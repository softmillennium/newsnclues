The Trump administration is quietly waging an all-out regulatory war on a Biden-era corporate tax that aimed to prevent large companies from dodging their tax liabilities while reporting huge profits. But since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued guidance and regulatory proposals designed to gut the CAMT. The effort is a boon to corporate giants and rich private equity investors at a time when the Trump administration is relentlessly attacking programs for low-income Americans, including Medicaid and nutrition assistance. Why would corporations spend millions on Trump's ballroom or bitcoin?Because they're getting billions in unlegislated tax breaks.We've gone from a system where the rich must pay taxes for public services, to one where they must pay the president for private favors. “Most troubling, Notice 2025-27, issued this June, allows companies to avoid CAMT if their income — under a simplified accounting method — is below $800 million,” the lawmakers wrote. “The Biden administration previously set the safe harbor threshold precisely at $500 million in its proposed CAMT rule after calculating that a higher safe harbor threshold would risk exempting corporations that should be subject to CAMT under statute.” “Now, less than nine months later and with zero justification, this new guidance summarily asserts that an $800 million safe harbor will not run that risk,” they continued. “We are seriously concerned that this cursory loosening of CAMT enforcement will simply allow more wealthy corporations to avoid paying their legally owed share.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world. Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump's second term. “The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people's phones, extract data, and surveil people's daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release. “Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment. ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract. Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.” Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups. Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations. “In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.” Prism is an independent and nonprofit newsroom led by journalists of color.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok video shows woman speaking into camera and reacting to a loud thud before she says ‘I just hit somebody' Authorities are investigating a newly surfaced video that suggests a woman who hit and killed a man while driving in the Chicago suburb of Zion, Illinois, on Monday night was livestreaming on TikTok at the time of the crash. Studies through the years have attributed cellphone use while driving to an increase in the potential for serious crashes – or worse. A screen recording of a TikTok live video streamed on Monday was then published on the social media app on Friday morning, and it showed user “Tea_Tyme_3” speaking at her phone before a loud thud. The live stream was quickly disconnected after the thud prompted her to curse, a child to ask what happened and someone else to ask the driver if she was OK. The user, it has been reported, has since changed her name and made her account private, deleting the biography section in which she had previously described being in Zion, Illinois. A thread on the Reddit platform separately was started by a user who described seeing the video when it was livestreamed and wondering whether something deadly had happened. “I just keep replaying that sound in my head.” Darren Lucas, 59, of nearby Beach Park, was unresponsive after being hit, and he was later pronounced dead at a hospital emergency room from blunt force injuries inflicted on him by the crash, the local coroner's office said in a statement. Lucas's son-in-law, Chris King, told the Lake and McHenry County Scanner that news of the video made his family “hold our loss tighter to our hearts”. “We … will continue to pray for what the driver must be going through,” King reportedly said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All thermal power plants (TPP) operated by Ukraine's state-owned energy company Centrenergo are down following "the largest Russian attack" which targeted all of them, the company announced on Nov. 8. According to the company, the same thermal power plants that had been restored after attacks in 2024 were struck again, with multiple Russian drones targeting them "each minute" overnight on Nov. 8. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said. Last spring, Centrenergo announced that the Zmiivska thermal power plant had beed completely destroyed. On July 25, 2022, Russian troops occupied the Vuhlehirska thermal power plant. "For safety reasons, we remained silent, but we did everything possible to ensure that Ukrainians got through the last winter with electricity and heat, overcoming hellish challenges to successfully start the current heating season," Centrenergo said. "Less than a month has passed since the previous strike, and last night the enemy again hit all of our power generation facilities simultaneously." Throughout the fall, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as it attempts to plunge the country into yet another harsh winter. During the Nov. 8 attack Russia primarily targeted the cities of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv, causing emergency power cuts in several regions. Based in Kyiv, she focuses on domestic affairs, parliament, and social issues. The Kizlyar Electromechanical Plant produces equipment for Russian Sukhoi and MiG aircraft and has been sanctioned for its role in the war against Ukraine. Russia launched yet another wide-ranging attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on Nov. 8, using a combination of drone and missiles to strike targets across the country. As winter approaches and Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy system intensify, a small unit from the 3rd Army Corps spends sleepless nights hunting long-range Shahed drones on the front line in Kharkiv Oblast — before they reach Ukrainian cities. Russia carried out a drone attack on the city of Dnipro overnight on Nov. 8, killing at least three people and injuring 12 others, including two children, officials reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said. "We have received a full sanctions exemption for the Turk Stream and Druzhba pipelines," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said. Reuters reported that the exemption was granted for one year. "He was the head of a large system, and this system was supposed to ensure the security of our energy sector.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As tens of thousands of military personnel work without pay and others are furloughed, a local pantry sees its numbers increasing as restaurants are losing customers When Jane Doorley and her husband Bill arrived at the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry they help run on 28 October, they couldn't get into the parking lot, such was the number of cars belonging to people seeking food. Last Friday was really bad too,” says Jane. “Around 250 families, including 300 children, come to the pantry every day it's open.” The pantry is situated a half mile from Wright-Patterson air force base – the largest single-site employer in Ohio with 38,000 workers – outside Dayton, Ohio, which has been rocked by the federal government shutdown. With tens of thousands of military personnel working without pay, and local contractors and civilian workers furloughed, the wider regional economy is in trouble. About 8,100 civilian workers at the Air Force Material Command, headquartered at the Wright-Patterson air force base, have received furlough notices, according to local media. The effects of this are being starkly seen at food resource centers. “In September, we were probably averaging 250 families a week. This week, I anticipate we'll probably help 500 families,” says Doorley. For decades, the military has been regarded as a stable source of employment, even through recessions and other economic crises. Dotted along streets outside the facility, which spans 8,000 acres, are dozens of military-adjacent and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, GE Aviation and Northrop Grumman, which have provided decades of stable employment, largely through contracts from the federal government that are paid for by taxpayers. It used to be really busy but now it's empty,” says Tik Taew, who works at Tik's Thai Express, a restaurant located a short distance from the base that's been in business for more than 15 years. “Weekday mornings are usually our busiest time, but right now, it's really quiet; we're only getting five to six [customers].” Around half are thought to have been currently furloughed. Reports from the Trump administration made public on 4 November suggested many of those furloughed may not be legible for back-pay, or that it could be used as a negotiating tactic with Democratic party leaders working to end the shutdown. Democrats have refused to sign a funding deal to end the shutdown unless subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which provides medical care at a reduced cost for millions of Americans, is renewed into 2026, a measure the White House opposes. While a last-minute measure late last month saw the Trump administration pull together $5.3bn to ensure military service members were paid on 1 November, avoiding an historic first, experts say service members are unlikely to be paid at the next payroll date if a deal isn't reached. “[B]y November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Face the Nation on 26 October. And yet, a plurality of voters in Ohio, Greene county, where the base is situated, members of the air force and military veterans as a whole, broadly vote for Republican political candidates. “While base civilians, who are still unpaid during the shutdown, might be living above poverty levels while receiving a paycheck, they may not have the funds needed easily available via savings or a credit card in the case of an emergency like now,” says Lee Lauren Truesdale of the Dayton Foodbank. “While going unpaid, these civilian employees still must pay day to day expenses such as rent, daycare (to hold spots in anticipation of returning to work), buy food, pay medical bills, car bills [and] utilities.” Thousands of pantries across the country, including the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, used to receive financial support worth a total of $117m through the federal government's Emergency Food and Shelter Program, but that was taken away in January. “That's on a pause, probably forever,” says Doorley. At the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, which has initiated dedicated days for military families, Doorley says meat is the number one sought after commodity. That is not sustainable for us,” she says, adding that it's time for politicians in Washington DC to find a solution. “It's time for the two sides to recognize that we are all Americans and we have people who are hungry and need help. [They need to] get together and somehow find a middle ground to move things forward and help those in our community.” The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated to include an additional statement from law enforcement. The commander of a Ukrainian unmanned systems battalion was charged with negligence after holding an award ceremony for soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast earlier this month, despite a ban. According to the investigators, the officer organized on Nov. 1 a formal assembly and award ceremony for over 100 servicemen in front-line areas of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, including locations where civilians were present. At that time, Russia reportedly struck the assembly points with three Geran drones and two Iskander missiles. If found guilty, he could face up to eight years in prison. Similar incidents have happened before, where Russia killed elite Ukrainian soldiers during award ceremonies in front-line areas. This Soviet-era practice has been criticized by both President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian military. Following a series of Russian attacks on training grounds and military centers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced in July that gathering troops and equipment or stationing soldiers in tent camps is banned. Based in Kyiv, she focuses on domestic affairs, parliament, and social issues. A local power plant was reportedly damaged, causing widespread blackouts in the city of Belgorod and the surrounding region. The Kizlyar Electromechanical Plant produces equipment for Russian Sukhoi and MiG aircraft and has been sanctioned for its role in the war against Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shadow Fleet tanker MT Virgo returns after delivering a cargo of Iranian oil on Aug. 24, 2025. British expat Remy Osman has a front-row seat from which to watch the growing “shadow fleet” of vessels off Singapore filled with Russian, Iranian or Venezuelan oil in the process of evading Western sanctions. Explainer: How a shadow fleet of tankers keeps Russian oil money flowing despite Western sanctions One day, he documents the Russian oil tanker Krasnoyarsk passing by. It's under sanctions from the United States, Canada and other countries for helping transport petroleum for Moscow, which is waging a war against Ukraine. Another day it's the Virgo, a tanker that's part of Iran's shadow fleet and also under U.S. sanctions. Mr. Osman is helping put video and photo evidence to a phenomenon that shipping analysts have been documenting for some time. The busy shipping lanes in the South China Sea offshore of Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia are a growing site for ship-to-ship transfers of oil from countries under Western sanctions, offering logistical advantages for shadow fleet vessels. Growth of shadow tanker fleet slows as tightened Western sanctions target Russian oil “It tends to be sanctioned oil from Iran, Russia and Venezuela. But the tremendous number of commercial vessels using these waterways means it's easier for tankers with illicit oil to blend in among all the traffic. Traders also disperse oil among multiple vessels to reduce the risk of interdiction or seizure by authorities. He looks for telltale signs of shadow fleet vessels before taking photos. The third criteria is whether it's an older vessel – 15 to 25 years old. He then runs the ship registration information against Western lists of vessels under sanctions. In an August brief, shipping intelligence provider Windward described the waters near the Riau archipelago off Singapore and eastern Malaysia as the “epicentre of maritime lawlessness on Asia's doorstep.” It said that for the past five years the area has been used by dark fleet – another term for shadow fleet – tankers as both a hub for floating storage and for ship-to-ship transfers of oil on sanctions lists. Windward's brief said the area is convenient because it serves as a midway point between Iran, Russia or Venezuela and “China, the biggest buyer of crude, with nearby maritime services from Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia within a day's sailing.” In 2025, it said, some 30 ships per month have shifted from mainstream shipping to the Russian or Iranian market, adding that the fleet now represents 18.2 per cent of global oil tanker tonnage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine is facing widespread power outages after Russia launched a massive overnight aerial assault across the country, killing at least two people, Ukrainian authorities say. Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky, with the latest assault coming as many were asleep. Emergency power cuts had been introduced in a number of regions, she added, and would be cancelled when the power system stabilizes. Residents of Kyiv face extensive power cuts through the weekend, according to schedules published by energy companies. Two people were killed and 11 injured by a drone attack that struck a nine-story apartment building in the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine. “There's nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia. “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added. Altogether, ten people have been killed by Russian strikes in the last 24 hours, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service, and nearly 50 injured. Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs [drones] have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv. “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.” The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriots, an air defense system that has proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles. Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month. “Despite the enemy's plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk. On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine. A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia and China agree to deepen cooperation in trade and energy; Washington struggles for influence over Kiev and its allies as it tries to steer conflict with Russia to an end; and the United States proposes creating an international security force in Gaza to facilitate demilitarization. In Beijing, Mishustin was also received by Chinese President Xi Jinping. During their meeting, the sides agreed to create conditions to attract investment, provide each other with firm mutual support, and deepen cooperation in high-tech sectors. "Such meetings make it possible to touch base, synchronize positions and discuss the most pressing issues, serving as an additional communication channel between national leaders," Junior Research Fellow at the Sector of Economy and Politics of China of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Andrey Fedotov told Izvestia. Notably, the Russian prime minister's visit took place after negotiations between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. In 2024, China imported approximately 213 mln metric tons of oil and 246 bln cubic meters of natural gas from Russia - 1.8% and 6.2% higher, respectively, than the previous year. During Vladimir Putin's visit to China on September 2, 2025, Russia's Gazprom and China's CNPC signed a legally binding memorandum on the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline through Mongolia. At existing fields alone, Gazprom can produce around 100 bln cubic meters, and additional volumes have become available due to reduced supplies to the EU. On the day when the European "coalition of the willing" convened in Madrid, where discussion was expected to include a 12-point peace plan prepared jointly with Ukraine, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker arrived in Kiev. During his meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, he posited that the only viable scenario for resolving the military conflict with Russia would be one led by US President Donald Trump. Zelensky himself stated the day before that he had not seen a finalized plan from Europe, even though he and European leaders had just recently outlined its key points. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue that Washington may be seeking to ease escalation after Russia's recent strategic weapons tests, but acknowledge that it lacks leverage over both Kiev and its European allies. According to the newspaper, since his inauguration on January 20, Donald Trump has periodically signaled a willingness to take into account the considerations of Russian negotiators regarding the outlines of a peace deal. Russia's position is and always has been that an immediate ceasefire would merely allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to regroup and maneuver, creating the risk of renewed hostilities. However, the US president has subsequently once again declared an immediate ceasefire to be a necessary move. At the same time, on October 22, the US Treasury announced new sanctions against two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Meanwhile, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker stated in an interview in recent days that he had discussed additional options for exerting pressure on Russia during a meeting with CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Commenting on these divergent statements for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts of the Peoples' Friendship University, suggested that Russian President Putin's recent announcement about successful tests of the unlimited-range Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater vehicle likely had an impact on Washington's thinking. Given their characteristics, both developments could pose a direct threat to the United States. Yet, any step toward Moscow would be depicted in Western media as a concession and a sign of personal weakness on Trump's part - an outcome that doesn't mesh with his political agenda. In addition, Semibratov continued, the current US administration may lack sufficient leverage to influence either Western globalist circles as a whole, including the United Kingdom, or Zelensky himself. However, attempts to advance new initiatives that disregard Russia's security conditions will only further accelerate escalation. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that while Washington seeks a multinational force to disarm Hamas, Israel currently has no incentive to accept such a plan, and disarmament remains impossible without progress toward Palestinian statehood, which remains unlikely. It remains unclear which nations will contribute troops to the ISF, Vedomosti writes. Potential participants may include military personnel from Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Turkey under the overall command of Egypt, The Guardian reported. The Israeli news portal Ynet suggested that military personnel from Indonesia, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan may be involved. "Trump is counting on Ankara's assistance to implement his strategy. But Israel has already secured the release of hostages and therefore has no incentive to comply with the American plan. Otherwise, it risks a political crisis for Netanyahu's cabinet. For their part, the Americans have no incentive to pressure their Israeli allies so long as the region remains relatively stable," he said. According to Hasanov, Hamas is interested in the deployment of peacekeepers only insofar as it hampers Israeli occupation of territory. Arab countries are seeking to play a more integral role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Head of the Mission of the League of Arab States (LAS) in Russia Valid Hamid Shiltag told Izvestia. He noted that Arab nations view their interaction with the SCO positively and are already participating in its meetings. Closer engagement would strengthen the organization's potential as one of the key centers of global development and would provide Russia with new avenues for growth. Arab states could play a more visible role in the SCO, Shiltag said. According to him, expanding cooperation with the organization creates new opportunities for the region in international diplomacy and economic development. Some countries are already participating in meetings, and there are states that would also like to become part of these associations," the diplomat emphasized. "Many countries express a desire to take part in order to expand their economic ties, and in this sphere, there are no rigid boundaries between countries. Arab states believe they will fit naturally into the organization's economic mechanisms and complement its existing cooperation formats. Today, the SCO covers about 60% of Eurasian territory, and more than 3.4 bln people live in its member nations - nearly half of the world's population. This scale makes the organization quite attractive for Middle East countries, Izvestia writes. Strengthening ties between the SCO and the Arab world goes beyond symbolic gestures and is developing into a strategic path reflecting a broader trend toward a multipolar world order, Saudi political analyst Mubarak Al-Aati told the newspaper. "An organization that includes a quarter of the global economy and more than half of the world's population provides Middle Eastern states with opportunities to enhance national security, expand economic ties, and make room for foreign-policy maneuver. The new US sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil did not have a substantial impact on the volume of Russian oil exports in October. Month-on-month, seaborne shipments declined by 1.2%, but longer delivery chains and widening discounts were observed. The sanctions could potentially have a greater impact after November 21, when the waivers for transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil expire, Kommersant writes. Seaborne exports of Russian oil in October decreased month-on-month by 1.2% to 470,000 metric tons per day, according to a review by the Center for Price Indices. The share of destinations listed as "unknown" amounted to 5%. Maritime shipments of Russian oil to China declined by 7.5% in October, to 159,000 metric tons per day, with ESPO making up about 98% of volumes and Urals comprising the remainder, the Center for Price Indices noted. Analysts do not view this decline in deliveries as critical, pointing out that in September there were two weeks of record shipments to China - 171,000 metric tons per day. However, according to market participants cited by the Center for Price Indices, Turkish buyers have already begun searching for alternative suppliers due to the expanded list of Russian oil companies subject to US restrictions after Rosneft and Lukoil were added to the SDN List. Kirill Bakhtin, Head of the Russian Equities Center at BCS World of Investments, told Kommersant that companies had sufficient time to prepare and develop alternative supply schemes. He said that purchases of Russian oil continue, but increasingly through intermediaries. The Center for Price Indices expects average Brent crude prices to decline from $69 per barrel in 2025 to $64 per barrel the following year, due to rising production by OPEC+ countries outpacing the growth in global demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian forces appear to be on the brink of finally seizing the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, a symbolic victory that President Vladimir Putin has been pursuing for 21 months at an increasingly heavy cost. While Kyiv denied Russian claims that Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk have already been surrounded, saying on Wednesday that active operations stopping the Russian advance were still ongoing, Ukrainian soldiers on the ground have described an increasingly grim reality. “The situation is difficult, with all types of fighting going on, firefights in urban areas, and shelling with all types of weapons,” one battalion commander told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity for security reasons. Another soldier, who also asked for his name to be withheld for safety reasons, told CNN the Russian military continues to press forward with large numbers of men. “The intensity of their movements is so great that (Ukrainian) drone operators simply cannot keep up with the pace. The claim that Russia is willing to sacrifice two soldiers in order to get one through might seem perplexing – but it tallies up with observations made by international researchers who have noted a very high number of Russian casualties around Pokrovsk, even though taking over the city won't make much difference on the ground. Instead, it has now morphed into a symbolic battle. “From (a) battlefield perspective, it doesn't make sense,” said George Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank. Pokrovsk was long seen as a key city for the Ukrainians, because of its road and rail connections. “It was operationally significant because it was a supply line that supported the Ukrainian logistics, which then fanned out and supported the other Ukrainian tactical positions in smaller villages and in the field around Pokrovsk,” he said. However, that changed once Russia began encircling Pokrovsk over the summer. Frequent drone and artillery attacks on the key highway and rail line have forced Kyiv to find alternative supply routes, shifting the hub function away from Pokrovsk – a major success for the Russians. The city also hosted Ukraine's last operating coking coal mine, but it was forced to shut down early this year. “From this point further, it doesn't actually operationally do anything for the Russians, because they already achieved the main effect that they needed to a while ago,” Barros told CNN. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that Russia had amassed some 170,000 troops in the region to bolster the Pokrovsk offensive. And in a war that has largely stalled, symbols like this matter. Pokrovsk would be the largest city Russia has seized since Bakhmut in May 2023. While some 60,000 lived in Pokrovsk before the war, the majority have left since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to Ukrainian authorities, some 1,200 civilians remain in the city. Some of those left have missed the window of opportunity to flee – Ukrainian authorities have said evacuations are currently impossible – but others might be waiting for the Russian troops to arrive. The Russian Ministry of Defense has already shared a video it said showed evacuations of Pokrovsk residents to the Russian side. “Strategically, from the political and informational perspective, Pokrovsk is very important, because Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way numerous times to make public national and international statements about the seizure,” Barros said. “He is conducting a strategic information campaign which seeks to present Russia's military victory on the battlefield as inevitable,” he added. Putin has made it clear his goal is to take over of the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. He said his battalion doesn't have the number of soldiers it should have and is running low on armored vehicles. “There has been no order to withdraw although everyone already understands that the fall of Pokrovsk is inevitable. He said withdrawal will become much more dangerous the longer the Ukrainians hesitate, repeating previous painful experiences for Kyiv's forces. The battles of Bakhmut in 2023 and Avdiivka in 2024 were both marked by delayed withdrawals, which led to high casualty rates among Ukrainian personnel.</p>

LONDON, November 8. /TASS/. The European Union plans to create a specialized center "for democratic resilience" in order to "counter disinformation" allegedly coming from Russia, China, and other countries, the Guardian said, citing a leaked EU document.

The newspaper specified that the document, initiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is slated to be published on November 12.

According to the Guardian, the "European Commission intends for the center to bring together expertise across the EU and from countries seeking to join the bloc to fight foreign information manipulation and interference."

The newspaper insists that the European Commission sees the biggest threat in purported Russia's "hybrid attacks, waging a battle of influence against Europe," naming China as another source of a "disinformation threat."

"The center would be a hub for EU institutions and member states to share information and early warnings, as well as raising public awareness about foreign governments seeking to manipulate information," the Guardian noted.</p>
