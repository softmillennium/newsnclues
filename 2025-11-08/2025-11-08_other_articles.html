What began as an already unforgettable moment at this year's Wacken Open Air turned legendary when Michael Schenker stunned tens of thousands of fans with a major announcement. Following a blistering My Years With UFO set on Thursday night, the hard rock icon revealed that his new Michael Schenker Group studio album, ‘Don't Sell Your Soul,' is out now via earMUSIC. To top it off, Schenker and his band premiered the album's title track live for the first time, closing their set with a powerful encore that electrified the festival grounds.

Earlier in the night, the Wacken faithful were treated to another surprise as Slash joined Schenker onstage for a searing rendition of the UFO classic “Mother Mary.” Two generations of guitar gods sharing the same stage — it was the kind of moment destined to live forever in metal lore.

‘Don't Sell Your Soul' marks the latest studio album from the Michael Schenker Group and the second part of a trilogy that began with 2024's My Years With UFO. Produced by Schenker and Michael Voss, the album features longtime collaborators Bodo Schopf (drums), Barend Courbois (bass), and Steve Mann (guitar, keys), with Erik Gronwall on lead vocals and guest appearances by Robin McAuley, Dimitri “Lia” Liapakis, and Voss. Available now on CD, LP, and limited transparent red vinyl, the record is a fiery testament to Schenker's unrelenting creative spirit and guitar mastery.

METHUEN — City Council chair Ron Marsan agreed this week to go on a scavenger hunt of sorts at the historic Searles Estate along with other city officials. The goal is to track down the dozens of artifacts at the estate and clear up a rumor referenced publicly by Councilor Neily Soto that items may have been taken from the premises after the city bought it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new analysis of surface temperature readings from NASA's Cassini Mission has determined that Saturn's moon Enceladus is losing heat from both poles. “This stability means Enceladus' ocean could have existed for a long-term, potentially giving life a chance to have evolved,” explained the study's lead author, Dr Georgina Miles from SwRI and Visiting Scientist at the Department of Physics, University of Oxford, and study co-author, Oxford Prof. Carly Howett, also from the PRI, in an email to The Debrief. The research team behind the new analysis also described Enceladus as “a top contender for extra-terrestrial life,” because it has heat, liquid water, and the right chemicals, such as complex hydrocarbons and phosphorus, needed for life on Earth. Although researchers have suspected for some time that Enceladus' ocean might support life, its long-term stability, which is required for life to evolve, has remained in question. This stability can only exist if its energy losses and gains remain in balance. Conversely, if this gravity-induced tidal activity generates too much heat, the ocean's activity would increase, which the researchers note would also dramatically alter its environment. “We used north polar late winter observations (when the north pole was in winter darkness) and summer observations permanent daylight) for this study,” Dr. However, they note, this “wouldn't be the case” for observations collected in summer. “Observations from both seasons were required to rule that out,” they explained, adding that warmer regions were “easier to spot” when the moon's surface is at its coldest. According to a statement detailing the research, the team used this data to create expected surface temperature models during the polar night and compare them against infrared observations captured by Cassini's Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS). These models revealed that the surface of the North Pole, which had previously been considered inactive, was approximately seven times warmer than previous models had predicted. In short, the heat generated and lost are a close match. The team said this finding indicates it might be possible for the sub-surface ocean to be maintained in liquid form “so long as its orbit around Saturn remains stable.” “With current theories about ‘tidal locking,' this is entirely possible,” they added. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief that the age of all of Saturn's moons is “highly uncertain,” and noted that Enceladus “is particularly difficult to age” because it has been continually resurfaced by alternating heating and cooling episodes throughout its icy shell. “The fate of the moon is tied to the evolution of Saturn and its interior structure,” they said, adding that “Enceladus could be up to 1 billion years old, or as young as 150 million years, with current best estimates of 200-450 million years old.” For comparison, the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. These readings could be used to “provide limits” on how long they've been at the rock-ocean interface, they explained, while also noting that “a lot of laboratory work is needed to verify this too.” “Our estimates of the energy balance will be significantly improved by future missions to Enceladus,” Dr. However, they said several more missions “are in the proposal stage.” The study “Endogenic heat at Enceladus' north pole” was published in Science Advances.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comic Book Questions Answered is a feature where I answer whatever questions you folks might have about comic books (feel free to e-mail questions to me at brianc@cbr.com). Today, I will try to figure out where the new Supernatural comic book series is set. A Scout Master was teaching his boy scouts about survival in the desert. Several hands went up, and many important things were suggested such as food, matches, etc. Then one little boy in the back eagerly raised his hand. "Well, Sir, as soon as you start playing Solitaire, someone is bound to come up behind you and say, "Put that red nine on top of that black ten!" Get ready to hit the road again with Dean and Sam as they prowl the highways and byways of small-town America in search of demonic wrongdoing to put right! Set between the foundational first and second seasons of the landmark television series, this brand-new title from acclaimed author GREG PAK (Darth Vader, Lilo & Stitch) and preternaturally gifted artist EDER MESSIAS (Sam Wilson: Captain America) brings readers back to where the dark magic first began - and reveals a disturbing new threat that the bickering brothers will have to face before they can return to hunting down the demon who killed their mother. As COUNTLESS people pointed out, the comic book COULDN'T be set between the first and second seasons. Okay, so when IS the comic book set? The final episode of Season 1 ends on a cliffhanger. However, after they save him, it is revealed that the demon Azazel has possessed John. John tells Sam to kill Azazel (and thus, in the process, kill him, as well), but Sam can't bring himself to do it, and instead shoots his possessed father in the leg, which forces Azazel to leave John's body. The brothers then drive their wounded father to the hospital, but their iconic Impala is then blindsided by a semi-truck being driven by a demonically possessed truck driver. John ultimately sacrifices himself to save Dean's life (John and Sam had gotten through the accident with minor injuries, but Dean was stuck in a coma). So clearly, the stories in this series CAN'T take place between Seasons 1 and 2. The key scene in the first issue (by writer Greg Pak, artist Eder Messias, colorist Thyago Brandao, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry) is when Sam and Dean talk about not knowing where their dad is. Clearly, since Sam and Dean ARE hunting together, the stories have to take place IN the first season (as opposed to being a prequel), so it is just a matter of figuring out which episode it would have to be for them not to know where their father was. Okay, so it can't be set in the Season 1 finale, "Devil's Trap," and it can't be in the episode BEFORE that, "Salvation," since that one leads directly into the finale. John is a major character in the 20th episode, "Dead Man's Blood," so it can't be set after that one. John sends his sons a message in Episode 18, "Something Wicked," and could at least ARGUE that him getting a message to them doesn't preclude them from not knowing where he is, but I think it is likely safer to just go before that episode. The 17th episode doesn't have any John in it, but Episode 16 DOES, so we have to rule that one out, as well. Not only does it fit the timeline where they don't know where their father is (but AFTER their father let them know that their mother was killed by a demon in Episode 11's "Scarecrow"), but it is also set in Minnesota, while the comic book is set in Wisconsin, so that seems to line up pretty well, as well. So there ya go, folks, I'm going with the comic book series being set between Episodes 15 and 16 in Season 1 (but anywhere after Episode 11 and before Episode 16 is at least a POSSIBILE answer). If anyone else has a comic book question they'd like to see answered, drop me a line at brianc@cbr.com! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alien buffs are scratching their heads after footage emerged of what seems to be a UFO hovering over an active volcano. This strange event was recorded by surveillance cameras at the Popocatepetl volcano in the states of Puebla and Morelos in Mexico on Thursday, October 30, reports the Daily Star. As of now, officials have not commented on the origin of the mysterious airborne object. The National Center for Disaster Prevention reported 19 low-intensity eruptions accompanied by vapor, gases, and small amounts of ash on the day in question. Last year, UFO expert Jaime Maussan, 72, suggested that Popocatepetl is functioning as an "inter-dimensional portal," a gateway in space-time that allows intergalactic travelers to enter one place from another. He pointed out that no man-made object could enter the crater as temperatures reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius, as reported by What's the Jam. US mountain that has 'alien base hidden inside' as it becomes UFO hotspotSailor linked to Area 51 shares chilling details of four UFOs rising from waterAlien hunters claim they have 'solved' Roswell mystery in 'crash site footage' Maussan elaborated: "The University of Bergen in Norway discovered that under the volcano there are magnetic storms necessary to be able to generate X-points " or regions of electron diffusion " and be used to create a Dimensional Portal." X-points are unique locations where Earth's magnetic field connects with the Sun's, creating a direct path from our planet to the Sun's atmosphere, a staggering 93 million miles away.

Along with his wife Gulnaar (Bhasha Sumbli) and their children Noorie (Arista Mehta) and Ayaan (Rohaan Singh), he moves into an old, abandoned house—unaware that it holds memories of bloodshed and spirits that have yet to find peace.As the investigation deepens, Baramulla reveals that the real mystery lies not only in the streets but within the walls of the house—and in the conscience of those who try to bury the past.Let's break down all the major plotlines in Netflix's film Baramulla, premiering on Nov. 7. The house that Ridwaan and his family move into once belonged, decades earlier, to a Kashmiri Pandit family, the Saprus: Kamalanand, his wife Mansi, and their children Eela and Sharad. The Pandits, a Hindu minority who lived for centuries in the predominantly Muslim region of Kashmir, were targets of persecution and a broader campaign of mass displacement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when militant separatist groups began demanding both the region's independence and its conversion into an Islamic state.During that period, thousands of Pandit families were forced to flee their homes in the valley, while others were killed by extremists. Only Sharad, who was away during the attack, survived, but even he disappeared shortly afterward.The tragedy turned the house into a place of eternal mourning. The film shows how these spirits manifest through white flowers that appear before each child's disappearance in the present day. At first, Ridwaan believes that local extremists have abducted the missing children to recruit them as soldiers. But as the investigation unfolds, he discovers that the truth is far more complicated.The first case involves Shoaib Ansari, the son of an influential former politician, Ismail Ansari. Shoaib vanishes during a magic show, moments after stepping inside the magician's box on stage. Soon after, another boy, Faizal, disappears while fishing at a lake. The tension escalates when Ridwaan's own daughter, Noorie, mysteriously vanishes at home—and before his eyes, another boy, Yassir, is swallowed by a tree that morphs into a dark portal.These children are being targeted by extremists Khalid and Juneid—the latter being Yassir's uncle—who plan to recruit and indoctrinate them into their militant movement, manipulating vulnerable youth with promises of faith and belonging under the orders of a mysterious leader known as Bhaijaan. In the final act, Baramulla ties all its threads together. Juneid and his men storm Ridwaan's house in retaliation, believing the police officer is hiding the missing children. In that moment, Gulnaar, now possessed by the spirit of Mansi, shoots Zainab from the second floor, while Ridwaan kills Juneid. Only after the gunfire subsides does the truth come out: Ridwaan uses Juneid's phone to call Bhaijaan, but it's Zainab's phone that starts ringing. She herself is Bhaijaan, the extremist leader who used her position as a teacher to identify and recruit vulnerable children.After Juneid and Zainab's deaths, the children who had mysteriously vanished begin to reappear in the very same places where they were last seen—unharmed, as if awakening from a long dream. Six months later, in Mumbai, the film shows Ayaan handing a small box of seashells to an older man—the same keepsake that once belonged to young Eela Sapru. The ending closes on a note of spiritual reconciliation: the Sapru spirits finally seem at peace after decades of unrest. Baramulla ultimately transcends its supernatural thriller form to become a parable about guilt, faith, and collective memory. By merging horror and political trauma, the film transforms its ghosts into metaphors for Kashmir itself—a land where the past is never buried, only silenced, and where true liberation depends on acknowledging the pain of all sides.
