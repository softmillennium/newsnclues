            Russian forces appear to be on the brink of finally seizing the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, a symbolic victory that President Vladimir Putin has been pursuing for 21 months at an increasingly heavy cost.
    


            Fighting inside the city has intensified in the past few days, after Russian troops successfully infiltrated it. The fall of Pokrovsk – the strategic value of which has already been greatly diminished but would nevertheless represent the biggest win for Moscow since 2023 – now seems almost inevitable, according to those on the ground.
    


            While Kyiv denied Russian claims that Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk have already been surrounded, saying on Wednesday that active operations stopping the Russian advance were still ongoing, Ukrainian soldiers on the ground have described an increasingly grim reality.
    


            “The situation is difficult, with all types of fighting going on, firefights in urban areas, and shelling with all types of weapons,” one battalion commander told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.
    


            “We are almost surrounded, but we are used to it,” he said. Another soldier, who also asked for his name to be withheld for safety reasons, told CNN the Russian military continues to press forward with large numbers of men.
    


            “The intensity of their movements is so great that (Ukrainian) drone operators simply cannot keep up with the pace. The Russians often move in groups of three, counting on the fact that two will be destroyed, but one will still reach the city and gain a foothold there. About a hundred such groups can pass through in a day,” a soldier from the Ukrainian Peaky Blinders drone unit told CNN.
    


            The claim that Russia is willing to sacrifice two soldiers in order to get one through might seem perplexing – but it tallies up with observations made by international researchers who have noted a very high number of Russian casualties around Pokrovsk, even though taking over the city won't make much difference on the ground.
    


            That's because the battle for Pokrovsk is no longer a fight for a strategically important logistics hub. Instead, it has now morphed into a symbolic battle.
    


            “From (a) battlefield perspective, it doesn't make sense,” said George Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank.
    


            Pokrovsk was long seen as a key city for the Ukrainians, because of its road and rail connections. It sits on a junction of several major roads, leading to Donetsk and Kostyantynivka in the east and Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia to the west.
    


            “It was operationally significant because it was a supply line that supported the Ukrainian logistics, which then fanned out and supported the other Ukrainian tactical positions in smaller villages and in the field around Pokrovsk,” he said.
    


            However, that changed once Russia began encircling Pokrovsk over the summer.
    


            Frequent drone and artillery attacks on the key highway and rail line have forced Kyiv to find alternative supply routes, shifting the hub function away from Pokrovsk – a major success for the Russians. The city also hosted Ukraine's last operating coking coal mine, but it was forced to shut down early this year.
    


            “From this point further, it doesn't actually operationally do anything for the Russians, because they already achieved the main effect that they needed to a while ago,” Barros told CNN.
    


            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that Russia had amassed some 170,000 troops in the region to bolster the Pokrovsk offensive.
    


            It is clear that, while Pokrovsk has been mostly ruined and its strategic value has all but disappeared, it has become a symbol. And in a war that has largely stalled, symbols like this matter.
    


            Pokrovsk would be the largest city Russia has seized since Bakhmut in May 2023. While some 60,000 lived in Pokrovsk before the war, the majority have left since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to Ukrainian authorities, some 1,200 civilians remain in the city.
    


            Some of those left have missed the window of opportunity to flee – Ukrainian authorities have said evacuations are currently impossible – but others might be waiting for the Russian troops to arrive. The Russian Ministry of Defense has already shared a video it said showed evacuations of Pokrovsk residents to the Russian side.
    


            “Strategically, from the political and informational perspective, Pokrovsk is very important, because Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way numerous times to make public national and international statements about the seizure,” Barros said.
    


            “He is conducting a strategic information campaign which seeks to present Russia's military victory on the battlefield as inevitable,” he added.
    


            Putin has made it clear his goal is to take over of the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.
    


            Taking over Pokrovsk would allow Russia to shift its focus elsewhere – namely towards the string of industrial cities to its northeast that form the backbone of Ukrainian defenses in the region.
    


            One soldier from Ukraine's 129th Brigade who is currently deployed near Kostyantynivka told CNN the expectation on the ground is that “as soon as the Russians deal with Pokrovsk and (the neighboring town of) Myrnohrad, the pressure on Kostyantynivka will increase and they will move towards Druzhkivka.”
    


            He said his battalion doesn't have the number of soldiers it should have and is running low on armored vehicles.
    


            The soldier said that the main concern of troops in the area is that the Ukrainian leadership will try to hold onto what remains of Pokrovsk for as long as possible because abandoning the city would be seen as a major failure.
    


            “There has been no order to withdraw although everyone already understands that the fall of Pokrovsk is inevitable. Pokrovsk was held for a very long time, a very long time. But the forces were exhausted, and reinforcements were not sent in time,” he said.
    


            He said withdrawal will become much more dangerous the longer the Ukrainians hesitate, repeating previous painful experiences for Kyiv's forces.  The battles of Bakhmut in 2023 and Avdiivka in 2024 were both marked by delayed withdrawals, which led to high casualty rates among Ukrainian personnel.
    


            “We will have to squeeze through the bottleneck, and you surely understand the high level of losses that such an exit from the encirclement will entail,” he said.

             Employing the casual hyperbole of his presidential idol, the “Chinese Trump” gave our interview a 67 out of 10.
    


            He said it calmly. Cheerfully. With absolute confidence. Like people do when they're standing in a megacity with fans seemingly on every street corner.
    


            Here in Chongqing, southwestern China, population 32 million, business manager Ryan Chen has mastered an impression so uncanny that strangers stop eating lunch to look up, mid-bite, when they hear his voice.
    


            As we moved through the crowded, fog-rimmed October streets, the same day as Trump's long-anticipated summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Chen's fame became apparent.
    


            Fans mobbed him like a Hollywood star. Another phone was thrust into his orbit. Another group photo. Another, “Can you do the voice?”
    


            And then comes his Trump schtick.
    

CNN's Mike Valerio travels to the Chinese metropolis of Chongqing where Ryan Chen, a 42-year-old business manager turned viral Trump impersonator, takes him on a tour of the city and talks about how he hopes to use his newfound internet stardom to bridge cultural divides.


            Chen pairs his pitch-perfect Trump impression with a Trump-style salesmanship of the best of China.
    


            Delectable hotpot in Chongqing? “The best, the finest.” Glittering skylines that make his hometown look like Hong Kong on steroids? “Totally incredible.”
    


            “Ask me how do I feel today? I'll tell you. I feel fantastic,” Chen declared, with that mix of bombast and deadpan that's both satire and sincerity.
    


            Chen mimics Trump's voice with eerie precision, but it's a talent that's only been in the public sphere since January – and all because Chen lost a bet.
    


            “I went into a truth and dare with my friend, and I lost,” he told me. “And (my friend) dared me to do Trump, and put it on my account, see how it goes.”
    


            The video went viral.
    


            For millions across China, especially those who watch the US from a fascinated digital distance, Chen became a one-man portal into the American presidency, without the clunky geopolitical baggage.
    


            Chen is now one of China's most popular English-language creators, with more than two million followers combined on Instagram and Douyin, China's version of TikTok.
    


            He understands the American media feed better than many who grew up inside it – a startling achievement for a man who's never been to the United States.
    


            And he uses his Trump impression to promote his hometown of Chongqing – and China – as a tourist destination. But on China's closely monitored social-media platforms, his videos walk a tightrope.
    


            “I try to keep everything non-political,” he said. “I'm promoting my culture, my food, showing basically what's real about China.”
    


            Which is how I found myself joining Chen for a day, experiencing a meticulously curated Trumpian sales pitch of Chongqing.
    


            We ate lunch inside a packed restaurant with red-checkered tablecloths and a dozen tables. Steam blasted out of the kitchen like the cooks were trying to season the air. Chen ordered all the courses.
    


            Tofu pudding with piping-hot dipping sauce. Pork with Sichuan seasoning. And the chef's signature: braised pork belly with fermented cabbage at the bottom.
    


            “This one's my regular go-to… When you put it in your mouth it just melts,” Chen said.
    


            “So incredible, only in Chongqing,” he added, hands moving like he's playing an invisible accordion.
    


            Then came the thousand-year egg. “It tastes like MSG,” Chen offered. And when diners nearby half-turned their heads to check if the foreigner liked it, Chen saw my expression of delight. In his Trump voice, he declared, “I love this guy! He likes everything! He likes every controversial food!”
    


            Outside, skyscrapers broke through the fog like theatrical scenery. More fans. More phones. And then, a visit to Chen's barber, Mr. Tom.
    


            This is the man who tends to Chen's all-important hair. “He's very professional, this guy,” roared the Trump voice.
    


            Chen sat. The shears hummed. He coached the cut like a director choreographing his own silhouette.
    


            “I'm gonna look 30 pounds lighter after this. We had a promise, right? A deal is a deal, right?”
    


            Cut. Dust. Brush. Reveal.
    


            “Tremendous,” Chen said, as he examined his reflection.
    


            Mr. Tom echoed, on command: “Tremendous!”
    


            Chen says he enjoys what he does because laughter bridges barriers, even between superpowers. His fans say the same thing – that he shows them a China that feels confident, funny, and cosmopolitan.
    


            And as someone who arrived in China only weeks ago, I found myself unexpectedly enlightened by a Trump impersonator in a part of the country that's not typically high on tourist itineraries.
    


            Chen's broad appeal with audiences in the US and China shows that language is no barrier when it comes to sharing a laugh.
    


            As for what's next? He's slowly winding down his day job in an architecture firm and would like to pursue acting full-time.
    


            There's also his dream – audacious, perhaps cinematic – of visiting America for the first time.
    


            More to the point, he'd like to dive into New York, the city that gave us Trump.
    


            “I'd like to experience, embrace the chaos a little bit to see how it really feels,” Chen said.
    


            Yes, Chen's voice is astonishing. Yes, the viral fame is ascendant.
    


            But by dusk in Chongqing, it hit me that the loudest thing Chen wants from his imitation is perhaps also the simplest: joy.

Europe's NATO member states should brace for a lasting rupture with Moscow, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has said, urging them to focus on supporting Kiev.

The Western nations have introduced multiple rounds of sanctions in an effort to economically isolate Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.

The measures have recently been followed by a wave of military buildup across Europe, with governments rearming in response to the alleged Russian threat.

“I firmly believe Sweden, Estonia, and the EU must prepare for a long-term isolation of Russia,” Kristersson said earlier this week after meeting with his Estonian counterpart Kristen Michal in Tallinn.

Earlier this year, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was “too large a part of the world to be isolated.” He has also warned that sanctions are a “double-edged sword,” arguing that every new package of restrictions creates negative consequences for the nations adopting them.

Kristersson also praised Estonia for raising its military budget to more than 5% of GDP, adding that Stockholm is “heading there too.” Earlier this year, the European NATO members agreed to increase armed forces spending to the same level in what officials described as a response to growing security challenges.

“We are not naive about Russia or its intentions,” he said, adding that Sweden is ready to support NATO's eastern forces, strengthening deterrence and deploying air and missile capabilities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has “no reason and no interest — geopolitical, economic, political or military — to fight NATO countries.”

Earlier, Peskov noted that Putin has warned for nearly two decades that the military bloc's eastward expansion undermines Russian national security.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Pakistan claims Afghanistan talks deadlocked","https://www.rt.com/news/627505-pakistan-claim-afghanistan-talks-collapse/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 14:08:00 GMT","

Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif has claimed peace talks with Afghanistan in Istanbul aimed at preventing new border clashes have collapsed.

In an interview with GEO News, Asif said that the ceasefire would only hold if there are no attacks from Afghan territory. Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, confirmed on Saturday that the negotiations had broken down.

Islamabad and Kabul began a third round of talks in Türkiye on Thursday in a bid to ease rising tensions after last month's deadly border clashes. The Istanbul meeting followed the earlier five-day talks in October in Doha that produced a ceasefire.

“There is a complete deadlock. The negotiations have entered an indefinite phase,” Khawaja Asif said, adding that there is “no program for the fourth round of talks.”

The minister thanked Türkiye and Qatar for their efforts to mediate tensions between the two neighboring countries.

“They support our stance. Even the Afghan delegation agreed with us; however, they were not ready to sign a written agreement,” he said, adding that Pakistan would only accept a written accord. “They wanted verbal assurances to be accepted, which is not possible in international negotiations,” he added.

Mujahid said negotiations had failed due to Islamabad insisting that Afghanistan assume responsibility for Pakistan's internal security, a demand he described as beyond his nation's “capacity.” However, “The ceasefire that has been established has not been violated by us so far, and it will continue to be observed,” he said.

Afghan and Pakistani troops briefly exchanged fire along the border between their countries on Thursday, both nations said, on the same day peace talks to find a lasting peace restarted in Istanbul.

Each side accused the other of initiating the gunfire near Spin Boldak, a border town in southern Afghanistan along their 2,600-km (1,600-mile) frontier.

The two South Asian neighbors clashed last month, killing dozens, in the worst violence since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. The escalation had been attributed to border security and militant activity. Islamabad accused Kabul of sheltering Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters, allegations that the Taliban administration rejects.

Hungary is the only EU nation governed by a “modern Christian government,” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said during a meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.

Orban is known for his staunch criticism of EU policies, including those related to the Ukraine conflict and migration, and has previously accused Brussels of turning the bloc into a symbol of weakness and chaos.

“We are a special island of difference in a liberal ocean in Europe,” he told journalists, adding that his cabinet pursues policies “different from what the others are doing even at the philosophical level, and at the level of practice as well.”

“We are the only government in Europe that considers itself a modern Christian government,” Orban stated.

Hungary is also the only EU state that has consistently supported Trump's efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict, he added, reiterating Budapest's readiness to host a potential summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“The only pro-peace government is the United States government and the small Hungary in Europe,” he said. He dismissed the narrative that the West is “unified” in its approach to resolving the conflict, blaming the continued hostilities on Brussels' belligerent stance and the mistaken belief that Kiev could win on the battlefield.

Unlike most other EU member states, Hungary has consistently opposed Brussels' confrontational policy towards Russia and has called for a more diplomatic approach. It has also refused to provide weapons to Kiev and opposed its EU membership bid, warning that Ukraine's accession to the bloc could lead to war.

Back in September, Orban accused the EU of becoming “a war project” that puts the economies of its member states at risk.

MOSCOW, November 5. /TASS/. Russia and China agree to deepen cooperation in trade and energy; Washington struggles for influence over Kiev and its allies as it tries to steer conflict with Russia to an end; and the United States proposes creating an international security force in Gaza to facilitate demilitarization. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russia and China will modernize border checkpoints and expand the list of goods permitted for cross-border transport, according to the communique issued following the 30th regular meeting of the heads of government of the two countries, Mikhail Mishustin and Li Qiang. The agenda also includes shifting the structure of bilateral trade toward agricultural products and primary processed goods, Izvestia writes. In Beijing, Mishustin was also received by Chinese President Xi Jinping. During their meeting, the sides agreed to create conditions to attract investment, provide each other with firm mutual support, and deepen cooperation in high-tech sectors.

On the economic front, Moscow and Beijing agreed to improve the structure of bilateral trade, making use of the growth potential in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, and primary processed products. In addition, the governments of Russia and China supported expanding air travel between the two countries.

""Such meetings make it possible to touch base, synchronize positions and discuss the most pressing issues, serving as an additional communication channel between national leaders,"" Junior Research Fellow at the Sector of Economy and Politics of China of the Center for Asia Pacific Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Andrey Fedotov told Izvestia.

Notably, the Russian prime minister's visit took place after negotiations between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump. Moscow and Beijing share a similar position on many global and regional issues. In particular, the two are opposed to the United States wielding unfettered power globally, Fedotov noted.

Talks with the Chinese leader also provided an opportunity to discuss the main areas of Russia-China cooperation. The central pillar remains energy trade. In 2024, China imported approximately 213 mln metric tons of oil and 246 bln cubic meters of natural gas from Russia - 1.8% and 6.2% higher, respectively, than the previous year.

During Vladimir Putin's visit to China on September 2, 2025, Russia's Gazprom and China's CNPC signed a legally binding memorandum on the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline through Mongolia. The implementation of this large-scale project will in the coming years allow Russia to increase gas exports to China to up to 50 bln cubic meters annually.

Igor Yushkov, Leading Analyst at the National Energy Security Fund and Expert at the Financial University under the Russian Government, told Izvestia that Russia has enough resources to build five such pipelines. At existing fields alone, Gazprom can produce around 100 bln cubic meters, and additional volumes have become available due to reduced supplies to the EU.

""I believe that, in the end, the project will be built, the question is when and under what conditions. Certain parameters of the commercial contract are still being finalized, as is the issue of financing,"" the expert emphasized.

 

On the day when the European ""coalition of the willing"" convened in Madrid, where discussion was expected to include a 12-point peace plan prepared jointly with Ukraine, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker arrived in Kiev. During his meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, he posited that the only viable scenario for resolving the military conflict with Russia would be one led by US President Donald Trump. Zelensky himself stated the day before that he had not seen a finalized plan from Europe, even though he and European leaders had just recently outlined its key points. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue that Washington may be seeking to ease escalation after Russia's recent strategic weapons tests, but acknowledge that it lacks leverage over both Kiev and its European allies.

According to the newspaper, since his inauguration on January 20, Donald Trump has periodically signaled a willingness to take into account the considerations of Russian negotiators regarding the outlines of a peace deal. Russia's position is and always has been that an immediate ceasefire would merely allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to regroup and maneuver, creating the risk of renewed hostilities. However, the US president has subsequently once again declared an immediate ceasefire to be a necessary move.

At the same time, on October 22, the US Treasury announced new sanctions against two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Meanwhile, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker stated in an interview in recent days that he had discussed additional options for exerting pressure on Russia during a meeting with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.

Commenting on these divergent statements for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts of the Peoples' Friendship University, suggested that Russian President Putin's recent announcement about successful tests of the unlimited-range Burevestnik cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater vehicle likely had an impact on Washington's thinking. Given their characteristics, both developments could pose a direct threat to the United States. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for Washington to try to reduce the level of escalation. Yet, any step toward Moscow would be depicted in Western media as a concession and a sign of personal weakness on Trump's part - an outcome that doesn't mesh with his political agenda.

In addition, Semibratov continued, the current US administration may lack sufficient leverage to influence either Western globalist circles as a whole, including the United Kingdom, or Zelensky himself. Given this, the UK, aware that Washington is weak on the details of the settlement, are deliberately seeking to complicate the negotiation process in order to push the United States to align with their position and turn up the heat on Moscow. If Russia rejects such a proposal, it could then be accused of derailing yet another round of negotiations. However, attempts to advance new initiatives that disregard Russia's security conditions will only further accelerate escalation.

 

The administration of US President Donald Trump has submitted to the UN Security Council a draft resolution to establish the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for a two-year mandate, with the possibility of extension, Axios reported citing a document obtained by the outlet. These armed contingents would not perform a peacekeeping function; instead, they would focus on securing Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training new Palestinian police forces. Discussions on the document are expected to begin in the near future. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti argue that while Washington seeks a multinational force to disarm Hamas, Israel currently has no incentive to accept such a plan, and disarmament remains impossible without progress toward Palestinian statehood, which remains unlikely.

The duties of the international forces would include the disarmament of the Palestinian radical group Hamas. According to the draft resolution, foreign contingents would work to stabilize the situation in the Gaza Strip and ensure the region's demilitarization.

It remains unclear which nations will contribute troops to the ISF, Vedomosti writes. Potential participants may include military personnel from Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and Turkey under the overall command of Egypt, The Guardian reported. The Israeli news portal Ynet suggested that military personnel from Indonesia, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan may be involved.

Conditions for the deployment of an international military contingent in Gaza are not yet in place, Doctor of Political Science at the University of Salzburg Kamran Hasanov told Vedomosti. First, despite the ceasefire, clashes between Israeli forces and Islamist fighters still periodically erupt in the enclave. Second, Israel is currently unwilling to allow the entry of international forces into Gaza as it categorically rejects the presence of Turkish troops there, the political scientist pointed out.

""Trump is counting on Ankara's assistance to implement his strategy. But Israel has already secured the release of hostages and therefore has no incentive to comply with the American plan. Otherwise, it risks a political crisis for Netanyahu's cabinet. For their part, the Americans have no incentive to pressure their Israeli allies so long as the region remains relatively stable,"" he said.

According to Hasanov, Hamas is interested in the deployment of peacekeepers only insofar as it hampers Israeli occupation of territory. However, the issue of disarmament remains inseparable from the question of establishing a Palestinian state - and such an outcome, the expert concluded, still appears unlikely.

 

Arab countries are seeking to play a more integral role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Head of the Mission of the League of Arab States (LAS) in Russia Valid Hamid Shiltag told Izvestia. He noted that Arab nations view their interaction with the SCO positively and are already participating in its meetings. Closer engagement would strengthen the organization's potential as one of the key centers of global development and would provide Russia with new avenues for growth.

Arab states could play a more visible role in the SCO, Shiltag said. According to him, expanding cooperation with the organization creates new opportunities for the region in international diplomacy and economic development.

""The League of Arab States and Arab countries as a whole take a positive view of cooperation with the SCO, as well as with BRICS. Some countries are already participating in meetings, and there are states that would also like to become part of these associations,"" the diplomat emphasized.

""Many countries express a desire to take part in order to expand their economic ties, and in this sphere, there are no rigid boundaries between countries. What matters here are shared interests. Arab states can take on a more active role in the SCO,"" the ambassador noted.

The region's intention to expand its involvement in the SCO is primarily linked to economic integration, the newspaper writes. Arab states believe they will fit naturally into the organization's economic mechanisms and complement its existing cooperation formats. Today, the SCO covers about 60% of Eurasian territory, and more than 3.4 bln people live in its member nations - nearly half of the world's population. The combined GDP of its participants exceeds $23 trillion. This scale makes the organization quite attractive for Middle East countries, Izvestia writes.

Strengthening ties between the SCO and the Arab world goes beyond symbolic gestures and is developing into a strategic path reflecting a broader trend toward a multipolar world order, Saudi political analyst Mubarak Al-Aati told the newspaper.

""An organization that includes a quarter of the global economy and more than half of the world's population provides Middle Eastern states with opportunities to enhance national security, expand economic ties, and make room for foreign-policy maneuver. At the same time, the success of their participation in this format will largely depend on the ability of Arab countries to articulate their own vision of engagement,"" the expert said.

 

The new US sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil did not have a substantial impact on the volume of Russian oil exports in October. Month-on-month, seaborne shipments declined by 1.2%, but longer delivery chains and widening discounts were observed. The sanctions could potentially have a greater impact after November 21, when the waivers for transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil expire, Kommersant writes.

Seaborne exports of Russian oil in October decreased month-on-month by 1.2% to 470,000 metric tons per day, according to a review by the Center for Price Indices. China accounted for 34% of shipments, India for 29%, Turkey for 14%, and Egypt and Syria together for 17%. The share of destinations listed as ""unknown"" amounted to 5%.

Maritime shipments of Russian oil to China declined by 7.5% in October, to 159,000 metric tons per day, with ESPO making up about 98% of volumes and Urals comprising the remainder, the Center for Price Indices noted.

Analysts do not view this decline in deliveries as critical, pointing out that in September there were two weeks of record shipments to China - 171,000 metric tons per day. Seaborne exports of Russian oil to India increased by 6.9% to 138,000 metric tons per day, and to Turkey - by 8% to 67,000 metric tons per day.

However, according to market participants cited by the Center for Price Indices, Turkish buyers have already begun searching for alternative suppliers due to the expanded list of Russian oil companies subject to US restrictions after Rosneft and Lukoil were added to the SDN List.

Kirill Bakhtin, Head of the Russian Equities Center at BCS World of Investments, told Kommersant that companies had sufficient time to prepare and develop alternative supply schemes. He said that purchases of Russian oil continue, but increasingly through intermediaries. The full effect of the sanctions will be clearer after November 21, when the transition period ends, the analyst added.

The Center for Price Indices expects average Brent crude prices to decline from $69 per barrel in 2025 to $64 per barrel the following year, due to rising production by OPEC+ countries outpacing the growth in global demand.

WASHINGTON, November 8. /TASS/. Control over the ceasefire regime in the Gaza Strip has shifted from the Israeli leadership to the US-established coordination center, the Washington Post (WP) reported, citing sources.

""The US military-led ‘coordination center' charged with implementing President Donald Trump's peace plan in the Gaza Strip is replacing Israel as the overseer of humanitarian aid to the enclave, even as multiple people familiar with the center's first weeks of operations have described it as chaotic and indecisive,"" the newspaper said.

""In a transition that was completed Friday, the Israelis are still ‘part of the conversation,' but decisions will be taken by the wider body,"" a US official told the newspaper.

More than 40 countries and organizations are represented in the US-led center, and ""one of the benefits […] of bringing them all together is that enables you to really sort through fact from fiction and get a clearer understanding of what is happening on the ground, where the needs lie,"" Tim Hawkins, US Central Command spokesman, told the Washington Post.

Israel and the Gaza-based Hamas Palestinian movement resumed Egypt-, Qatar-, United States-, and Turkey-mediated indirect talks on settling the situation in the Gaza Strip on October 6. On October 9, the parties to the conflict signed an agreement on the implementation of phase one of US President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan. The ceasefire came into effect on October 10.

On October 28, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered to deliver powerful strikes on the Gaza Strip after armed militants from the Hamas movement violated the ceasefire by delivering strikes on the Israeli military in the Rafah area in the southern Gaza Strip. Hamas denies its involvement in the Rafah incident.

According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, 104 people were killed in Israeli strikes while 253 sustained wounds.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

TikTok video shows woman speaking into camera and reacting to a loud thud before she says ‘I just hit somebody'

Authorities are investigating a newly surfaced video that suggests a woman who hit and killed a man while driving in the Chicago suburb of Zion, Illinois, on Monday night was livestreaming on TikTok at the time of the crash.

The video in question was reportedly taken by a user in Zion, and it shows a woman behind the wheel of a car reacting to a loud thud by saying, “Fuck, fuck, fuck … I just hit somebody.”

According to the Lake and McHenry County Scanner, which first reported on the video, the Zion police department investigations commander, Lt Paul Kehrli, said drugs and alcohol were not suspected of being factors in Monday's crash, and the driver involved – a 43-year-old woman – remained at the scene to speak with authorities.

The Lake county state's attorney's office told the Scanner on Friday afternoon that the agency had been made aware of the video but could not comment further because of a pending investigation. The office stopped short of indicating exactly who made the agency aware of the video.

Studies through the years have attributed cellphone use while driving to an increase in the potential for serious crashes – or worse.

A screen recording of a TikTok live video streamed on Monday was then published on the social media app on Friday morning, and it showed user “Tea_Tyme_3” speaking at her phone before a loud thud. The live stream was quickly disconnected after the thud prompted her to curse, a child to ask what happened and someone else to ask the driver if she was OK.

The user, it has been reported, has since changed her name and made her account private, deleting the biography section in which she had previously described being in Zion, Illinois.

A thread on the Reddit platform separately was started by a user who described seeing the video when it was livestreamed and wondering whether something deadly had happened. News stories later confirmed that user's worst fears, as the user put it.

“It feels like I accidentally witnessed the moment someone's life was taken and now I can't stop thinking about the victim, and how avoidable it was,” the user said. “I just keep replaying that sound in my head.”

The user also said the person driving while on TikTok “wasn't paying attention to the road because she was reading comments and grinning at her phone”.

“A man died because she wanted attention from a livestream,” the Reddit user also wrote.

Monday's crash occurred at about 5.30pm, police said. Darren Lucas, 59, of nearby Beach Park, was unresponsive after being hit, and he was later pronounced dead at a hospital emergency room from blunt force injuries inflicted on him by the crash, the local coroner's office said in a statement.

Lucas's son-in-law, Chris King, told the Lake and McHenry County Scanner that news of the video made his family “hold our loss tighter to our hearts”.

“We … will continue to pray for what the driver must be going through,” King reportedly said. “We are trying to find our ways to live, without someone we cherished so much.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Draft template seen by the Guardian has no reference to countries receiving benefits for sharing information, such as guaranteed access to medicines developed as a result





The US wants countries to agree to hand over information on bugs that could cause large-scale disease outbreaks in return for restoring aid to tackle health problems such as HIV and malaria, according to government documents.

The Trump administration is seeking new bilateral aid agreements with dozens of countries, after an abrupt withdrawal from existing arrangements at the start of this year. The agreements form part of a new America First Global Health Strategy announced in September.

A draft template seen by the Guardian, to be used for memorandums of understanding with partner countries, offers funding to tackle diseases such as malaria, TB, HIV and polio, as well as for activities such as surveillance, and laboratory systems and electronic health records.

It suggests that countries will be expected to gradually take over funding these areas themselves over the course of the five-year agreements.

In return, it includes conditions requiring countries to share biological specimens and genetic sequences of “pathogens with epidemic potential” with the US, within days of their identification.

The move risks undermining global efforts to bring a new pandemic agreement into force and ensure countries get fair access to vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, advocates said.

A full specimen-sharing agreement – envisaged as a 25-year commitment – is still being drafted, the memorandum says, but there is no reference in the current document to countries receiving any specific benefits for sharing, such as guaranteed access to medicines developed as a result.

Access to those benefits proved a key sticking point in negotiations for the pandemic agreement, reached earlier this year, governing how the world will respond to future outbreaks. Developing countries fear a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic when they struggled to access the vaccines and medicines that became available.

A decision on that element of pandemic response – a “pathogen access and benefit sharing” (Pabs) system – was pushed back for further negotiations. The system will form an annex to the main agreement, but must be in place before the agreement opens for signatures.

The draft memorandum and accompanying technical guidance also suggests that countries will be expected to recognise approval of drugs by US regulators as meeting domestic regulatory requirements, particularly where there are “large domestic markets [or] other strategic reasons”.

News of the draft US memorandum broke as country and civil society representatives gathered in Geneva for talks on the proposed Pabs system.

Michel Kazatchkine, on behalf of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: “In our view, these bilateral agreements will undermine the multilateral system. They will bypass the World Health Organization and the foundations of solidarity and equity we have been trying to build here.

“The template offers no guarantees of access to countermeasures and gives commercial dominance to one country. It threatens health security, data security and, ultimately, national sovereignty.”

In a statement, the Pandemic Action Network said: “We would like to underline the importance of this multilateral process and of investing in a system that can last, of countries pulling together.

“The origin story of these negotiations got us here: every country fighting for themselves became a race to the bottom – and those that suffered were the most vulnerable.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. Read the latest news on Russia's overnight Nov. 8 attacks, including its drone strike on a residential building in Dnipro.

Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast faced emergency power outages after a new large-scale Russian attack overnight on Nov. 8, which targeted Ukraine's energy and gas infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces downed 406 out of the 458 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said.

The cities of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv served as the primary target of Russian attacks. Explosions were also heard in the city of Sumy, as well as in Odesa Oblast.

""Very brazen, in many ways the strike is demonstrative,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine is working with the U.S. to buy additional Patriot air defense systems. 

Emergency power cuts were introduced in several Ukrainian regions due to the attack, according to Ukraine's state grid operator Ukrenergo.

Ukraine's largest private energy company, DTEK, reported on Nov. 8 that one of its thermal power plants had been ""seriously damaged"" by a Russian attack. According to the company, Russia has attacked DTEK power plants over 210 times since the start of the full-scale invasion.

In Kyiv, outages varied by location, with some areas expected to remain without electricity for up to eight hours.

Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk said that the consequences of the attacks are being determined and normal outages (up to four hours a day) will be restored ""once the situation in the energy system stabilizes.""

In Kyiv, explosions were heard just before 4:30 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. Officials reported that air defense were at work in the city amid a wider Russian drone attack on the capital.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko later reported that a fire has been reported in the Pechersky district amid falling drone debris stemming from the attack. The fire was later extinguished, the mayor added.

No casualties in the capital were reported. 

The attack on Kyiv comes amid a wider attack on cities closer to Ukraine's front line regions. Air raid alerts throughout the night warned of Russian ballistic missile attacks, targeting Ukraine's central, southern, and eastern regions.

Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported energy infrastructure was struck in Odesa Oblast amid the ballistic missile attack.

Throughout the fall, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as it attempts to plunge the country into yet another harsh winter. The worst strikes on Oct. 3 and 5 wiped out around 60% of Ukraine's gas production sites.

Earlier in the night, Russia also carried out a drone attack on a residential building in the city of Dnipro, injuring at least seven people, including two children, officials reported.

Russia launched yet another wide-ranging attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on Nov. 8, using a combination of drone and missiles to strike targets across the country.

The U.S. granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas use following a meeting between Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Nov. 7.

""We have received a full sanctions exemption for the Turk Stream and Druzhba pipelines,"" Orban said. Reuters reported that the exemption was granted for one year.

Orban, a close ideological ally of Trump, has defied pressure to halt purchases of Russian oil and gas. After the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft in late October, Orban said Hungary looked for ways to ""circumvent"" the restrictions.

Orban, a close Trump ally and widely seen as Putin's closest partner in the EU, has maintained ties with Moscow despite the war and has repeatedly portrayed Ukraine as a threat to Hungary's security and economy.

Trump told the media he was ""looking at"" granting Hungary an exception from Russian oil sanctions in response to Budapest's plea. He added that he was ""very disturbed"" that there are other European countries that have not fully cut off Russian oil imports.

""Sure, we're looking at it, because it's very difficult for (Orban) to get the oil and gas from other areas,"" Trump said alongside the Hungarian leader. ""As you know, they don't have the advantage of having sea. It's a great country, it's a big country, but they don't have sea. They don't have the ports. And so they have a difficult problem.""

The two countries also reached a nuclear fuel deal with Westinghouse to supply nuclear fuel for Hungary's Paks I power plant, and Budapest would buy U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to diversify its energy supplies.

Orban and Trump also discussed Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, as the two seek to portray themselves as mediators in peace efforts. According to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, Budapest is ready to host possible peace talks ""once the preparations are complete.""

When asked by reporters if the two leaders agree on methods to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, Trump said that ""I think we agree that the war is (going to) end in the not too distant future,"" with Orban adding that he has ""some ideas"" to present to Trump.

The planned Trump–Putin summit in Budapest was canceled in October shortly after being announced.

""If there is a meeting — wherever it may take place — that can genuinely lead to a ceasefire and an end to the war, Ukraine will support any such format,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier on Nov. 7. ""But if these meetings are only meant as an 'electoral fireworks show' for Orban and produce no real results, then we can't support them.""

Shadow Fleet tanker MT Virgo returns after delivering a cargo of Iranian oil on Aug. 24, 2025. The busy shipping lanes in the South China Sea offer a logistical advantage because they are close to buyers in China and India.Remy Osman/Supplied

British expat Remy Osman has a front-row seat from which to watch the growing “shadow fleet” of vessels off Singapore filled with Russian, Iranian or Venezuelan oil in the process of evading Western sanctions.

Mr. Osman, a salesman in the Asian city-state's food and beverage industry, has built an internet following in his spare time by documenting the passage of tanker ships that in many cases are part of the illicit trade in oil.

From his apartment, armed with a camera and telephoto lens, he identifies and captures photos and videos of these vessels en route to international waters. Once out of local jurisdictions, they sidle up to another ship and transfer their hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil. 

Explainer: How a shadow fleet of tankers keeps Russian oil money flowing despite Western sanctions

One day, he documents the Russian oil tanker Krasnoyarsk passing by. It's under sanctions from the United States, Canada and other countries for helping transport petroleum for Moscow, which is waging a war against Ukraine.

Another day it's the Virgo, a tanker that's part of Iran's shadow fleet and also under U.S. sanctions.

Mr. Osman is helping put video and photo evidence to a phenomenon that shipping analysts have been documenting for some time.

The busy shipping lanes in the South China Sea offshore of Singapore and neighbouring Malaysia are a growing site for ship-to-ship transfers of oil from countries under Western sanctions, offering logistical advantages for shadow fleet vessels.

“It's kind of a Wild West zone that's geographically close to where the buyers are likely to be,” Mr. Osman said.

Growth of shadow tanker fleet slows as tightened Western sanctions target Russian oil

“It tends to be sanctioned oil from Iran, Russia and Venezuela. And then it typically tends to be transferred to buyers and shipped out to China or India.” 

It's hard for the ships, which can run as big as 330 metres in length, to evade Mr. Osman's camera lens as they transit the ocean about 10 to 15 kilometres from his apartment.

But the tremendous number of commercial vessels using these waterways means it's easier for tankers with illicit oil to blend in among all the traffic. 

Transferring the oil from countries under sanctions to another tanker helps obscure the origin, destination and ownership of the cargo. Traders also disperse oil among multiple vessels to reduce the risk of interdiction or seizure by authorities. Sometimes it is mixed with product from countries that are not under sanctions to disguise it.

Mr. Osman, who is now a permanent resident of Singapore, said he first became interested in ship spotting during the pandemic, when he was confined to a hotel for a quarantine period about five years ago. “I had nothing to do but spend hours in my hotel room looking at the sea and taking pictures of the ships.”

He looks for telltale signs of shadow fleet vessels before taking photos. First, if the AIS (automatic identification system) data being broadcast from the ship is odd – for instance, the ship is supposed to be coming from China but is pointed toward China; and second, if the vessel is flying an unusual flag. 

“If it's got a flag from an unregulated and undeveloped maritime country – if it's some random African country which doesn't really have a merchant fleet – that's usually a good clue,” Mr. Osman said.

The third criteria is whether it's an older vessel – 15 to 25 years old.

He then runs the ship registration information against Western lists of vessels under sanctions.

In an August brief, shipping intelligence provider Windward described the waters near the Riau archipelago off Singapore and eastern Malaysia as the “epicentre of maritime lawlessness on Asia's doorstep.” It said that for the past five years the area has been used by dark fleet – another term for shadow fleet – tankers as both a hub for floating storage and for ship-to-ship transfers of oil on sanctions lists. 

Windward's brief said the area is convenient because it serves as a midway point between Iran, Russia or Venezuela and “China, the biggest buyer of crude, with nearby maritime services from Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia within a day's sailing.”

In a note to clients that same month, BRS Shipbrokers said Western sanctions by the U.S., the European Union and others may be fuelling the expansion of the “grey fleet,” or vessels engaging in illicit trading. In 2025, it said, some 30 ships per month have shifted from mainstream shipping to the Russian or Iranian market, adding that the fleet now represents 18.2 per cent of global oil tanker tonnage.

John Boscariol, head of McCarthy Tétrault's international trade and investment law group, said the illicit ship-to-ship transfers demonstrate the limitation of sanctions.

“Everyone can say, ‘Oh, we've imposed sanctions on Russia. We've listed this shadow fleet,'” he said. “But ultimately, when the shadow fleet doesn't call at Canadian or other Western ports, or companies that buy from or otherwise support the shadow fleet don't touch the jurisdiction of the United States, Canada, the EU or Britain, there's not much that can be done about it.”

Donald Trump's decision to boycott the annual Group of 20 summit comes just a few days after he said South Africa shouldn't be a part of the group at all.

President Donald Trump on Friday announced that no US officials would attend the Group of 20 summit in South Africa later this month, citing the country's treatment of white farmers.

""It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social network.

The Trump administration has long accused the South African government of discriminating against its white minority, citing alleged land seizures and violence.

The South African government has denied that Afrikaners and other white South Africans are being persecuted.

""No US government official will attend as long as these human rights abuses continue,"" Trump said in his post.

Trump said at a business event earlier this week in Miami that South Africa should be thrown out of the group of the world's largest economies, saying: ""South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what's happened there is bad.""

Trump announced in September he would skip the G20 summit this year, but that Vice President JD Vance would attend in his place.

On Friday, as Trump broke news that US officials plan to skip the summit, Reuters news agency reported an official, without naming the person, as saying that ""the vice president is not traveling to South Africa for the G20, nor does he have any plans for international travel in the near term.""

Each year, a different country assumes the G20 presidency and sets the agenda for that year, with the US due to take on the role after this year's summit on November 22-23.

Trump plans to hold next year's summit at his golf resort in Miami — at the same location he proposed to host the 2020 Group of Seven (G7) summit during his first term.

China announced it has commissioned its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian. With it, China is steadily closing the gap to US naval capabilities in the region.

On Friday, Chinese media reported that the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has officially taken its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, into service at a naval base on the southern Chinese island of Hainan.

The state news agency Xinhua said the commissioning ceremony had been held on Wednesday, with Chinese President Xi Jinping in attendance.

International reactions have been guarded. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary and former defense minister Minoru Kihara said that Japan was observing China's military activity and would respond ""calmly but decisively "" if necessary.

Fujian is also the name of the Chinese coastal province facing the island of Taiwan in the South China Sea.

The Fujian is the first carrier that China designed and built independently. The first two, the Liaoning and Shandong, commissioned in 2012 and 2019, relied heavily on Soviet blueprints.

The new carrier is equipped with an advanced takeoff technology — a sort of electromagnetic catapult known as EMALS — that is able to launch heavier jets than older steam-powered technologies, allowing for more fuel and a wider range, as well as a larger payload.

It also allows for the deployment of heavier reconnaissance planes, which are essential for providing ships with operational visibility when out of range of land-based support.

Previously, this lauch capability had been exclusive to Ford-class carriers — named after the world's largest warship to date, the USS Gerald R. Ford — in the US navy.

Increasing the range of warships and planes in the region comes with a series of geopolitical implications, lending China growing capabilities to defend contested islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea it lays claims to, as well as challenge US primacy deeper in the Pacific.

""China's carriers cannot just operate near home, they must operate in the distant oceans and far seas to carry out various training and support missions,"" Hong Kong-based military expert Song Zhongping told the AP news agency. ""Our overseas interests span the globe, we need to be globally present.""

In a recent report to the US Congress, the Pentagon described China's military as ""the only competitor to the United States with the intent and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order.""

There are growing concerns abroad that China's growing naval force will be used to blockade or possibly invade Taiwan. The democratically self-governed island off China's eastern coast has geopolitical, economic and historical relevance in the US-China rivalry in the South China Sea and beyond.

And the Fujian had already drawn international attention ahead of its formal commissioning on Wednesday.

In September, Chinese defense officials confirmed the Fujian had passed through the Taiwan Straight on ""scientific research trials and training missions."" The carrier was also used to showcase takeoffs and landings of the PLA's prestigious J-35 stealth fighter. 

Beijing has been funneling billions of dollars into defense in recent years, with the aim of modernizing its forces by 2035.

A fourth carrier has been under construction since 2024, and is thought to have nuclear propulsion capabilities which will increase the distance it can travel by virtually removing the need to refuel.

China's navy is expected to have six aircraft carriers by 2030, the US Department of Defense estimates.

In numbers, China has the world's largest navy, with over 700 warships and submarines, and over 1,000 active vessels. In comparison, the US Navy has just over 200 active ships.

But in terms of aircraft carriers, the imbalance is reversed: The US Navy has 11 aircraft carriers in total, compared to China's three. All of them are nuclear powered. 

But China has been working to close this gap, constructing new warships at a pace the US has not been able to match.

""They're fielding and building more aircraft carriers, they're fielding more nuclear-powered subs, they are fielding more, larger destroyers and other vessels that carry a larger number of missiles,"" the deputy director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Brian Hart, told AP.

But Singapore-based analyst an aerospace engineer Tang Meng Kit  told the AP news agency, ""it is possible that China's capabilities are overstated, "" and argued  that well-choreographed parades displaying modern weaponry did not translate into actual combat-readiness.

""Real-world operational readiness lags behind its showcased arsenal,"" he said.

British fascists are being trained by American white supremacists linked to a deadly terror attack, the Telegraph can reveal.

Members of Vanguard Britannica, a racist, anti-Semitic group based in the UK, travelled to the US in September to attend the first national conference of the Patriot Front, America's most prolific neo-Nazi group.

The members returned to the UK “ready to apply what they have learnt in our home country”, leaked Telegram messages show.

During their trip to Texas, delegates took part in training “workshops”.

They also met with prominent American white nationalists including Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance magazine, a publication associated with the movement, and Thomas Rousseau, the leader of Patriot Front.

Mr Rousseau formerly headed up Vanguard America, the American chapter of the group, members of whom were present at the march preceding the 2017 Charlottesville terror attack which left one person dead and injured dozens more.

James Alex Fields marched with the group at the Unite The Right rally before mowing down a peaceful crowd. Vanguard America has denied Fields was a member.

Mr Taylor is an academic who believes in voluntary racial segregation and has been credited with intellectualising the US white nationalist movement away from Klansmen and skinheads.

Vanguard Britannica's engagement with the Patriot Front will fuel fears that the British group could bring the extreme tactics used by American neo-Nazis to streets of UK cities, including flash demonstrations that incorporate smoke bombs, flares and anti-Semitic chants.

Last July, masked members of the Patriot Front descended on the streets of Nashville, Tennessee, while holding American flags and chanting “Sieg Heil”. Members are also required to engage in weekly on-the-ground activism or face expulsion.

The group has previously blamed Jews for the migrant crisis and called for Britain to be free from “Jewish usury, media control, and non-white immigration”.

Alex Hearn, co-director of Labour Against Antisemitism, called the disclosure “extremely concerning” and urged British counter-terrorism officers to take action.

New figures show the highest number of people on record were referred to the UK's anti-extremism scheme in the year to march — with a 37 per cent rise in extremism cases.

A total of 8,778 people were referred to the programme, the highest since records began in 2015, up 27 per cent from the previous year's 6,922 referrals, according to data collected by Prevent, the UK's counter-terrorism programme.

The British group is known for intimidating minority communities through sticker campaigns and unfurling banners on motorways that include opposing “Zionist wars”.

They have previously said they wish to “educate all on the evils the Jew wreaks upon our lands and people”.

It is understood that the group has been reported to Counter Terrorism Policing over its recent trip to the US.

Dr Julia Ebner, a researcher specialising in radicalisation, extremism and terrorism at the University of Oxford and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said: “This form of transnational tactical inspiration and guidance is becoming increasingly common among the extreme Right.”

She added that the meeting “could lead to a shift towards more transgressive tactics — which fit with an overall trend of a more emboldened far Right in the UK”.

Vanguard Britannica is also linked to Active Club England (ACE), a neo-Nazi group recruiting fighting-age white British men to “enforce their will on the world”, The Telegraph understands.

Two ACE Midlands activists were pictured alongside Mr Taylor just days after members of Vanguard Britannica were also photographed with the leading white nationalist, Telegram messages reveal.

The West Midlands region received the highest number of referrals for extremism per million people (176) in the year to March, Home Office data shows.

Western intelligence agencies are allegedly monitoring “Active Clubs”, white supremacist groups that place emphasis on physical fitness, such as ACE, owing to the threat of increasing international cooperation between them, the Guardian reported.

In an interview with an undercover reporter, the leader of the group apparently boasted about having ties to a network of “good actors” at the forefront of the conservative protest movement in Britain.

After being forced into a “security lockdown” in January following an “infiltration”, ACE is once again enlisting recruits.

Members are required to have a “pro-White worldview”, be a “heterosexual male of European heritage”, “train a combat sport” and “train weightlifting or calisthenics”.

Applicants who are six foot and above, heavier than 80kg (12 stone 6tlb) and have a “straight edge” will be looked upon favourably, the group says.

The ACE leader said the group is made up of “deeply committed national socialists”, “white nationalists” and “everything in between” whose plan is to “get together and enforce their will on the world.”

During the call, he stressed the importance of being able to fight, with membership contingent on attending training at least once a month to practise hand-to-hand combat.

“We wish to have a continued existence for our people,” he said.

Mr Hearn said: “It is extremely concerning that British neo-Nazis have partnered with their American counterparts to collaborate on campaigns and share tactics.

“Equally concerning is the British group's relationship with German neo-Nazis allied to Hezbollah, a proscribed terrorist group that runs an international criminal empire.

“Counter terrorism police must now address Vanguard Britannica.”

Dr Ebner said: “There is a risk that this type of US-UK extreme-Right convergence also allows for other synergies, such as shared funding structures and more impactful comms campaigns that reach new target audiences.”

A Counter Terrorism Policing spokesman said: “We have ongoing concerns about people becoming engaged with extremism and terrorism — whether that be linked to extreme Right wing terrorism, Islamist terrorism, or other forms of terrorist ideologies.

“Evidenced through our increasing casework in these areas, the scale of the extreme Right wing terrorist threat is one that isn't going away, and something we share with our international partners. We know that there are rising numbers of young people being drawn into the ideology, through social media and online platforms.

An ACE spokesman said: “Active Club England is a fraternal organisation for English and European men dedicated to the creation of a culture prioritising physical fitness, self-improvement, and the building of strong and healthy communities.

“We meet regularly to train, socialise, and network — prioritising weightlifting, combat sports, outdoor pursuits, and communal events.

“We are unapologetically for the English people and their continued existence in their ancestral homelands.”

Vanguard Britannica was approached for comment.

Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 30 in federal court by Just Futures Law and the Center for Constitutional Rights, demands that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comply with Freedom of Information Act requests related to their contracts with tech companies Cellebrite and Paragon Solutions. Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world. 

Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump's second term.

“The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people's phones, extract data, and surveil people's daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release. 

“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

CBP did not respond to Prism's request for comment.

ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. The agency currently holds two active contracts totaling $11 million with the company, which markets phone-cracking tools that allow law enforcement to extract data from locked devices, according to the attorneys' press release. CBP, which also holds at least 20 Cellebrite software licenses, has partnered with the firm since 2008, the press release states.

Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. According to technical researchers, the tool can hack into smartphones, including encrypted messaging apps, without the user's knowledge. ICE entered into a contract with Paragon in September 2024, but the Biden administration paused the agreement due to national security concerns after issuing an executive order limiting the use of spyware by federal agencies. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract.

Members of Congress sent a letter last month demanding answers from ICE about its use of Graphite, calling the secrecy surrounding the program “deeply alarming.”

Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Family members have had their devices searched during home raids. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid.

The level of intrusion remains unclear, which is precisely what the lawsuit seeks to change.

“We should not have to go to federal court to force the government to hand over these records,” Ian Head, manager of the Open Records Project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in the press release. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.” 

Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.

Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations.

“In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”

Susan Kigula spent 10 years on death row in Uganda, where a murder conviction carried a mandatory death penalty. Undeterred by the threat of execution, Kigula buried her misery in legal books and mobilized a team of lawyers that eventually included current British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Kigula went on to file an appeal on behalf of 417 people incarcerated on death row in Uganda, and her effort saved her own life and the lives of 416 others. 

Today Kigula is free and a member of the leadership of the International Network of Formerly Incarcerated Women (INFIW). The network is the product of years of grassroots organizing across the globe — efforts that culminated in a 2023 convening in Bogota, Colombia, where 60 women from 17 countries met to share strategies on halting the massive population increase in women's prisons and jails around the world.

The 2023 convening sought to implement an international declaration created in 2021, which proclaimed that “now is the time to invest in initiatives led by incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women and girls and their families, addressing stigma and discrimination, and reducing the damage of centuries of purely punitive penal policies that have negatively impacted millions of people, including those deprived of liberty, their families and communities.” In the years after the declaration was issued, members of the INFIW had built local, national and regional organizations to magnify their political power and consolidate under the banner of abolition.

The renowned activist and former political prisoner Angela Davis addressed the Bogotá gathering via video, reminding those in attendance they were “the vanguard of social justice movement precisely because … [they recognized] that given the interconnected economic, political, and social structures that characterize our times, it is incumbent on us to develop strategies of social justice that are also global in scope.”

The advent of the INFIW emerged from a simple realization: The voices and presence of formerly incarcerated women were missing from major international policy spaces like the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS). In 2015, Andrea James of the U.S.-based National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls (The National Council) stepped into that void, taking part in forums at the OAS and the UN and successfully putting women's incarceration on regional and international agendas.

From there, momentum grew. Working with the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), The National Council began building cross-border connections, traveling first to México in 2017 to join a workshop with an emerging network of formerly incarcerated women. They followed with visits to Brazil, Argentina, and a return to México to lay the groundwork for the first regional workshop in Bogotá, Colombia, in 2019, titled “Women Resisting: Bringing Down the Bars.” 

That historic gathering, organized by Corporación Humanas, Mujeres Libres, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), and The National Council brought together directly impacted women from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, México, and the United States. The attendees, speaking three languages, crafted a powerful final statement. Among the participants was the late Kathy Boudin, the co-founder of Columbia's Center for Justice and an advisory committee member of the INFIW, who underscored the need for restorative justice approaches that move beyond punishment.

INFIW quickly looked beyond the Americas to build relationships in Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. 

At the 2023 Bogota gathering, the network also finalized their structure, constituting a democratic decision-making body that is currently a 15-member advisory committee of people from five continents. A unified force emerged that focused on movement building, advocacy and campaigns, changing narratives, economic empowerment, education and training, and self-care, with a mission to transform pain into collective power. 

Amid the global rise in women's incarceration, which has outpaced that of men, INFIW members opted to consolidate their power to challenge and resist the carceral juggernaut. Their determination to take this action was fortified by the absence of the political will to implement the Bangkok Rules, a potentially transformative set of guidelines officially known as the “Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders,” which was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010. 

The historical roots of the organizations in the network extended deep into the 20th century, as far back as the 1992 founding of Sisters Inside in Australia. Like many of the INFIW member organizations, Sisters Inside arose from the experience of one person who had been through the system and realized that change would only come when those directly impacted stepped to the front. 

In Australia that person was Debbie Kilroy, who had been through a cycle of domestic violence, poverty, and incarceration until her close friend was murdered in the Boggo Road Gaol in Queensland. That killing prompted Kilroy to reflect on the conditions that led to this tragedy. When she looked around the prison, she saw women repeatedly traumatized by poverty, racism, domestic violence, and police abuse. In response, Kilroy and several Aboriginal women in the prison began Sisters Inside. 

Over the past three decades Sisters Inside has grown a presence across Australia, visiting women in all prisons including remote rural prisons, initiating mounting critiques of abuse by prison guards and carving pathways to success for women when they do get out. 

 “We share our knowledge, especially regarding the intersectionality of colonialism, racial capitalism, and the oppression that Indigenous women and girls are confronted with daily.”

Kilroy herself is a prime example of such personal transformation. After the murder of her close friend, she changed course, completing a degree in social work, then going on to defy the odds and become one of the first formerly incarcerated women to attend and finish law school. She has now been a practicing attorney for nearly two decades. Her clients are primarily women inside prisons and those who have been released. In the course of that work, she connected with Angela Davis, and built a partnership that became an important influence on the International Network. 

“We share our knowledge, especially regarding the intersectionality of colonialism, racial capitalism, and the oppression that Indigenous women and girls are confronted with daily,” Kilroy told Truthout. “Our liberation is inherently bound together as we fight for a collective future free from the prison industrial complex.” For Kilroy and her organization, asserting the leading role of Aboriginal women in Sisters Inside has been paramount. “We've been able to connect with Aboriginal communities across the globe, learning from their struggles and aspirations.” 

After nine years in prison, Claudia Cardona landed a job at Corporación Humanas to work on the topic of women, drugs, and prison. “I was charged with using my freedom to fight for that of others. Having been on the inside, I knew this would have to be a collective struggle, so I started by calling other formerly incarcerated women who were struggling to put their lives back together,” she said. This meant teaching women “that this is about having strength and to be able to fight against the system because the system is wrong.” 

Cardona focused on making people understand that when we are imprisoning a woman, it is not only the woman who loses her freedom — it also impacts her family. “By affecting the family you affect and impact the community in general.” She led the formation of an organization in her community called Mujeres Libres (Free Women) which leads major policy campaigns. 

In 2022, Mujeres Libres pressured the Colombian government to pass the Menstrual Health in Prison Act, which guaranteed free menstrual materials to incarcerated people. The following year the government issued Decree 2292, which allowed some convicted women to receive a public service sentence in place of prison. Cardona catapulted from Mujeres Libres to the National Commission for Monitoring the Unconstitutional State of Affairs in Penitentiary and Prison Matters, a coalition of civil society organizations that researches human rights violations in the prison system and brings its findings before Colombia's Constitutional Court.

Like Kilroy, Cardona's work brought international connections, largely with other women from Latin America such as México's Betty Maldonado. After completing her prison term, Maldonado became a leader of Mujeres Unidas por la Libertad (Women United for Freedom), also a member of INFIW. 

“What we don't want is for a criminal record to become a life sentence,” she told Truthout. The work of Mujeres Unidas por la Libertad extends deep into the personal lives of their members. “We get women who are pregnant and we take them to the hospital so they can give birth. We have women that have been sexually abused … we also see some homeless women, women that don't have anywhere to go. They live on the street. So we're researchers to see where women who used to be in prison were and we are able to take them to a shelter, find help for them.” 

A major problem for people in women's prisons in México is pre-trial delays. According to Maldonado, people can wait years in jail before their case even gets to court. They essentially disappear inside the system. In one renowned instance, Daniel García and Reyes Alpízar spent 17 years awaiting trial. That is why Maldonado stresses the effort her members put into their work. “We work Monday to Sunday,” she told Truthout. Like Cardona, Maldonado believes the progress of formerly incarcerated women is tied to a fight for “human rights of women, lesbians, nonbinary, Indigenous, migrants.” 

Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, Susan Kigula had been busy fighting her case and building connections with women across the continent. Kigula fought her way out from under her legalized death threat, getting her sentence reduced to 20 years.

By the time of her release Kigula had finished a law degree and was ready to take on the death penalty again. While she built an international profile in her death penalty work she started the Sunny African Children's Center, which provides housing and education for children of women incarcerated in Uganda. 

She shared her vision of the International Network with Truthout: “My hope [is] to engage in global partnerships. The network might aim to forge partnerships with governments, with NGOs, with corporate entities, with other civil societies to tackle global challenges and inspire more systematic changes.” 

Kigula also views the network as a future reservoir of resources to “help formerly incarcerated women rebuild their lives and integrate back into society…once the network moves to a global recognition status and drives change,” then she believes “it'll promote more social justice, human rights, and community empowerment.” 

While all network members share a deep commitment to women inside and those released from prison, the strength of the INFIW lies in the diversity of political perspectives and experiences that each member brings. These varying visions are not a source of division but of richness, allowing the network to weave together different ideas into a collective vision and a shared pathway forward. 

For example, INFIW leaders from Brazil bring an additional political component to the organization. Coming from a very politicized society with a developed working-class movement, Ana Tonini, who was incarcerated for 13 years, calls for the Network to develop a critique of capitalism and to consider Marxism as a political framework. She and fellow Brazilian Patricia Mendes told Truthout that they both query the use of “women” in the title of the network, since they know that many of the members identify as trans and nonbinary. 

On the other hand, Haitian representatives to the INFIW, Cassandra Altinor and Lynette Peregrina, prioritize a different approach. Largely because a nexus of crises, natural disasters and centuries of underdevelopment have ravaged their neighborhoods. They lean more toward fundraising to provide assistance to women who have come out of prison and are struggling with necessities. 

A common thread through the network is addressing the narrative about women who have been incarcerated and often further criminalized by family and community members. Altinor said that she was “obliged to move to another area because the people in my former community … considered us formerly incarcerated women as criminals. They do not talk to us,” said Altinor. “People were always saying that we're bad people, we're criminals. That's the most difficult part for me,” Altinor recounted. “The state, the government doesn't help us at all.” 

Akosua Akuffo of Zambia echoes Altinor's views. Akuffo spent years battling substances. But on her last prison bid, she transformed and began to analyze her position in society and the community. “I think this is high time that people understand that we're women, we are mothers, we are children, we are sisters, we are aunts, and we deserve a second chance to build our lives. We deserve to go back into society and earn money to feed our children. Otherwise, what are you encouraging us to do? You're encouraging us to go back. So we need to speak up to end the stigma and ensure that future generations do not have to go through what we have gone through.”

Not surprisingly, changing the narrative about incarcerated women is one of the five major goals of the INFIW. As Akuffo sees it, “I feel like right now we have at least been included to the table, but more can be done to change policy reform … more can be done to amplify our voices and really change the narrative of formerly incarcerated people,” Akuffo said. “And this is where we see the network going, talking about it and saying that people who go to prison are human beings.”   

Dawn Harrington, a formerly incarcerated woman from the U.S., came to a similar conclusion. She realized when she met people who had been incarcerated in women's prisons in other countries that “there were significant similarities between us no matter where we were … the more we connected the more [we realized] we can actually build solidarity together.” Ireland's Paula Kearney agreed. She saw the network as a guard against that isolation because … “a lot of us are living in our own little bubbles and tend to stay quite local … our research has really shown that there are a lot of similarities across all of our paths,” she said. “A lot of times we don't realize that that's not just in our little circles because we tend to look at what's going on in our own countries.”

“We deserve a second chance to build our lives. We deserve to go back into society and earn money to feed our children.”

Being from the United States, Harrington found the work of the network made her deeply aware of the imperialist policies and practices “from the U.S. that were being exported.” Harrington comes from Nashville, Tennessee, which was the birthplace of the first private prison company, known originally as Corrections Corporation of America. (In 2016 they changed their name to CoreCivic.) 

As private prisons came under fire in the U.S. and began to reduce their profile, Harrington discovered through the network that internationally these corporations are expanding. And today, they are experiencing a boomerang-like resurgence, with stocks rising in response to the growth of immigration crackdown and detention. This reality underscores the urgent need for global solidarity across movements and intersections: Our struggles are interconnected, and an injury to one is an injury to all.

For Harrington, the 2023 gathering in Bogotá was “like pouring fuel on the fire that was about to happen.” While developing the declaration and its structure was essential, Harrington recognized a beautiful challenge in internal debates, ultimately guiding the adoption as a principle, to “unapologetically commit to end the incarceration of women and girls, period.” In the words of Toni Tulloch, a Jamaican woman who spent 16.5 years in U.S. prisons and was subsequently deported, and now serves as the international organizer for the INFIW, “we're gonna have to change the whole structure of how incarceration for women is dealt with and just basically find the keys that it takes to unlock the door to stop this madness.”

While women's prisons make up a small percentage of the world's incarcerated population, the people coming out of these prisons have moved front and center in politicizing issues of incarceration. According to Debbie Kilroy, “it's about bringing everybody on a journey to end the incarceration of women and girls, whether it's intellectually within our hearts or in our practice with our hands.” Kilroy said she talks a lot about how “head, heart, and hands have to be connected … Because if we can't feed ourselves, we can't have an intellectual analysis of what's happening with the prison industrial complex or racial capitalism. But if our bellies are full and our hearts are warm because we're somewhere safe, we can actually start to strategically think about what we can do.… But it's about having those three parts of us as human beings connected to be able to do the work to move forward.” 

For the members of INFIW that pathway forward includes international solidarity. With its global reach and leadership of directly impacted people, the INFIW has created a model that can reshape our notions of liberation and undermine any and all efforts to extend the boundaries of empire and the carceral state everywhere that it exists around the world. Toni Tulloch projected this vision into the network's future: “We're going to continue to demolish the system. We're going little by little. We're going to … tear down this structure because it's necessary.” 

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Food banks are in “disaster response mode” after SCOTUS blocked a lower court order that the funds be distributed.

The U.S. Supreme Court late Friday temporarily blocked a lower court order that required the Trump administration to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight.

One wrinkle in the case is that the Supreme Court order, which came after the Trump administration appealed the lower court directive, was handed down by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Her brief order came after the Massachusetts-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit opted not to swiftly intervene in the case.

Jackson, who is tasked with handling emergency issues from the 1st Circuit, wrote that her administrative stay in the case will end 48 hours after the appeals court issues a ruling in the case.

The justice's order came after states across the U.S. had already begun distributing SNAP benefits after a district court judge directed the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in funds by Friday.

“Some people woke up Friday with the money already on the debit-like EBT cards they use to buy groceries,” NPR reported.

Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University, wrote Friday that “it may surprise folks that Justice Jackson, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the court's behavior on emergency applications from the Trump administration, acquiesced in even a temporary pause of the district court's ruling in this case.”

He continued:

But as I read the order, which says a lot more than a typical “administrative stay” from the Court, Jackson was stuck between a rock and a hard place—given the incredibly compressed timing that was created by the circumstances of the case.

In a world in which Justice Jackson either knew or suspected that at least five of the justices would grant temporary relief to the Trump administration if she didn't, the way she structured the stay means that she was able to try to control the timing of the Supreme Court's (forthcoming) review—and to create pressure for it to happen faster than it otherwise might have. In other words, it's a compromise—one with which not everyone will agree, but which strikes me as eminently defensible under these unique (and, let's be clear, maddening and entirely f-ing avoidable) circumstances.

The Trump administration has fought tooth and nail to flout its legal obligation to distribute SNAP funds during the shutdown as low-income Americans grow increasingly desperate and food bank demand skyrockets.

“This is insane,” U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote after the administration appealed to the Supreme Court. “Trump is jumping through hoops to block SNAP. Follow the law, fund SNAP, and feed American families.”

Maura Healey, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts — one of the states that quickly moved to process SNAP benefits following the district court order — said in a statement that “Trump should never have put the American people in this position.”

“Families shouldn't have had to go hungry because their president chose to put politics over their lives,” said Healey.

Feeding America, a nonprofit network of hundreds of food banks across the US, said Friday that food banks bought nearly 325% more food through the organization's grocery purchase program during the week of October 27 than they did at the same time last year.

Donations to food banks, which were underresourced even prior to the shutdown, have also skyrocketed. The head of a Houston food bank said the organization is in “disaster response mode.”

“Across the country, communities are feeling the real, human impact the shutdown is having on their neighbors and communities,” said Linda Nageotte, president and chief operating officer at Feeding America. “Families, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities are showing strength through the hardship, and their communities are standing beside them—giving their time and money, and advocating so no one faces hunger alone.”

            President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed his role in a pretty grim 2025 election for Republicans.
    


            “I watched that election, which I was not much involved in,” Trump said in the Oval Office alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
    


            “I didn't support Virginia, the [gubernatorial] candidate. I didn't do a lot of support for the other candidate [in New Jersey]. They asked me about [New York City mayoral candidate Andrew] Cuomo, and I said, well, it's a question – do you want a thug or do you want a communist?
    


            “So I wasn't involved in that stuff too much.”
    


            But however you want to characterize Trump's role in Tuesday's off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey, there is no question they were about him.
    


            In fact, the results appear to have been more of a direct rebuke to Trump than any previous election that didn't actually feature him on the ballot.
    


Takeaways from Tuesday's elections: Democrats win across the spectrum as voters reject Trump



            Perhaps one of the biggest lessons of this week is that the anti-Trump vote appears stronger than ever. And, as notably, the pro-Trump vote appears as weak as ever.
    


            Even before the election, this was perhaps my biggest takeaway from the CNN poll released Monday.
    


            It showed 41% of registered voters said that if they were voting for Congress today, their vote would be meant to show opposition to Trump. Meanwhile, just 21% said their vote would be meant to show support for Trump.
    


            So about twice as many anti-Trump votes as pro-Trump ones.
    


            That's not normal. While unpopular presidents are not exactly uncommon these days, that was actually the biggest such gap in CNN polling in nearly 20 years.
    


            The last time twice as many voters viewed their vote in a non-presidential election as opposing rather than supporting the president was in 2006. At the time, 36% of registered voters viewed their vote as against George W. Bush, while just 15% viewed it as pro-Bush. (Republicans got shellacked in that election.)
    


            The numbers weren't quite as pronounced ahead of Trump's first midterm election, in 2018, when 38% of voters described their votes as anti-Trump, versus 25% who were pro-Trump.
    


            Okay, that's national polling. So, did this show up on Tuesday in the election? It sure did.
    


            While we didn't have a nationwide election, the exit-poll data we do have from the key states suggests the anti-Trump vote was stronger than before.
    


            The gap between anti-Trump votes and pro-Trump votes in Virginia went from 17 points in 2017 (34%-17%) to 22 points on Tuesday (38%-16%).
    


            It grew even more in New Jersey, going from 17 points in 2017 (28%-11%) to 28 points this time (41%-13%).
    


            And 2017 was the worst-polling year of Trump's first term.
    


            The gaps between anti- and pro-Trump votes in these states were also significantly larger than they were nationally in either the 2018 or 2022 midterms, when both measured at 12 points. (Trump was out of office in 2022, of course, but he still loomed large in American politics.)
    


            That's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, given Virginia and New Jersey lean modestly to the left. (Trump lost both states in 2024 by 6 points.) But it's not like these are deep-blue states, either.
    


            And New Jersey is a state Trump and his allies have tried to pitch as a swing state in the making. Yet there were three times as many anti-Trump voters there Tuesday as pro-Trump ones.
    


Takeaways from Tuesday's elections: Democrats win across the spectrum as voters reject Trump



            All of which suggests a couple things.
    


            The first is that the massive size of the “No Kings” rallies was no fluke. The anti-Trump movement appears as strong, motivated and robust as ever. Its adherents might not be keen on the Democratic Party these days, but that doesn't mean they aren't engaged and even prepared to vote.
    


            The second point hasn't gotten as much attention. And that's that, for all of Trump's huge power grabs and his political domination of the Republican Party, his base actually doesn't seem terribly enthused right now.
    


            Just 1 in 5 registered voters said in the CNN poll ahead of the election that their vote would be intended to support Trump. It was even less than that in New Jersey and Virginia on Election Day, according to CNN's exit polls
    


            These are not the numbers of an all-powerful, domineering force whose actions are beloved by half the country and who can marshal voters to the polls when he decides to get more involved.
    


            And it suggests there's something to the data we're seeing where Trump's base isn't exactly gung-ho about some of his policies. I wrote about this back in July – the idea that there was something of a “malaise” setting in on the right. It looks like that's a real electoral problem for Trump and the GOP now.
    


            Whatever the case, these numbers are worth paying close attention to moving forward.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Watch CNN Original Series “Tony Shalhoub Breaking Bread” for a mouthwatering journey around the world, with bread serving as the conduit into a variety of cuisines and cultures. The series airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CNN.



            When the baguette received official UNESCO heritage status in Paris in 2022, the French delegation waved slender loaves of crusty bread triumphantly in the air, in a photo op that went viral around the world.
    


            French president Emmanuel Macron hailed the baguette as “250 grams of magic and perfection in our daily lives” on social media, accompanied by an iconic vintage black-and-white Willy Ronis photo of a jubilant little French boy captured mid-run with a long baguette tucked under his tiny arm.
    


            But the UNESCO victory, which saw the artisanal know-how of French breadmaking and the culture of the baguette inscribed in its intangible cultural heritage list, appears to have done little to reverse the ongoing decline of bread consumption in France, generating headlines like, “Will bread disappear from French tables?” in French food media.
    


            Historically, the French ate an average of 25 ounces of bread per person, per day in the years following World War II. According to the Federation of Bakery Entrepreneurs, by 2015 that number plummeted to 4 ounces. Today, that figure has dropped again to 3.5 ounces, equal to a little less than half a baguette a day.
    


            In a 2023 consumer survey released by the National Confederation of French Bakeries and Pastry Shops (CNBPF), more than a third (36%) of the 1,000 respondents also said they had reduced their bread consumption over the last five years.
    


            Industry experts say it's a trend driven by changing eating habits, along with a new generation of “neobakers,” some of whom are opting to take baguettes off their shelves entirely, and the growing popularity of the baguette's American rival, processed sliced white bread.
    


            “One of the threats is the fact that young people are losing the habit of buying a baguette every day,” says Dominique Anract, president of the CNBPF.
    


            Daily baguette runs to the local bakery – an errand that Anract says used to be as automatic and ritualistic as brushing teeth – have become less frequent.
    


            But this is especially true of younger generations, who are cooking less and eating out more.
    


            “In the past, even students cooked for themselves. There was no snacking, no ‘world food,' no burgers, kebabs or sushi. But more and more young people are turning towards fast food,” he says.
    


50 of the world's best breads



            Traditionally, baguettes are eaten as open-faced tartines at breakfast, slathered with butter and jam, or chocolate hazelnut spread. At lunch, they're stuffed with ham, tuna, chicken or cheese for a take-out baguette sandwich. And at dinner, they're the indispensable accompaniment to a traditional saucy French meal like a blanquette de veau (veal stew) or beef bourguignon, in which hunks of bread are used to mop up any remaining sauce on the plate – a gesture that has its own verb, called “saucer.”
    


            “We see that these young people are very happy to have the traditional baguette on weekends when they visit their parents, so it is appreciated. But life has become more modern and there are different options for eating out without bread,” Anract says.
    


            In recent years, there's been another noteworthy shift that is changing France's relationship to bread: the rise of “neoboulangeries” or neo-bakeries. This new generation is baking with ancient grains and organic flour, selling aromatic, long-fermented sourdough loaves and making fewer baguettes – if any at all.
    


Seize Heures Trente Pâtisserie-Boulangerie in Rennes is one of several bakeries across France that have made headlines this year for having the audacity not to sell baguettes.
    


            When pastry chef and owner Marion Juhel expanded her pastry shop into a bakery two years ago, she made the deliberate decision not to offer baguettes. For Juhel, it's an energy-intensive product with little nutritional value, and has a short shelf life which leads to one of her biggest pet peeves: excessive food waste.
    


            Instead, large sourdough breads and whole grain loaves made with local, organic flour are sold by weight. Along with staying fresher for longer, the breads, which weigh up to 7 pounds, feed more households, are better for digestion thanks to longer fermentation times that break down gluten, and just taste better, she added.
    


            But for some, the idea of a baguette-free French bakery was hard to swallow. Juhel recalls one man who flew into a rage when he was told they didn't make any. She had to ask him to leave.
    


            “There was a real need to educate customers so that they understood our approach,” Juhel told CNN. “It's true that French people expect a bakery to have baguettes. And the fact that we proclaimed to be a bakery and didn't have them was inconceivable to them.”
    


            Another entrepreneur who shares Juhel's ethos is artisan pâtissier and boulanger Benoît Castel, who has been described as one of the pioneers of the modern bread movement when he made rustic sourdough loaves his signature product in 2012.
    


            Instead of baguettes, it's his caramelized, aromatic pain du coin – a play on words that means both local bread and quince bread, after the fruit-based sourdough starter the bread is made from – that is the big seller at his three Paris bakeries.
    


            “Right from the start I wanted to make these large loaves, which are more traditional, like they used to be made in the past,” Castel says.
    


            Because as Castel notes, baguettes only emerged in the 20th century as an alternative to traditional loaves that were made once a week. Unlike the time and labor-intensive pains de garde (which translates as “bread that keeps”), baguettes with their shorter baking times became popular among the Parisian bourgeoisie, who quickly developed a taste for fresh-baked white bread every day.
    


            But while pains de garde can be eaten all week long, baguettes go stale quickly, leading to significant waste in French households.
    


            To redress this at his own bakery, Castel created his pain d'hier et de demain (the bread of yesterday and tomorrow), made from stale, unsold inventory. Apart from a deeper, toastier-colored crumb, the zero-waste bread tastes virtually indistinguishable from freshly-baked loaves.
    


            For Castel, the popularity of gut-friendly, organic sourdoughs and zero-waste bakeries is a reflection of an exciting time: while the French may be eating less bread, they're eating better, he says.
    


            “I think we've never eaten such good bread as we are right now. We eat very good bread today in Paris.”
    


            But baker Éric Kayser, who built a mini empire of 370 bakeries around the world on the strength of his signature tradition baguette made with liquid sourdough starter, makes an interesting point about specialty breads that are taking the capital by storm.
    


            “The problem is that that bread is much more expensive. It's not affordable for everyone,” he says.
    


            For context, a simple baguette, which can be made with additives and baked from frozen, is around a euro. The upper-tier artisan tradition baguette — which by law can only be made fresh with flour, water, salt and leavening, be it yeast, sourdough starter, or a combination of both — is about €1.30. By contrast, a 500-gram chunk of specialty bread, which is often sold by weight, can sell for up to €7.
    


            “The purpose of a baguette is to feed a lot of people. Those are more elitist bakeries. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just that it corresponds to a certain type of middle-class customer,” Kayser says.
    


            Despite declining bread consumption, Kayser says he has no worries about its demise. Even when the results of another consumer poll by the Federation of Bakery Entrepreneurs found that 86% of French people admit to eating industrial, sliced white supermarket bread.
    


            “Some older people like it because it's easier on the teeth, and then there are young people who buy a loaf of bread, put it in the fridge where it will keep for a whole week and live a bit like Americans. It's practical,” Anract acknowledges.
    


            Still, Kayser scoffs at the idea that the baguette is in any real danger.
    


            “Never in a million years. People love it.”
    


            Kayser points out that the baguette sandwich, which is a relatively recent product that only started taking off in late '90s and early aughts, has picked up where single baguette sales have dropped off.
    


            In fact, Kayser is so confident in his star product that last year he opened a concept store and “baguette bar” simply called baguett. in Paris with co-founder Deborah Magnan. Along with three-foot-long sandwiches, loaves of fuschia-pink baguettes dyed with beets and studded with cranberries, or surprisingly green pistachio and white chocolate loaves are displayed in shop windows.
    


            “It's a simple idea, but our French customers say, ‘Why has no one ever done this before?'” Magnan says.
    


            For Anract, neobakeries and creative bakers like Muhel, Castel and Kayser are what have always propelled France's breadmaking culture forward.
    


            “We have to adapt. Bakeries have always gone through crises but we've always reinvented ourselves.”

            This week in travel: a secret garden is a secret no longer in Beijing, one of France's classic pastries is the subject of a surprising debate, and why some couples are ditching each other at the airport.
    


            He likes arriving four hours early for a domestic flight and then chilling in the lounge. She prefers to have a pre-flight cocktail and browse the duty free options. What's a couple to do? Welcome to “the airport divorce.”
    


            British travel journalist Huw Oliver coined the phrase to explain how he and his fiancee go through airport security together, split up for different airport activities (having a beer, trying out perfumes, obsessively watching the departures screen), and then reunite on board the plane.
    


            Some people might just call this “compromising,” but Oliver says the airport divorce has done wonders for his relationship — and it sets the tone for a happy vacation.
    


            Many travelers love being able to say they're among the first to go somewhere. Now, visitors to Beijing's Forbidden City complex can access Qianlong, a secret garden that has been closed for a century.
    


            Timed for the 100th anniversary of the Palace Museum's opening, the Chinese attraction features rockeries, symbolic figurines believed to ward off fire and destruction, and a discreet entrance that gives you a sense of what it felt like to be the Emperor sneaking into his personal green space.
    


            2025 has been a surprisingly big year for opening up formerly secret places, both above and under ground.
    


            The Comodus Tunnel, a secret passageway used by Roman emperors to access the Colosseum, just opened to the public this fall.
    


            And in London, a mile-long tunnel complex used during World War II is being converted into an underground attraction, which will house a museum, an arts center, and — best of all — the world's lowest licensed bar. CNN got an exclusive look inside.
    


            A Japanese hotel group has launched a program to accommodate guests' plus-ones. No, they don't mean babies. Or pets. They're talking about stuffed toys of your favorite characters.
    


            The Toyoko Inn chain has launched a “Sleepover With Your Plushie” program in 56 hotels across Japan, saying it wants to capitalize on the social media fad of taking plush toys and dolls (that means you, Labubu) and posting photos of them on vacation.
    


            “We noticed that some guests were using the bedside area like a stage, arranging their plushies and other “oshi” (fan) items to take creative photos,” a rep for Toyoko said in a statement.
    


            Under this program, plushies will get beds, PJs, pillows and comforters, all made of the same materials as the human versions — and it only costs an extra $2 per night. This really gives “plush hotel” a whole new meaning.
    


            Yes, it looks like a pain au chocolat, but don't call it that in Bordeaux or you may find yourself in a shouting match.
    


            Most of France calls the beloved pastry pain au chocolat, but in the Bordeaux region they call it a chocolatine. Meanwhile, you'll need to order a “couque au chocolat” in the Ardennes, a “petit pain au chocolat” in Hauts-de-France, and – possible sacrilege? – a “croissant au chocolat” in Grand Est.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The Trump-MAHA-Stanford nexus of US health policy","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/stanford-maha-trump-rfk-bhattacharya-huberman","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 11:00:03 GMT","


            In early 2022, Stanford medical student Santiago Sanchez set out to organize a campus debate with Jay Bhattacharya — a professor at the university whose outspoken denunciations of pandemic lockdowns made him a right-wing icon and a lightning rod both inside and outside the school.
    


            But when Sanchez pitched the idea to Stanford faculty, the response was tepid. University academics he approached warned that debating Bhattacharya would elevate his views rather than challenge him. The prevailing sentiment, Sanchez said, was that Bhattacharya's 15 minutes would eventually subside along with the coronavirus.
    


            Three years later, Bhattacharya's once-marginal platform has ascended to the top of American public health policy. He now leads the National Institutes of Health, overseeing an overhaul of nearly $40 billion in federal research grants — including money once destined for Stanford.
    


            Bhattacharya's rise is part of a broader Stanford imprint on the Trump administration's health agenda. From inside and outside the government, the prestigious West Coast school's alums are now helping to shape seismic reorientation of public health — one that has alarmed many in the medical establishment.
    


            In all, more than a dozen people with Stanford ties have become prominent figures in the Make America Healthy Again movement, galvanizing health-conscious Americans who feel more harmed than helped by modern medicine.
    


            “It's not a coincidence that a lot of the people questioning the existing establishment came from Stanford,” said Calley Means, a Stanford alumnus and health entrepreneur who has advised Trump. “There's a culture of questioning existing assumptions.”
    


            At Stanford, MAHA's ties   have been cause for both celebration and unease.
    


            In official statements, the university congratulated Bhattacharya's appointment and said it was “proud” Trump selected one of its alumnae, best-selling wellness author Casey Means, for Surgeon General. (Casey and Calley Means are siblings.)
    


            Among rank-and-file faculty and students, though, there is dismay over the growing relationship between Stanford and a government that questions vaccine safety, promotes fringe theories about autism and pushes unproven treatments.
    


            Philip Pizzo, who spent a decade as dean of the Stanford School of Medicine, told CNN that the blurring of lines between academic research and partisan politics had become “problematic,” and makes it difficult for the public to know who to trust.
    


            “Obviously, this becomes much more complicated when extreme polarization abounds,” he added.



            In a statement to CNN, the Stanford School of Medicine said it “recognizes the vital role of public service in advancing our nation's health and well-being.”
    


            “Our academic community brings a breadth of expertise and perspectives to this work, with a long record of contributing to our nation's government and civic discourse – including service across multiple U.S. administrations,” the statement said.
    


            Long prized as a cradle of scientific innovation and Silicon Valley entrepreneurship, the school has served as a breeding ground for contrarian thinkers who have questioned orthodoxy on the road to innovation. Its alumni include modern tech titans like Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Netflix's Reed Hastings and Intel's Pat Gelsinger as well as the founders of iconic American companies like Hewlett Packard and Charles Schwab.
    


            “The culture at Stanford was always receptive to thinking out of the box, for taking new directions, for being willing to fail, and for seeking new ways to think about issues,” said Pizzo, who found the spirit of Palo Alto “striking” when he arrived in 2021 compared to the hierarchical Ivy League schools he left behind.
    


            Few would mistake the Bay-area school as a hotbed of Republican politics, but a conservative streak has long run through it. The Hoover Institution, a GOP-aligned policy think tank currently led by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, sits at its heart. Silicon Valley's libertarian currents are reflected in the Stanford Review, a right-of-center student paper founded by tech billionaire Peter Thiel when he was a student there nearly four decades ago.
    


            The pandemic, though, exposed a deeper rift on campus. Scott Atlas, a longtime Stanford faculty member, emerged as an architect of President Donald Trump's more contentious coronavirus moves. Atlas criticized mask mandates, shutdown measures and school closures and advocated for allowing the deadly virus to spread through healthier populations to build “herd immunity.”
    


            In response, the faculty senate censured him, and a group of 98 Stanford physicians and scientists published an open letter rebuking what they called Atlas' “falsehoods and misrepresentations in science.”
    


            But Atlas also had support on campus. As the pandemic continued in late 2020, Bhattacharya co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, an open letter opposing certain Covid-19 mitigations that drew considerable scrutiny from other doctors and scientists. Yet Stanford had more signees than any other college.
    


            Voices inside and outside Stanford have accused the school of failing to challenge contrarian — some argue dangerous — public health opinions amplified by those with Stanford on their resumes
    


            “You have some bad actors that act unaccountably, and people are asleep at the wheel, and now they run the country,” said Sanchez, who remains a medical student.
    


            At times, the statements from Atlas and Bhattacharya contradicted research coming from the school's other scientists and students, said Mallory Harris, who has studied the proliferation of vaccine skepticism and received a doctorate degree in Biology at Stanford. Harris called it “extremely demoralizing” that the university didn't more vocally support that work.
    


            “It was always kind of framed as, ‘the university can't weigh in because then we would be taking a side and we need to let this to be a scientific debate,'” said Harris, now at the University of Maryland. “But a lot of the time the attacks weren't scientific.”
    


            Renée DiResta, a former researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said she experienced this firsthand. The Observatory was a center that tracked abuses online, but DiResta's work became subjected to accusations from Bhattacharya and others that she was helping the government censor conservatives. Bhattacharya took his complaints about censorship all the way to the US Supreme Court and lost. But DiResta said she was still discouraged by the university from responding to his attacks.
    


            “I'm supposed to just allow my colleague two buildings down to defame us on Fox News?” she asked.
    


            Atlas declined to be interviewed for this story. A spokesperson for the NIH said Bhattacharya was not available to speak to CNN due to the government shutdown.
    


            In mid-2024, Stanford dismantled the Internet Observatory. A few months later, the school hosted a pandemic summit arranged by Bhattacharya to relitigate the public health steps taking during the pandemic. The event, which featured many outspoken opponents of Covid mitigation strategies, drew sharp condemnation – but not from the university's administration.
    


            Addressing the conference, newly installed Stanford president Jonathan Levin spoke out against the critics and offered a glimpse into his approach for navigating the divisions emerging from his campus.
    


            “In today's world, we absolutely need to ask and expect our students to be able to engage with, listen to, and debate with people with whom they disagree,” Levin said. “My view is that we need to err on the side of talking to one another.”
    


            Calley Means said it's fitting that Stanford is well-represented in an increasingly powerful wave of anti-establishment voices.
    


            “The country is having a necessary, messy conversation about how our elite institutions have led us into the wrong direction,” Calley Means said, “and Stanford is both an elite institution and an institution that preaches independent thinking and iconoclastic thinking.”
    


            Besides Bhattacharya and the Means siblings, the Palo Alto-to-Washington pipeline also includes Arman Sharma, a former Stanford researcher who once co-authored a textbook with Bhattacharya, and now advises the Department of Health and Human Services. Bruce Patterson, the former director of virology at Stanford, recently appeared at a White House roundtable on long Covid alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the driving force of Trump's MAHA makeover. And George Tidmarsh, a Stanford professor, was overseeing drug reviews at the Food and Drug Administration before abruptly resigning his post this month.
    


            The school's influence on public health extends to outside the administration. Atlas and another long-time Stanford faculty member, John Ioannidis, now sit on the editorial board of a new alternative health journal Bhattacharya launched in February.
    


            Some of the country's leading vaccine skeptics are connected to Stanford as well, including Kennedy's former running mate Nicole Shanahan; Simone Gold, the founder of the fringe medical group America's Frontline Doctors; and Mary Talley Bowden, a sleep doctor who launched Americans for Health Freedom to lobby against coronavirus vaccines.
    


            And then there's neuroscientist Andrew Huberman, a tenured professor whose wellness podcast “Huberman Lab” has made him one of Stanford's most recognizable figures. His audience spans the ideological spectrum, as do his guests (he has interviewed both Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general under President Joe Biden, and Casey Means before she was Trump's pick for the same job). But he has gained a particularly devoted following within the so-called red-pilled manosphere, the online world of bro influencers and their followers who proved key to Trump's victory last fall.
    


            Huberman has appeared on shows popular within this demographic, like the Joe Rogan Experience and comedian Theo Von's This Past Weekend. He told CNN he could not make time for an interview.
    


            Stanford hasn't necessarily benefited from its growing clout. The university was among many hit by mass federal funding cuts this spring to medical research seen as promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, with at least 16 grants terminated. Dozens of Stanford researchers applied this summer for NIH funding to study the causes of autism, but the school was not among the 10 universities selected for the funding.
    


            This year, university leadership announced a $140 million funding cut, citing “significant budget consequences from federal policy changes” including scaled-back research funding. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bhattacharya, at times a critic of his former employer and erstwhile colleagues, considered linking NIH funding to free-speech scores, where Stanford ranks near the bottom.
    


            On campus, challenging ideas favored by the surging contrarian wing of Stanford thinkers is now seen as dangerous – a seeming reversal of a situation conservatives once loudly complained about.
    


            “There's a real cost to being outspoken in the current environment,” said Jake Scott, a physician and infectious disease specialist at Stanford Medicine.
    


            Scott once questioned certain Covid policies such as lengthy lockdowns (Bhattacharya once followed him on X; he no longer does). But he has also received hate mail and death threats for defending vaccines amid MAHA's rise.
    


            “Many of my colleagues have concerns about backlash and about being misrepresented. I certainly have concerns about the professional risks of taking public positions, especially these days,” he said. That's led to hesitation among faculty to disagree publicly with major MAHA voices, he said.
    


            Others have welcomed the debate. Huberman credited Bhattacharya for playing “an essential role in shining a light on certain aspects of public health” during a four-hour interview with the new NIH director on his show.
    


            “Love or hate MAHA,” he wrote on social media in February, “all Americans are far more proactive in thinking about what they will and won't do for their own health than ever before.”

            The impacts of the longest federal government shutdown in United States history are reverberating around the country — leaving millions of Americans in limbo and igniting concerns about an economic downturn.
    


            Frustrated travelers were scrambling as more than a thousand flights were canceled Friday and thousands more were delayed. Those who count on food stamps were in limbo as President Donald Trump's administration continued fighting in federal court to resist paying full benefits for November. Federal workers who haven't been paid in weeks said their bills were due and they were running out of options.
    


            With Congress in a stalemate — majority Republicans still short of the 60 votes they need to pass a government funding measure in the Senate, and minority Democrats sticking to their health insurance funding demands — no end to the shutdown is in sight.
    


Is the federal government shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it



            Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Friday that the “wheels came off” in compromise talks with Democrats. He told senators to remain in Washington and available for votes this weekend. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would agree to end the shutdown in exchange for one more year of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — an attempt to further pressure the GOP to make a deal.
    


            The uncertainty over when the shutdown might end has led to deepening concerns about damage it could do to the overall economy — with one of Trump's top economic officials sounding the alarm on Friday. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that the economic impact of the shutdown is “far worse” than initially expected “because it's gone on for so long.”
    


            “If we go another month or so, then who knows how bad the economy could be this quarter,” he said.
    


            A 4% reduction in domestic flights ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration took effect Friday, leading to more than a thousand canceled flights across 40 major airports — with further cuts slated for the weekend due to air traffic controller staffing issues.
    


            In addition to the cancellations, major airports — including those in Washington, Atlanta, San Francisco and Newark — were experiencing major delays due to short-staffed control towers.
    


            Travelers across the country told CNN they feared their plans being upended.
    


            Alicia Leva was set to get married Saturday in South Florida. But with more than half of her guests attending from across the country, Leva said she saw travel plans unraveling fast.
    


            “When I found out about the flight delays, I was just incredibly anxious,” she said. Leva didn't want to compare her wedding woes to others who have been deeply affected by the government shutdown, but was still mourning her original vision of the couple's special day.
    


            Traveler Jay Curley had hoped to fly to Wilmington, North Carolina, from Newark International Airport on Thursday night, but was instead going to rent a car, he told CNN in frustration Friday morning.
    


            “People are really hurting out here,” he said. Addressing federal lawmakers, he added: “It's not just the traveling public, but it's affecting the whole economy, and you people are to blame.”
    


            When Luana Griffin's mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer this past week, she booked a flight to go spend a few days with her. Griffin's trip, from San Diego to Sacramento, is planned for next week, she told CNN. Griffin said she has limited windows of time to be able to see her mom because she is working a contract job. Any delay or cancellation of her return flight could cause her to miss work the next day, she said.
    


            “I have very limited time left with my mom and so many other decisions, this is the last thing I need,” she told CNN in an email.
    


            A federal judge on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration needed to fully pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 40 million Americans this month, rather than the partial payments the administration had proposed.
    


            “The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened and needless suffering will occur. That's what irreparable harm here means. Last weekend, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation's history. This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided,” US District Judge John McConnell said during Thursday's hearing in Rhode Island.
    


            The US Department of Agriculture then announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and that the process should be completed later in the day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in the coming days.
    


            But later Friday, the Supreme Court temporarily paused the lower court order requiring full payment of benefits, injecting more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.
    


            Zacherie Martin, 35, of Bremerton, Washington, said he and his girlfriend are out of work and rely on food stamps in part because they can never predict whether local food banks will have food available.
    


            He said he's been following news about the government shutdown “very closely,” and is struggling to plan, given the uncertainty around whether and what amount of SNAP benefits he'll receive.
    


            “I'm worried if I'm going to even be able to eat at all before Thanksgiving — or at all tomorrow night, or tonight, even,” Martin said.
    

Onita Norris is trying to figure out a problem that has no good answer. She keeps running the numbers to see how much money she has to feed her two children, both under five, and how much she'll have to go without. CNN's Rene Marsh reports.


            Laura Bowles, a pregnant mother of five children, ages 4 to 13, in West Virginia, is trying to make her husband's paycheck from Walmart stretch to feed their family and pay the bills this month. She told CNN earlier this week that her growing family has already made some tough choices this month after their SNAP benefits didn't replenish on the first.
    


            “My kids eat a lot. And groceries are already so expensive these days. It was already hard,” Bowles said. “It's a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn't part of the plan — but it was God's plan. I guess people struggle everywhere, but it's hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here. And this just made things go from bad to worse. Way worse.”
    


            Cuts or delays in SNAP benefits could also hurt the stores that sell to its recipients — particularly smaller grocers.
    


            SNAP accounted for $124 billion in sales at 262,000 retailers in 2023 — half of which were at superstores such as Walmart. A quarter of sales went to supermarkets.
    


            Large chains such as Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General can absorb cuts to SNAP. It's the small, independent grocers that depend on SNAP for up to half of their sales to sustain razor-thin profit margins that are most vulnerable to cuts, economists and grocers say.
    


            Progressive think tank Center for American Progress in May identified 27,000 retailers — mostly in rural areas with large shares of SNAP recipients — likeliest to shoulder the brunt of cuts to SNAP. In dozens of small counties and tribal areas, more than 30% or 40% of the population receives SNAP benefits.
    


            Though many of them have remained on the job, most federal workers haven't been paid during the shutdown. Some of them told CNN that bills are now piling up.
    


            Lisa Morales, a nurse who works at a military base in El Paso, Texas, said she was able to make rent for October and November, but can't go any further without pay. She said she's not sure how she's going to afford her car and insurance payments, gas, groceries, dog food and utilities this month without a paycheck. She said her landlord won't work with her, and she doesn't know where she'll live if the shutdown doesn't end soon.
    


            “We are not eligible for unemployment, because we are still reporting to work, so that disqualifies us for benefits,” she said. “I will have to look for another job this month if the government continues to be shutdown.”
    


            At a recent job fair in McLean, Virginia, hosted by RockITGov, furloughed federal workers offered sobering accounts of what they face. They asked not to be named in order to speak candidly.
    


            “I haven't gotten a paycheck. I'm trying to find a way to support my family. I have a young family,” one federal worker said. “We're trying to figure out next steps, what our finances look like.”
    


            A nine-year Pentagon employee who took the deferred resignation offer in May said she was supposed to be paid through December, but hasn't received a paycheck since early October because of the shutdown. She said she's planning to skip holiday travel and gift-giving.
    


            “I'm concerned about my car payments. I'll probably call the bank and see if I can skip a car payment,” she said. “I may have to take money from my retirement if my savings run out.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — UPS and FedEx said they are grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 planes “out of an abundance of caution” following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Kentucky.

The crash Tuesday at UPS Worldport in Louisville killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu.

MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.

“We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,” a UPS statement said late Friday. “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.”

FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts “a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.”

Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, said in a statement on its website that it “recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed.”

Western Global Airlines is the only other U.S. cargo airline that flies MD-11s, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. The airline has 16 MD-11s in its fleet but 12 of them have already been put in storage. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside of business hours early Saturday.

Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000.

The UPS cargo plane, built in 1991, was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said earlier Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball.




The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.

Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.

Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.

“It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,” Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. “They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. … They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.”

Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles.

Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.

The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.

UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.

The Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza said the 15 bodies were brought there. The return came shortly after Israel confirmed the remains given back Friday night were of an Israeli man who died while fighting Hamas in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that started the war.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war so far, Gaza health officials said Saturday, as both sides completed the latest exchange of bodies under the terms of the tenuous ceasefire.

The latest jump in deaths occurred as more bodies are recovered from the rubble in the devastated Gaza Strip since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, and as previously unidentified bodies are identified. The toll also includes Palestinians killed by strikes since the truce took hold, which Israel says target remaining militants.

Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, according to hospital officials in the territory, a day after militants returned the remains of a hostage to Israel. He was identified as Lior Rudaeff, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that Rudaeff was born in Argentina.

The exchanges are the central part of the ceasefire's initial phase, which requires that Hamas return all hostage remains as quickly as possible. For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians.

The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. It began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.

Also Saturday, Israeli settlers staged two attacks on Palestinian farmers, paramedics, activists and journalists in the occupied West Bank as settler violence reaches new highs in the territory.




Palestinians on Saturday checked the newly returned remains. Ahmed Dheir, director of forensic medicine at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, said that the remains of 300 people have now been returned, with 89 identified.

“We do not have sufficient resources or the DNA to match them with the martyrs' families,” Dheir said. Unidentified ones will be buried in batches.

Hopeful families looked into the body bags of decomposed remains. “Close it, it's not him,” one family said.

“I always come here. I have not lost hope. I am still waiting for him,” said the mother of a missing boy, who did not give her name.

Gaza's Health Ministry said the number of people killed there since the war began has risen to 69,169. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

The ministry said 284 people were added to the total after their identities were verified between Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.

And over the past three days, 10 bodies were brought to Gaza hospitals — nine retrieved from under the rubble and one newly killed, the ministry said. Since the ceasefire began, 241 people have been killed in Gaza, it said.

It added that a large number of Palestinians remain missing.

Israel's military on Saturday said that soldiers killed two militants who had approached troops, one in northern Gaza and the other in the south.

Palestinian health officials said 11 people were injured in an attack by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including journalists, medics, international activists and farmers, as settler violence reaches new highs during this year's olive harvest.

The U.N. humanitarian office has reported more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians and their property in the West Bank in October than in any other month since the office began keeping track in 2006. There were more than 260 attacks, or an average of eight incidents per day, the office said.

Activists and medics have flocked to this year's olive harvest to help Palestinian farmers safely reach their fields.

A video circulating in Palestinian media showed the inside of a West Bank hospital where the injured — bandaged and bloody — were brought from Saturday's attack on the town of Beita.

Jonathan Pollak, a longtime activist, told The Associated Press that he was picking olives when dozens of masked Israeli settlers, armed with clubs, descended, chasing them and lobbing rocks.

Pollak said he saw five settlers converge on a journalist and her security guard. He watched the settlers beat and bludgeon her, denting her helmet. Pollak was hit in the head with a rock and taken to the hospital.

“It's a pattern we see every day,” Pollak said. “This is just one finger in the iron fist of Israeli policy aiming to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their land.”

There was no immediate Israeli comment.

Rights groups say that arrests for settler violence are rare, and prosecutions even rarer. Israel's left-leaning Haaretz newspaper reported in 2022 that based on statistics from the Israeli police, charges were pressed in only 3.8% of cases of settler violence, with most cases opened and closed without action being taken.

Also Saturday, Palestinian paramedics reported another settler attack in a nearby village, Burin. The Palestinian Red Crescent said settlers injured four international activists and one 57-year-old man.

Israel's military said soldiers responded to a report of rock-throwing at an Israeli vehicle and that Israeli civilians then hurled rocks at harvesters. It said Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured.

If you have upcoming travel plans anytime soon, you might notice fewer options on the airport's departure board. 

Airlines are scaling back flights at dozens of major U.S. airports to ease the pressure on air traffic controllers, who have been working unpaid and under intense strain during the ongoing government shutdown.

The Federal Aviation Administration says the decision is necessary to keep travelers safe. Many controllers have been putting in long hours and mandatory overtime while lawmakers are at a standstill over how to reopen the government.

Major hubs like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are among those affected, and the ripple effects could mean more cancellations, longer delays and fuller flights for travelers across the country. The cutbacks will impact hundreds if not thousands of flights daily.

Here's what to know about the FAA's order — and what you can do if your plans are disrupted:

There's a good chance it is. The list spans more than two dozen states.

It includes the country's busiest airport — Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia — and the main airports in Boston, Denver, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Miami, San Francisco and Salt Lake City.

Multiple airports will be impacted in some metropolitan hubs, including New York, Houston, Chicago and Washington.




It's hard to say. Even if the shutdown ends soon, the FAA has said it would not lift the flight restrictions until staffing at airport towers and regional air traffic centers makes it safe to do so. 

“It's going to take time to work through this,” said Michael Johnson, president of Ensemble Travel, an association of travel agencies in the U.S. and Canada.

That's why, he said, it's important to plan ahead — whether you've already booked flights or you're just starting to make holiday travel plans.

Airlines say they will let their customers know if their flight is called off.

Still, it doesn't hurt to check your airline's app or a flight-tracking site for updates before you leave for the airport. It's better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than stranded in a terminal.

“Take a deep breath. Don't panic,” Johnson said. “There are options available. They may not be ideal, and they may be inconvenient, but you have options.”

If you're already at the airport, it's time to get in line to speak to a customer service representative. While you're waiting, you can call or go online to connect to the airline's reservations staff. It can also help to reach out on the social platform X because airlines might respond quickly there.

Now might also be the time to consider if it makes sense to travel by train, car or bus instead.

Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, said the shutdown is different from when a single airline is having problems and travelers can just pick another carrier.

“The longer the shutdown drags on, it's unlikely that there will be one airline running on time if the rest of the them are failing,” Potter said.

The airlines will be required to issue full refunds, according to the FAA. However, they aren't required to cover extra costs like meals or hotel stays — unless the delay or cancellation was within their control, according to the Department of Transportation.

You can also check the DOT website to see what your airline promises for refunds or other costs if your flight is disrupted.

Not necessarily. You might just need a little more planning and flexibility than usual. 

A travel adviser can help take some stress off your plate, and travel insurance may give you an extra safety net.

Johnson also warned that flights could sell out fast once the shutdown ends.

“There will be a flurry of booking activity,” he said. “So try to get ahead of it and make sure that you're protected.”

Booking an early flight can also help, says Tyler Hosford, security director at risk mitigation company International SOS. If it gets canceled, you still “have the whole day” to sort things out.

Travel light. Limiting baggage to a carry-on means one less airport line to deal with, and if your plans change unexpectedly, you'll already have everything with you.

Give yourself extra time at the airport, especially if you're an anxious flyer or traveling with young children or anyone who needs extra help getting around.

And be nice. Airline agents are likely helping other frustrated travelers, too, and yelling won't make them more willing to help. Remember, the cancellations aren't their fault.

“An extra ounce of kindness to yourself and to others at this time of year, with all of the disruptions, will go a long way,” Johnson said.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Joe Biden slowly but steadily walked onto the stage in Omaha on Friday. As he did, 800 people in the downtown Hilton ballroom rose to their feet cheering. 

“Did you see the results Tuesday?” he asked, igniting another round of cheers as he listed Democratic victories from governorships in New Jersey and Virginia to the mayoral seat in New York to a redistricting decision in California. 

It was a joyful return to the political stage for the former president, whose party's effort to remain in the White House was rejected just over a year ago. Biden called for a political comeback, though not for himself, but to an audience hungry for a fight. 

“You know what it feels like to be outnumbered,” he told Democrats in Nebraska, where Republicans have carried the state in every presidential election since 1968. “But every election, you put up the yard signs and you make your voices heard. The country needs you badly.”

It was the kind of pep talk that sells in a place where Democrats lose statewide but have staged winning races for the Omaha area's 2nd District electoral vote, elected a Democratic mayor for the first time since 2009 and feel energized about capturing the 2nd District seat in 2026. 

Biden heaped on the encouragement, but returned repeatedly to his view of his lone term's high points, curbing COVID-19 and beginning the economic recovery from the epidemic. 




He didn't touch the difficulties he had last year, nor the year of debate Democrats have engaged in over how they lost the presidency to Republican Donald Trump. 

In the summer of 2024, Biden waited more than three weeks from his disastrous debate performance in June with Trump, prompting panic among Democrats, before announcing in July he would not seek another term, and then endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor on the ticket. 

Harris had written in a book published in September that she and others in Biden's orbit should have been more aggressive in encouraging him to consider stepping aside sooner. 

The closest Biden came to acknowledging the difficult decision was an oblique joke. 

“I have the dubious distinction. I'm the youngest ever man elected to the U.S. Senate and I'm the oldest damn president,” he playfully rued. 

Although Biden's delivery was quiet but upbeat, he at times garbled his words and was sometimes so quiet he was inaudible from the amplified podium. Yet he would come charging back with fiery attacks on the Trump administration and calls for action. 

“What we have to do is repair our faults, and that's what we began to do on Tuesday,” he shouted. 

Tuesday's victories, a boon to Democrats across the country, were a timely lift for Biden. 

But he also benefited from an atmosphere of respect. 

Earlier in the program, he remained seated but beamed when the audience stood after Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, also a guest at the fundraiser, hailed him “for a lifetime of service to our country.”

“He was a president who governed not for red states, not for blue states but for the entire United States,” said Beshear. 

Throughout Biden's 30-minute remarks, the audience rose cheering. He returned to well-worn campaign themes promoting the middle class, equality and the nation's responsibility as an example to other nations. 

He called them principles “we've never walked away from.” Straining to punctuate by raising his voice, he said, “We're not going to walk away from them now.” 

It was Biden's second public appearance in the past week, and second since completing a round of radiation therapy treatment in October for the aggressive form of prostate cancer he was diagnosed with after leaving office. He said nothing of his health, and when he mentioned cancer it was not about his own. It was about his late son Beau, who died in 2015. 

It was the first purely political appearance for Biden since Labor Day 2024, when he appeared with Harris for a labor event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a full two months before the Nov. 5, 2024, election. 

If his decision making about the 2024 race were in question in the audience Friday, it seemed a distant memory as he wrapped his speech. 

“Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!” they chatted as he left the stage.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal judge in Oregon ruled Friday that President Donald Trump's administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying the National Guard to Portland after the city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. 

The administration said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump described as “war ravaged” with “fires all over the place.”

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

“The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,” Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.” 

The Trump administration criticized the judge's ruling.

“The facts haven't changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.




“The courts are holding this administration accountable to the truth and the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an e-mailed statement. “From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Today's decision protects that principle.”

Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states' sovereignty.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.

Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The trial Immergut held further developed the factual record in the case, which could serve as the basis for further appellate rulings.

Witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump's National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.” 

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland's ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Trump. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Former colleagues are mourning three pilots killed in a UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville, Kentucky, as relatives of a man who was pulled from the wreckage confirm he's among those who died.

Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond were on board when the crash happened during takeoff Tuesday at UPS Worldport, the company's global aviation hub located at Muhammad Ali International Airport.

At least 11 others died, including Matt Sweets, who suffered widespread burn wounds. Many of the victims still have not been identified.

Todd Inman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the ongoing investigation, has said the plane had been cleared for takeoff when a large fire developed in the left wing and an engine fell off. A recording indicates a repeating bell sounded in the cockpit for 25 seconds as pilots tried to control the aircraft, Inman said Friday.

Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has helped investigators piece together what happened from many different angles. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




From 1994 until 2016, Wartenberg served with the 445th Airlift Wing at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, according to a statement from the wing.

The retired lieutenant colonel and former reservist received his commission through Air Force Officer Training School and throughout his career had qualifications in the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy and the C-17 Globemaster III. He had logged more than 5,000 military flight hours when he retired as a command pilot, the release said.




In 2010, he received the Meritorious Service Medal.

Wartenberg lived in Independence, Kentucky, south of Cincinnati, according to public records.

He also spent more than two decades as a member of the Ohio Valley Region Porsche Club of America, a group of enthusiasts of Porsche vehicles. The club holds events such as autocrosses and high-performance driving education at regional sports car tracks.

Truitt had been a pilot for UPS since 2021, flying the MD-11 airliner, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he was a captain for SkyWest Airlines and a flight instructor at Bode Aviation. He studied Spanish language and literature at the University of New Mexico and graduated in 2006.

John H. Bode, the president and CEO of Bode Aviation, called Truitt “a cherished friend, a trusted colleague, and a model of what it means to be a true professional aviator.” 

Truitt “demonstrated an unwavering commitment to excellence, earning the respect and admiration of everyone he worked alongside,” Bode wrote in a statement. “Through diligence, humility, and an unrelenting pursuit of mastery, Lee rose to serve as a Senior Flight Instructor and Charter Pilot, where his discipline, composure, and integrity became the standard by which others measured themselves. His dedication to his craft was matched only by his generosity of spirit — he continually returned to mentor our students and instructors, guiding the next generation of aviators with patience, wisdom, and care.”

Diamond previously served as commissioner and chief of Bastrop County Emergency Services District No. 1 in Texas. The emergency services agency said in a social media tribute that it was “deeply saddened” by his death.

“He ran towards danger so the rest of us can step back from it and that kind of devotion to his community leaves a mark on everyone it touches,” the agency said. “He leaves behind not only a legacy of service but also the memories with fellow firefighters and the community he served. His contribution to the citizens of Bastrop County Texas are immeasurable.

“May his family find comfort in knowing he served our community to make it a better place and may we honor his memory.”

Diamond lived in Caldwell, Texas, according to public records.

Matt Sweets, who was badly burned in the blaze and hospitalized, died Thursday afternoon, according to a social media post by his sister, Michelle Sweets.

“For now, please keep his girlfriend Brooke and his two young children in your prayers as well as the rest of us,” she wrote.

Carrie Ryan, another sister of Matt Sweets, thanked the “brave man who pulled him from the wreckage and got him to help.” But she said there was nothing anyone could have done to save her brother. She said his children didn't deserve this.

“But we will make sure they grow up knowing their dad was the most loyal, kind, and caring man — and how lucky they are to have you watching over them,” she wrote.

Newly re-elected Minneapolis Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey is facing backlash from conservatives for giving a victory speech in Somali and saying that Minneapolis welcomes Somalians.

In a video of the speech posted online, Frey can be seen leading chants in Somali as the crowd responds and applauds.

Popular conservative influencer Paul Szypula ripped into the progressive mayor, writing, ""The pandering here is insane.""

""Mayor Jacob Frey, as he won reelection, spoke almost a minute in Somalia then said Minneapolis belongs to Somalia,"" said Szypula.

In a second round of nonpartisan ranked-choice voting, Frey narrowly defeated a challenge from socialist Minneapolis state Sen. Omar Fateh. Fateh is the first Somali American and first Muslim to serve in the state senate.

Fateh had the backing of the Twin Cities' chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America and ""Squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents Minneapolis in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Meanwhile, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate last year and is up for re-election next year, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., endorsed Frey's campaign this year.

While speaking with a crowd of Somali residents after his victory, Frey repeatedly thanked the crowd in Somali.

""To the great people of Minneapolis, and I say that very intentionally, because no matter where you are from, Minneapolis should be a place where you are proud to call home,"" he said.

He then proceeded to list off a number of Somalian regions, saying, ""Whether you are from Bosaso or Mogadishu, whether you are from Hargeisa or Garowe, whether you are from Beledweyne or southwest, Minneapolis is a place where you come to seek prosperity, where you come to raise your family.""

""Here is what this election means, this election means this is a moment for unity, where the entire Somali community can come together and say, ‘This is our people, this is our city, we are united behind each other,"" he said.

Conservative pundit Gerry Callahan slammed Frey's speech, saying, ""This is an American politician, raised in America, educated in America, ostensibly representing Americans, prostrating himself in front of bunch of foreigners. Could be the most humiliating thing I've ever seen."" 

Podcaster Matt Walsh also chimed in, writing, ""As I have said many times now, politicians in this country should be required by law to speak English when addressing the public in an official capacity. There should never be a time when Americans can't understand what their elected leaders are saying.""

This is not the first time Frey has garnered criticism over Somali-language political messaging. He was also widely criticized in September for releasing a campaign ad in Somali. 

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, commented on the ad, saying, ""This must be stopped."" 

Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., also reacted to the ad, posting a disapproving gif. 

Kari Lake simply wrote, ""WTAF?"" which is an acronym for ""what the actual f---.""

Having entered office in 2018, Frey was elected to his third term as Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday. He is best known for marching with protesters during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots, which were particularly destructive in Minneapolis, the city in which George Floyd died. Frey was also seen kneeling and weeping by Floyd's casket at a memorial service.

Country star John Rich of the music duo ""Big & Rich"" spoke with Fox News Digital about his endorsement of Jody Barrett in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District.

FIRST ON FOX: A Tennessee Democratic state representative running for Congress, who has been likened to Zohran Mamdani, claims she is running to make life better for the working class, but her voting record tells a different story. 

Tennessee state Rep. Aftyn Behn, D-District 51, who is running to replace outgoing Congressman from Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, Mark Green, voted no last year on a bill that would have resulted in a $400 million tax cut for certain Tennessee small businesses, including potential refunds of up to $1.5 billion. Behn also rallied against Republican's H.R. 1, the so-called ""one, big beautiful bill,"" which extended Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts that, without, could've meant a nearly $4,000 increase for taxpayers in her district. 

Meanwhile, earlier this year, Behn voted against a statewide budget bill that would have added tens-of-millions to the state's rainy day fund, which would have effectively padded the state's coffers so that in times of low-revenue taxes won't need to be increased so much. That same budget bill would have also allocated millions for volunteer fire departments, senior centers, emergency medical services, teacher bonuses and other public safety funding.

TRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER SPECIAL ELECTION PRIMARY IN DEEP-RED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

""A pissed-off social worker, Aftyn has seen firsthand how broken systems fail the very people they're meant to protect,"" Behn's campaign website reads. ""She's now running for Congress after the so-called ‘Big, Beautiful Bill' passed — a giveaway to the wealthy that codified the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in American history.""

However, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation, if Trump's 2017 tax cuts had expired, residents in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, whom Behn wants to represent, would have seen an increase in their taxes of approximately $3,717 per taxpayer.

""To win, Democrats need to focus on what really matters: making life more affordable for working people,"" Behn said after the bill's passage. ""Washington Republicans did the opposite by passing this #BigBullsh--Bill. Gutting healthcare and giving handouts to billionaires.""

TENNESSEE SUED OVER LIMITED ACCESS TO EXECUTIONS AS MEDIA DEMAND TRANSPARENCY 

Even the New York Times has admitted that independent analyses showed Trump's 2017 tax cuts ""have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law.""

Last year, Behn also voted against a bill that the Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee estimated would provide over $1.5 billion in tax refunds for small business owners in the state. It also would have reduced a combined yearly tax burden for Tennessee business owners of about $400 million. 

Simultaneously, Behn voted against Tennessee's 2025-2026 fiscal year budget that included a big increase to the state's rainy day fund, which is used by state governments during periods of low revenue. The same budget bill also included community funding for services like volunteer fire departments, emergency medical services and rescue squads, senior centers, teacher bonuses, school security and more. 

During Behn's time in the state legislature, she also worked to repeal the grocery tax in Tennessee, claiming it would put money back into the pockets of hard-working Tennesseans year-around. However, according to Republicans, the move would create a business enterprise tax, raising taxes on small businesses by about $800 million.

""Aftyn Behn's policies would skyrocket the cost of living even more for hardworking Tennesseans,"" Behn's Republican opponent, Trump-backed Matt Van Epps, said. ""Aftyn has repeatedly voted against tax cuts and proposed new taxes, taking more money from your pocket. I'll always fight to lower taxes and bring down costs so that working families can get ahead.""  

In local media reports, Behn has been compared to New York City mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani and the Dickson County Democratic Party described Behn as ""our very own AOC of TN,"" in a reference to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

""His message is one of helping working families across New York, my message is one of helping working families across Tennessee,"" Behn said about Mamdani during the appearance on CNN. ""We need to go back to pocketbook issues, especially in states like Tennessee where people are living unaffordable lives and suffering as a result of Republican policies.""

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., joins Fox & Friends Weekend to discuss the impact of the ongoing government shutdown. 

President Donald Trump has urged Senate Republicans to abolish Obamacare and reroute federal health care spending directly to individual Americans.

In a Truth Social post Saturday morning, Trump wrote: ""I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over.""

""In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare.""

The post marks Trump's latest push to revive his long-running campaign against the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, a centerpiece of former President Barack Obama's domestic legacy. 

PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LOWERING HEALTHCARE COSTS, BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING IT

Trump and Republicans have renewed their criticism of the program amid the government shutdown, arguing it drives up costs and enriches insurance companies at taxpayers' expense. Trump spent much of his first term trying to repeal the law.

Obama and Democrats argue it made health care more available and affordable for millions of Americans.

Congress remains deadlocked over government funding, with health-care programs and insurer subsidies among the major budget sticking points fueling the shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday told reporters Thursday that he would not commit to holding a vote on extending COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year without congressional action.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had been floating a vote on such an extension in exchange for Democrats voting to end the shutdown.

The issue of enhanced Obamacare subsidies has been a matter of debate within the GOP, with some Republicans in more moderate districts calling for at least a year-long extension to give lawmakers time to create a new healthcare deal in its place.

Trump also once again called on Republicans to end the filibuster, the procedural rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation.

""Unrelated, we must still terminate the Filibuster!"" Trump wrote.

Students at NYU, Baruch College, Columbia and Barnard College sat down with Fox News Digital and revealed the truth about how professors promote biased beliefs on campus.

EXCLUSIVE: A number of students revealed the ""extremist"" viewpoints held by some university professors that ""play a role"" in fostering an antisemitic environment on campus, condoning anti-Israel protests and maintaining a bias message that is ""not exactly something that should be promoted"" at their respective schools.

Jewish students from NYU, Columbia, Barnard College and Baruch College sat down with Fox News Digital during an exclusive interview and exposed the ""disturbing things"" that have been said by professors at some of the top schools in New York City and in the U.S.

""I've had many peers share very disturbing things that professors have said in class, whether it's in courses specifically related to Middle Eastern politics or in classes that should be completely absolved of anything happening in the Middle East,"" TJ Katz of Columbia explained.

""We've had professors yell at students, not support students,"" Mera Skoblo of NYU told Fox.

""Just the presence of these professors on campus, you know, a lot of them on their offices have signs saying things like, hands off our students, and they have free Palestine signs on their doorways,"" Eliana Birman of Barnard explained.

""I had professors that were antisemitic,"" Aidan Herlinger of Baruch told Fox. ""I know students that have had professors that are antisemitic, we are put in positions where we can't do anything about it, because it could cost us our grade.""

""We need to extricate extremists from the classroom, do departmental audits,"" Shoshana Aufzien of Barnard added.

PROMINENT UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR SAYS ANTI-ISRAEL CAMPUS PROTESTS ‘WERE ENCOURAGED FROM IRAN'

Columbia University has been one of the most notorious campuses that has faced anti-Israel riots and demonstrations. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, hundreds of students and non-students have been arrested as a result of riots.

NYU faced similar, though less intense, protests on its NYC campus, including a Dec. 12, 2024, demonstration outside the university's library where protesters called for an ""intifada revolution"" saying that ""Tel Aviv is stolen land.""

Skoblo outlined her fears as a Jewish student on campus, saying that ""a lot of us are scared.""

ANTISEMITIC ‘VENOM' INFECTING CAMPUSES GETS WORSE AS UNIVERSITIES PLAY ‘ROPE-A-DOPE' WITH TRUMP ADMIN: EXPERT

""The past two years on college campuses across New York City have been difficult for Jewish students,"" Skoblo told Fox. ""Some of us hide our identities. We've been screamed at. We've been blocked out of our own library during finals week.""

""How are we supposed to study when we hear chanting that shouts towards our destruction, makes us feel unsafe and unheard,"" Skoblo added.

When asked if faculty influenced or pressured students to adopt a specific stance in the Middle Eastern conflict, Aiden Herlinger from Baruch College said, ""I think the professors definitely play a role.""

While the students explained that antisemitism has existed on college campuses for some time, students noted that the recent rise in tensions and anti-Israel rhetoric that came after Oct. 7, 2023, could be attributable to professors indoctrinating or influencing students to participate in demonstrations, some of which turned violent and led to expulsions, suspensions and arrests.

As for the consequences these professors may face for being accused by their own students of indoctrinating, Herlinger said there will likely be none.

""[Professors are] not going to face any consequences, especially in a school like Baruch that's a public school, and it's funded by the New York State government, and New York City government,"" Herlinger added.

Rep. Thomas Massie — a Republican fiscal hawk facing a President Donald Trump-backed primary challenger in Kentucky — has previously described himself as ""America First,"" but now he says he thinks that he's ""America only."" 

""I am tired of sending money overseas,"" he told Fox News Digital during an interview on Thursday. 

""I am tired of favoring foreign beef over U.S.A.-grown beef,"" he continued. ""I'm ready to be America only. And I think all congressmen should be that way.""

Massie gave Trump a mixed review, saying that the president is America First on ""some"" fronts.

REP THOMAS MASSIE REMARRIES AFTER WIFE'S DEATH LAST YEAR: ‘PLEASE PRAY FOR US'

""But when it comes to the beef, he is not America first. When it comes to sending money overseas to Ukraine and Israel,"" Massie said, ""I think he needs to get back to his campaign promises and put America first. Because we're not gonna make America great again by sending our money overseas.""

Massie noted that his ""biggest disagreement"" with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is the increase in spending.

""I mean, I thought we were conservatives. Why are we spending more this year than Joe Biden spent in his last year? Actually, we're spending about $200 billion dollars more,"" he said, adding that the consequence ""is inflation and higher interest rates.""

""And people are feeling that. You can't gaslight them,"" Massie added. ""You can't tell them that things are getting cheaper when they're not getting cheaper.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House spokesman Kush Desai accused Massie of ""Fake Math.""

""Here are the facts: President Trump's Working Families Tax Cut Act cut mandatory spending by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, and the budget deficit from April to September of this year is down a staggering 40% compared to last year, when Joe Biden was president,"" Desai declared in the statement.

""Instead of Fake Math, Thomas Massie should reflect on how he betrayed his voters and hardworking Americans when he voted with every Democrat against the biggest tax cut for working families in American history, including no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime pay, increased child tax credits, and permanence for the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts,"" he added.

Massie said his other disagreements with what has been happening in D.C. are ""secondary"" to the spending issue.

""I would say, we need to follow through on some of our campaign promises. For instance, release the Epstein files,"" he said.

MAVERICK HOUSE REPUBLICAN IN TRUMP'S CROSSHAIRS TOUTS RECORD CAMPAIGN CASH HAUL

Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have been spearheading a bid to force a House vote on a proposal that would compel the release of materials pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. 

Their discharge petition has amassed 217 of the 218 signatures needed to force the vote, but Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who has said she will sign on, has still not yet been sworn in to office more than six weeks after winning a special election in Arizona.

Johnson ""has tried every which way he can to avoid this vote,"" Massie claimed, asserting that the speaker has not sworn in the Democrat because she ""represents the 218th signature I need to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Johnson's office for comment.

Massie, who owns cattle himself, said the president has ""sort of gut punched the cattle ranchers and… livestock farmers"" in the U.S.

During remarks aboard Air Force One last month, Trump indicated the U.S. was considering buying beef from Argentina to drive down prices. 

Days later Reuters reported that a White House official indicated that the administration was quadrupling the nation's low-tariff imports of beef from the South American nation. Increasing the tariff rate quota to 80,000 metric tons will allow Argentina to send greater quantities of the product to America at a lower rate of duty, according to the outlet.

The president has Massie in his political crosshairs — he has repeatedly reviled the congressman on Truth Social.

In a post on Monday, Trump referred to Massie as ""a Weak and Pathetic RINO"" — a pejorative acronymn that stands for ""Republican in name only."" He also called the congressman ""a totally ineffective LOSER,"" while expressing his support for primary challenger Ed Gallrein, who Trump is backing in the race.

Even as the president tries to convince voters in Kentucky's 4th Congressional District to reject Massie, the lawmaker said that he does not regret endorsing Trump ahead of the 2024 election, noting that former Vice President Kamala Harris would have been a total ""disaster.""

Massie initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential primary, but DeSantis dropped out and backed Trump, and Massie later endorsed the Republican juggernaut as well.

""And I'm glad that President Trump won,"" he said. 

Trump has ""done a lot of good things,"" he said, adding that many of them have been carried out via executive order, and he thinks Congress should vote on more of the issues so that the president's moves are not simply ""temporary actions.""

Asked whether he'd have any interest in potentially running for president himself, Massie said that he is not interested.

Acting I.C.E. Director Todd Lyons discusses President Donald Trump's deportation efforts on 'America Reports.'

Three illegal immigrants in Louisiana allegedly ran a sex trafficking ring and offered a ""menu"" of women to potential clients as young as 18 using WhatsApp, federal prosecutors allege.

Officials said Zaira Lopez-Oliva, Kirsis Castellanos-Kirington and Jesus Lopez, known as ""El Perro,"" were arrested in October after running a sex trafficking ring in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

A source initially tipped off the FBI with screenshots from WhatsApp from El Perro, who sent pictures of scantily clad women who were available for sex acts, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that the women were forced to have sex with men, who paid anywhere from $40 to $60.

Both Castellanos-Kirington and Lopez-Oliva allegedly helped Lopez with several aspects of the sex trafficking operation.

Prosecutors said Lopez-Oliva helped Lopez transport victims to and from the New Orleans Airport. In one surveillance video screenshot shared by the Department of Justice, prosecutors said Lopez-Oliva was seen inside a pickup truck with Lopez near the New Orleans Airport.

Castellanos-Kirington and Lopez-Oliva both helped Lopez ""maintain the operation"" at the two locations in Baton Rouge when he was unable to, the documents state.

The complaint detailed that clients of the sex trafficking ring were anywhere from 18 to 60 years old.

When federal agents raided the house where the operation was based, one of the victims said she was in financial trouble and got Lopez's contact information from a friend, prosecutors said. She was allegedly informed when she arrived in Louisiana that she'd be performing sex acts for male clients. Two of the victims interviewed were also illegal immigrants.

The female victim allegedly told prosecutors that she wouldn't be paid at all on Mondays and Tuesdays, and would only get to keep $20 if a client paid $40, with the rest going to Lopez.

One of the victims also told investigators that she ""was not allowed to leave or tell anyone what she was doing,"" and if she told anyone, Lopez would ""kill her.""

All three suspects are charged with sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion as well as aiding and abetting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Air traffic controllers say FAA's 10% flight cuts won't ease shutdown strain","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3879836/air-traffic-controllers-warn-flight-cuts-wont-ease-strain-risk-government-shutdown/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Air traffic controllers say the Federal Aviation Administration's plan to trim flight schedules by up to 10% during the government shutdown doesn't go nearly far enough to ease the crushing workload inside the nation's control centers, and may do little to address what they describe as a growing safety risk.

The Washington Examiner spoke with three current air traffic controllers and one who recently left the agency. None were authorized to speak publicly, and all requested anonymity out of concern for retaliation. They described a system buckling under chronic staffing shortages, six-day workweeks, and mandatory overtime, now pushed to the brink as controllers report for duty without pay.

The FAA has ordered airlines to scale back flights by up to 10% at 40 of the nation's busiest airports over the next week, a phased reduction that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said was meant to “alleviate building risk” as controllers continue working without pay.

A controller at a major center in the Midwest said that the shutdown has only magnified problems that were already eroding morale and compromising focus.

“Ten percent of flights being canceled throughout the day isn't going to impact us whatsoever,” he said. “The problem isn't the number of flights on paper, it's the number of qualified people in the room.”

He said the FAA's decision to scale back flights is “performative,” arguing that it does little to relieve workload or fatigue inside the facilities where controllers are already stretched to their limits. “We're still working the same amount of traffic with fewer people,” he said. 

Asked whether it remains safe to fly, he paused. 

“Yes, it's still safe,” he said. “Is it as safe as it was a month ago? Unequivocally, no.”

He explained, “Our baseline leading into the shutdown was not healthy.” The system, he said, was already stretched thin after months of mandatory overtime, uneven hiring, and years of pay stagnation that had left morale at an all-time low. Controllers, he added, were still dealing with the fallout from January's midair collision near Reagan National Airport, when staffing shortages and outdated technology were thrust into the spotlight. 

‘WE JUST MAKE IT WORK': STRAINED AIR TRAFFIC CULTURE AT REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT EXPOSED BY NTSB CRASH INQUIRY

After 10 years in the job, he described a schedule that leaves little room to rest. Six-day workweeks are routine from March through November, with most controllers rotating through a “rattler” schedule: two evening shifts, two early morning shifts, and an overnight. When staffing is low, the sixth day is often added on top, forcing them to come in on what should be a rest day, sometimes for any shift the facility needs covered.“It's just not sustainable,” he said. “You finish one shift, go home, maybe see your kids for an hour, try to sleep, and then turn around for a midnight shift.”

When staffing dips, the pressure mounts. “Instead of working an hour and getting a 30-minute break, we're working two or three hours and getting maybe 20 minutes off,” he said. “You can't stay 100% working 20 to 25 aircraft at a time for hours straight and expect to maintain safety.”

That exhaustion, he said, is driving absences as controllers run out of patience and money. “Some people are calling in sick because they're literally going out to drive Uber or pick up side work,” he said. “Others are just burned out. You can only lean on patriotism for so long before reality hits; people have bills to pay.”

Each callout forces others to take on extra shifts. He has logged about 400 hours of overtime this year, which is now typical across many facilities. He said he's fortunate to have savings and a zero-percent credit-union loan while paychecks are frozen. “Even if you're OK financially, it's demoralizing to get a pay stub that shows zeros when you're working overtime,” he said. “For the newer folks, it's not just frustrating, it's survival.”

According to the controller, many newer hires earn between $50,000 and $60,000 per year and have been required to relocate for training or assignments, often to high-cost areas far from home. He said missing even one paycheck can mean missing rent or car payments.

“They absolutely can't afford it,” he said. “This is all anybody talks about. It's taking focus away from the mission.”

FAA data show the number of fully certified controllers has declined over the past decade, even as air traffic volumes have climbed. “It feels like an entire generation is going to spend their careers working short-staffed,” he said. 

Controllers in other regions echoed that frustration, saying the flight reductions may sound significant  but make little difference in practice.

A controller in the Dallas-Fort Worth area called the cuts “a media stunt to make it look like the problem is being fixed, when it's not.” He said even with a 10% reduction, the change barely touches the daily workload for controllers managing some of the nation's busiest airspace.

“A 10% reduction in arrival rates won't make any real difference,” he said. “At most major airports, we already operate below maximum capacity. Taking Dallas-Fort Worth from 130 arrivals an hour to 117, or Charlotte from 87 to 78, doesn't change much.”

He explained that major hubs operate on banked schedules that already run at their maximum limits, meaning the reductions won't ease staffing pressures or prevent delays. “Every day we're dealing with flow programs and reroutes to cover for low-staffed areas, while working with skeleton crews,” he said.

In Minnesota, a controller who recently quit said the shutdown was “the final push” after months of burnout and frustration over pay and staffing. He had spent nearly six years in air traffic control, first in the military, then in the federal system, before walking away just two weeks ago.

“I quit and served my last day of notice,” he said. “It wasn't just because of the shutdown, but that was the tipping point.”

He said the agency was already struggling to keep new hires even before paychecks stopped. “Trainees show up under enormous stress,” he said. “They've moved across the country, they're learning one of the hardest jobs in the world, and now they don't know how they'll pay their bills.”

The shutdown, he said, pushed many over the edge. “We started seeing more people calling out, taking sick leave, or just giving up,” he said. “A lot of controllers are talking about quitting; some like me already have.”

He said his own decision to leave came from exhaustion and disillusionment. “This job is already stressful,” he said. “Add low staffing, no pay, and leadership that doesn't seem to care, and it becomes unbearable.”

He warned that the longer the shutdown lasts, the harder it will be for the FAA to recover. “If this keeps up, new hires won't stick around,” he said. “They're already behind on staffing, and this just makes it worse.”

Federal officials say the flight reductions are a necessary and proactive measure to protect the integrity of the airspace while thousands of controllers continue working without pay.

Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford outlined the order this week, describing it as a “temporary, data-driven step” to “maintain the highest standards of safety in the national airspace system.” 

The plan will reduce flight operations by 4% starting Friday, gradually increasing to 10% by Nov. 14 across 40 of the nation's busiest airports, including Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, Los Angeles, New York LaGuardia, and Reagan National Airport in Washington. At least 1,000 flights were canceled nationwide on Friday, according to FlightAware. Duffy warned Friday that the percentage could jump to 20% unless the government shutdown ended.

A U.S. Department of Transportation spokesperson told the Washington Examiner the decision was guided entirely by safety metrics, not politics.

“This was a data-driven decision made by non-political safety experts at the FAA who based their decision on the strain our system is currently seeing,” the spokesperson said. “Unprecedented times call for unprecedented actions. We'll continue to assess the data and adapt as needed.”

Rep. Rick Larsen (D-WA), the top Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the FAA's plan to reduce flights by 10% at 40 airports beginning Nov. 7 is “a dramatic and unprecedented step that demands more transparency.” He added, “The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data that this decision is predicated on with Congress.”

The agency said the reductions were informed by safety data and confidential reports from both pilots and air traffic controllers, which showed growing fatigue and strain within the system. “We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely,” Bedford said.

During a visit to Reagan National Airport on Friday, Duffy said recent data revealed “a troubling trend,” pointing to an increase in runway incursions, pilot complaints, and instances where aircraft came too close together in flight.

“That data is going in the wrong direction, not in the right direction, which made us make the decision to take additional measures to reduce the pressure in our system,” Duffy said.

The shutdown comes just months after Duffy unveiled his signature plan to “supercharge” the air traffic control workforce and overhaul the FAA's aging infrastructure. In February, he announced a streamlined hiring process and a 30% increase in starting salaries for academy graduates at the FAA's training center in Oklahoma City, a move he said would begin reversing more than a decade of workforce decline.

Since then, the agency has reported record recruitment figures, surpassing its fiscal 2025 goal by hiring just over 2,000 new controllers. Still, training those recruits can take years, and the total number of fully certified controllers remains lower than it was a decade ago. “We're 3,000 controllers short, and we've been 3,000 short for over a decade,” Duffy said earlier this year.

The push followed months of scrutiny over safety lapses and near-misses, including the January midair collision near Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. That disaster prompted the FAA to accelerate modernization projects, including replacing hundreds of radar systems, upgrading software across control centers, and building six new towers, a multibillion-dollar plan Duffy says could be completed in as little as four years if Congress provides funding.

Many controllers fear that even when the shutdown ends, the damage will linger. While federal officials insist the system remains safe, the controllers responsible for keeping it that way say the strain is showing.

 “I mean, this absolutely introduces more risk into the system, without a doubt,” said a controller based in Philadelphia. 

SEAN DUFFY TURNS AIRPORTS INTO HIS BULLY PULPIT AS SHUTDOWN ENSNARES TRAVEL

The controller described an industry held together by human endurance more than institutional support, one that depends on overtime, unpaid labor, and the quiet resolve of those who still show up.

“We're expected to keep the skies moving no matter what,” the controller said. “But you can only patch so many holes before something slips through.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

One week after national outlets reported that the Justice Department had opened a fraud investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the organization announced Friday that it had severed ties with longtime strategist and board member Shalomyah Bowers, citing a “leadership transition.”

The move sharpened scrutiny of the organization's finances and governance just as federal authorities examine whether tens of millions of dollars raised in 2020 were misused, according to legal experts and nonprofit researchers who have tracked the organization's scandals.

In a Nov. 7 letter to supporters, BLMGNF said Bowers's “time on the board has come to an end” and that his consulting firm's work with the group had ceased. The message framed the shake-up as part of a renewed commitment to “transparency, integrity, and faithful stewardship.”

The announcement followed reports from the Associated Press and CBS News that the Justice Department is investigating whether donations to the national BLM entity were diverted by its leadership after the 2020 racial-justice protests. The investigation, reportedly led out of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, focuses on possible donor fraud. No charges have been filed, and the foundation says it is not a target of the investigation.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California declined to comment.

Federal scrutiny comes amid years of controversy surrounding the foundation's finances. In 2022, Sean Campbell reported in New York Magazine that BLMGNF used nearly $6 million of donated funds to purchase a 6,500-square-foot Los Angeles property through an LLC connected to the law firm Perkins Coie.

The house was initially described as a creative hub, but records showed it had also been used for private events and personal filming projects. Nonprofit group experts said the arrangement blurred boundaries between charitable and private benefit, raising questions about oversight and disclosure.

That same year, the foundation's first public Form 990 showed it had received roughly $77 million in donations during the height of the 2020 protests and ended the fiscal year with $42 million in assets. The filing also disclosed payments of more than $2.1 million to a consulting firm run by Bowers, nearly $970,000 to a company founded by the father of co-founder Patrisse Cullors's child, and more than $840,000 to a security firm operated by her brother. Experts said the transactions, while not necessarily illegal, illustrated weak internal controls and potential conflicts of interest for an organization of such size and prominence.

BLMGNF's governance structure also drew criticism. During the 2020–2021 fiscal year, Cullors served as the foundation's sole voting board member, and its filings listed only two employees. Nonprofit attorneys called that lack of independent oversight a major red flag for the IRS. Cullors stepped down as executive director in 2021, later admitting she had stayed at the Los Angeles property for several days and hosted two private parties there. She reimbursed the foundation $390 for one event and later conceded that using the house for personal gatherings “probably wasn't the best idea.”

The separation with Bowers marks another turning point. 

His firm's multimillion-dollar contracts were among the most scrutinized in the foundation's 990 filings. In 2022, a separate entity known as Black Lives Matter Grassroots sued Bowers and the foundation in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accusing him of diverting about $10 million in donations for personal use and turning the nonprofit into a “personal piggy bank.” Bowers denied any wrongdoing, and in June 2023, a judge dismissed the case under California's anti-SLAPP statute, finding the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to substantiate their claims. 

Parker Thayer, an investigative researcher at the Capital Research Center, told the Washington Examiner that Bowers's ouster should be viewed as a warning sign.

“It's a massive red flag,” he said. “It's something we haven't seen at any nonprofit in America in recent history. That's like a five-alarm fire.”

Thayer added that the Justice Department has been increasingly aggressive in policing nonprofit abuses and said BLMGNF's issues are so extensive that “there aren't too many things that a nonprofit could do wrong that BLM hasn't already done.” He said the group's repeated controversies around financial disclosures and leadership self-dealing create “a strong likelihood that an investigation will find something that actually goes the distance.”

Thayer also pointed to BLMGNF founder Cullors's previous admission that she found preparing IRS filings “triggering,” and argued that her reaction betrayed an awareness of deeper problems. “You don't get scared by paperwork unless it reflects reality,” he said. “I think there is a good chance that something more than clerical errors is found.”

Legal analysts say that any criminal investigation would likely hinge on patterns of wire fraud, tax violations, or false filings with the charity. 

John Shu, a constitutional lawyer who served in both Bush administrations, told the Washington Examiner the Justice Department would almost certainly begin by examining “whether they filled out the correct tax forms and whether they lied on them.” 

He added that prosecutors would also look at possible conspiracy and fundraising-fraud angles. “Was there a conspiracy among two or more of the leaders to misappropriate funds and to lie on their tax forms?” Shu said. “And did they mislead donors about how their money would be used?”

Shu said the inquiry could also test how far the department is willing to stretch its resources to pursue a case. 

“It's not clear to me that it would stay just in California,” he said. “Because of the scale of the foundation and the national network of donations, this could easily be run out of Main Justice rather than a local U.S. attorney's office.”

He also suggested the statute-of-limitations clock could still allow prosecutors to act. “People were still donating into 2021, so those transactions are well within the window,” Shu said, noting that a standard five-year federal limit would likely govern probable wire-fraud or tax-related charges. “The first thing they have to do is get a grand jury together, because only the grand jury can issue subpoenas — not only for testimony, but for documents, hard drives, and emails.”

BLMGNF has insisted it is not a target of the investigation. The group plans to expand its board, tighten conflict-of-interest policies, and conduct an external audit as part of broader transparency reforms. Cullors and other former leaders have described the controversy as exaggerated and politically motivated.

DOJ INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS BLACK LIVES MATTER DEFRAUDED DONORS

BLMGNF did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.

While it remains unclear whether the Justice Department will ultimately pursue a civil lawsuit or consider criminal charges, the reported investigation into one of the country's most visible civil-rights organizations has reopened questions about accountability, transparency, and public trust in the movement's finances, and whether the government will ultimately test those questions in court.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Democrats voted against a House of Representatives-passed continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through Nov. 21 for the 15th time on Friday, stretching the shutdown to a record 39 days.

Without congressional authorization to spend money, the Trump administration has been forced to cut spending on many programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps.

Last week, a federal judge ordered the Agriculture Department to at least make partial SNAP payments to recipients, equal to the size of available funds left in an emergency fund designed to cover SNAP payments. But now the judge is back, demanding that the administration make full November SNAP payments, even though there is no lawful appropriation or dedicated fund to do so.

“It's an absurd ruling because you have a federal judge effectively telling us what we have to do in the midst of a Democrat government shutdown,” Vice President JD Vance said in response to a question about the ruling. “We can't have a federal court telling the president how he has to triage the situation. We're trying to keep as much turned on. We're trying to keep as much going as possible. The president and the entire administration are working on that, but we're not going to do it under the orders of a federal judge.”

There are about 42 million people receiving $8 billion a month in food stamp benefits. The Agriculture Department maintains a contingency fund to help keep food stamp payments stable, but there is only $4.65 billion in that fund, not enough to pay everyone's full benefits.

After a federal district judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay out at least partial benefits until the fund was exhausted, the Agriculture Department complied, releasing to each state its share of the SNAP funds. But SNAP is a federally funded program administered by the states, and the states are having administrative trouble getting those partial payments out the door. Implementing major modifications to a safety net spending program in the middle of a government shutdown is not as easy as some federal judges think it is.

Faced with delays caused by partial payment, the same judge is now ordering the Agriculture Department to tap a totally different fund to issue full payments for November. But that fund, the Section 32 Child Nutrition Programs Fund, was designed primarily to be a backup fund for the school lunch program, not food stamps. The Section 32 fund has also been used to bail out farmers with direct payments, including by President Bill Clinton to compensate hog farmers in 1998 and by President Donald Trump in 2018 to compensate soy bean farmers caught up in his first-term trade war.

It is one thing for a federal judge to order the executive branch to pay benefits by emptying an emergency fund created specifically to fund that program, but it is an entirely different matter to start siphoning dollars from a federal fund designed to support one program to bail out a completely different federal program. That is not how the Constitution works.

The chaos caused by the Democratic Party is going to grow as the shutdown drags on. Already, hundreds of flights have been canceled across the country because there are too few air traffic controllers to operate them safely. Section 8 housing rents are not being paid to landlords, and hospitals are not receiving Medicaid payments.

DEMOCRATS' OFF-YEAR WINS REMIND US WHY THE FILIBUSTER IS NEEDED

None of this pain was necessary, and all of it can be ended immediately if Senate Democrats simply vote with Republicans to pass the continuing resolution and open the government.

Democrats say they care about protecting poor people, but they are the ones keeping the government closed. The Constitution gives Congress, not courts, the power to appropriate money. If Democrats want to ensure that 42 million people receive their full food stamp benefits, they can do so today by voting to reopen the government. Every day they refuse to act, they deepen the suffering of low-income families, jeopardize essential programs, and invite judicial overreach. It's time for Democrats to stop the gamesmanship, restore lawful governance, and let the people who depend on these programs get the help Washington promised them.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A federal judge permanently blocked President Donald Trump on Friday from deploying the National Guard to Portland, where the administration has cited clashes between anti-ICE protesters and federal officers as justifying the military presence.

United States District Judge Karin Immergut found that the federal government violated the 10th Amendment and Title 10, Section 12406 of the U.S. Code by sending National Guard troops to the city of Oregon in late September to guard an ICE office building.

“The evidence demonstrates that these deployments, which were objected to by Oregon's governor and not requested by the federal officials in charge of protection of the ICE building, exceeded the President's authority,” the Trump-appointed judge wrote in the 106-page order.

The final ruling follows a preliminary injunction that prevented troops from being deployed until 5 p.m. local time on Friday.

Immergut held a three-day trial last week featuring testimony from federal, state, and local law enforcement officials regarding Trump's claims that protests over federal immigration operations prompted him to activate the National Guard to protect federal assets and officials. Based on the compiled evidence, the judge said the administration's claims of unruly violence before the deployment were largely unfounded.

“While violent protests did occur in June, they quickly abated due to the efforts of civil law enforcement officers. And since that brief span of a few days in June, the protests outside the Portland ICE facility have been predominantly peaceful, with only isolated and sporadic instances of relatively low-level violence, largely between protesters and counterprotesters,” she wrote.

Though the ruling is a setback for the federal government, Immergut noted it does not preclude Trump from deploying the National Guard to Oregon in the future if there is justification for doing so. She said that the conditions in Portland did not meet the bar.

“When considering these conditions that persisted for months before the President's federalization of the National Guard, this Court concludes that even giving great deference to the President's determination, the President did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard,” Immergut said.

The ruling allows the Oregon National Guard to remain under federal control for at least 14 days. However, the National Guard units from Texas and California that were deployed to Oregon are immediately barred under the preliminary injunction.

An appeal is likely to be filed by the Trump administration, considering federal lawyers indicated as much during last week's trial.

JUDGE EXTENDS BLOCK ON PORTLAND NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT THROUGH FRIDAY

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the ruling. “The President's lawful actions will make Portland safer.”

Meanwhile, Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Chicago has faced similar court orders from a federal judge and an appeals court. The Supreme Court is currently considering a petition on its emergency docket to lift the block on the Chicago deployment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted the Trump administration's request Friday night to halt a lower court's order to issue full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits using funds intended for child nutrition.

Jackson granted the request to halt the order pending a ruling on a stay pending appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, writing in her order that the administrative stay will expire 48 hours after the First Circuit issues its ruling.

The petition to the Supreme Court's emergency docket came less than an hour after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declined to grant an administrative stay of U.S. District Judge John McConnell's Thursday order that Section 32 Child Nutrition Funds be used to issue full SNAP benefits by Friday. In its order denying the administrative stay earlier this evening, the First Circuit stated that it would still consider the request for a stay pending appeal, promising a decision on it “as quickly as possible.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the high court to issue an administrative stay of the lower court's orders by 9:30 p.m. Friday. Jackson's order was posted roughly 13 minutes before that time.

Sauer asserted SNAP may only be funded using the SNAP contingency reserve, which would cover roughly half of the benefits for November, and that McConnell's order to use Section 32 funds to issue full SNAP benefits is unlawful.

“That unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. The core power of Congress is that of the purse, while the Executive is tasked with allocating limited resources across competing priorities,” Sauer wrote in the petition.

“But here, the court below took the current shutdown as an effective license to declare a federal bankruptcy and appoint itself the trustee, charged with picking winners and losers among those seeking some part of the limited pool of remaining federal funds,” Sauer added. “The district court's ruling is untenable at every turn.”

Sauer warned that if the high court allowed McConnell's order to stand, it would “sow further shutdown chaos” with groups attempting to force funding to their favored programs via court orders.

“Courts would issue unworkable and potentially conflicting injunctions, as different judges order different allocations of limited pools of money,” Sauer wrote. “District courts' seizure of the power to allocate federal agency funds as they see fit would also invite a run on the bank by way of judicial fiat during this shutdown, as litigants race to courthouse to obtain their guarantee of federal funds before it is too late.”

Sauer urged the high court to issue its ruling quickly, noting that it is currently required to use Section 32 funding to send full SNAP benefits by tonight due to McConnell's order.

JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO USE CHILD NUTRITION FUNDS TO ISSUE FULL SNAP BENEFITS

“Once those billions are out the door, there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds—to the significant detriment of those other critical social programs whose budgets the district court ordered the government to raid,” Sauer wrote.

With the government shutdown now the longest in history and with no clear end in sight, the administration had warned that SNAP benefits would not be paid out for November. The announcement prompted multiple lawsuits and orders requiring the administration to use other funds to pay for SNAP. The administration has maintained that only congressionally appropriated SNAP funds may lawfully be used for the program.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) slammed his Republican colleagues on Friday for failing to denounce Tucker Carlson amid the fallout from the conservative pundit's interview with Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who has contributed to the recent rise in antisemitism online.

“My colleagues, almost to a person, think what is happening is horrible, but a great many of them are frightened because he has one hell of a big megaphone,” Cruz said of Carlson at the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington, D.C.

The senator has ramped up his criticism of the former Fox News host ever since Fuentes appeared on The Tucker Carlson Show last week. The two-hour-plus interview was characterized by Carlson's failure to directly challenge Fuentes's points. Carlson's treatment of Fuentes on the show was in direct contrast to the pundit's heated interview with Cruz in June.

The fallout from the Carlson-Fuentes interview has been notable, as it has led to several resignations at the Heritage Foundation. The conservative think tank was caught in the right-wing backlash when its president, Kevin Roberts, defended Carlson while decrying the “venomous coalition” attacking his “close friend.” Roberts later apologized for the “venomous coalition” comment.

“Their attempt to cancel [Carlson] will fail,” he said in a video on Oct. 30. “I disagree with, and even abhor, things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either. When we disagree with a person's thoughts and opinions, we challenge those ideas and debate.”

Cruz argued Carlson didn't challenge Fuentes enough on his antisemitic claims.

“The last I checked, Tucker actually knows how to cross-examine,” he said, referring to his conversation with Carlson.

The Texas Republican previously spoke about this very issue at last weekend's Republican Jewish Coalition annual summit in Las Vegas, where he described antisemitism as a “poison” and an “existential crisis in our party and in our country.” He also charged his fellow Republicans to speak out, saying each one is a “coward” if “you say nothing.”

“Too many people are scared to confront it,” Cruz said of the surge in antisemitism on the right side of the aisle. “How many elected Republicans do you see standing up and calling this out?”

“I am committed to calling out this garbage. I am committed to fighting this garbage,” he added. “And I am committed to going to young people and saying, ‘These are poisonous lies.'”

TED CRUZ HEAPS CRITICISM ON TUCKER CARLSON OVER NICK FUENTES INTERVIEW

The senator noted that while he doesn't have a problem with Carlson and Fuentes exercising their First Amendment rights, others have an “obligation to stand up and say it is wrong.”

“It's easy right now to denounce Fuentes,” he said to the audience. “Are you willing to say Tucker's name?”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Trump is saying, essentially, If you don't want to get hurt, you'll do what I say.

The Sunday before the New York City mayoral race, President Donald Trump told New Yorkers he might withhold federal funding if Zohran Mamdani won.

“It's gonna be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York, because if you have a Communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there,” Trump told CBS's 60 Minutes. Mamdani responded to Trump's threat of extortion—vote for my preferred candidate or else—by pointing out that said federal funding was not Trump's to give. “This funding is not something that Donald Trump is giving us here in New York City,” Mamdani said. “This is something that we are, in fact, owed in New York.”

It was not the first time Trump treated federal funds as his personal property that he could use to extort political opponents or reward political allies. Trump has approved disaster aid for red states and denied it to blue states. In the midst of the government-shutdown fight with Democrats, he is refusing to disburse rainy-day funds for food stamps, saying (falsely) that the lapse will hurt “largely Democrats.” The Trump administration has cut funding for projects in states with Democratic majorities. It is withholding federal funding from colleges and universities that do not submit to ideological control by the federal government over whom they hire, what they teach, and what sort of students they admit, and rewarding those that comply.

Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn the election on Trump's behalf have received pardons, as have Republican officeholders convicted on corruption charges. Wealthy donors who funneled money to Trump's family businesses have also been pardoned, such as Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 2023. Trump's selective pardons are balanced out by his selective persecutions. His political opponents, such as New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey, have been slapped with flimsy indictments. Cities and states that Trump sees as bastions of his political opposition are subject to occupation by masked federal agents. As soon as Mamdani won, many New Yorkers began bracing for Trump's retaliation.

Joshua Braver: When the military comes to American soil

Incidentally, Trump's “border czar,” Tom Homan, was caught accepting $50,000 from federal agents in a bribery sting—and was not prosecuted. (The FBI and Justice Department “found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing, said Attorney General Pam Bondi.) Although Trump frequently accuses others of corruption, he seems to define the term not as profiting from one's office—something he apparently has zero objection to—but as defying his will.

Elections in democracies determine who administers the government; they do not alter whom the government is for. Under any administration, Republican or Democratic, the United States government exists to serve the people of the United States, regardless of their partisan affiliation. Besides, Americans are not as easily divided as Trump might think. Millions of Republican voters live in New York, just as millions of Democrats live in Texas. He cannot tell whom he is punishing by glancing at an electoral map. But even if he could, Trump's acts of extortion have no place in a democracy. They belong in a protection racket: If you support Trump, you are protected; if you do not, you are vulnerable. If you donate enough cash to Trump, you may receive favorable treatment, including immunity from the law. If you oppose Trump, you may be prosecuted.

This is not how a representative government works. It is how the Mafia works.

As the Italian historian Salvatore Lupo writes in his History of the Mafia, the core of the Mafia business is protection, which is to say, extortion. Emerging out of the chaos of post-feudal, post-unification Italy, the Sicilian Mafia began as a number of small organizations that could retrieve stolen property or prevent it from being stolen in the first place. Eventually, with the fledgling Italian state unable to impose order, these organizations began to compel legitimate businesses to use their services, and then demanded a greater and greater share of those businesses.

Want your citrus groves to turn a profit? You're going to have to hire my guys and also let me skim off the top. You want your cattle back? I'll get them for you, but if you don't want them stolen again, you should probably cut me in. Mafia organizations turned out to be stubbornly adaptable: When a right-wing government cracked down, they exploited the strong hand of the law to take out rivals; when a left-wing government tried to build infrastructure, they made sure they got their cut.

Their entrepreneurial use of violence boiled down to: If you don't want to get hurt, you'll do what I say. The businesses they attached themselves to, and by extension, the larger economy, ultimately suffered as a result of the parasitic drain on efficiency, innovation, and profit caused by having to cater to these masters in the shadows.

I doubt that anyone would look at that system and think: Now, there's a great model for the U.S. government. And yet here we are. If you are aligned with Trump, you can expect public services to function normally (although they often don't), and you may be entitled to exemption from laws and regulations. If you are opposed to Trump, you have to worry about being crushed by the fist of the state.

Trump likes to argue that his intercession in the rule of the law is necessary because Democratic cities are war zones, and because “good” Americans are being persecuted. This, too, is a common ploy; Mafia organizations present themselves as “an expression of traditional society,” as Lupo puts it. “Every eminent mafioso makes a point of presenting himself in the guise of a mediator and resolver of disagreements, as a protector of the virtue of young women. At least once in his career, the mafioso boasts of the rapid and exemplary execution of ‘justice' against violent muggers, rapists, and kidnappers.”

Such rhetoric is a way of presenting an avaricious and exploitative organization, in populist terms, as a protector of the people. But it's a fraud. “Greed and ferocity,” Lupo writes, “are intrinsic characteristics of the Mafia,” and its leaders are plenty capable of ignoring “their codes of honor” whenever they become an obstacle.

One could similarly observe that the suffering the Trump administration has chosen to inflict on the American people in an attempt to extort its opposition is a more frank expression of Trump's beliefs and ideology than his constant bleating about law and order.

The longevity of the Mafia in Italy also serves as a warning that, once these practices embed themselves in the state, they are very difficult to extract; the Italian government's battle against the Mafia continues to this day. After Trump is gone, restoring integrity to the U.S. government, and curbing the sort of flagrant corruption that has suddenly become commonplace here, will be a monumental task. But for now, Trump's extortion attempts are offers he has no authority to make, and the American people have every right to refuse them.

The beauty writer Jessica DeFino refers often to the “mirror world” inside our phone, the uncanny, glistening selfieverse that's also become more real for many of its devotees than the lumpy, blotchy meatspace where the rest of us live. I thought about the mirror world while watching All's Fair, Ryan Murphy's new creative product—I can't call it a television show, because it isn't one. Rather, it's Instagram Reels at episode length, 45-minute collections of bedazzled moving images, targeted at the idly scrolling second-screen viewer. Scenes pass quickly, as if to emulate the true feed experience: Here's a private jet, swaddled in ultra-feminine bouclé; here's a ring, its diamond as big as a grape, slipped gently onto a finger with a two-inch acrylic talon; here's lunch, three lavishly adorned bites of salad; here's the face you know better than your own after two decades of overexposure, poreless and glazed and unmistakably Kim Kardashian, with arachnid eyelashes and lips so pillowy that you could fall asleep on them. If you're not already on your phone, you may as well be.

All's Fair is technically a drama on Hulu about divorce lawyers, but only in the sense that someone needed something to tie all of these visuals together. Scenes start, jarringly, without introduction or fanfare, as though we've been vaulted into the action; the plot resists all attempts by the viewer to impose any kind of order. But: 10 years ago, infuriated by how sexist and stuffy their law firm was (this was, mark you, a good two years into the Lean In girlboss tote-bag-feminism era), and by how the partners at their firm refused to see the potential of divorce law (I laughed into my hand), three trailblazing legal eagles named Allura Grant (played by Kardashian), Emerald Greene (Niecy Nash-Betts), and Liberty Ronson (Naomi Watts, regretfully) left to start their own firm. Flash forward to the present day, and their dream is fully realized: Allura drives a Bentley to her womb-like office (the curved hallways resemble nothing so much as vaginal canals), every partner meeting comes with champagne, and practicing law apparently consists of walking into a room and declaring, “Ladies!!!!,” as though you're kicking off an inexhaustible bachelorette group chat. (The New York Times felt obliged to ask this week whether women ruined the workplace; All's Fair says: “You betcha.”)

Read: No, women aren't the problem

This summary is basically it. There are subplots involving Allura's marriage to an NFL player 10 years her junior, and the firm's antagonist, a vicious rival lawyer named Carrington Lane (Sarah Paulson, chewing scenery so aggressively that she must still have splinters in her teeth). Each episode has a few cameos from actors who I can only hope were paid unspeakable amounts to play clients: Grace Gummer as an abused wife; Elizabeth Berkley as a gaslighted wife; Jessica Simpson, covered in facial prosthetics, as a trophy wife coerced into getting botched plastic surgery. The writing suggests that ChatGPT was asked to emulate Fifty Shades'  E. L. James, and however cringeworthy and brand-name-peppered that sounds, I can promise you it's so much worse. “From cocktails to cock rings in one 24-hour period,” Watts's Liberty says at the end of the first episode. “God, I love my job.” Now that's acting.

The reviews of All's Fair have been so uniformly dire that the show has emerged, paradoxically, as a must-watch. I can only assume that this is exactly what Murphy and his co-creators—including the playwright and two-time Pulitzer finalist Jon Robin Baitz—were going for. You simply can't make something this bad without intention, even if the intention is just to be widely memed each week via Evan Ross Katz's Instagram account. The performances are wildly disparate: Paulson's key is psychotic operatic, Glenn Close's (she plays the mentor figure Dina Standish) is animated to excess, Nash-Betts's is sitcom charming, and Kardashian's is Days of Our Lives perfume ad. I don't mean to malign Kardashian—whose character seems very sweet on the show—but her particular art form works only in the hyper-specific world of heavily edited images. On Instagram, and even on her reality show, Kardashian comes across as thrillingly impervious, wearing impassivity like body armor and putting her body and face through Olympian ordeals to draw our collective gaze. On scripted television, she's much more vulnerable to someone else's camera angles, and to a genre that rewards expression, not provocative blankness.

Read: Reclaim imperfect faces

Watching the show, you may have questions. Such as: Does this portend the end of culture as we know it? and Is the scene where the lawyers all talk about vaginal filler made of salmon sperm critiquing the absurdity of late-capitalist beauty culture or endorsing it? My question was: What does Ryan Murphy really think about women? He's spent much of his career portraying us as grotesques and static archetypes—divas, witches, den mothers, monsters—in shows The New Yorker has described as “cynical hits.” The first five seasons of American Horror Story featured not a single female director; All's Fair is a drama co-created by three men about a supposed feminist wonderland. Is this show written for women? Or, as seems more likely to me, are we being pandered to in plain sight—patronized, diminished, and fed designer-label eye candy and weak-sauce revenge plots by someone who recently noticed Selling Sunset at the top of Netflix's most-watched list? It's easy to absorb endless amounts of branded pap when you're on your phone. The experience of being bombarded with shoe-closet-makeover reels and deep-plane-facelift infomercials from Miami plastic surgeons is as normal there as breathing. It's harder to take on television. It seems much more obvious, somehow—all the ways we're being pacified and manipulated to consume, to desire, to disassociate.

The government shutdown is now the longest in history. Panelists joined Washington Week With The Atlantic to discuss how voters and lawmakers are responding, and more.

Three weeks before Thanksgiving, “the administration has chosen to not find money to fund the food-assistance program for some 42 million Americans,” Jeff Zeleny, the chief national-affairs correspondent at CNN, said last night. “But they have found money for military payments and ICE officers and others. That choice, he added, “is beginning to catch up with the administration and Republicans.”

They're more diverse than ever, but they remain the sites of deep racial and socioeconomic gaps.

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

Some critics of the suburbs argue that they're not a place at all. “The anthropologist Marc Augé coined the term non-places to describe interchangeable, impersonal spaces lacking in history and culture that people pass through quickly and anonymously,” Julie Beck wrote last year. The highways and chain stores of suburbs such as the ones Beck grew up in can often feel that way. But suburbs have identities, and they leave their mark on people's lives, Beck notes: “Where there is life, there is connection and emotion. Where there is connection and emotion, nostalgia follows.”

America's suburbs have evolved: Once known for segregation, they are now more diverse than ever, Beck writes. But suburban life is prone to its own dynamics of racial and socioeconomic disparity, mirroring the gaps that have become clearer and clearer in America's cities. Today's newsletter explores the nostalgia, the dream, and the failures of the suburbs.

Megha Majumdar's second novel imagines how climate disaster might scramble our sense of morality.

Whenever I read a novel about immigration, I recall a scene from the 2006 Italian film Nuovomondo (released as Golden Door in English). At the turn of the 20th century, a young Sicilian woman who will soon marry a “rich American” presents two postcards, supposedly from the United States, to a village elder. The first depicts a man holding a wheelbarrow that contains a massive onion, so large that it dwarfs both the wheelbarrow and the man. The second postcard displays a tree that is bursting with coins, as if money is sprouting from the branches. Convinced that these images faithfully represent America, a group of villagers sets off for the New World.

Many immigrant novels contain similar scenes, in which hapless characters embrace improbable visions of America, only to be chastened upon arrival. These passages reflect how divided the planet once was, how easily myths about the United States could become rooted in other countries. Yet these images also contained a kernel of truth: America once seemed to be a place where hard work inevitably yielded prosperity; where, with time and effort, you could eventually purchase as many onions as you pleased.

Immigration tales tend to adopt a hybrid form—part elegy for life in the home country, part hymn to the promise of the new. A Guardian and a Thief is not an immigrant novel in the traditional sense, though its protagonist hopes to leave India for America. (Majumdar's best-selling debut novel, A Burning, takes place in contemporary India.) Set in the near future, when an environmental crisis has decimated India's economy and landscape, A Guardian and a Thief unfolds as a mesmerizing morality play that demonstrates how categories like “victim” and “thief” collapse under conditions of scarcity. Yet the novel suffers from what feels like a mismatch between the conditions it depicts and the worldview of the people who populate it. Majumdar's characters are contending with intractable 21st-century problems while adhering to the stories of an earlier era. In a novel that is so alert to where climate change is leading the world, a narrative frame that illustrates migration as linear and largely redemptive feels anachronistic.

Read: A new kind of immigrant novel

A Guardian and a Thief begins promisingly, offering nuanced portraits of its main characters. On the first page, the reader meets Ma as she fetches eggs and rice from a hidden room in her home. Standing before the stove, she watches a young man whistling as he cycles past her house. Majumdar continues:

Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song?

But the reader soon learns that Ma, who manages a homeless shelter, has for the past year been skimming donations for her own family as food grows scarcer in Kolkata. Soon after, a desperate man named Boomba, who witnessed Ma stealing from the shelter, breaks into her home and swipes her food, her phone, and a purse containing her family's invaluable travel documents.

Throughout the book, Majumdar provides devastating details about Ma's and Boomba's lives. Ma cares for her young daughter and elderly father, and has gone months without seeing her husband, who is waiting for her in the U.S. Boomba's family, in a nearby village, has endured a series of catastrophes, leaving them in dire straits. Ma and Boomba desire the same things—love, food, shelter, security—and they are fearless and unapologetic in pursuing them. Each comes to understand that the rules that prevailed during calmer times no longer hold, that to cling to them is to willingly accept privation and defeat. Majumdar lavishes her characters with careful attention, and so the reader comes to regard their most troubling actions as justified, if not inevitable. And because the world she conjures is so similar to our own (her characters complain about economic inequality and have smartphones; among them is a social-media influencer with 600,000 followers), a persistent question pulses beneath the story: What would you do if you were in their shoes?

In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Majumdar said that her novel was prompted by asking herself: “Are there good people and monsters or do we contain elements of both?” This idea animates every encounter between Ma and Boomba until the distinction between good and bad, right and wrong, begins to dissolve. Ma imagines herself as a guardian—of her daughter, her father, her fragile home—yet she steals from the shelter she manages. Boomba, young and rootless, takes essential provisions from Ma's family, yet his act is also one of guardianship, because he does so to secure his own family's survival. The novel offers no clean resolutions; it shows how scarcity makes every action double-edged.

Majumdar's psychological precision is what makes the novel's geopolitical weaknesses feel so pronounced. Her depiction of everyday human interaction is rich and persuasive, but the larger world her characters inhabit feels underdeveloped. Ma's vision of the U.S., for instance, is described in these clichéd terms:

She knew plenty about America. Who didn't, given Hollywood? It was a country of grocery stores as large as aircraft hangars, stocked with waxed fruit and misted vegetables and canned legumes from floor to ceiling. It was a country of breathable air and potable water, and, despite a history of attempts to cultivate a poorly educated electorate, functioning schools and tenacious thinkers. It was a country of encompassing hope, sustained by the people despite the peddlers of fear and pursuers of gain who wore the ill-fitting costumes of political representation.

Ma's assertion that she knows plenty about America “given Hollywood” might have been understandable in an earlier era, before the internet was ubiquitous. But Majumdar has created a world that is recognizably continuous with our own—her characters scan social media and inhabit a culture saturated with real-time information; as a result, this statement feels curiously old-fashioned. Ma's description of enormous, glistening grocery stores could be explained as the musings of a person who longs for stability and plentitude, or of a naive character who thinks of America as a land of boundless riches. But Ma has been deftly drawn as a canny realist and problem solver—not the kind of person to indulge in daydreams.

Read: No one is prepared for a new era of global migration

Majumdar's inconsistent world building ultimately undermines the reader's ability to invest in the story. She reveals that crops have failed and hunger grips India, but the scope and texture of the climate crisis remain unclear. At one point, Ma's husband does provide a glimpse of how the climate crisis has affected the U.S. (“fields of corn, cucumber, and asparagus withering, rivers depleted, cacti where there had once been broad-leafed trees”). Yet its brevity is telling: This is the sum of Majumdar's engagement with the international scale of the disaster. The vagueness might be deliberate—an attempt to present the story as a parable about morality under duress. But invoking climate change invites readers to think in global terms. Without that examination, the moral argument becomes unmoored. A novel about planetary collapse retreats into the contours of a fable, one that asks what people will do to survive without fully confronting the systems that endanger them.

Majumdar's most compelling insight—into collapsing social categories during a time of crisis—speaks to a broader global condition, in which the will to survive can obscure the line between right and wrong. Yet the novel also shows that moral imagination cannot thrive in isolation. Majumdar's characters' choices would carry greater weight if the conditions constraining them were rendered with equal depth. In the end, A Guardian and a Thief is a story that comprehends hunger more deeply than the world that produces it.

Do people love West End Girl because it's good, because it documents a trainwreck, or both?

The pop music landscape is currently a loud reminder that love does not always last. And that the heartbreak that follows a split, while painful, can render great art — or at least art that will get the internet talking if you give the people enough juicy details. And this year is shaping up to be a banner year for the tell-all breakup album.

Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires released dueling albums about the dissolution of their marriage; Haim went full-on messy with a summer breakup album; and a 50-year-old song by Fleetwood Mac honestly will not leave the news cycle.

Currently at the front of the group sits British singer Lily Allen, who just released a scorched-earth, confessional album seemingly about her divorce from Stranger Things actor David Harbour. The album, West End Girl, breaks new ground for Allen — and for the art of the breakup record — with its candid, detail-filled account of the heartbreak and betrayal that led to the end of her marriage.

“She's not sparing a single detail other than the person's name, which is never on the record,” said Coleman Spilde, senior staff culture writer and critic at Salon. “This is a breakup album that's also coming at a time where we have this very Taylor Swiftian sort of alternative romance songwriting that is very metaphorical. And Lily is kind of yanking us back to the style of songwriting that is incredibly candid.”

The internet has lost its collective mind over the album, a reaction that signifies how our parasocial age is changing the breakup album's purpose. Today, Explained co-host Noel King sat down with Spilde to break it all down. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Tell us: Who is Lily Allen and what did she do? 

That is a very interesting and complicated question.

Lily Allen is a British musician and a tabloid fixture, and now she is back with her new album, West End Girl, which is taking her sort of confessional songwriting to the next level by being incredibly honest, straightforward, candid, and revealing every sordid detail about the dissolution of her marriage to David Harbour, the actor from Stranger Things and Marvel fame.

West End Girl tells quite a tale. What is the tale that it is telling?

This is an album about a woman who is really excited to be in this marriage. She's been swept off her feet by this handsome man, and she's moving to New York to start her new life with him. We hear that in the opening title track of the album, “West End Girl,” which is sort of a sing-songy introduction to the album.

And then suddenly she gets a call: Her agent has booked her a play. It seems that the nameless person that she's writing about on the album isn't quite so happy about that.

Then at the end of this opening track, we hear the recording of a one-sided FaceTime conversation between the two of them, where Lily is sort of talking to the person on the other end of the phone who seems to be asking for — maybe it's an open marriage; maybe he's confessing infidelity; maybe he's asking for a certain kind of marriage arrangement.

Then she is sort of thrust into this anxiety spiral, which a lot of listeners can probably relate to if they've ever been in any kind of torrid relationship.

You have the follow-up track, the second track on the album, “Ruminating” — this frenetic drum & bass song. She's remembering this line that he told her over the phone: “If it has to happen, baby, do you want to know?” The end of the song, she just repeats [her reaction] — “what a fucking line” — over and over and over again.

And then through the rest of the first half of the album, she's throwing back-to-back songs like “Tennis” and “Madeline.” “Tennis” is all about coming home from London to find that her partner may have been texting another woman. She's asking over and over, “Who is Madeline? Who the fuck is Madeline?” The very next song is answering that question. So it's sort of like a call-and-response that really invites the listener to have a lot of fun with it.

What are we supposed to be feeling by the time we finish?

It sort of flips a little bit to go a bit more introspective, thinking about, What can I do to be part of this relationship as he wants it to be? What can I do to make him happy? What sacrifices can I make?

You have songs like “Non-Monogamummy,” where Lily is kind of wrestling with her traditional ideas of motherhood and then being a mother who is also nonmonogamous, which doesn't quite fit for her. And then you have the sort of coda of the album, where she is finding some contentment with it and just accepting that this is someone who's never going to change.

And this is someone who didn't have her best priority in mind and someone who'd prioritize themselves over the love of their marriage.

There are two types of reactions to this album: One of them is the offline reaction. That is your sister and your sister-in-law texting you, “You have to listen to this album.” And then there is what happened on Al Gore's internet. 

What was the reaction online?

There were a couple different reactions online.

People were starting to look at it as a morality tale. You had this initial reaction that was listening to the album and vilifying David Harbour and all of this. You had people who were calling for boycotts of the last season of Stranger Things, people who said that he should never be working in a Marvel movie again, and people who were really equating personal, romantic problems with sort of illegal sins — making infidelity into something that should be punishable by a law or by firing, which is just not how we work as a society.

People were digging up things about their relationship, because it has that sort of car crash element to the album. People were looking at their shared Architectural Digest home tour of their Brooklyn Brownstone. People were analyzing the way that video started with David Harbour opening the door and kind of making a joke about the cameraperson being the other woman.

And then you also had people really digging into the sort of “West End Girl” of it all and looking at how David Harbour responded to Lily's part in her first play. They also dug up an old Instagram story from Lily about flowers that he had sent her pre-opening night. He wrote on the note: “My ambitious wife, these are bad luck flowers because if you get reviewed well in this play, you will get all kinds of awards and I will be miserable. Signed, your loving husband.”

People were really able to take these things and feed into them because they were all public as it was, so it helps proliferate that narrative that Lily was already spinning.

Then there was another layer to that, which I find almost even more fascinating: People, as the album became more popular over its release weekend, were looking at it and then suddenly digging up things about not just David and Lily's marriage, but Lily Allen herself. They dug up an old Twitter row that she had with Azealia Banks. They dug up confessions from Lily Allen saying that much of her last record, No Shame, was about her infidelity with her husband. So it's kind of this idea that people are running to make the artist behind things in or to tear them down as much as possible.

Do people like this album because it's a good album? Or do people like it because people love a trainwreck? Or do people like it because in 2025, it is saying something much deeper than what's on the surface?

As a critic, I would have to say it's a little bit of everything. It's funny because it's an interesting album. The music itself may not be the most unconventional or the most left-field in its production, but it is filled with earwormy hooks and interesting lyrics and fun phrases that kind of keep you coming back to it and really drill into your head, which is really part of the genius of making a breakup album like this. You want to keep returning to it no matter how sad it is.

And also I think people really do love the trainwreck of it, because there is a sort of rubbernecking sensationalism of: People love to look at a car crash. I think that people are really eager to tear people down in the public sphere when they seem to have any wrongdoing that they've done. And some people also like to dig in and uncover stuff and proliferate it online and on social media and add to the narrative themselves. So it all becomes kind of a bit of a game, but it all also works in Lily Allen's favor too.

﻿Space dogs paved the way for human astronauts. Was it worth it?

In March, I visited the Lowell Observatory — the astronomical research site where Pluto was first discovered — in Flagstaff, Arizona. I stood in line to squint through telescopes at Jupiter and the surface of the moon before the night turned cloudy and drove me inside the Astronomy Discovery Center museum. And like all museum visits, it ended in the gift shop.

This one was full of space paraphernalia, astronaut dolls, and NASA shirts. But what caught my eye were the dog plushies in silver spacesuits, name embroidered in blue on the front: Laika. She also came in the form of a backpack clip. It might have been cute if it weren't so profoundly sad.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Because on November 3, 1957 — 68 years ago this week — Soviet researchers launched the real Laika, a small black-and-white terrier mix, into space aboard the Sputnik 2 spacecraft, where she became the first living thing to orbit the earth, proving that life could survive both launch and outer space conditions for extended periods of time. But the technology that would facilitate her safe re-entry did not exist yet, so there was never any hope that she would come back alive.

”After placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch,” recalled Soviet engineer Yevgeniy Shabarov, “we kissed her nose and wished her bon voyage, knowing that she would not survive the flight.”

The scientists intended for her to die painlessly after eating poisoned food after a week in orbit, but that's not how the story turned out.

Soviet physicians had implanted sensors into Laika's body before her doomed flight to track her vital signs while she was in space. During the launch, her breathing rate quadrupled and her heart rate tripled. She reached orbit alive, alone, and terrified, peering out through the window at the planet far below.

But then the life support capsule in her spacecraft malfunctioned, causing temperatures in the cramped cabin to spike to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Somewhere between five and seven hours after launch, Laika died of hyperthermia and stress — overheating and panic. She had no way to understand what was happening to her.

American astronaut Scott Kelly has described space as smelling like burning metal. What must it smell like to a dog, with a nose at least 10,000 times more powerful than a human being's?

Before humanity went to space, scientists feared that we could not survive extended periods of weightlessness. So we first experimented on animals as proof of concept. The Soviets preferred dogs, while Americans opted mostly for nonhuman primates like monkeys and chimpanzees, some of whom perished horribly.

“Recruited” into the Soviet spaceflight program from the streets of Moscow earlier in 1957, Laika was a well-behaved, 11-pound, 3-year-old stray. By all accounts, she was a very good girl. Vladimir Yazdovsky, the physician who had selected her for the mission, took her home to play with his children the night before her fatal mission. “I wanted to do something nice for her,” he later said. “She had so little time left to live.”

Before Laika, Soviet scientists had successfully (and non-fatally) launched other dogs into suborbital flights, which reach outer space but do not travel fast enough to orbit the earth. Laika wasn't the last to be fatally sent into the cosmos, although most space dogs that succeeded her survived their missions, and mechanisms were put in place for their recovery. (Whether they came back dead or alive, though, the space dogs endured cruel training regimens that involved being confined in progressively smaller cages and subjected to deafening sounds to mimic launch conditions.) Her story has persisted in cultural memory as one of scientific progress, a sad but necessary part of the research that paved the way for human astronauts. She demonstrated that animals could survive launch conditions into space and successfully orbit the Earth, inspiring the US to kick its space program into high gear.

While Laika's mission provided some of the first physiological data about the effects of space travel — and launching animals into space has provided us with knowledge that made it possible to more safely send humans into space — it's also probable that this one-way mission, and others like it, weren't worth the cost. Sputnik 2, along with Laika's remains, disintegrated upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere, so there was no body left to study.

The next year, a Polish scientific periodical decried the failure to bring Laika back to Earth alive as “regrettable” and “undoubtedly a great loss for science.” There was a sense among many, both now and then, that humanity used animals too liberally in space research.

After all, humans would have gone to space eventually, even if Laika was never launched with Sputnik 2. And it would have been possible to wait to send animals into orbit until we had the technology to recover them safely. Sputnik 2 had been a politically motivated rush job after the success of Sputnik 1 only a month before: Sergei Korolev, the father of the Soviet space program, had suggested sending a dog into orbit to surprise the Americans and mark the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

One of the scientists who worked on the Sputnik 2 program lived to regret it. “The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it,” Oleg Gazenko told audiences at a 1998 press conference. “We shouldn't have done it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog.”

Laika would go on to become one of the most celebrated dogs to ever live — Soviet allies issued commemorative Laika stamps, while the Soviet Union's Russian successors honored her as a fallen cosmonaut. Popular representations of Laika tend to depict her as a happy dog astronaut, or as a proud martyr who chose to give up her life for a greater cause. She was turned into “an enduring symbol of sacrifice and human achievement,” as the space dog biographer Amy Nelson put it, inspiring monuments and so many musical tributes. A vegan lifestyle magazine (founded on the idea that sending her to space was a tragic mistake) and an animation studio bear her name.

But aside from some incredibly sad songs, little is said about what spaceflight was like for Laika and the many other animals sent to their deaths for space research. None of them understood what space was, nor did they have any choice in making the ultimate sacrifice for expanding humanity's knowledge of the cosmos.

Laika's true cause of death by overheating was not publicly revealed until 2002. The Soviets feared it would spark opposition to its space program, and instead kept up the fiction that her end had been heroic and painless, the valiant sacrifice of a canine cosmonaut.

If you've ever loved and lost a dog, it's impossible not to compare their life and death to Laika's. My childhood dog, Muppet, passed away late last year. He was almost 15, very sick, and spent his last day eating treats. My parents held him as he was put to sleep. But Laika died young and healthy, alone, confused, and without any comfort.

Humans no longer send dogs and non-human primates to space — why would we, when we have willing human astronauts? — but animal experimentation in space research continues. Zebrafish, tardigrades, worms, flies, frogs, and rodents are still sent up to the International Space Station, where we use them to examine the effects of space radiation and microgravity on living tissue, model different diseases, and study reproduction in space, a prerequisite for a self-sustaining human settlement off of our planet.

It's hard to muster up as much empathy for flies and worms as for our mammalian cousins, and tardigrades seem to adapt to life in orbit well enough. But it's safe to say that mice deserve better than routine euthanization after they return to earth.

Humans tend to value our curiosity above animal life, using animals as instruments to achieve our own ends. Sometimes we gain from this tremendously, but the animals always lose out. While it's unequivocally true that animal research in space can make the space environment safer for humans, there are competing incentives at play in weighing the potential benefits of space settlement against the very real cost to animals. This is a hard problem, and not one there are easy answers to.

But here's some good news: Although humans still experiment on dogs here on Earth, that practice is on its way out. And new approaches to reduce animal testing show promise both on and off our planet. Organoids — miniature 3D organs grown from stem cells — even grow better in space than on the surface of the Earth. So maybe one day soon, space research could help facilitate the end of animal testing.

A Manhattan federal judge on Friday declared a mistrial in the case of two MIT-trained brothers accused of fraud for a 12-second transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that netted them $25 million.

The judge ended the trial of James and Anton Peraire-Bueno at 7 p.m. after the jury's five men and seven women pleaded in a lengthy note for deliberations to end, saying the case had become an emotional strain and they could not reach a unanimous verdict.

Half of the jurors ""spontaneously broke down in tears"" on Thursday, and some jurors had suffered ""multiple nights of sleeplessness"" during the three days they deliberated, they told the judge in the note.

""We are unanimously of the belief that we are not making any progress,"" the note concluded.

""There's nothing in the note to indicate that if I hold them over until Monday, that anybody will change the result here,"" US District Court Judge Jessica G. L. Clarke told the parties before bringing the jury out to send them home, ending the four-week trial.

The verdict is the third failure this year for federal efforts to convict defendants in multimillion-dollar digital asset fraud and money laundering cases. Prosecutors did not immediately say if they will seek to retry the two brothers.

The reprieve — temporary though it may be — left the brothers, their lawyers, and their parents smiling and exchanging embraces in the courtroom.

The final deadlock note was the second time the jury sent a message to the judge on Friday saying they were unable to reach a verdict.

""We all did our best,"" a male juror told Business Insider, declining to comment further before leaving the courthouse.

Another male juror told a prosecutor that the jury could not agree on how to apply the law.

""There was markedly little debate about the facts,"" this juror could be heard telling the prosecutor in a post-mistrial conversation outside the courtroom.

""It was understanding the law,"" the juror said. ""Finding the appropriate standard was a struggle for us.""

James Peraire-Bueno, 29, and Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, faced three charges — wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and money laundering, each carrying a maximum of 20 years in prison.

To find them guilty of wire fraud, jurors needed to agree that the brothers intentionally made at least one fraudulent misrepresentation to deceive others for the purpose of obtaining money.

Throughout deliberations, jurors repeatedly asked for clarifications and definitions around such key words as ""wrongful,"" ""willful,"" ""misrepresentation,"" and ""false pretense.""

The brothers were accused of tricking a trio of cryptocurrency traders out of $25 million in a dizzyingly complicated and blindingly fast transaction.

Federal prosecutors described the brothers' 12-second, April 2023 maneuver as a ""first of its kind"" blockchain heist, but emphasized to the jury that the high-tech money grab was no different from any simpler or less modern fraud.

""There is no separate law about fraud on the blockchain,"" Assistant US Attorney Danielle Marie Kudla told jurors Tuesday, during closing arguments.

Whether on the phone, online, or on Ethereum, ""You can't tell a lie and deceive people to get their money,"" she added.

Prosecutors said the brothers' fraudulent misrepresentations included their typing a series of invalid zeros, which voided or ""poisoned"" a block of transactions they were supposed to blindly add to the blockchain.

Poisoning the proposed block let the brothers see and tamper with their victims' trades, prosecutors said.

The defense had countered that the brothers pocketed their small fortune after a fair and square battle: their preprogrammed software, or ""bots,"" simply outsmarted the targets' bots.

In closing arguments, defense lawyer Daniel Nathan Marx told the jury that any rule-bending on the brothers' part was par for the course in the ""brutally competitive,"" bot-eat-bot world of Ethereum.

""They took on risk and enjoyed tremendous success,"" Marx told jurors. ""They should be celebrated, not villainized by the prosecution.""

The outcome may help define the Justice Department's evolving role in policing cryptocurrency.

Both sides agreed the Peraire-Bueno's was a first-of-its kind prosecution. The defense went further, saying that the verdict will have an unprecedented impact on the Ethereum blockchain.

Until now, the blockchain has been self-regulating, defense lawyers argued last year, calling the Peraire-Bueno prosecution unwelcome and unneeded.

""The indictment is an audacious attempt by the United States government to regulate, for the first time and through criminal prosecution, the duties and interactions of the Ethereum Network — a decentralized, trustless system that uses economic incentives to drive behavior and relies on consensus to effect changes,"" they wrote as part of an unsuccessful effort to dismiss the charges.

Prior to this latest outcome, the DOJ suffered two other major losses in federal courts in Manhattan this year.

In May, a federal judge overturned the jury's wire fraud conviction against Avraham ""Avi"" Eisenberg, who was accused of draining $110 million through a pump-and-dump scheme.

In August, another Manhattan jury could not agree if Tornado Cash CEO Roman Storm laundered $1 billion in dirty crypto.

One notable pre-trial victory came last month, when federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the largest forfeiture in department history, seizing $15 billion in bitcoin from the accused mastermind behind an international cryptocurrency investment fraud ring.

For some diehard Starbucks fans, a $7 latte isn't enough of a splurge — they're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on the collectible holiday cup it comes in.

Starbucks' Glass Bearista Cold Cup, which launched and quickly sold out on Thursday at an original price point of $29.95, has evolved from festive holiday merch into an investment item, fueling a resale market usually reserved for designer sneakers and rare toys.

Shortly after launch, eBay was flooded with listings for the beanie-wearing Bearista, with some cups listed with ""Buy It Now"" prices of up to $50,000. While it doesn't appear that any have sold for such an exorbitant price, auction listings reviewed by Business Insider have racked up bids upward of $285 (plus shipping).

A representative for Starbucks told Business Insider the response to the Bearista cup ""exceeded even our biggest expectations.""

""Despite shipping more Bearista cups to coffeehouses than almost any other merchandise item this holiday season, the Bearista cup and some other items sold out fast,"" the spokesperson said. ""We know it's disappointing to fans, and we're sorry if they missed out. We appreciate our customers' understanding. We have more exciting merchandise coming this holiday season.""

The holiday spirit at Starbucks came with an extra side of scarcity this year, as some baristas who worked on launch day said their stores received just one or two Bearista cups to sell — and customers were lined up before opening, ready to claim one for themselves.

The Starbucks spokesperson declined to comment on the number of Bearista units shipped out this year or stock levels at specific stores.

A shift supervisor who has been with the company for over a year told Business Insider that customers lined up outside for more than half an hour before the store opened, and since they only received two Bearista cups to sell, they ""sold out immediately.""

""I got to my store somewhere between 3:45 and 3:50 a.m. and there were already several people literally wrapped in blankets, camped out in front of the store,"" a Minnesota-based barista who has worked with Starbucks for seven years told Business Insider. ""When we tried to enter, after reminding them that the store does not open until 4:30 a.m., they tried to push their way in with us.""

She added that, when her manager arrived at the store after 4 a.m. and told the waiting customers there would be a limit of one bear-themed cup per party, the customers got angry and ""cussed her out.""

The 2025 Bearista cup isn't Starbucks' first foray into collectible merch. The company first debuted its Bearista in 1997 in plush form and has since expanded into a wide variety of seasonal and themed merchandise, which customers regularly clamor for.

A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the policy for merchandise sales requires the items to be sold on a first-come, first-served basis, with no purchase limit or holds — meaning customers could buy more than one, and a staff member could not set aside an item with the intent to purchase it themselves, or save it for a customer.

John Kauchick, a 70-year-old Starbucks fan in Mississippi who says he has spent ""several thousand"" dollars on collectible merchandise from the coffee giant over the last 25 years, told Business Insider he camped outside his local Starbucks starting at 3 a.m. to get a chance at purchasing the bear, as well as some limited-edition Hello Kitty-themed merchandise also released on Thursday.

Although he was first in line, Kauchick said a barista at the location he visited had purchased the store's lone Bearista cup for herself before he had the opportunity to do so, which has irritated him enough to consider stopping his spending at Starbucks entirely.

""I felt cheated out of the opportunity to get one,"" Kauchick said. Although he has turned to resellers before, including spending $150 on a Taylor Swift-themed Starbucks tumbler he had been eyeing, he doesn't want to keep feeding the secondary market, given the inflated prices.

""I may get one,"" he said, ""But I have this bad taste in my mouth still, and I think I may decide I just can't do this anymore.""

In the days since the launch, social media has been filled with celebratory posts from Starbucks fans showcasing their festive Bearista cups.

The fervor is reminiscent of the craze surrounding cult items like Labubu dolls, which Business Insider reported in August were on track to hit a billion dollars in sales this year, and created a secondary market of people creating custom versions, including tattooed Labubus that sell for over $200 each, for the most committed fans of the brand.

For every post bragging about scoring one of the coveted cups, there's another from an exhausted barista, publicly begging customers to understand that they have no personal control over the available inventory.

Once the Bearista cups were sold out at her store, the Minnesota-based barista said some customers became aggressive, calling her and other staff ""flat out disgusting"" names. The vitriol continued well into Friday, she said.

Another barista, who has worked at the company for 11 years, told Business Insider that ""the phone wouldn't stop ringing"" all day Thursday, with customers calling to see if their store happened to have an extra Bearista on hand.

""If customers were polite, I would apologize and direct them to the Target store where they might have a slim chance to get one,"" they said, referencing licensed in-store cafés, which were rumored to have received more Bearista inventory than corporate-owned stores. ""If they were rude and asked me if we had any at 5 p.m., I told them they already knew the answer.""

Although some social media reports suggested that a handful of Starbucks fans became violent over the Bearista launch, Business Insider could not verify any such incidents. Still, it wouldn't be the first time collectors threw punches over a popular item. In 2021, Target stopped stocking Pokémon, NFL, MLB, and NBA trading cards after their increasing resale value sparked fist fights in their stores.

""I'm a bug for rarity, and one thing that Starbucks does is they build up the expectation or the perception of scarcity — and they do that on purpose,"" Kauchick said. ""I feel sorry for some of the people who got caught up in the hostility or whatever. But, you know, Starbucks knows what they're doing.""

If you're a young person trying to land a job in the age of AI, one expert says you should focus on mastering tasks, not skills. 

Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a prominent figure in the AI revolution and author of ""Co-Intelligence,"" said that a lot of the skills people learn related to AI aren't all that useful, because the technology evolves and quickly makes the skill somewhat irrelevant.

""It would be helpful for young people to think more about what tasks they're actually really good at, because that's where they stay ahead of machines,"" Mollick told Business Insider. ""And then you can find a job where the machine helps you with the other pieces of your task.""

Every job, he said, requires many tasks, and it's unlikely that a single applicant will excel at all of them. AI can help with ""task distribution"" and help in the areas where applicants struggle. Knowing how to provide clear instructions is crucial for maximizing the benefits of AI as it completes tasks.

""Being able to be an expert enough in something to know whether it's good or bad turns out to be really important,"" Mollick said about judging AI's output.

He also advised that young people should focus on gaining broad knowledge and developing expertise in specific topics. Since AI machines are trained on such a wide array of information, having a strong base in the humanities is useful, he said.

AI is threatening entry-level jobs across industries, making it especially hard for Gen Zers to find work. Mollick — who has consulted with JPMorgan, Google, and the White House on AI usage — told Business Insider that he's most concerned about whether we're tackling the question of how to restructure jobs with enough urgency.

As AI automates some technical abilities, soft skills are newly crucial for job applicants. Communication, leadership, and organizational prowess were among the top skills identified by Indeed's Hiring Lab. Some leaders who celebrate the promise of AI worry that employees could lose the ability to complete certain tasks.

The administrative stay, issued Friday night by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, is designed to give a federal appeals court more time to consider the government's request for a longer-term order letting it avoid making the payment.

President Donald Trump said no US officials would attend this month's Group of 20 summit in South Africa, the latest escalation in a rift that erupted over his claims that the country is mistreating White Afrikaners.

“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” Trump wrote on social media, claiming that Afrikaners “are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated. No U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

For millions of Americans, it is an uncertain time.

Amazon, General Motors and Paramount have all been making layoffs, and U.S.-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October altogether, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The government shutdown has also left hundreds of thousands of workers without pay, millions of SNAP recipients without funds to feed themselves and their families, and now thousands of travelers with reduced flight options.

There are ways to cope that don't exacerbate the financial anxiety you might be feeling. For example, financial therapist Aja Evans recommends leaning into self-care activities that cost little to no money, like going outside and spending time with family and friends.

But there's a mindset shift people can make as well.

Instead of experiencing uncertainty as an anomaly, remember that ""uncertainty is fundamental reality,"" says best-selling author and wellness guru Deepak Chopra. ""Every moment we breathe, live and move in uncertainty, pretending that it's certainty.""

The 79-year-old recently launched a wellness platform offering various meditations, live digital sessions with him and a Deepak Chopra AI chatbot drawing from his decades of writing and talks that users can interact with directly.

Instead of thinking of uncertainty as an inhibitor in your life, think of it as a chance to try something new. ""In every uncertain event,"" says Chopra, ""there is the seed for a greater opportunity and creativity.""

That creativity can lead to fresh problem solving in whatever difficult circumstance you're facing and solutions you haven't considered before.

Creativity is ""a new story, a new paradigm, a new way of dealing with relationships, new context and new meaning,"" he says.

When you feel that anxiety creeping in about an unclear future, ""start with the presumption that life is uncertain,"" says Chopra. ""When you start with that, you welcome the unknown.""

(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)

Berkshire Hathaway's B shares and A shares moved 4.5% higher this week after a strong earnings report last weekend, even as the broader market moved lower amid fears AI stocks are overvalued and worries about weakness for the U.S. economy.

The Nasdaq's 3% drop was its worst weekly decline since April.

The upturn for Berkshire shares has cut its underperformance versus the benchmark S&P 500 to 4.3 percentage points from 12.2 percentage points on October 29.

Operating profits for Berkshire's wholly owned companies were up 34% to almost $13.5 billion in the third quarter, with a 200% increase for insurance underwriting income.

There were again no stock buybacks, a sign Buffett does not think Berkshire shares are significantly undervalued despite their weakness since May.

With no money spent on buying back Berkshire shares and equity sales outpacing purchases, the company's September 30 cash hit $381.7 billion, up 10.9% since the end of June.

If you subtract BNSF's cash and account for the timing of some Treasury bill purchases, the total is $354.3 billion, up 4.3% from June.

Warren Buffett may be delivering his final message as Berkshire's CEO next Monday.

This week the company confirmed in a news release what it told the Wall Street Journal last week.

""On Monday, November 10th, Berkshire will be issuing a press release which will contain a message from Mr. Buffett regarding philanthropy, Berkshire and other matters that Berkshire shareholders and others may find to be of interest.""

The philanthropy part will probably be connected to his annual Thanksgiving contributions to family foundations.

The ""Berkshire and other matters"" portion could be something of a farewell message as he prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the year.

While he will remain chairman of the board, he will not be on stage at next May's meeting and new CEO Greg Abel will be writing the annual letter to shareholders.

Since he appears to be intentionally limiting his future opportunities to speak to shareholders and the rest of the world, Buffett may be ready to have his final say now.

We won't know for sure until next Friday's release of Berkshire's Q3 equity portfolio snapshot, but it looks like there were more sales of Apple shares during the three months ending September 30.

CNBC.com's Yun Li notes Berkshire's 10-Q last Saturday reported a $1.2 billion decline in its cost basis for consumer product stocks, which would include Apple.

She also points out that Apple's 24% gain during the quarter would have provided an opportunity for Buffett to lock in more profits.

Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity holding, currently valued at $75.2 billion, but it has cut the position by 69% over the past two years.

Barron's divides that $1.2 billion cost basis drop by $35, Apple's per-share basis, to estimate Berkshire may have sold 35 million shares for around $8 billion, based on Apple's average price of $230 per share during the quarter.

With Apple reporting in its 10-Q that it had $12.4 billion in Q3 equity sales, Barron's suggests a lot of the remaining $4.4 billion may be Bank of America sales, another big position that Berkshire has been sharply reducing.

That stake has been cut by around 40% since the beginning of last year.

At $32.2 billion, it is Berkshire's third largest equity holding.

Berkshire Hathaway has hired banks to prepare for another yen bond sale, according to Bloomberg and Nikkei.

The company has also filed a preliminary prospectus with the SEC.

It would be the second time this year it has borrowed Japanese yen, a strong indication it plans to keep building its stakes in the ""trading house"" stocks it has been buying since 2019.

That helped lift four of the five stocks this week, with Itochu's 6.5% gain leading the way.

All five of the stocks are at or near all-time highs.

The combined value of Berkshire's reported holdings is approaching $33 billion, up from $31 billion just one month ago.

The figure could be even higher assuming some of Berkshire's continued buying has not yet been publicly revealed.

Berkshire Hathaway has a new warning about YouTube videos with ""images or AI created images impersonating"" Warren Buffett.

A news release Thursday said, ""Generally, such video images of Mr. Buffett may appear to look like him but the sound of the impersonator speaking in a very flat monotone voice is clearly not the voice of Mr. Buffett.""

It added, ""Mr. Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus. Individuals who are less familiar with Mr. Buffett may believe these videos are real and be misled by the contents of these videos.""

In April, a Berkshire release cited unspecified ""reports currently circulating on social media"" about ""comments allegedly made"" by Buffett and said, ""All such reports are false.""

Buffett also warned shareholders at the 2024 Berkshire annual meeting that AI's ability to create fake audio and video could make scamming ""the growth industry of all time.""

Warren Buffett explains why investors should look at their stocks the same way they would look at owning a farm or an apartment.

WARREN BUFFETT: If you have a temperament that when others are fearful, you're going to get scared yourself, you know, you are not going to make a lot of money in securities over time, in all probability.

You know, people really -- if they didn't look at quotations -- but of course, the whole world is urging them to look at quotations, and more than that, do something based on small changes in quotations.

But think how much more rational -- we've talked about it before -- but think how much more rational investing in a farm is than the way many people buy stocks.

If you buy a farm, do you get a quote next week, do you get a quote next month? If you buy an apartment house, do you get a quote next week or month?

No, you look at the apartment house or the farm, and you say, ""I expect it to produce so many bushels of soybeans and corn, and if it does that, it meets my expectations.""

If they buy a stock and they think if it goes up it's wonderful, and if it goes down it's bad.

We think just the opposite. When it goes down, we love it, because we'll buy more. And if it goes up, it kills us to buy more.

And I -- you know -- all kinds -- you know, Ben Graham wrote about it. It's been explained. But if you can't get yourself in that mental attitude, you're going to be scared whenever everybody else is scared.

And to expect somebody else to tell you when to buy and therefore get your courage back up or something, you know --

I could get this fellow's courage up substantially by saying this is a wonderful time to buy, and then a week from now he'd run into somebody else that tells him the world is coming to an end and he'd sell.

I mean, he's a broker's friend, but he's not going to make a lot of money.

In this article

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer has clinched a $10 billion deal for obesity drug developer Metsera, capping a fierce biotech bidding war between the New York-based pharma giant and Danish rival Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk.

Metsera accepted a sweetened offer from Pfizer late on Friday, citing U.S. antitrust risks in Novo's bid that it had previously called superior. The Danish obesity drug behemoth said on Saturday it would exit the race.

The bidding war win hands Pfizer a way into the lucrative obesity drug market, even if Metsera's treatments remain years from hitting the market. It marks a blow for Novo as it tries to claw back lost ground against U.S. rival Eli Lilly.

Pfizer appeared to have locked up the deal in September before Novo jumped in last week with an unsolicited offer, sparking a fight for a coveted asset in the growing weight-loss market. Pfizer is trying to gain a toehold in obesity to overcome past in-house stumbles in developing weight-loss drugs.

Pfizer has agreed to pay $86.25 per share in cash, a premium of 3.69% to Metsera's Friday close, Metsera said in a statement. The offer includes $65.60 per share in cash and a contingent value right entitling holders to additional payments of up to $20.65 per share in cash.

Novo Nordisk on Saturday said it would not be making an increased offer.

""Following a competitive process and after careful consideration, Novo Nordisk will not increase its offer to acquire Metsera,"" the Danish drugmaker said in a statement.

Novo added that it is advancing its own pipeline of treatment options for obesity, and that it would ""continue to assess opportunities for business development and acquisitions ... that further its strategic objectives.""

A source close to Novo said that its last unsuccessful bid had been the ""maximum value"" of Metsera and that the firm remained confident in its own obesity drug pipeline. The deal was never ""do or die"" for Novo.

""This was always a bolt-on acquisition for Novo,"" the person said.

The escalating M&A game sent Metsera's shares surging over the last week. From just before Novo stepped in with its bid through Friday's close, Metsera shares gained nearly 60%, sending its market value to $8.75 billion.

For a time, it appeared Novo had the inside track. Novo has been trying to recover its once-commanding position in obesity drugs that it lost to Eli Lilly.

Metsera, in its Friday statement, said Novo's proposal presented ""unacceptably high legal and regulatory risks"" compared to the proposed merger with Pfizer, citing a call from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to discuss the risks of a transaction with Novo. The regulator sent a letter earlier this week to Novo and Metsera, saying their proposed deal ran the risk of violating U.S. antitrust laws.

Novo said in its statement that it believed that the structure of its offer was ""compliant with antitrust laws"".

In a statement, Pfizer said it was pleased to have reached a revised agreement with Metsera, and expects to close the merger soon after Metsera's November 13 shareholder meeting.

Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen said the $10 billion price rested on optimistic assumptions about the future performance of Metsera, saying Pfizer would need to assume $11 billion in revenue by 2040, nearly double Metsera's current projections. She pointed to growing skepticism around long-term GLP-1 pricing, which could compress margins.

Metsera's board recommended that its shareholders approve the amended Pfizer offer. The biotech company currently loses money and analysts expect additional losses while its drugs are still in development.

The bidding war between Pfizer and Novo lifted the price from Pfizer's $7.3 billion offer in September. Former Pfizer research and development chief John LaMattina told Reuters that the battle was reminiscent of Pfizer's 2000 hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert for $90 billion, an effort to gain control of Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug.

""While this is a smaller deal, Pfizer must believe that Metsera's pipeline is key for its future,"" he said.

Analysts and investors have pointed to the unusually fierce fight to gain control of Metsera, whose early-stage obesity treatments remain unproven but could be key in a market that some analysts estimate will reach $150 billion by early next decade.

""This is a Game of Thrones-level of play,"" Peter Kolchinsky, managing partner at RA Capital, a top-20 Metsera shareholder, said before the final bid was accepted.

Metsera's experimental obesity drugs, MET-097i, a GLP-1 injectable, and MET-233i, which mimics the pancreatic hormone amylin, are projected to reach $5 billion in combined peak sales, according to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger.

Neurodiverse professionals may see unique benefits from artificial intelligence tools and agents, research suggests. With AI agent creation booming in 2025, people with conditions like ADHD, autism, dyslexia and more report a more level playing field in the workplace thanks to generative AI.

A recent study from the UK's Department for Business and Trade found that neurodiverse workers were 25% more satisfied with AI assistants and were more likely to recommend the tool than neurotypical respondents.

""Standing up and walking around during a meeting means that I'm not taking notes, but now AI can come in and synthesize the entire meeting into a transcript and pick out the top-level themes,"" said Tara DeZao, senior director of product marketing at enterprise low-code platform provider Pega. DeZao, who was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, has combination-type ADHD, which includes both inattentive symptoms (time management and executive function issues) and hyperactive symptoms (increased movement).

""I've white-knuckled my way through the business world,"" DeZao said. ""But these tools help so much.""

AI tools in the workplace run the gamut and can have hyper-specific use cases, but solutions like note takers, schedule assistants and in-house communication support are common. Generative AI happens to be particularly adept at skills like communication, time management and executive functioning, creating a built-in benefit for neurodiverse workers who've previously had to find ways to fit in among a work culture not built with them in mind.

Because of the skills that neurodiverse individuals can bring to the workplace — hyperfocus, creativity, empathy and niche expertise, just to name a few — some research suggests that organizations prioritizing inclusivity in this space generate nearly one-fifth higher revenue.

""Investing in ethical guardrails, like those that protect and aid neurodivergent workers, is not just the right thing to do,"" said Kristi Boyd, an AI specialist with the SAS data ethics practice. ""It's a smart way to make good on your organization's AI investments.""

Boyd referred to an SAS study which found that companies investing the most in AI governance and guardrails were 1.6 times more likely to see at least double ROI on their AI investments. But Boyd highlighted three risks that companies should be aware of when implementing AI tools with neurodiverse and other individuals in mind: competing needs, unconscious bias and inappropriate disclosure.

""Different neurodiverse conditions may have conflicting needs,"" Boyd said. For example, while people with dyslexia may benefit from document readers, people with bipolar disorder or other mental health neurodivergences may benefit from AI-supported scheduling to make the most of productive periods. ""By acknowledging these tensions upfront, organizations can create layered accommodations or offer choice-based frameworks that balance competing needs while promoting equity and inclusion,"" she explained.

Regarding AI's unconscious biases, algorithms can (and have been) unintentionally taught to associate neurodivergence with danger, disease or negativity, as outlined in Duke University research. And even today, neurodiversity can still be met with workplace discrimination, making it important for companies to provide safe ways to use these tools without having to unwillingly publicize any individual worker diagnosis.

As businesses take accountability for the impact of AI tools in the workplace, Boyd says it's important to remember to include diverse voices at all stages, implement regular audits and establish safe ways for employees to anonymously report issues.

The work to make AI deployment more equitable, including for neurodivergent people, is just getting started. The nonprofit Humane Intelligence, which focuses on deploying AI for social good, released in early October its Bias Bounty Challenge, where participants can identify biases with the goal of building ""more inclusive communication platforms — especially for users with cognitive differences, sensory sensitivities or alternative communication styles.""

For example, emotion AI (when AI identifies human emotions) can help people with difficulty identifying emotions make sense of their meeting partners on video conferencing platforms like Zoom. Still, this technology requires careful attention to bias by ensuring AI agents recognize diverse communication patterns fairly and accurately, rather than embedding harmful assumptions.

DeZao said her ADHD diagnosis felt like ""somebody turned on the light in a very, very dark room.""

""One of the most difficult pieces of our hyper-connected, fast world is that we're all expected to multitask. With my form of ADHD, it's almost impossible to multitask,"" she said.

DeZao says one of AI's most helpful features is its ability to receive instructions and do its work while the human employee can remain focused on the task at hand. ""If I'm working on something and then a new request comes in over Slack or Teams, it just completely knocks me off my thought process,"" she said. ""Being able to take that request and then outsource it real quick and have it worked on while I continue to work [on my original task] has been a godsend.""

Macro factors like lower consumer demand, higher material and labor costs, and a trend in consumer trade-down to lower margin tire products have applied significant margin and growth pressure. As a result, following a 4.9% decrease in sales for fiscal year 2025 — the second year in a row with a meaningful decline in revenue — the company announced that they are closing approximately 145 underperforming locations. 

Most recently, the company's third-quarter earnings report left a lot of investors disappointed about its strategic transition, with weaker-than-expected revenue and no specific financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Shares fell 16.7% the next day. Lastly, many investors have questioned the company's dividend payout ratio, which has remained relatively large despite these ongoing struggles. 

Putting all this together, it comes as little surprise that shares have underperformed, down 44.73%, 66.73% and 63.25% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, prior to Icahn's announcement.

Perhaps this depressed valuation is what caught the eye of Carl Icahn. He disclosed a 14.79% position in the company (67% of which was acquired since the stock's Oct. 29 downturn), immediately sending the stock up over 15%. 

While there are plenty of cheap stocks, this isn't Icahn taking a flyer on the automotive industry. Icahn has a rich history in the automotive parts and services industry, most notably Icahn Automotive, the automotive segment of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. Icahn knows this industry well and likely sees Monro as a great business that is significantly undervalued. 

The timing of this public engagement is also very notable. It is not just the stock's recent fall that makes this a good entry point for an investor like Icahn. Monro recently agreed to collapse its dual class share structure, which had previously granted its sole Class C shareholder, Peter Solomon, veto power over any matter brought to a shareholder vote, effectively making this a controlled company. Pursuant to its approval in 2023, this collapse will occur prior to the 2026 annual meeting, which is expected to take place next August. 

So, what does this mean for the company's shareholders? It effectively sets the stage for the company being converted from a privately run company to a publicly run company for the benefit of its shareholders. With one person having veto power over all material board decisions, the rest of the board becomes somewhat irrelevant. With this conversion, the company has an opportunity to have a real, collaborative, and productive board. This would require its reconstitution, and we know of nobody better or more experienced than Icahn for that endeavor.

Solomon is an 87-year-old renowned investment banker and Icahn is, well, Icahn and a contemporary of Solomon. However, there is no evidence that the two have ever crossed paths. 

Despite this, we would imagine that they have many relationships in common and mutual respect for each other. While there are many different ways this campaign can go down, what we would like to see is the two elder statesmen meeting in a room with an air of civility and cordiality uncommon in the average activist engagement and together coming up with a board that will oversee management, hold them accountable on behalf of shareholders and usher the company through its first real phase as a truly public company. With Solomon already agreeing to give up control, and neither Solomon nor Icahn likely to be on the continuing board, there is no reason why this should get contentious.

However, we also must address the elephant in the room. Icahn has built his automotive industry on acquisitions, and Monro appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. 

Icahn has launched activist campaigns at some of the auto companies that he later went on to acquire, including Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: ""We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities, thereby benefiting customers, manufacturing partners and employees, as well as our shareholders."" 

While we sincerely believe that Icahn's main motivation for this investment is to invest in a good company that he believes is at an inflection point and is significantly undervalued, there is always the chance that he might want to own the entire company one day. This is a very small position for him and a good return would not move the needle as much as a synergistic integration into his automative business, but we see no reason why both things cannot be true.

Many restaurants may need to rethink their mandatory gratuity policies if they want this income to count as qualified tips for their workers under the new tax laws.

The ""no tax on tips"" provision in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in ""qualified tips"" per year from 2025 through 2028. The rub is that mandatory gratuities, the 15% to 20% that restaurants often impose on parties of six people or more, aren't eligible for the deduction, a disappointment to the restaurant and foodservice industry, which held out hope for a different outcome.

The industry is the country's second-largest private-sector employer, providing 15.7 million jobs, or 10% of the total U.S. workforce, according to a data brief from the National Restaurant Association based on the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.

The service fee issue is sure to resonate with many restaurateurs. Research from the National Restaurant Association shows that 54% of full-service operators — including 67% of fine-dining operators — say their restaurants sometimes add a service charge or automatic gratuity to customer checks. Among this group, 12% add the service charge or automatic gratuity to all checks, while 88% only add it to parties that exceed a specific number of people (typically six or more) or to banquets, private events or catering events. 

Notably, the Internal Revenue Service has never considered these service fees as tips. However, the restaurant industry hasn't necessarily followed the letter of the law, according to Jean Hagan, a partner at Eisner Advisory Group who focuses on the restaurant industry. 

Hagan said during a recent webinar for a large state restaurant association, many proprietors were surprised to learn they weren't supposed to be counting service fees as tips. ""They've just always been doing it a certain way — passing on the service fees to employees as a tip,"" Hagan said. 

Now, however, restaurants will have to put all tips through payroll, even if they weren't doing it before, or were incorrectly including service fees, so that the employee can benefit from the deduction. There will be more pressure on restaurants to do it properly. ""They've got to clean their systems up and follow the law as it's always been,"" Hagan said. ""If they don't, the employee won't get the full benefit of the new tax law."" 

Some advocates for the restaurant industry have been lobbying to change the way service fees are treated. They'd like to see automatic gratuities included as tips. The Culinary Union in Nevada, for example, submitted formal recommendations to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS that automatic gratuities and suggested tips both be treated as eligible tip income. Separately, several members of Congress from Nevada had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to ensure that automatic gratuities are deemed eligible for the tips deduction. 

""Functionally, for employees, there is no distinction between auto-gratuity and a tip, and inclusion of this income as eligible will prevent arbitrary distinctions between tip practices that would disadvantage workers based solely on the business model of their employer,"" lawmakers wrote in an Aug. 12 letter.

However, upending the long-standing distinction between service fees and tips doesn't appear likely. In September, the IRS issued proposed rules on the new ""no tax on tips"" deduction. The rules aren't final yet, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room, since the language within the OBBBA is unambiguous — the tip has to be voluntary. ""Congressional intent is pretty clear,"" said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""What's unclear is how restaurants respond to that,"" he added. 

Some restaurants are taking a wait-and-see approach.

""Restaurant operators are watching closely for the final 'No Tax on Tips' rules from the IRS and will evaluate any shift in their restaurant's current policies on tipping so that it best suits their tipped employees' desires,"" Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, wrote in an email.

""These employees have chosen a restaurant job because of the income potential they get from tipping, so operators want to make sure that they can take full advantage of the tax credit while it is available to them,"" he wrote.

Some restaurants are ""consulting with their accountants, point-of-sale providers, and teams to determine what approach works best for their business and employees,"" said a spokesperson for the Texas Restaurant Association.

Some business owners may decide to make changes for competitive reasons. ""For restaurants who use the commission-based model or utilize service charges, those servers would likely consider it a disadvantage to forego $25,000 of tax-free income when they could potentially move to a restaurant that does not utilize service charges and are therefore eligible for tax-free tips up to $25,000,"" said a spokesperson for The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.

Even though the regulations regarding these rules are not yet final, industry participants aren't expecting much to change with respect to service fees and tip eligibility. At a hearing in October, the IRS reiterated that it is maintaining the stance that service fees aren't eligible for the deduction, said Scott Klein, senior manager of tax policy and advocacy for the American Institute of CPAs, who attended the hearing. That's not likely to change in the final regulations, he said.

In its September guidance, the IRS offered several examples of how restaurants can respond so their employees can eke out the most benefit from the deduction under the rules. ""If a customer is expressly provided an option to disregard or modify amounts added to a bill, such amounts are not mandatory amounts,"" the guidance states. 

Say, for example, that a restaurant's menu states that an automatic 18% charge will be added to all bills for parties of six or more customers. Even if the restaurant distributes this amount to waitstaff, it is not a qualified tip for purposes of the deduction, the IRS said. However, if the restaurant adds a line labeled ""additional tip amount"" and the customer adds in an amount equal to 2% of the price for food and beverages, the 2% can be considered a qualified tip.

Another option would be for the restaurant to include a ""recommended tip"" equal to 18% of the price for food and beverages, and include a line for the customer to subtract (including to zero) or add to the recommended tip amount before paying the bill. Say the customer subtracts 3% from the recommended tip amount, resulting in a tip of 15%. The 15% amount that the customer voluntarily paid is a qualified tip in this scenario, according to the IRS.

In another example provided by the IRS, a server presents a customer's bill on an electronic handheld point-of-sale device, which offers the option to pay 15%, 18%, 20%, other, or no tip. Because the customer has a right to determine the additional amount and was expressly provided the option to leave no tip, the amount chosen is a qualified tip. If, however, the customer was not given an option to modify the amount or leave zero tip, the amount selected would not be a qualified tip for purposes of the deduction.

As restaurant owners and employees weigh their options, the clock is ticking. Because President Trump's OBBBA is so new, and the IRS is still crafting the applicable regulations, the situation is complicated for restaurants and other businesses whose employees want to claim a deduction for 2025. The AICPA had asked the Treasury Department and the IRS to include a safe harbor for businesses for this tax year, which the IRS issued in early November. This means employers will not face penalties for ""failing to provide a separate accounting of any amounts reasonably designated as cash tips or the occupation of the person receiving such tips.""

This safe harbor only applies to tax year 2025.

Cardsmiths' New Currency Cards Include Over $500K in Real Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum

collectibles

After multiple collectors pulled Bitcoin redemption cards from previous sets, trading card manufacturer Cardsmiths released its latest Currency Series set with five cards that are redeemable for 1 full Bitcoin apiece—more than $100,000 each as of this writing.

Currency Series 5 went up for sale on the firm's website and via select retailers on Wednesday, offering its largest-ever selection of crypto redemption cards, which allow collectors to redeem real amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. 

“Demand for Currency Series 5 has exceeded all prior releases. Interest has been both broader and deeper than with any previous Currency set,” Cardsmiths CEO Steven Loney told Decrypt.

The latest series of cards can be purchased for as little as $37 for a box containing two packs, with each pack containing 5 trading cards. Cards redeemable for crypto can be found in approximately 1 of every 96 packs according to data shared on the product page.

Beyond enhancing its redeemables, Cardsmiths also added a non-redeemable 1/1 Bitcoin trading card to Currency Series 5 to stand as a premier collectible from the set. 

The manufacturer also worked with artists like Gunship Revolution Studios, Jon McTavish, and noted street artist Mr. Brainwash to add a distinctive visual presence to the cards. 

“From the beginning, our goal was to create truly unique 'One of One' cards for each Currency release. Bitcoin remains the most recognized and valuable cryptocurrency, so it was a natural choice for this concept,” Loney said.

Collectors have been cashing in on Cardsmiths' currency redemption offerings over the last year, turning packs worth around $30 into over $100,000 thanks to Bitcoin's rise. 

In February, a user found a full Bitcoin redemption card from a $50 pack of the Holiday Currency set, netting them more than six figures in profits if they opted to sell after redemption. 

In August, a GameStop patron found a Bitcoin redemption card that was valued around $115,000 at the time from a pack that cost around $13. Other GameStop customers have shared similar stories thanks to the video game retailer turned collectible firm offering Cardsmiths' products.

Supplies of Currency Series 5 are still available on the manufacturer's website as of Friday afternoon. The firm has partnered with BitPay to allow users to pay with coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Circle's dollar-backed stablecoin, USDC. 

As for Cardsmiths' future crypto ambitions, collectors can expect more Currency sets ahead.

“Currency is our tentpole IP, and development on future sets, including Currency Series 6, is already underway,” said Loney. “We have a good handful of exciting launches on the horizon.”

Oops, something went wrong

While Bitcoin and Ethereum funds shed assets, Bitwise's fledgling Solana ETF racked up more than $126 million in net inflows in its first full week of trading, an auspicious sign for the SOL-tracking product and potentially for other altcoin funds.

The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has generated more than $545 million in net inflows since its October 28 debut on the New York Stock Exchange, including $223 million in seed investments, according to UK asset manager Farside Investments. BSOL's share price closed up 5% in Friday trading.

""Inflows every day for the last 8 days since its launch,"" crypto asset manager Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsely wrote in an X post early Friday. ""Over $500,000,000 in total. It's clear investors want Solana exposure.""

Over that period, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have lost more than $2.1 billion in assets, while net outflows for the nine Ethereum funds have totaled $579 million. The Bitwise Solana fund's promising start comes even as SOL's price has been dropping, part of a market-wide downturn tied to a government shutdown and other macroeconomic uncertainties.

Solana was recently trading at $156, off more than 16% for the past week and nearly 29% over the last month, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. Bitcoin has declined about 16% since early October when it rose to a record high above $126,000.

A Myriad prediction market found that only 13% of respondents expect Solana to surpass its record high of $293 by year's end. Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt. 

In a text to Decrypt, etf.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy wrote ""the (Solana) inflows make sense,"" noting the token's massive $90 billion market value: ""Solana has a devoted following, arguably the most devoted following after Bitcoin and Ethereum.""

He added: ""It wouldn't be surprising to see Solana ETFs collectively account for 5% of that market cap at the very least. So in that context, $500M is still small. The fact that BSOL launched with 100% staking certainly made it more attractive as well.""

The listing of the Bitwise fund and a Grayscale Solana ETF last week surprised some hopeful observers, who had feared the current government shutdown would delay a regulatory process that had already taken months.

But the NYSE certified 8-A filings that offered the fund managers an alternative route to the recent ETF approval process. Issuers file these forms with the SEC to register certain securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The funds met the generic listing standards adopted by the SEC in September for commodity-based trusts. The Grayscale Solana Trust ETF (GSOL) has received about $114 million in net inflows, most of them in seed investments.

Bitcoin Dips Below $100K in 'Mid-Cycle Shakeout' Amid Bond Market Volatility

Last week, spot Litecoin and Hedera funds from Canary began trading after the Nasdaq certified their 8-A submissions. Other altcoin-focused funds benefiting from the same SEC rule change may soon also be available to investors.

In a Thursday filing to the agency, Bitwise removed a ""delaying amendment"" from its S-1 prospectus for the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. The fund could begin trading in a few as 20 days from the submission if the SEC doesn't object.

""Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention,"" Eric Balchunas wrote in an X post on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

A retired teacher says a Bitcoin scam took her life savings — and now she might lose her home. The warning she wants everyone to hear. 7's Heather Walker has this exclusive investigation.

Karla Kelley thought she had set herself up for a nice, comfortable retirement after 30 years of teaching.

Karla Kelley, Bitcoin ATM scam victim: “I had worked all my life to get to a point where I had no debt.”

But one phone call changed that.

Karla Kelley: “They put a fear into me, it's like, ‘Oh, my gosh.'”

Karla says she got an email about her PayPal account and was given a phone number to call. That's when she got the bad news.

Karla Kelley: “Your account is in jeopardy; somebody has got your identity.”

The man on the phone said her account was hacked and criminals now had access to her bank accounts. So, she needed to take steps to protect her money.

Karla Kelley: “The guy asked me how much I have in my savings account, and I said, ‘$5,000.' He said ‘OK, take the $5,000 and put it into it,'” and he gave me a bitcoin machine.”

The man told her to take her money out of the bank and put it in bitcoin, but the man wasn't done. Over the coming weeks, he claimed to be working with the police and said all of her bank and investment accounts were in danger of being stolen.

Heather Walker: “I know people are going to be watching and say, ‘How did she fall for this?'”

Karla Kelley: “I know it, I know it. If I was watching me, I would be saying the same thing. It's the fear.”

Scammers use fear to steal billions of dollars from people all across the country.

Karla Kelley: “In the very beginning, they told me you cannot tell anybody because it could jeopardize the investigation. So I'm like, ‘Well, all right, the FBI knows what they are doing. I certainly don't want to jeopardize their investigation.' So I didn't say anything to my daughter, my friends, and I lived with 14 months with this fear and anxiety.”

Experts say the crooks know exactly how to manipulate their victims.

Karen Murillo, AARP Florida: “This is not something to be ashamed or embarrassed about. This is a game of numbers for the scammers; they are targeting us at a crazy rate these days.”

The actual number of victims is unknown because many people never report the crime.

A police body camera was rolling as this Texas woman inserted her life savings into a bitcoin atm. Not stopping, even when the police arrived.

These Bitcoin ATMs are a huge problem. Florida has more than 3,000 of them in stores across the state, and none of them are regulated.

Karen Murillo: “These scammers are exploiting the lack of consumer protections.”

There is no daily transaction limit, and most of the time when the money is sent, it's gone instantly — because only the scammers have access to the cryptocurrency.

Karen Murillo: “It's devastating, and Florida needs more protections.”

AARP Florida is pushing lawmakers to regulate Bitcoin ATMs and require the owners to pay back people whose money is stolen.

It's too late for Karla. Her money is gone, and now she could lose her home.

Karla Kelley: “I've raised my daughter here, we've had Christmas, Thanksgiving, people all out on the patio, you know, we have a lot of memories here.”

Her daughter is trying to help – using social media to raise funds and warn others. She started a GoFundMe.

Now, with help from her family and friends, Karla is trying to rebuild her life.

Karla Kelley: “I can't blame myself because I'm a trusting person. I thought I was doing the right thing.”

Her lesson to others – if anyone asks you to put money in a bitcoin ATM – stop and call police.

Bitcoin Dips Below $100K in 'Mid-Cycle Shakeout' Amid Bond Market Volatility

Last week, spot Litecoin and Hedera funds from Canary began trading after the Nasdaq certified their 8-A submissions. Other altcoin-focused funds benefiting from the same SEC rule change may soon also be available to investors.

In a Thursday filing to the agency, Bitwise removed a ""delaying amendment"" from its S-1 prospectus for the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. The fund could begin trading in a few as 20 days from the submission if the SEC doesn't object.

""Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention,"" Eric Balchunas wrote in an X post on Thursday.

After weeks of steady decline, Ethereum is finally showing some strength, bouncing back near the $3,460 level. But not everyone is convinced the worst is over. Prominent crypto analyst Ted warns that this sudden recovery might be a “false signal,” suggesting that Ethereum could face one more big drop before a real rebound begins.

Here's how low the ETH price can go.

Short Squeeze or Real Reversal?

While Ethereum's recent 5% daily jump has given traders a brief sense of relief, crypto analyst Ted suggests that this move is likely driven by short liquidations rather than real buying interest. 

He noted that many traders who bet against Ethereum have been forced to close their positions, creating a quick price push that looks like a rally but lacks strong market support.

And the numbers back it up, over $133.83 million worth of ETH positions were liquidated, wiping out both over-leveraged longs and shorts, temporarily boosting prices. But Ted warns that this is a common trap, a short-term bounce before another drop.

Ethereum Price To Drop To $2800 Level

Despite the temporary bounce, the trader insists that Ethereum's market structure still looks heavy. In his view, the earlier drop wasn't the final one, just a pause before the “real move” down. 

His chart highlights strong resistance zones between $3,700 and $3,800, where Ethereum has repeatedly failed to break higher. Until these levels flip into support, the market remains under bearish pressure.

But for now, Ted expects another potential drop toward the $2,900–$3,200 zone, which has acted as a key support area before. 

If that level breaks, Ethereum could slide even further, possibly to around $2,800, before finding solid ground.

Key Level to Watch: $3200

For now, Ted is watching the $3,200 mark closely. Holding above it could give Ethereum's bulls a chance to rebuild momentum. But if it slips below, another wave of selling could follow.

As of now, ETH is trading around $3446, reflecting a 5.2% jump seen in the last 24 hours

Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The once-quiet corridors of digital currency are now teeming with excitement—and it's all thanks to a surge of altcoins that are catching the spotlight. Let's talk Dino altcoins; specifically, Internet Computer (ICP) and Polkadot (DOT) — two giants that are turning heads as traders sift through the price movements and market trends. As the waves of volatility roll in, grasping these market dynamics can open avenues to lucrative investment strategies.

In the thrilling rush of cryptocurrency, Dino altcoins are making quite a splash. Just recently, Internet Computer (ICP) made headlines with an incredible 200% surge within a week—a sight that has enticed a flurry of investors mesmerized by its bullish fractal formations. Following closely, Polkadot (DOT) is showing its own signs of vitality, experiencing a healthy 16% uptick in a short burst, prompting speculation about potential similar ascents.

Diving deeper into the analytics toolbox, the Power of 3 model emerges as a guiding star, delineating three pivotal phases: accumulation, manipulation, and expansion. Viewed through this lens, Internet Computer has successfully completed its journey and is in the midst of an expansion phase. Meanwhile, Polkadot's trading indicates a parallel path, suggesting it might soon leap into its own expansion phase after establishing a solid foothold above the $3.24 support line. Should this positive momentum endure, traders could have sights set on an ambitious target near $7.06—a staggering 111% upside from its recent lows.

While the charts pulse with promising trends, overall market sentiment walks a cautious line. Conversations swirling in various communities reflect a mixture of optimism and skepticism about Polkadot's trajectory. Even amidst recent gains, uncertainty lingers, making room for trepidation among investors, as questions loom regarding both tokenomics and external pressures that could stymie growth. 

For those stepping into the altcoin arena, mastering breakout patterns is imperative for seizing the right buying moments. Technical analysis serves as more than a mere lens for price movements; it pulls back the curtain on the underlying forces at play. Currently, Polkadot dangles just below its 200-day moving average—the upcoming resistance at this threshold could dictate whether it embarks on a sustained recovery or falls prey to deeper bearish retreat.

Neglecting the complexities of altcoin trading can lead to disastrous oversimplifications. Many of these projects navigate a rocky landscape that demands robust compliance frameworks and astute capital management. It's essential to balance the thrill of price surges with a firm grasp of the operational realities faced by Web3 ventures if lasting success is to be secured.

As the crypto world experiences its highs and lows, a steady hand among investors is paramount. The euphoric dance of rising altcoin prices shouldn't overshadow the lurking risks woven into the fabric of market volatility. An overreliance on technical analysis may gloss over critical external factors and regulatory hurdles that can imperil price stability.

The meteoric rise of Dino altcoins like Internet Computer and Polkadot showcases a captivating blend of exuberance and caution. As the cryptocurrency universe shakes off the dust and embraces this wave, investors must keep their wits about them, navigating the thin line between seizing opportunities and grappling with systemic challenges. A nuanced understanding of market dynamics, coupled with well-thought-out investment strategies, is key to fostering resilience within the tumultuous sphere of cryptocurrency. 

In the end, while the charisma of altcoins promises substantial rewards, an all-encompassing approach that acknowledges both market volatility and operational hurdles is vital for thriving in this exhilarating landscape.

Written by Oluwapelumi Adejumo

Edited by Mohammad Shahid

Bitcoin hovered around the $100,000 mark through the weekend as traders searched for signs of recovery across the broader crypto market. Its muted performance contrasted with sharper advances among select altcoins, where fresh liquidity clustered around decentralized infrastructure and privacy-focused assets.

Data from Santiment showed that several mid-cap tokens, including Filecoin, DASH, Internet Computer Protocol, and Zcash, outpaced the market. Their rally underscored how traders have shifted toward narratives with clearer fundamental catalysts while Bitcoin remained locked in a narrow range.

According to BeInCrypto data, Filecoin led the recent surge, with the storage token jumping more than 60% in the past 24 hours to roughly $3.47, its highest level since February. 

The move extended a broader rotation into the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) sector. In that sector, Filecoin has positioned itself as a modular data layer for Web3 and AI workloads.

Notably, assets in this sector gained additional traction after Amazon Web Services suffered a multi-hour outage in October, which disrupted major platforms, including Coinbase and Robinhood. 

The event reignited debate around centralized cloud dependencies and strengthened the case for hybrid, decentralized infrastructure.

Meanwhile, Messari data shows that Filecoin recently celebrated its fifth anniversary with a rise in developer activity and new milestones.

“Originally focused on incentivized cold storage, the network has expanded to support smart contract programmability through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), enabling applications in DeFi, data management, and decentralized autonomous organizations,” Messari wrote.

So, traders who had been waiting for a broader market impulse instead rotated into assets with narrative-driven momentum.

At the same time, privacy tokens also picked up new flows. 

For context, Zcash reached a multi-year high of approximately $712 on November 7 before retreating to the mid-$500s.

The correction marked its first major pullback since a sustained rally that began in early autumn, yet the token remains significantly higher on the year.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said ZEC has become the second-largest liquid position in his family office, Maelstrom. 

Due to the rapid ascent in price, $ZEC is now the 2nd largest *LIQUID* holding in @MaelstromFund portfolio behind $BTC.

His comments helped fuel interest in privacy-focused settlement and trading. That demand has re-emerged as an alternative to increasingly visible, compliance-heavy payment rails.

Dash followed a similar pattern, reaching multi-year highs above $100 alongside rising privacy-transaction volumes and renewed developer engagement. 

Market analysts tracking sector-wide flows note that capital rotated into privacy and infrastructure tokens. They argue these assets offered clearer catalysts than Bitcoin's consolidation phase.

Whether this marks the early stages of an altseason remains uncertain. However, the speed of inflows and the focus of traders suggest that positioning is now happening ahead of potential catalysts rather than in response to them.

Crypto markets began the weekend on a steady note, with the Bitcoin price hovering near $102,000 and traders closely watching altcoins for momentum. After a week of mixed ETF inflows and muted macroeconomic triggers, the market appears to be entering a consolidation phase—characterized by stability in major indices and bursts of activity in select gainers. 

As volatility compresses across large caps, smaller tokens like Filecoin FILUSDT, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance FETUSDT, and Internet Computer ICPUSDT have emerged as standout performers, signaling renewed speculative interest among retail traders.

Bitcoin BTCUSDT traded in a narrow range between $101,500 and $102,300, while Ether ETHUSDT held slightly above $3,450, showing early signs of stabilization after midweek pressure. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $3.45 trillion, down about 0.4% in the past 24 hours. 

Market Sentiment & Technical Snapshot

Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index steady at 25 (Fear)—suggesting confidence despite subdued price action. On the technical front, BTC's consolidation above $100,000 support indicates accumulation, while resistance at $112,000 continues to cap short-term upside. Analysts point to this range as a potential “coil phase” that could precede a decisive move next week.

ETH mirrors Bitcoin's pattern, with resistance near $3,700 likely to dictate near-term momentum. Meanwhile, top gainers such as FIL (+45%), FET (+37%), and ICP (+23%) have outperformed the broader market, underscoring a shift in trader attention toward high-beta assets. The sudden rotation into these smaller tokens reflects increased appetite for risk as large-cap volatility declines.

Broader Context & Outlook

Recent ETF data shows net inflows turning positive after midweek outflows, suggesting institutional confidence remains intact. Macroeconomic cues have also been mildly supportive, with softer U.S. Treasury yields and a weaker dollar helping crypto assets stabilize after last week's pullback.

Analysts say the market is entering a two-speed phase—Bitcoin and Ether consolidating, while altcoins and niche sectors experience sharper short-term moves. If BTC manages to clear the $110,500 level, momentum could quickly broaden across the market, setting the tone for mid-November.

For now, traders expect range-bound movement over the weekend with bursts of volatility driven by emerging gainers—a familiar setup in crypto's pre-rally consolidation phases.

Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade will activate on the blockchain's mainnet on December 3, according to the Ethereum Foundation.

The goal? To enable Ethereum to handle the large transaction traffic from its layer 2 chains, blockchains with a $47 billion on-chain economy built on top of Ethereum. Those chains inherit the base layer's security architecture while offering faster and cheaper transactions.

“Fusaka's biggest impact comes from improvements to data availability through PeerDAS, which should make rollups cheaper and more scalable,” Nick Johnson, founder and lead developer of Ethereum Naming Service, ENS, told DL News.

Fusaka is the latest checkpoint in Ethereum's development plan. Developers are attempting to scale the $410 billion blockchain so that it can handle 100,000 transactions per second, a massive increase from its current maximum of 30 transactions per second. It follows the Pectra upgrade that the developers released in May.

PeerDAS is one of 12 changes to the blockchain included in the Fusaka upgrade package. It targets the data load needed for verifying transactions from layer 2 blockchains.

Layer 2 chains bundle thousands of transactions and submit summaries, called blobs, to the Ethereum base layer. Nodes running on the base layer currently have to download the entire blob data to check for validity.

That process becomes more expensive for nodes as layer 2 transactions soar. It also creates a data traffic jam on the base layer.

PeerDAS solves the problem by reducing the data load for nodes when verifying layer 2 transactions. Instead of downloading the whole blob, nodes only need to check random samples within the blob data to verify transactions.

Leo Fan, co-founder of Cysic, a zero-knowledge-based blockchain, describes Fusaka as a “deep infrastructural shift” for Ethereum, which could increase the chain's throughput eightfold.

The reduced data load could result in a significant reduction in bandwidth costs for nodes. Experts like Shiv Shankar, CEO of Boundless, a zero-knowledge scalability protocol, said that this could help improve Ethereum's efficiency.

“It lets Ethereum handle more activity, which is good for developers building apps,” Shankar told DL News.

However, Fusaka doesn't aim to supercharge Ethereum's layer 2 chains alone. It also includes improvements that directly impact the base layer.

The 12 EIPs include two upgrades that directly aim to stretch the base layer's block and data limits. EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals, are blueprints vetted by Ethereum developers that codify changes to the blockchain.

These upgrades allow for more transaction processing capacity and increase the number of blobs that layer 2 chains can submit to the main chain.

All transactions would “eventually” run on blockchain rails, according to Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters.

“Our belief, which I think is shared by the leadership of Hong Kong, is that pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually, and that all money will be digital,” Winters said Monday at Hong Kong FinTech Week. “Think about what that means: a complete rewiring of the financial system.”

Winters added that it was not yet clear how this rewiring would be done, which made experimentation supported in Hong Kong all the more critical.

Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen

Hong Kong has worked to become a blockchain and cryptocurrency hub since at least 2022. In 2024, the region launched a tokenization sandbox, which has seen participation from Standard Chartered. This year, the region has also passed a stablecoin bill, offering guidance and clarity to prospective issuers.

Standard Chartered in February announced a partnership with cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm Animoca Brands to launch a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin.

Winters on Monday said HKD-backed stablecoins could play an “interesting” role in international trade, as they are linked to the Chinese government but are still “tightly managed against the U.S. dollar.”

Meanwhile, Hong Kong is not the only region opening its doors to tokenization and stablecoins. In April, the U.S. enacted stablecoin rules. Meanwhile, the country's Securities and Exchange Commission has unveiled “Project Crypto,” an initiative to enable financial markets to move on-chain.

Amid the global regulatory tilt, several leaders in finance have shown rising optimism about the blockchain sectors.

Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev last month likened tokenization to a “freight train,” adding that “it can't be stopped and eventually it's going to eat the entire financial system.”

XRP reclaims $2.30 amid Nasdaq CEO's claim that blockchain could unlock trillions in trapped capital.

XRP is showing signs of renewed strength after reclaiming $2.30, with major support levels in place, signaling potential for an imminent upward breakout, according to on-chain analytics from VOGs.

XRP has spent the past few weeks consolidating in a tight range, building trader confidence and signaling stability. With rising institutional interest, this steady accumulation sets the stage for a potential breakout, echoing patterns that have historically preceded major crypto rallies.

VOGs identifies $3.50 as a key target for XRP, suggesting that a breakout above this level could signal a new upward trend. 

Notably, XRP is trading around $2.31, drawing keen attention from both retail and institutional investors. With momentum building, a push toward $3.50 may be just around the corner.

At the recent Ripple Swell conference, Nasdaq CEO Diana delivered a compelling message about the transformative power of blockchain in modern finance. 

“Trillions in capital are trapped, blockchain can set it free,” she stated, drawing attention to inefficiencies in the current financial system.





Diana emphasized that the existing financial plumbing, the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that moves money globally, is slow, fragmented, and laden with intermediaries. 

From cross-border transactions to corporate treasury operations, the process is often bogged down by delays, fees, and a lack of transparency. According to her, this results in enormous amounts of capital effectively “locked up,” unable to flow freely to areas where it could generate economic value.

“The challenge isn't a lack of capital,” Diana explained, “it's how that capital moves through the system. There's just so much trapped, waiting to be utilized more efficiently.” She argued that by leveraging blockchain technology, financial institutions could streamline these processes, reduce intermediaries, and increase liquidity.

Blockchain's inherent features, decentralization, transparency, and real-time settlement, allow for more direct movement of assets across borders and institutions. This could potentially unlock trillions of dollars currently tied up in slow or opaque processes. 

For businesses and investors, the implications are significant: faster payments, lower costs, and more efficient capital allocation could drive growth and innovation across industries.

Diana also highlighted Ripple's role in pioneering blockchain solutions for financial institutions, noting that scalable blockchain networks could provide the infrastructure necessary for global capital mobility. 

By implementing digital assets and blockchain-based settlement systems, banks and corporations could access liquidity in ways previously thought impossible, bringing a new level of efficiency to global finance.

The Nasdaq CEO's comments underscore a growing consensus in the financial world: blockchain is not just a speculative tool but a foundational technology capable of reshaping capital flows. If implemented thoughtfully, it could release trapped capital, empower businesses, and redefine how value moves around the world.

As Diana concluded, “If we do it right, we can actually deliver more capital to the system.” 

Her remarks signal a pivotal moment for both traditional finance and the blockchain ecosystem, pointing to a future where money moves faster, smarter, and more transparently than ever before.

Trading near $2.30 with solid support and rising ETF speculation, XRP is poised for a potential breakout toward $3.50. Strong technicals, growing institutional interest, and market accumulation signal that its next move could set the tone for the months ahead, making it a focal point for bullish investors.

At Ripple Swell, Fredman emphasizes a pivotal moment for global finance. Blockchain can unlock trillions in trapped capital, boost liquidity, and drive faster economic growth by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional systems. 

Beyond speed and transparency, it has the power to reshape how money moves, creating a more efficient, inclusive, and dynamic financial ecosystem. Thoughtful implementation could transform not just transactions, but the very flow of global capital.

Solana price predictions gain traction as DeFi and NFT growth fuel optimism for a $250 breakout. Analysts see SOL's strong momentum continuing, while Remittix (RTX) emerges as a promising payments token challenger.

The Solana price narrative is heating up as DeFi and NFT data indicate the network may be poised for a breakout, while many Layer-1 rivals fall behind. Analysts believe SOL could push towards $250, particularly if usage metrics continue to climb and technical levels are cleared. 

Meanwhile, payments infrastructure token Remittix (RTX) is quietly carving out a high-utility niche that could drive a bigger breakout than Solana.



Usage metrics for Solana are eye-catching. The network processed over 70 million daily transactions and recorded roughly $143 billion in DEX volume for October 2025. This surpasses many rivals. 

At the same time, Solana's architecture gives it the raw speed to capitalize on DeFi demands. It offers a single-layer throughput of 1,100 TPS and a robust validator structure. This means the Solana price story is not just speculative.

Solana is backed by real network activity. If the growing on-chain engagement sustains, the odds that the Solana price could push toward $250 improve significantly.

On the technical front, SOL is at a make-or-break point. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $179–$190 recently failed to hold its position. This signals a temporary structural challenge.  However, underpinned by usage strength, the Solana price remains within an ascending bias in mid-term charts.

Analysts caution that slipping below $138 or $120 could lead to further losses. However, Ted Pillows notes that SOL has cleared almost all downside liquidity. Yet, a strong upward move depends on BTC's recovery.

If buying volume returns and Bitcoin recovers, the Solana price could target $220 in the short term and $250 in the medium term. Solana price is currently $157.



While Solana shows DeFi and NFT growth, Remittix (RTX) is tackling real-world payments, a narrative that could create 2025's biggest breakout. It's offering quick, transparent, and private cross-border payments. Remittix supports over 30 countries and 40 digital assets. It has CertiK-verified smart contracts and is running an active $250,000 Gleam giveaway. Early adopters are already testing key features as the Beta wallet is now live in testing.

The project has already raised $28 million in private funding and confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, drawing attention from both institutional and retail investors. Analysts say its strong fundamentals and expanding PayFi ecosystem could make RTX one of the best-performing digital assets in 2025. 

Remittix could see a realistic target of $2.5 from its current price of $0.0166 as adoption scales. This represents a roughly 20x increase, positioning it as the next big breakout, outpacing Solana.

More than 130 countries, covering almost 98% of global GDP, are now developing or testing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). 

What started as small pilots has turned into a full-scale race to digitize money. As CBDCs move closer to launch, one big question hangs over the crypto market – will they replace cryptocurrencies, or can both exist side by side?

The Global Shift Toward Digital Money

The push for CBDCs is driven by three goals – faster payments, financial inclusion, and control over digital money. Countries like China (e-CNY), the Eurozone (Digital Euro), Nigeria (eNaira), and the Bahamas (Sand Dollar) are already leading the charge.

2025-2028 could mark a major turning point as CBDC pilots turn into real rollouts. The Atlantic Council's CBDC Tracker now lists a record 49 active pilots, showing just how fast governments are moving toward national digital currencies.

CBDCs and Crypto: Two Sides of the Same Coin?

CBDCs and cryptocurrencies might look similar, but they're built on completely different ideas.

CBDCs are centralized, state-backed, and designed for stability. Crypto, on the other hand, is decentralized and permissionless, built around the idea of financial freedom.

Still, some experts see a way for both to exist. RevBit notes that CBDCs could actually help crypto by familiarizing people with digital wallets and blockchain payments. If people start using digital currencies issued by central banks, they might be more open to exploring Bitcoin or DeFi later.

The Concerns: Control, Privacy, and Regulation

That said, many in the crypto world aren't convinced. While clearer rules could bring legitimacy, CBDCs might also push regulators toward stricter KYC and AML checks – tightening control at the cost of privacy.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found in a 2025 paper that “more positive central-bank CBDC sentiment is associated with negative impacts on cryptocurrency market returns.” 

Community sentiment also reflects that worry. A Reddit discussion in November showed that most users view CBDCs negatively, mainly over privacy concerns and fears of state surveillance. 

As one user said, “We really don't want CBDCs… they're the inverse of crypto.”

 Still, a few voices believe both can coexist – CBDCs for daily payments, crypto for investment and independence.

Banks Could Feel the Heat Too

It's not just crypto that could face disruption. A report titled “CBDC and Banks: Disintermediating Fast and Slow” warns that retail CBDCs could pull deposits away from banks, forcing them to rethink how they lend and operate.

The Middle Ground

Despite all the tension, some researchers believe coexistence is the only practical outcome. A few studies argue that CBDCs could handle regulated digital cash while crypto continues to serve privacy and global transfer roles.

So, are CBDCs good or bad for crypto? Probably both. They'll tighten regulation, increase competition, and change how money moves but they'll also push more people toward digital finance.

The real question is no longer if CBDCs are coming, but whether crypto can evolve fast enough to stay relevant in a world where every government wants a piece of the blockchain.

FAQs

CBDCs won't fully replace crypto. They serve different roles, so both are likely to coexist as digital payments grow.

CBDCs are government controlled and stable, while cryptocurrencies are decentralized and offer open, borderless use.

CBDCs may reduce privacy because they allow closer oversight of transactions, which worries many crypto users.

CBDCs could boost awareness of digital wallets, making it easier for newcomers to explore crypto over time.

Retail CBDCs might pull deposits from banks, pushing them to adjust how they lend and manage customer relationships.

                              November 08, 2025                            

ISLAMABAD: Pakistanis are estimated to have invested $20-30 billion in asset-backed crypto instruments, experts told the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Conference on Friday, The News reported. 

They projected that crypto trading by Pakistanis could reach $300 billion — a figure approaching the country's approximately $400 billion in GDP.

The experts stressed these figures are indicative only, given the absence of a legal framework to regulate or document crypto activity, which leaves the true scale unverified. 

They warned Pakistan risks forfeiting $25 billion in economic opportunities if it delays regulating cryptocurrencies and virtual assets, urging a swift but cautious approach to avoid falling behind in global adoption.

They cautioned that weak regulations and cybersecurity risks could hinder progress. Both local and international experts at the conference urged the government to adopt a cautious, phased approach toward legalising cryptocurrency. Experts also recommended that Pakistan introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a first step, saying it could significantly reduce the costs associated with remittances from overseas.

Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) President Zafar Masud noted that the country had the potential to tap $20-25 billion in crypto-related opportunities but stressed the need for proper alignment and regulatory safeguards. He emphasised prioritising consumer protection and suggested that Pakistan introduce stablecoins in the initial phase.

Zafar Masud said the event marked “the first kind of public discussion in Pakistan” on the subject, emphasising the urgency of adopting digital financial systems. “There are a lot of misunderstandings about digital currency and different thoughts, but we cannot ignore its future and the coming revolution,” he said. 

Masud added that “there is around $27.6 trillion worth of stablecoins globally and increasing,” calling the development both “a threat to the US dollar's sovereignty” and “a smart step by Washington.” He urged Islamabad to act decisively, saying: “Shape the rules before they shape you.” He also revealed that Pakistan is “seriously considering a rupee stablecoin”. 

He described the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a transition “away from printed currency to digitalised currency,” calling it “a clear-cut case of financial inclusion.” However, Masud warned that “cybersecurity remains a major challenge” and that “regulatory ambiguity and negative public perception” persist in Pakistan.

Singapore-based expert Yara Wu, who has visited Pakistan four times since November 2024, said that adopting a CBDC could substantially lower remittance transfer costs for Pakistan, offering a secure and efficient alternative to existing channels.

Sajid Amin of SDPI said the country needs a clear, consistent approach to digital assets. “Challenges are also there,” he said. “Cyber protection is an issue — how safe it is and how to safeguard from scams.”

Faisal Mazhar, Deputy Director of Payments at the SBP, confirmed that “we have been working on digital currency since 2022,” with support from the World Bank and IMF. He described the CBDC as “an evolutionary process,” adding that a prototype is under development before launching a pilot phase.

Experts at the conference agreed that digital finance could significantly cut remittance costs, expand financial inclusion, and align Pakistan with global fintech trends — but warned that delay could mean missing a transformative economic opportunity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Stablecoins replace Bitcoin as preferred money laundering digital assets","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stablecoins-replace-bitcoin-laundering/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 12:10:00 GMT","

Chainalysis research has found that stablecoins are replacing Bitcoin as the preferred digital currency to run money laundering schemes. The crypto analytics firm claimed that these fiat-pegged tokens were used in nearly 63% of money laundering transactions in 2024.

The Chainalysis report asserted that stablecoins are mostly preferred because they are easy to send overseas. They can also be traded informally without identity verifications. The report says stablecoins are the new “back accounts” for criminal organizations. 

A “back account” is the final drop account from which the funds transferred across several accounts are withdrawn. The first account where deceived victims deposit their money is referred to as the “front account.”

The report claims that, until 2021, Bitcoin was used almost exclusively for various money laundering crimes; however, stablecoins have recently become more untraceable, especially across borders. The growth of stablecoins has also led to a corresponding increase in their illegal use.

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reported in June that the use of stablecoin by criminals has increased significantly since last year. The FATF also claimed that the majority of illicit activities on blockchains involve stablecoins.  

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also published a report in January claiming Tether (USDT) was the most popular currency for criminal gangs in Southeast Asia. The main reason stablecoins were used for laundering proceeds from criminal activities is their versatility. The UNODC noted the difficulty in smuggling fiat currencies overseas; converting them in Korea is even more challenging. 

The Chainalysis report also found that converting criminal proceeds into stablecoins allows for easy cross-border remittance. Money launderers can bypass exchanges by using overseas crypto exchanges that don't require KYC (know your customer) verification. They can also use OTC (over-the-counter) transactions.

The report noted that while stablecoins are fundamentally traceable, their decentralized nature allows them to avoid government control.  It further noted that although the transactions may leave a trail, crypto wallets make tracking difficult because they use randomized alphanumeric characters. Tumbled or mixed stablecoins become even more challenging to track.  

The report also found that Korean criminals are increasingly turning to stablecoins for the so-called “Oda Jangip fraud”. The scam begins with false advertising on online shopping stores or second-hand marketplaces, and then money is scammed from unsuspecting buyers. 

Stablecoins are used to launder proceeds from small-scale frauds (hundreds of thousands of dollars) and large-scale scams (hundreds of millions of dollars and more).

However, the report suggests that criminals involved in stablecoin-related crimes often receive lenient sentences. Chainalysis gave an example of one criminal who laundered over $188 million while working for a voice phishing ring in January. The criminal, whom the analytics firm chose to call Person A, bought Ethereum and transferred it to an overseas crypto exchange. 

The ETH was then swapped for USDT and transferred to a crypto wallet controlled by the ring. The money laundering process began with domestic bank accounts, ETH, overseas crypto exchanges, stablecoins, and then a crypto wallet. However, the criminal received only one year and six months in prison, suspended for three years in August. 

Another criminal was reportedly sentenced to eight months in prison and two years' probation for deceiving a victim who bought perfume through a second-hand marketplace. The criminal received the customer's 220,000 won deposit through a fake bank account, and then exchanged it for USDT to cash out.  

The report noted that financial fraud organizations that use stablecoins primarily use tactics such as voice phishing, stock/coin “leading room” scams, and second-hand market fraud. They then seek ways to launder the proceeds cleanly and withdraw them as cash.

US stocks retreated as tech and consumer sentiment fell, but energy stocks and cryptocurrency-related funds held their ground, signaling a shift toward defensive and alternative assets.

What's going on here?

US stocks took a tumble this week as tech shares lost their luster and consumer sentiment dimmed, but energy names and crypto-focused funds found favor as investors looked for stability and new angles.

What does this mean?

A broad wave of selling hit popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the iShares S&P 500 and Russell 2000 both finishing lower for the week. Tech-heavy ETFs like Invesco QQQ dropped 1.6% as technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary stocks led losses—fueled in part by a sharp drop in the Michigan consumer sentiment index. That reading showed Americans are increasingly anxious about the economic outlook. While financial and semiconductor funds also slumped, the energy sector managed gains even with softer oil prices. Safe-haven demand pushed gold and silver—and their related ETFs—higher, while consumer staples outperformed more cyclical, discretionary names. Even crypto assets like bitcoin and funds tracking them bucked the negative trend, rallying as investors broadened their search for reliable returns.

Why should I care?

For markets: Investors brace for volatility with a shift in priorities.

With risk appetite on the wane, money is moving out of growth names like tech and drifting to defensive sectors such as energy, consumer staples, and precious metals. The sharp dip in consumer sentiment spooked investors, sparking drops across health care, industrials, and financials—while semiconductors spearheaded tech's pullback. Crypto's resilience, highlighted by rising bitcoin and ether-related funds, suggests digital assets are gaining ground as perceived hedges, even as industries tied to economic growth look shakier.

The bigger picture: Alternative assets and defensive sectors take the spotlight.

This week's moves highlight a market searching for safety as US consumer confidence falters. Strength in gold, silver, and crypto is part of a wider global trend, with investors turning to diversification and alternative assets when the future is uncertain. Energy's steady performance, even with lower oil prices, and increased demand for safe havens suggest investors remain optimistic—but are taking precautions as doubts creep in about how long market gains can last.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Hong Kong credits AI, blockchain, and tokenization for FinTech growth","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hong-kong-credit-ai-blockchain-tokenization/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 16:17:00 GMT","

The Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Xu Zhengyu, believes that AI, blockchain and tokenization are the future of Hong Kong's fintech industry, as the Chinese special administrative region (SAR) celebrates a decade of steady growth in its FinTech ecosystem. 

The Director of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's FinTech ecosystem has grown considerably in both size and quality in the ten years since the establishment of Hong Kong's Financial Technology Week. 

Speaking to the media after attending a morning radio program on November 8, Xu said the number of startups in Hong Kong has tripled over the past decade, rising from about 1,600 ten years ago to nearly 5,000 today.

Xu also pointed out that the number of FinTech firms has reached around 1,200, representing a consistent year-on-year growth. 

“These are quantitative changes,” he said, “but we can also see qualitative changes as the ecosystem becomes richer and more mature.”

Xu gave credit to the Hong Kong government's initiatives, saying that they supported this FinTech growth. The authorities issued two major declarations on electronic and digital assets, and one declaration on artificial intelligence, encouraging rapid responses and strong participation from the private sector.

According to Xu, the current phase of FinTech development in Hong Kong is being shaped by artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and tokenization. 

He explained that many companies and financial institutions are now looking for ways to use these technologies in traditional financial products. For example, tokenization brings in steady income streams from things like electric charging stations or property leases that can be turned into investment products. 

“There are also pilot projects that look at how to turn long-term rental income into secure and authentic investment opportunities using blockchain,” Xu said. “These are very concrete examples showing how FinTech is being implemented in real-world scenarios.”

Xu stated that the future will likely be filled with more companies that are finding innovative ways to apply emerging technologies to financial services. He believes the adoption of AI, blockchain, and tokenized assets will not only make markets more efficient but also create new opportunities for both investors and businesses.

During his conversation with the media, the 2023 JPEX cryptocurrency case, in which the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) accused JPEX of operating without a license and misleading investors, came up. 

The platform allegedly promised unusually high returns on digital asset products, which attracted thousands of local investors. Then, withdrawals were suddenly restricted, and many users found they could not access their funds. This incident led to losses exceeding HK$1.5 billion (about US$190 million).

It has been described as Hong Kong's largest financial fraud involving virtual assets. Following the scandal, police made multiple arrests connected to the platform, including the influencers who had promoted JPEX. 

Xu was asked about the case's implications for investors. He started by acknowledging that the rapid growth of FinTech also brings challenges. He noted that there is often a gap in public understanding of new technologies and financial products, which can lead to confusion or misuse.

“Whether it is daily investor education or the rollout of new financial products, there will always be differences in understanding across the market,” he said. “That is why we must continue to strengthen education and awareness among investors.”

Bitcoin BTC$102,012.54 remains only marginally positive year-to-date, suggesting 2025 has been a period of consolidation as the asset stabilizes around the $100,000 level.

Much of the recent price weakness appears linked to previously dormant coins re-entering circulation, per onchain data. 

Large holders, commonly known as whales, have been the primary distributors, driving the current downward pressure on price, according to The Accumulation Trend Score (ATS) by Glassnode.

ATS measures the relative accumulation or distribution behavior across different wallet cohorts, accounting for both the size of entities and the volume of coins they have acquired over the past 15 days. 

Whales holding over 10,000 BTC have been consistent sellers since August, marking three months of sustained distribution. Meanwhile, wallets in the 1,000–10,000 BTC range remain neutral around a score of 0.5, while all smaller cohorts (below 1,000 BTC) are firmly in accumulation mode, according to Glassnode data. 

While in the first four months of the year, all cohorts were in deep distribution, which contributed to bitcoin's 30% decline to $76,000 in April during the so-called tariff tantrum.

This data highlights a clear divide between whales and the rest of the market participants and for now, it appears the whales are still steering the price action.

 Long-term whales have cashed out millions of dollars from Bitcoin throughout 2025, potentially putting BTC price recovery at risk. 

Key takeaways:

Older Bitcoin whales are selling heavily, spending over 1,000 BTC/hour in 2025.

Bitcoin's bear pennant pattern projects a potential drop to $89,600. 

Bitcoin (BTC) was at risk of further losses as the oldest whales continued to spend their BTC stash. 

Capriole Investments co-founder Charles Edwards said that “super whales are cashing out of Bitcoin,” in a post on X, raising concerns about the potential impact on BTC's price.

The BTC/USD pair trades 18.7% below its all-time high of $126,000 reached on Oct. 6, a drawdown that has been partly attributed to large outflows from old whale wallets. 

While some view this as a normal dip for bull cycles, others argue that the correction has been fueled by selling from long-term holders. 

Related: New Bitcoin highs could take 2 to 6 months but data says it's worth the wait: Analysis

Edwards shared a chart illustrating the extent of onchain spending from “OG” Bitcoin holders—those who have held their assets for seven years or more.

The chart features two color-coded categories: orange for $100 million dumps and red for $500 million dumps, clearly demonstrating the scale of selling by these long-term investors. This selling began in November 2024 and intensified in 2025.

“The chart is VERY colorful in 2025,” Edwards said, adding:

Additional data from Glassnode shows that events where these whales have been spending more than 1,000 BTC per hour have been persistent since January. 

One such example is “Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden,” highlighted by onchain analytics platform Lookonchain. This whale has moved 3,600 BTC, worth about $372 million, on Saturday, with “500 $BTC($51.68) already deposited to Kraken.”

Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden keeps dumping $BTC!Today, he moved 3,600.55 $BTC($372M) — with 500 $BTC($51.68M) already deposited to #Kraken, and the remaining 3,100.55 $BTC ($320.46M) likely heading there in the coming days.https://t.co/sGMrheaZl9https://t.co/lGpGzZiXmE pic.twitter.com/dsZzCKyvc5

Despite this selling pressure, the market has exhibited unusual resilience, according to Willy Woo, who argues that “what constitutes an ‘OG dump' is simply BTC moving out of an address that has been untouched for 7 years.”

Willy Woo suggested that BTC transfers by long-term holders may be intended for moving to taproot addresses for quantum-safe transactions. He notes that these could also involve custody rotations or seeding BTC treasury companies, rather than actual sales.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC trading inside a bear pennant, suggesting that a significant downward move may be next.

A bear pennant is a downward continuation pattern that occurs after a significant drop, followed by a consolidation period at the lower end of the price range.

A break below the pennant's support line at $100,650 could potentially lead to the next leg down for Bitcoin, measured at $89,600 or a 12% decline from its current price level.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin must close the week above the 50-week EMA, currently at $100,900, to avoid a deeper correction toward $92,000 or lower.

Rubin Observatory Discovers Surprise ‘Tail' on Iconic Galaxy

The first image from the Vera C. Rubin telescope reveals a previously unnoticed feature of the galaxy M61 that may explain its mysterious properties

By Jenna Ahart & Nature magazine 

Galaxy M61 sports a long stellar stream, which had not been spotted before now.

Mere months after its long-awaited debut, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is beginning to deliver on its promise to rewrite cosmic history. The observatory's colossal camera — perched atop a mountain in Chile — has yet to begin its official scientific survey. But just by perusing its first test image, astronomers have uncovered a surprise: a trail of light — called a stellar stream — extending from a well-known galaxy, suggesting that the galaxy once tore apart a much smaller one.

“This is the first stellar stream detected from Rubin,” says Sarah Pearson, an astrophysicist at the University of Copenhagen. “And it's just a precursor for all of the many, many features we'll find like this.” The authors reported their findings in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.

The galaxy, named Messier 61, was first spotted in 1779 in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies and has caught the gaze of astronomers ever since. Hosting a slew of supernovae and churning out new stars at a surprisingly high rate, Messier 61 is what's known as a starburst galaxy owing to its bounty of stellar activity.

Astronomers have enlisted some powerhouse telescopes — including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope — to unravel the galaxy's structure. But “despite all of this intense study, no one had ever found this stellar stream”, says Aaron Romanowsky, an astronomer at San Jose State University in California and an author of the study.

After scrutinizing Rubin's first image — captured by the world's largest-ever digital camera — the team filtered out excess light to reveal the galaxy's stellar stream. The trail of stars is 55 kiloparsecs or 180,000 light years long, making it one of the longer streams discovered. It probably originated from a dwarf galaxy that was shredded apart by Messier 61's gravity. Such an interaction could have boosted star formation in Messier 61 and might begin to explain some of the galaxy's abnormalities, the authors note.

Rubin's first image captures ten million galaxies, and it's only an appetizer for the observations to come. Over the next decade, Rubin will capture light from 20 billion galaxies — more than any other observatory so far.

“The expectation is that every single galaxy should be surrounded by these streams. It's a fundamental part of how the galaxies are made,” Romanowsky says. “We just need to look fainter, and that's the hope with Rubin.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Einstein might have been wrong about black holes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251108014022.htm","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 08:08:10 GMT","

Black holes are often described as cosmic gluttons, consuming everything that drifts too close -- including light itself. This is what makes the images of the supermassive black holes at the centers of the galaxy M87 and our own Milky Way so remarkable. Captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration a few years ago, these observations marked a major milestone in astronomy.

""What you see on these images is not the black hole itself, but rather the hot matter in its immediate vicinity,"" explains Prof. Luciano Rezzolla of Goethe University Frankfurt, whose team played a crucial role in the discovery. ""As long as the matter is still rotating outside the event horizon -- before being inevitably pulled in -- it can emit final signals of light that we can, in principle, detect.""

Einstein's Theory and the Mystery of Black Holes

These striking images reveal what scientists call the ""shadow"" of a black hole, offering a new way to probe the physics behind these mysterious cosmic giants. For over a century, Einstein's general theory of relativity has been the foundation of our understanding of space and time. It predicts the existence of black holes and the event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing -- not even light -- can escape.

""There are, however, also other, still hypothetical theories that likewise predict the existence of black holes,"" Rezzolla notes. ""Some of these approaches require the presence of matter with very specific properties or even the violation of the physical laws we currently know.""

Testing Einstein's Ideas With Black Hole Shadows

In collaboration with colleagues from the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute in Shanghai (China), Rezzolla and his team proposed a new way to test these alternative theories. Their work, published in Nature Astronomy, outlines how future black hole observations could help confirm or challenge Einstein's model of gravity. Until now, there has not been enough data to verify or reject competing ideas, but that may soon change through detailed analysis of black hole shadow images.

""This requires two things,"" Rezzolla explains. ""On the one hand, high-resolution shadow images of black holes to determine their radius as accurately as possible, and on the other hand, a theoretical description of how strongly the various approaches deviate from Einstein's theory of relativity.""

Simulations Reveal How Theories Diverge

To tackle this, the team produced a thorough framework describing how different theoretical types of black holes would vary from Einstein's predictions and how those differences would appear in images. They used advanced three-dimensional computer simulations to reproduce the motion of matter and magnetic fields in the warped spacetime surrounding black holes. From these simulations, they created synthetic images of the glowing plasma that circles these immense objects.

""The central question was: How significantly do images of black holes differ across various theories?"" says lead author Akhil Uniyal of the Tsung-Dao Lee Institute. The researchers identified clear patterns that, with sharper images in the future, could help scientists determine which theory best matches reality. Although today's EHT resolution cannot yet detect these fine distinctions, improvements in technology will gradually make such comparisons possible. To prepare for this, the physicists developed a universal description of black holes that can encompass many different theoretical frameworks.

Einstein's Theory Still Holding Strong -- for Now

""One of the EHT collaboration's most important contributions to astrophysics is turning black holes into testable objects,"" Rezzolla emphasizes. ""Our expectation is that relativity theory will continue to prove itself, just as it has time and again up to now."" So far, the findings remain consistent with Einstein's theory, although uncertainties in measurement mean that only a few exotic ideas have been ruled out. For example, the black holes in M87 and the Milky Way are almost certainly not ""naked singularities"" (without an event horizon) or wormholes. Still, Rezzolla notes, ""Even the established theory must be continuously tested, especially with extreme objects like black holes."" If Einstein's model were ever shown to fail, it would mark a revolutionary moment in physics.

A New Era of Cosmic Observation

The EHT provides an unprecedented opportunity for these investigations. By combining data from multiple large radio telescopes across the world, it effectively creates a telescope as large as Earth, capable of capturing fine details around black holes. Plans are already underway to add more observatories to the network and, eventually, to include a radio telescope in space, which would greatly boost its resolution.

Such advancements could make it possible to perform truly definitive tests of competing black hole theories. According to the new study, this would require achieving an angular resolution of less than one millionth of an arcsecond -- roughly equivalent to spotting a coin on the surface of the Moon from Earth. While that level of precision is not yet possible, scientists expect it to be within reach in the coming years, potentially unlocking a new chapter in our understanding of gravity and the universe itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden cellular cleanup trick could reverse aging","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251107010326.htm","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 03:46:38 GMT","

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to show signs of accelerated aging. Those affected often develop early skin wrinkling, loss of skin elasticity, reduced body fat, hair loss, hardened arteries, and insulin resistance. Scientists have found that about 90% of HGPS cases result from a defective protein known as progerin.

Progerin has a harmful ""dominant-negative"" effect on cells, meaning it interferes with normal cell function. This abnormal protein triggers multiple cellular problems, such as deformation of the nuclear envelope (NE), increased DNA damage, shortened telomeres, cell cycle arrest, and reduced ability to divide. Interestingly, growing evidence suggests that small amounts of progerin are also present during natural aging and in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Because of this, therapies that enhance the removal of progerin could hold promise for treating HGPS, CKD, and other conditions linked to aging.

Investigating How Cells Manage Progerin

A research team led by Professor Chuanmao Zhang from Peking University and Kunming University of Science and Technology has long been focused on uncovering the biological mechanisms behind aging and progeria. In a recent study published in Science China Life Sciences, the group identified a key process in which lysosomes -- tiny cellular compartments responsible for breaking down waste -- play a central role in clearing progerin.

Their study revealed that defects in lysosomes contribute to the accumulation of progerin in HGPS cells. More importantly, they demonstrated that stimulating lysosome activity can restore this cellular ""cleanup"" function, helping remove progerin and reducing signs of cell aging. These discoveries highlight lysosomes as an important new target for potential therapies in HGPS, CKD, and other age-related diseases.

How Progerin Builds Up Inside Cells

Using a combination of immunofluorescence imaging, live-cell observation, and biochemical analysis, the researchers tracked how progerin behaves inside cells. They observed that progerin, which first appears near the nuclear envelope, can move into the cell's cytoplasm through a process called nuclear envelope budding. Once in the cytoplasm, progerin should normally be degraded through the cell's autophagy-lysosome pathway -- a key recycling system.

However, in HGPS cells, this system fails to work efficiently, allowing progerin to accumulate. To investigate why, the team performed RNA sequencing on primary cells from two patients with HGPS. The results showed a significant reduction in the activity of genes linked to lysosome function. Further tests, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and biochemical assays, confirmed that lysosomes in these cells were indeed defective.

Restoring Lysosome Function to Fight Cellular Aging

Next, the researchers tested whether repairing the lysosomal defects could enhance progerin clearance and slow down cellular aging. They activated lysosome biogenesis -- the process by which new lysosomes are formed -- through two methods: by stimulating protein kinase C (PKC) or by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).

Both approaches successfully improved lysosome function, boosted the removal of progerin, and reduced signs of cellular aging, such as DNA damage, growth arrest, and loss of cell vitality. These findings suggest that reawakening the cell's own cleanup machinery could help reverse some of the harmful effects of progerin buildup.

Toward Anti-Aging Therapies Targeting Lysosomes

This research clearly establishes lysosomes as key players in removing progerin and maintaining cellular health. It also points to lysosome activation as a potential strategy for combating premature and natural aging. By targeting the body's built-in recycling systems, scientists may eventually find new ways to treat HGPS and a wide range of age-related diseases.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find brain cells that could stop Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251108083902.htm","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 15:44:40 GMT","

In Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, microglia (the brain's immune cells) play a double role. They can protect the brain by clearing harmful debris or, under certain conditions, contribute to damage and inflammation. How these cells behave can strongly influence how the disease unfolds.

Scientists from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, together with researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Biology and Ageing in Cologne, Germany, The Rockefeller University, The City University of New York, and other international partners, have identified a unique group of microglia that appear to protect the brain. This discovery could pave the way for new treatment strategies aimed at slowing or preventing Alzheimer's disease.

In a study published November 5 in Nature, the team found that microglia with lower levels of a transcription factor called PU.1 and higher expression of a receptor known as CD28 help reduce brain inflammation. These specialized microglia also slow the buildup of amyloid plaques and the spread of toxic tau proteins, which are both major hallmarks of Alzheimer's.

PU.1 is a protein that binds to specific DNA regions, helping control which genes are activated or silenced. CD28, found on the surface of T cells, acts as a signaling receptor that supports immune cell activation and communication.

How Protective Microglia Work

Using mouse models of Alzheimer's, as well as human brain cells and tissue samples, the researchers showed that reducing PU.1 levels encourages microglia to express immune-regulating receptors typically found in lymphoid cells. Although these protective microglia make up only a small portion of total microglia, their effect is widespread: they suppress inflammation throughout the brain and help preserve memory and survival in mice.

When the scientists removed CD28 from this specific microglial subset, inflammation worsened and plaque growth increased, confirming that CD28 plays an essential role in keeping these brain-protective cells active.

""Microglia are not simply destructive responders in Alzheimer's disease -- they can become the brain's protectors,"" said Anne Schaefer, MD, PhD, Professor in the Nash Family Department of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine, Co-Director of the Center for Glial Biology at The Friedman Brain Institute, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, and senior author of the paper. ""This finding extends our earlier observations on the remarkable plasticity of microglia states and their important roles in diverse brain functions. It also underscores the vital importance of international collaboration in advancing scientific progress.""

""It is remarkable to see that molecules long known to immunologists for their roles in B and T lymphocytes also regulate microglial activity,"" added Alexander Tarakhovsky, MD, PhD, Dr. Plutarch Papamarkou Professor of Immunology, Virology, and Microbiology at The Rockefeller University and co-author of the paper. ""This discovery comes at a time when regulatory T cells have achieved major recognition as master regulators of immunity, highlighting a shared logic of immune regulation across cell types. It also paves the way for immunotherapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.""

Genetic Clues Point to Lower Alzheimer's Risk

The research expands upon earlier genetic findings by Alison M. Goate, DPhil, Jean C. and James W. Crystal Professor of Genomics and Chair of the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine, founding director of the Ronald M. Loeb Center for Alzheimer's Disease at Mount Sinai, and a senior co-author of the study. Dr. Goate's prior work identified a common genetic variant in SPI1 (the gene responsible for producing PU.1) that is linked to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

""These results provide a mechanistic explanation for why lower PU.1 levels are linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease risk,"" said Dr. Goate.

A New Path Toward Immunotherapy for Alzheimer's

The discovery of the PU.1-CD28 relationship offers a new molecular framework for understanding how microglia can protect the brain. It also strengthens the idea that targeting microglial activity through immune-based therapies could alter the course of Alzheimer's disease.

Superconductors work like express trains for electricity. Once electric current enters one, it can travel through without resistance or energy loss. Because of this remarkable efficiency, superconductors are already key to technologies such as MRI scanners and particle accelerators.

However, these ""conventional"" superconductors only operate at extremely cold temperatures. They must be kept in specialized cooling systems to remain in their superconducting state. If materials could superconduct at warmer, more practical temperatures, they could transform modern technology -- from creating energy grids that waste no power to enabling more functional quantum computers. To reach that goal, researchers at MIT and other institutions are exploring ""unconventional"" superconductors, materials that defy the rules of traditional ones and may lead to the next big breakthrough.

MIT's Magic-Angle Graphene Discovery

In a major step forward, MIT physicists have observed clear evidence of unconventional superconductivity in ""magic-angle"" twisted tri-layer graphene (MATTG). This unique material is created by stacking three atom-thin sheets of graphene at a very specific angle. That tiny twist dramatically alters the material's properties, giving rise to strange and promising quantum effects.

While earlier studies hinted that MATTG might host unconventional superconductivity, the new findings, published in Science, offer the most direct confirmation to date.

A New Look at the Superconducting Gap

The MIT team successfully measured MATTG's superconducting gap, which indicates how strong a material's superconducting state is at different temperatures. They found that the gap in MATTG looked completely different from what is seen in conventional superconductors. This difference suggests that the way MATTG becomes superconducting relies on a distinct, unconventional mechanism.

""There are many different mechanisms that can lead to superconductivity in materials,"" explains co-lead author Shuwen Sun, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Physics. ""The superconducting gap gives us a clue to what kind of mechanism can lead to things like room-temperature superconductors that will eventually benefit human society.""

The team made this discovery with a new experimental system that lets them directly observe how the superconducting gap forms in two-dimensional materials. They plan to use the technique to study MATTG and other 2D materials in more detail, hoping to identify new candidates for advanced technologies.

""Understanding one unconventional superconductor very well may trigger our understanding of the rest,"" says Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at MIT and senior author of the study. ""This understanding may guide the design of superconductors that work at room temperature, for example, which is sort of the Holy Grail of the entire field.""

The Origins of Twistronics

Graphene is made of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern that looks like chicken wire. Scientists can peel off a sheet of graphene from graphite (the same material in pencil lead) to study its properties. In the 2010s, researchers predicted that stacking two layers of graphene at a very precise angle could create new electronic behaviors.

In 2018, Jarillo-Herrero's group became the first to experimentally produce this so-called ""magic-angle"" graphene and reveal its extraordinary properties. That work launched a new field of research known as ""twistronics,"" which studies the surprising effects that emerge when ultra-thin materials are stacked and twisted at exact orientations. Since then, the team and others have explored a variety of graphene structures with multiple layers, revealing further signs of unconventional superconductivity.

How Electrons Cooperate

Superconductivity occurs when electrons form pairs rather than scattering apart as they move through a material. These paired electrons, known as ""Cooper pairs,"" can travel without resistance, creating a perfect flow of current.

""In conventional superconductors, the electrons in these pairs are very far away from each other, and weakly bound,"" says co-lead author Jeong Min Park PhD '24. ""But in magic-angle graphene, we could already see signatures that these pairs are very tightly bound, almost like a molecule. There were hints that there is something very different about this material.""

Probing the Quantum World Through Tunneling

To prove that MATTG truly exhibits unconventional superconductivity, the MIT researchers needed to measure its superconducting gap directly. As Park explains, ""When a material becomes superconducting, electrons move together as pairs rather than individually, and there's an energy 'gap' that reflects how they're bound. The shape and symmetry of that gap tells us the underlying nature of the superconductivity.""

To do this, scientists used a quantum-scale technique known as tunneling spectroscopy. At this level, electrons act both as particles and as waves, which allows them to ""tunnel"" through barriers that would normally stop them. By studying how easily electrons can tunnel through a material, researchers can learn how strongly they are bound inside it. However, tunneling results alone don't always prove that a material is superconducting, making direct measurements both crucial and challenging.

A Closer Look at the Superconducting Gap

Park's team developed a new platform that combines tunneling spectroscopy with electrical transport measurements, which involve tracking how current moves through the material while monitoring its resistance (zero resistance means it's superconducting).

Using this method on MATTG, the researchers could clearly pinpoint the superconducting tunneling gap -- it appeared only when the material reached zero resistance, the defining mark of superconductivity. As they changed the temperature and magnetic field, the gap displayed a sharp V-shaped curve, very different from the smooth, flat pattern typical of conventional superconductors.

This unusual V shape points to a new mechanism behind MATTG's superconductivity. Although the exact process is still unknown, it's now clear that this material behaves unlike any conventional superconductor discovered before.

A Different Kind of Electron Pairing

In most superconductors, electrons pair up due to vibrations in the surrounding atomic lattice, which gently push them together. Park believes MATTG operates differently.

""In this magic-angle graphene system, there are theories explaining that the pairing likely arises from strong electronic interactions rather than lattice vibrations,"" she says. ""That means electrons themselves help each other pair up, forming a superconducting state with special symmetry.""

The Path Ahead: Next-Generation Quantum Materials

The MIT team plans to apply their new experimental setup to study other twisted and layered materials.

""This allows us to both identify and study the underlying electronic structures of superconductivity and other quantum phases as they happen, within the same sample,"" Park explains. ""This direct view can reveal how electrons pair and compete with other states, paving the way to design and control new superconductors and quantum materials that could one day power more efficient technologies or quantum computers.""

James Dewey Watson — who won the Nobel Prize for his role in divining the structure of DNA; was instrumental in initiating and propelling the Human Genome Project; and who became notorious for his history of racist and sexist comments — has died at 97.

The discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA paved the way for scientists to unravel the mechanisms behind genetic inheritance and how cells synthesize proteins. Gene therapies, the sequencing of the human genome and the development of monoclonal antibodies as treatments for cancer are just a few of the developments that would not have been possible without an understanding of DNA's structure.

“The elucidation of the structure of the double helix goes down, along with Mendel and Darwin, as the three greatest discoveries in biology,” says Bruce Stillman, president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, where Watson had various positions.

Watson and Francis Crick, who worked together at the University of Cambridge, UK, solved the structure of DNA within a few years of their first meeting. In 1953, they published a seminal paper1 in Nature titled A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. Watson had just turned 25.

“For him, nothing was impossible,” says Robert Martienssen, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor. “Nothing was out of reach.”

But the discovery of the DNA helix also became enmeshed in controversy. Watson and Crick elucidated the complex structure with the help of data and ideas from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, who were working at King's College London at the time. Some of these data were shared without Franklin's permission. Wilkins was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 with Watson and Crick. Franklin had died of ovarian cancer 4 years earlier at the age of 37, and so was ineligible for the award.

Watson and Crick, “could have — and should have — requested permission to use the data and made clear exactly what they had done, first to Franklin and Wilkins, and then to the rest of the world”, wrote Matthew Cobb, and Nathaniel Comfort, historians of science at the University of Manchester, UK, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, respectively, in a 2023 essay2 on Franklin.

In the aftermath of the discovery, Watson was particularly unkind about Franklin and dismissive of the role of women in science generally. In a best-selling book about the discovery of the double helix, he criticized Franklin's appearance and wrote, “The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.”

Colleagues who were close to Watson have long had to wrestle with his mixed legacy. Nancy Hopkins, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Watson convinced her to pursue her PhD, at a time when few women pursued careers in science. When she launched her own lab and feared she might not get tenure, Watson convinced her to push on. “Just keep working and when you come up for tenure, if the letters are good enough, you'll get tenure. Or I'll sue them,” Hopkins says Watson told her.

Hopkins later became a vocal advocate for women in science and says that she is just one of many women Watson trained and supported. She also says she is bewildered by Watson's rhetoric on race.

End racism in science

A 2001 lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, left many in the audience stunned when Watson made remarks linking skin colour to sexual libido, and thinness to ambition.

“That was the beginning of the end,” Hopkins says of the lecture. “What happened later on, I just don't know the answer.”

In 2007, Watson abandoned a book tour after asserting that he thought Black people are less intelligent than white people. At the time, he was still active at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he had once been the director and had helped to make the lab a pre-eminent scientific institution. But he was removed from his leadership roles at the lab for his statements about race and intelligence. The institution severed ties with him completely after he made similar remarks in 2020. He also had a history of anti-Semitic comments, such as a 2007 remark that “Some anti-Semitism is justified.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Gene Editing Therapy Cut Cholesterol Levels by Half","https://www.wired.com/story/a-gene-editing-therapy-cut-cholesterol-levels-by-half/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 14:56:00 GMT","

In a step toward the wider use of gene editing, a treatment that uses Crispr successfully slashed high cholesterol levels in a small number of people.

In a trial conducted by Swiss biotech company Crispr Therapeutics, 15 participants received a one-time infusion meant to switch off a gene in the liver called ANGPTL3. Though rare, some people are born with a mutation in this gene that protects against heart disease with no apparent adverse consequences.

The highest dose tested in the trial reduced both “bad” LDL cholesterol and triglycerides by an average of 50 percent within two weeks after treatment. The effects lasted at least 60 days, the length of the trial. The results were presented today at the American Heart Association's annual meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The Nobel Prize–winning Crispr technology has mostly been used to address rare diseases, but these latest findings, while early, add to the evidence that the DNA-editing tool could be used to treat common conditions as well.

“This will probably be one of the biggest moments in the arc of Crispr's development in medicine,” Samarth Kulkarni, CEO of Crispr Therapeutics, tells WIRED. The company is behind the only approved gene-editing treatment on the market, Casgevy, which treats sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

The American Heart Association estimates that about a quarter of adults in the US have elevated LDL levels. A similar number have high triglycerides. LDL cholesterol is the waxy substance in the blood that can clog and harden arteries over time. Triglycerides, meanwhile, are the most common type of fat found in the body. High levels of both raise the risk of heart attack and stroke.

The Phase I trial was conducted in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand between June 2024 and August 2025. Participants were between the ages of 31 and 68 and had uncontrolled levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The trial tested five different doses of the Crispr infusion, which took about two and a half hours on average to administer.

“These are very sick people,” says Steven Nissen, senior author and chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic, which independently confirmed the trial's results. “The tragedy of this disease is not just that people die young, but some of them will have a heart attack, and their lives are never the same again. They don't get back to work, they develop heart failure.”

One trial participant, a 51-year-old man, died six months after receiving the lowest dose of the treatment, which was not associated with a lowering of cholesterol and triglycerides. The death was related to his existing heart disease, not the experimental Crispr treatment. The man had a rare, inherited genetic form of high cholesterol and previously had several procedures to improve blood flow to his heart.

“That's the trajectory these people are on, and we want to get them off that trajectory,” Nissen says.

Three people had minor reactions such as back pain and nausea that cleared up with medication. One participant, who had elevated liver enzymes before getting the Crispr infusion, had a temporary further rise in liver enzymes that lasted a few days and returned to normal without needing treatment.

Researchers will continue to monitor study participants for a year following the trial, with an additional long-term safety follow-up of 15 years, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration for all gene-editing therapies.

The team is planning Phase II studies for 2026 that will include a broader patient population and longer follow-up period. The hope is that the effects of a single Crispr infusion would last years, even permanently, replacing the need for a daily pill or regular injection.

This isn't the first trial to use gene-editing to address cardiovascular disease. Verve Therapeutics is using a newer type of Crispr called base editing to target a different gene, called PCSK9, in people with a hereditary form of high cholesterol levels and premature heart disease. Verve halted a trial of its gene-editing candidate in 2024 after one participant had a concerning rise in liver enzymes, but this year it showed positive safety data from 14 patients with a newly formulated therapy. Earlier this year, Eli Lilly announced a deal to acquire Verve for over $1 billion.

Safety is a key concern with new gene-editing therapies. Intellia Therapeutics has paused trials of a Crispr treatment after a patient died from liver damage. Because many Crispr therapies target the liver, damage to that organ has been a known risk.

If further trials confirm safety and efficacy, however, Nissen thinks that in the relatively near future, it will be possible to treat patients at an earlier stage, before they develop heart disease. “This is a revolution in progress here,” he says.

The only smartphone manufacturer with a 10/10 iFixit repairability score is finally bringing its products to the US, but it isn't starting with its phones. Netherlands-based Fairphone announced this week that it will mark its expansion into the US with the Fairbuds XL, its repairable over-ear headphones. It'll be available on Amazon later this month.

Fairphone says it achieved 61 percent revenue growth in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, though this is likely attributed to the launch of The Fairphone (Gen 6)—the company doesn't release a new phone every year. It sold more than 100,000 units in 2024, including phones and audio products.

Right-to-repair laws have been cropping up all over the US, and Fairphone smartphones are the easiest to repair. The company provides a screwdriver, sells spare parts for years, and offers long-term software support. Its devices may not be the flashiest or the most powerful, but they are a more sustainable solution, also ensuring fair mining practices and wages for workers in its supply chain.

Bringing its smartphone over to the US is a little more complicated than headphones, as it requires carrier certifications, but Fairphone tells WIRED it's in “advanced discussions” with select retailers and carriers.

Meta seems to be on a quest to finally bring its apps to other platforms. A few months ago, it launched an Instagram app for the iPad; now we're getting WhatsApp on the Apple Watch. Rather than just mirroring your notifications and sending basic replies, now you can read full messages on the Apple Watch, record and send voice messages, see who's calling, send emoji reactions to messages, and see more of the chat history on the screen.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

It syncs with your iPhone, so you don't need to set it up as a companion device. You can't take calls on the watch itself or even answer them; you can see who is calling and decline. It also doesn't seem as though you can add the WhatsApp app as a complication.

It's a little earlier than usual, but Motorola's latest budget phones are here: the Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026. They share a similar look and aren't too different from the design language Motorola has employed on its 2025 Moto G devices. What's most notable is that the Moto G Play will have 5G support, making it one of the cheapest handsets with 5G at $170.

Both phones have 6.7-inch 120-Hz LCD screens, big 5,200-mAh batteries, and IP52 water resistance. They're powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 processor with 4 GB of RAM, but they differ in storage size, with the Moto G offering 128 GB of internal storage and the Play with 64 GB (both are expandable with a microSD). Cameras are the other place where the two phones diverge, with a 50-MP main sensor on the Moto G and a 32-MP sensor on the Play. Yes, they still have headphone jacks.

Motorola says the Moto G Play will arrive first on November 13 at Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon for $170, and the $200 Moto G launches on December 11 at Motorola's website first, then at Best Buy and Amazon on January 15.

Canon has announced its much-anticipated new EOS R6 Mark III full-frame mirrorless camera. The R6 III features a new 32.5-megapixel sensor (the same sensor in the EOS C50 cinema camera), as well as the company's latest Digic X processor.

The new technology means the R6 now shares more than a few features with Canon's more expensive R5 and R1 professional-level cameras, most notably perhaps the autofocus system of the R5, a significant step up from what was available in the R6 II.

The body of the R6 III is not hugely different than its predecessor. The 3.69-million-dot EVF and 3-inch articulating touchscreen are unchanged, though the R6 III uses Canon's newer, larger battery and adds a CFexpress Type B card slot. The CFexpress Type B helps with some of the impressive photo and video specs, including the ability to capture full-resolution RAW images—with autofocus—at up to 40 frames per second (12 fps if you use a purely mechanical shutter).

The video specs rival Canon's dedicated cinema cameras. The R6 III can shoot oversampled 4Kp60, 7K RAW, 7K Open Gate, and Canon Log 2 video. There's also support for features like waveform monitoring, and focus acceleration and deceleration (similar to the EOS Cinema C80).

The Canon EOS R6 Mark III will be available later in November for $2,799 (body only). There are a couple of kit options as well, including one with the RF 24-105mm f/4L for $4,049. You can preorder it today at B&H Photo. —Scott Gilbertson

Fans of dancehall and reggae music (or Jamaican beats in general) will adore Teenage Engineer's latest sample and mic, designed to help you make some extremely island-y jams. The European audio brand is famous for making gorgeous-sounding and beautifully designed musical instruments and recording equipment for the jet-setting class.

The Riddim n' Ting are meant to be “a complete rhythm and bass system” loaded with 200 instruments and loops over drums, bass, keys, and an FX loop. There are even preloaded samples from folks like King Jammy and Mad Professor, which should get you off to a quick start.

The EP-40 Riddim is based on the familiar EP-133 K.O. II sampler, so folks who know and like that tool will find an easy transition to this one. The EP-2350 Ting microphone comes with built-in effects, like echo, reverb, and pitch shifting. They are available together for $329 but will be sold separately later. —Parker Hall

There's something invisible that can put us in an early grave. And I'm not talking about sentient AI, but something much more ubiquitous and real. While AI doomers predict the existential risk that artificial intelligence poses to humanity, air pollution—specifically, ultrafine particulate matter, PM 2.5—has been an efficient killer for decades. Many people don't realize there are volumes of scientific evidence that link cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and brain damage to the growing list of bleak health consequences of bad air.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. As Trump's EPA continues to roll back standards and deregulate industries that cause air pollution, the burden of maintaining a safe breathing environment is increasingly falling on individuals. Luckily, there are some steps you can take.

PM 2.5, produced by wildfires, automobile exhaust, power plants, and industries like mining, enters the body through the nose and mouth through the simple act of breathing. Once inside the body, PM 2.5 can enter the bloodstream and the brain. Air pollution's impact on public health and life expectancy isn't novel. In 1970, 22 years after the deadly Donora Smog Event that killed 20 people and sickened over 6,000 in Western Pennsylvania, the Clean Air Act became federal law.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration repealed the Biden administration's new standards for air pollutants from taconite iron ore processing, exempting private sectors from complying, saying, “Preserving and enhancing domestic taconite processing capabilities … ensuring [the] resilience of American industrial supply chains.”

Taconite iron ore processing creates a major amount of PM 2.5. Trump's White House also repealed recent emissions standards for coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam, along with several other industries. As America's commitment to limiting air pollution declines, there are appliances and actions you can take to keep the air you breathe healthier, both indoors and outside.

When people think of high blood pressure, air pollution might not be what they envision. More often, stress, smoking, poor diet, or genetics might come to mind, but air pollution, PM 2.5, can cause and/or contribute to hypertension. NYU cardiologist Jonathan Newman, an expert on the link between the environment and cardiovascular disease, says that “in broad strokes, air pollution can affect cardiovascular risk factors, blood sugar/diabetes, blood pressure/hypertension.”

Invisible PM 2.5 reaches the deepest part of the lungs, entering the lung's tiny air sacs, where it passes through the barrier to enter the bloodstream. There, it can build up into plaque on the arterial walls, known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. According to Newman, “Generally this occurs through direct effects of inflammation, neurohormonal effects, direct particle effects.” The interaction of PM 2.5 causes an imbalance with free radicals and antioxidants that puts stress on the body, causing inflammation and oxidative stress that leads to cell damage.

In other words, PM 2.5 can wreak havoc on the molecular level. The World Health Organization recommends that average annual concentrations not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter, with daily levels under 20 micrograms per cubic meter. Those guidelines are difficult to live by. A study found that “over 90 percent of the world population lives at PM 2.5 levels above World Health Organization standards.” The cheapest and easiest protection is to use a well-made N95 face mask. I carry an N95 mask with me at all times, as I cannot predict if a good-air day will turn into a bad-air night. The practice of carrying a just-in-case mask is one way to have agency over the air you breathe.

Newman was one of the coauthors of last year's study that found that “air pollution exposure has been implicated in the onset and progression of diabetes. Increased exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM 2.5) is associated with increases in blood glucose and all forms of diabetes.” The findings are not new; in studies going as far back as 1967, researchers have found a link between high levels of PM 2.5 in ambient air (outdoor air) and an increase in diabetes deaths. And while there are other contributors to diabetes such as obesity and genetics, there is a link between the inflammation caused by PM 2.5 and diabetes.

While respiratory disease has long been studied as a negative outcome of air pollution, recent studies show that it also impacts the nervous system and brain development, linking PM 2.5 with stroke, changes in cognitive function, dementia, and psychiatric disorders. In particular, that fine and ultrafine particulate matter has an outsized impact, as it can be absorbed into the bloodstream to reach the central nervous system.

And how does this happen? One possible and terrifying way is through the olfactory nerve, the shortest nerve in your body, which enables us to smell. It goes from your brain to the upper inside part of your nose. To understand how something tiny like PM 2.5 can cause inflammation, a 2022 study reiterated, “PM 2.5 can pass through the lung-gas-blood barrier and the ‘gut-microbial-brain' axis to cause systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, or directly enter brain tissue via the olfactory nerve.” That PM 2.5 accumulates and results in oxidative stress (the free radicals and antioxidants have an imbalance), where it can “cause systemic inflammation and brain tissue damage.”

It isn't just the young that can be harmed by exposure to air pollution; a 2025 study found “long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of neurological disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, and cognitive impairment.”

There is, and will continue to be, a divide between those who can reduce the harmful health effects of poor air quality and those who cannot. Air quality monitors give real-time air quality index levels and guide decisions about opening windows, running purifiers, and masking. And the more people who use and share their data from outdoor air quality monitors, the more informed the general public will be. The use of indoor air purifiers that capture PM 2.5 is essential to well-rounded good health, and knowing how to use an air purifier properly is equally important. Understanding PM 2.5 and how to manage risk with masks, air purifiers, and air quality monitors is as much a part of staying healthy as eating well, taking prescription medicine like statins, and exercising.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 1876, Peter Guthrie Tait set out to measure what he called the “beknottedness” of knots.

The Scottish mathematician, whose research laid the foundation for modern knot theory, was trying to find a way to tell knots apart—a notoriously difficult task. In math, a knot is a tangled piece of string with its ends glued together. Two knots are the same if you can twist and stretch one into the other without cutting the string. But it's hard to tell if this is possible based solely on what the knots look like. A knot that seems really complicated and tangled, for instance, might actually be equivalent to a simple loop.

Tait had an idea for how to determine if two knots are different. First, lay a knot flat on a table and find a spot where the string crosses over itself. Cut the string, swap the positions of the strands, and glue everything back together. This is called a crossing change. If you do this enough times, you'll be left with an unknotted circle. Tait's beknottedness is the minimum number of crossing changes that this process requires. Today, it's known as a knot's “unknotting number.”

If two knots have different unknotting numbers, then they must be different. But Tait found that his unknotting numbers generated more questions than they answered.

“I have got so thoroughly on one groove,” he wrote in a letter to a friend, the scientist James Clerk Maxwell, “that I fear I may be missing or unduly exalting something which will appear excessively simple to anyone but myself.”

If Tait missed something, so did every mathematician who followed him. Over the past 150 years, many knot theorists have been baffled by the unknotting number. They know it can provide a powerful description of a knot. “It's the most fundamental [measure] of all, arguably,” said Susan Hermiller of the University of Nebraska. But it's often impossibly hard to compute a knot's unknotting number, and it's not always clear how that number corresponds to the knot's complexity.

The Scottish physicist and mathematician Peter Guthrie Tait began the systematic study of what would later become one of the biggest problems in knot theory: the classification of knots.

To untangle this mystery, mathematicians in the early 20th century devised a straightforward conjecture about how the unknotting number changes when you combine knots. If they could prove it, they would have a way to compute the unknotting number for any knot—giving mathematicians a simple, concrete way to measure knot complexity.

Researchers searched for nearly a century, finding little evidence either for or against the conjecture.

Then, in a paper posted in June, Hermiller and her longtime collaborator Mark Brittenham uncovered a pair of knots that, when combined, form a knot that is easier to untie than the conjecture predicts. In doing so, they disproved the conjecture—and used their counterexample to find infinitely many other pairs of knots that also disprove it.

“When the paper was posted, I gasped out loud,” said Allison Moore of Virginia Commonwealth University.

The result demonstrates that “the unknotting number is chaotic and unpredictable and really exciting to study,” she added. The paper is “like waving a flag that says, we don't understand this.”

The conjecture dates back to at least 1937, when the German mathematician Hilmar Wendt set out to understand what happens when you add knots together—that is, when you tie both of them with the same string before gluing the ends together. (Mathematicians call this combined knot the “connect sum.”) Wendt thought that the unknotting number of the resulting knot should always be the sum of the unknotting numbers of the two original knots.

His prediction, now known as the additivity conjecture, makes sense. Say you add the two knots above, whose unknotting numbers are known to be 2 and 3. That means that there's a sequence of two crossing changes that unknots the lefthand side of the connect sum, and a sequence of three crossing changes that unknots the righthand side. If you use these sequences, you can unknot the whole thing in 2 + 3, or 5, crossing changes.

But this only tells you that the connect sum's unknotting number is no bigger than 5. You might be able to find a sequence of crossing changes that's more efficient than untying each side individually. That is, there might be a knot that really is less than the sum of its parts.

We just dropped absolutely everything else. All of life just went away. Eating, sleeping got annoying.

To settle the additivity conjecture, mathematicians had to either find a connect sum with a shorter unknotting sequence or prove that no such example exists. In either case, they didn't have a clue where to begin.

Part of the problem was that the way you lay out your knot—what mathematicians call a “diagram”—determines where and how the knot crosses over itself. There are lots of diagrams that can represent the same knot. To find the shortest sequence of crossing changes, you might have to choose just the right diagram. Often, it's not the one you'd normally associate with the knot.

“There are unimaginably large numbers of ways to try and imagine changing your diagram before you decide to introduce the crossing change,” Brittenham said. “We don't, at least at the start, have any control over how complicated the picture has to look.”

In 1985, the mathematician Martin Scharlemann finally made some headway when he proved that for any two knots whose unknotting number is 1, the connect sum will always have an unknotting number of 2. “That made [the whole conjecture] seem much more likely,” said Charles Livingston of Indiana University.

Susan Hermiller and Mark Brittenham disproved a decades-old conjecture about knots, complicating mathematicians' understanding of these seemingly simple objects.

The result offered tantalizing evidence that the universe of knots could be neatly organized. That's because all knots can be built out of a smaller class of “prime” knots. The additivity conjecture implied that once you knew the unknotting numbers of those prime knots, you would know them for all knots. Any information you might want about a given knot would fall naturally out of that much simpler set.

Mathematicians wanted the conjecture to be true, said Arunima Ray of the University of Melbourne, “because that would be like, there's order in the world.”

Scharlemann's result was later extended to other classes of knots. But it wasn't clear that it would apply to all knots.

Then Brittenham and Hermiller convened a cluster of computers to help.

The pair began their project a decade ago with a broader aim: to use computers to learn whatever they could about the unknotting number.

They turned to software known as SnapPy, which uses sophisticated geometric techniques to test whether two pictures depict the same knot. Just a few years earlier, SnapPy had vastly expanded its database, enabling it to identify nearly 60,000 unique knots.

It was perfectly suited for what Brittenham and Hermiller had in mind. They started with a single complicated knot and applied every imaginable crossing change to it, producing scores of new knots. They then used SnapPy to identify those knots—and repeated the process.

They did this for millions of knot diagrams that corresponded to hundreds of thousands of knots. Ultimately, they assembled an enormous library of information about unknotting sequences and calculated upper bounds on the unknotting numbers of thousands of knots. The work required a lot of computing power: The pair signed up for supercomputing time at the University of Nebraska's computing center, while also running their program on old laptops they'd bought at an auction. All told, they were managing dozens of computers. “We had a bit of a sneakernet,” Brittenham said, “where you transfer information from computer to computer by walking between them.”

Tait tabulated scores of knots and wrote about their properties. This page is from an 1885 paper.

The duo kept their program running in the background for over a decade. During that time, a couple of computers from their ragtag collection succumbed to overheating and even flames. “There was one that actually sent out sparks,” Brittenham said. “That was kind of fun.” (Those machines, he added, were “honorably retired.”)

Then, in the fall of 2024, a paper about a failed attempt to use machine learning to disprove the additivity conjecture caught Brittenham and Hermiller's attention. Perhaps, they thought, machine learning wasn't the best approach for this particular problem: If a counterexample to the additivity conjecture was out there, it would be “a needle in a haystack,” Hermiller said. “That's not quite what things like machine learning are about. They're about trying to find patterns in things.”

But it reinforced a suspicion the pair already had—that maybe their more carefully honed sneakernet could find the needle.

Brittenham and Hermiller realized they could make use of the unknotting sequences they'd uncovered to look for potential counterexamples to the additivity conjecture.

Imagine again that you have two knots whose unknotting numbers are 2 and 3, and you're trying to unknot their connect sum. After one crossing change, you get a new knot. If the additivity conjecture is to be believed, then the original knot's unknotting number should be 5, and this new knot's should be 4.

But what if this new knot's unknotting number is already known to be 3? That implies that the original knot can be untied in just four steps, breaking the conjecture.

“We get these middle knots,” Brittenham said. “What can we learn from them?”

He and Hermiller already had the perfect tool for the occasion humming away on their suite of laptops: the database they'd spent the previous decade developing, with its upper bounds on the unknotting numbers of thousands of knots.

When the paper was posted, I gasped out loud.

The mathematicians started to add pairs of knots and work through the unknotting sequences of their connect sums. They focused on connect sums whose unknotting numbers had only been approximated in the loosest sense, with a big gap between their highest and lowest possible values. But that still left them with a massive list of knots to work through—“definitely in the tens of millions, and probably in the hundreds of millions,” Brittenham said.

For months, their computer program applied crossing changes to these knots and compared the resulting knots to those in their database. One day in late spring, Brittenham checked the program's output files, as he did most days, to see if anything interesting had turned up. To his great surprise, there was a line of text: “CONNECT SUM BROKEN.” It was a message he and Hermiller had coded into the program—but they'd never expected to actually see it.

Initially, they were doubtful of the result. “The very first thing that went through our heads was there was something wrong with our programming,” Brittenham said.

“We just dropped absolutely everything else,” Hermiller recalled. “All of life just went away. Eating, sleeping got annoying.”

But their program checked out. They even tied the knot it had identified in a rope, then worked through the unknotting procedure by hand, just to make sure.

Their counterexample was real.

The counterexample Brittenham and Hermiller found is built out of two copies of a knot called the (2, 7) torus knot. This knot is made by winding two strings around each other three and a half times and then gluing their opposing ends together. Its mirror image is made by winding three and a half times in the other direction.

The unknotting number of both the (2, 7) torus knot and its mirror image is 3. But Brittenham and Hermiller's program found that if you add these knots, you can unknot the result in just five steps—not six, as the additivity conjecture predicted.

“It's a shockingly simple counterexample,” Moore said. “It goes back to that unpredictability of the crossing change.”

The result led Brittenham and Hermiller to an infinite list of other counterexamples, including almost any knot that's built by winding two strings and gluing.

Now, with the additivity conjecture decisively struck down, the knot theory community has a wide world to explore.

For some mathematicians, the new result brings disappointment. It reveals that there's less structure in the world of knots than they had hoped for. The unknotting number is “not as well behaved as we would like,” Ray said. “That's a bit sad.”

But from another perspective, that only makes the unknotting number more intriguing. “There's just much more complexity and unknowns about knot theory than we knew there were a few months ago,” Livingston said.

The nature of that additional complexity isn't clear yet. During their furious examination of their counterexample, Brittenham and Hermiller weren't able to develop an intuition for why it broke the additivity conjecture when other knots didn't. Understanding this could help mathematicians get a better handle on what makes some knots complex and others less so.

“I'm still stymied by this most basic question” about the unknotting number, Moore said. “That just lights the fire under you.”

My iPhone Wallet stores theater and transit tickets and all of my credit and debit cards, and it lets me sashay like a boss through my gym's turnstile. The tech works flawlessly, requiring only my proximity or the merest tilt of the device toward my face. Biometric goodness means I have few worries about security, even accessing my bank accounts.

So … why am I still opening my EV with a key?

OK, it's more than just a metal key; it's a passive electronic fob with proximity-based radio signaling, which means I don't have to press anything to unlock my car. But it's nevertheless a bacteria-rich, easily lost, marque-branded plastic blob that, in truth, I no longer need. And I haven't needed it for some years.

BMW 5 Series owners have been using smartphones to unlock, start, and digitally share access to their luxury vehicles since 2021, the year after Apple's introduced its plainly titled Car Key. Audi, Kia, and Hyundai later implemented support for ‌the feature. During the WWDC 2025 keynote in June, Apple said that 13 additional vehicle brands would “soon” join them, including Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC, and Porsche. “Soon” appears to mean 2026.

Tesla Model 3 owners have had digital key access since 2017, when the midsize sedan launched without a fob; it could only be opened with a smartphone. Subsequently, digital-native carmakers Rivian and Polestar also enabled digital key use. (“Digital Key has been removed from the upcoming 2025.34 software update for further testing,” noted a recent update from Rivian. The company's comms team tells WIRED it'll be available again “soon.”)

Owners of the latest high-end Ford vehicles can use digital keys. Still, the Dearborn, Michigan, company clearly isn't ready to ditch fobs—in October it launched the $200 Truckle, an ornate Western-style belt buckle with a cavity to fit the oversized F-150 fob, so it need never get lost or spoil the line of your jeans.

Phone-as-a-key functionality isn't just for select luxury cars. The wire-in MoboKey device turns a smartphone into a digital key and can be fitted by an auto electrician to almost any modern car, gas or electric.

Similarly, KeyDIY, a Chinese smart key maker, sells a USB-powered box of tricks that allows almost any car to operate with a digital key. The box grabs car connectivity signals–Flipper-Zero-style–emulating the rolling codes that key fobs use to foil signal boosting “relay” attacks where criminals use antennas and extenders to capture the signals from a car's key fob. (Always store your fob in a Faraday cage.) KeyDIY's box, which lives in the car, is actuated by a device connected momentarily to the vehicle's onboard diagnostic port.

In short, the picture here is that digital key tech is mature and (mostly) secure, and we're perfectly happy using Bluetooth Low Energy, near-field communication (NFC), and ultra-wideband (UWB) in the rest of our life—unless you're a conspiracy theorist who clings to cash, that is—so why are so many of us still seemingly so attached to our physical car fobs?

“Most people are reluctant to go without the physical backup of an actual key,” says Sean Tucker, managing editor of automotive research company Kelley Blue Book. And, he adds, picking up a fob is now an ingrained habit. There are also emotional factors to consider.

“A car key is full of meaning,” says Stefan Gössling, a professor at Linnaeus University, Sweden, and author of The Psychology of the Car. “Jingling them gives some motorists the opportunity to show off their automobile, even if the car is not close by. Car keys are also comforting to some, a physical reminder that your vehicle is there to take you away; to protect you.”

No amount of digital doohickeys will convince those who view branded physical fobs as a status signifier or who fondle fobs like automotive rosary beads. For the rest of us, going digital has its benefits. One can share digital keys with trusted individuals, allowing, say, a smartphone-packing child to hop into a family car while not allowing them to start the engine. Digital is also cheaper—a BMW i8 replacement fob costs up to $650.

Yes, you can perform many actions (such as scheduling air conditioning) with configurable button presses on a key fob, but who's got the mental bandwidth to memorize a suite of such sequences? It's so much easier to do it with a smartphone.

There's no rule against using a car's smartphone app and a physical key, but going fully digital makes life easier, especially for multi-car households where cars must be moved around when their owners are elsewhere.

But what if your smartphone runs out of battery? Apple says that Car Key can work for up to five hours after an iPhone's battery runs out, and it's the same for other smartphones. Rely on valet parking? Digital keys usually feature “valet mode.”

Despite previous heady predictions from the car industry, most drivers have yet to go fob-free. There are no stats available on digital-key adoption in the US, but Alysia Johnson, president of Oregon's Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC)—a mix of 300 device-to-car electronics companies and automotive suppliers, including carmakers—says “the number of digital keys in use [will] increase significantly in the years ahead, both in the US and globally.” She bases that claim on the 2025 S&P Global Mobility report, which notes that the annual volume of connected cars is estimated to increase from 56 million two years ago to 76 million by 2030.

Three options for unlocking.

Kelley Blue Book's Tucker cautions against suggesting digital key use will go mainstream by then.

“The rolling fleet on the road turns over very slowly,” he says. “There are a little under 300 million cars registered in the US right now, and, in an average year, we buy 16 million more and retire 12 million. So, at that rate, the actual turnover in the fleet is about 4 percent every year. The average car on American roads is about 13 years old, so most of [today's] fleet cannot be accessed with digital keys.”

Even for those cars that sport all the latest doodads, too many feature proprietary connectivity tech, a digital downer for many consumers. The Car Connectivity Consortium advocates for a common global standard for digital keys. Since last year, the organization's Digital Key Certification has complied with the standards of the German Federal Office for Information Security, becoming the first and only digital key standard to receive this critical designation.

The CCC states that adhering to the standard would mean carmakers “can ensure users are able to securely and safely access their vehicles, create and delete digital keys, share a digital key with others, and start their vehicle.”

The universal standard is intended to have cross-platform interoperability at its core. “Interoperability is what makes it possible to easily share a digital key with friends or family,” CCC's Johnson tells WIRED. “Not all digital key implementations are interoperable yet. Imagine you are a parent of two kids in high school who share a vehicle and want to start using digital keys. They have different brands of smartphones, and the car's digital key technology only works with one smartphone brand. This makes wider adoption of digital keys in the family more difficult.”

Security, too, should be more trustworthy through the adoption of a universal standard. “Manufacturers must ensure,” says CCC, “that their implementations are designed to prevent known hardware- and software-based attacks, such as tampering, storage intrusion, cloning, relay attacks, and unauthorized access.”

Consortium members include the main smartphone players (Apple, Google, and Samsung) as well as automakers such as Ford, GM, BMW, and Honda. Volkswagen is represented by its troubled software brand, Cariad. Rivian's Digital Key solution is built on the CCC standard and also supports Apple and Android digital keys.

Looking to Asia, however, and major player BYD might not be a CCC member, but there are many Chinese companies who have signed up with the Consortium, including Geely, Zeekr, and Nio. Several Chinese component suppliers are undergoing CCC's certification program, with Indeek Security the first Chinese OEM to meet the standard, gaining the right to use CCC's digital key logo in September.

CCC's standard should ensure suppliers use the same connectivity language, which will be essential as the technology improves. Automotive suppliers have recently released new NFC chipsets and UWB modules designed to operate in high-temperature, vibration-prone environments common in automotive. (NFC is used for close interactions, and UWB is for secure, precise distance measurements. iPhones have had UWB chips—used for the “Find Me” function—since iPhone 11 in 2019. The first Androids to be so equipped were released in 2020.)

Will carmakers ever play nicely with each other? Kelley Blue Book's Tucker isn't so sure. “There's tension between automakers who may say they want a common standard but who don't necessarily want to share the data that [digital keys] collect,” he says. “Apple CarPlay was adopted quickly because it's convenient, and users like it a lot. But automakers realized that Apple collects data on how the car gets used, and automakers would rather collect that data themselves so that they can monetize it. GM said that they're dropping Apple CarPlay from all of their cars, and I think you're going to run into a similar issue with digital keys.

“The more that [digital key technologies] are standardized, the more that automakers lose control, and I don't know if they're willing to do that.”

Automakers also want to squeeze customers for subscription income, and if they bundle digital key use in with paid-for apps it's likely that uptake will be stunted. Many manufacturers offer “free” access to their smartphone apps but then two or three years down the road demand monthly subscription fees.

Digital key technology is evolving especially fast in China. The Beijing company UbiTraq (short for “ubiquitous tracking”) produces a centimeter-accurate UWB-AOA (Ultra-Wideband, Angle of Attack) positioning system for automotive digital key applications. The system knows exactly where the smartphone outside the vehicle is, so, for instance, an owner approaching from behind would trigger the opening of a trunk rather than unlocking the driver's door.

Similarly accurate positioning tech for automotive digital keys has been developed by China's YF Tech and Shanghai HiSilicon using the Huawei-developed NearLink short-range wireless protocol (formerly known as Greentooth). Other component suppliers plan to use centimeter-accurate Bluetooth 6.0.

According to China's Automotive Digital Key Industry Trend Report 2025, nearly 3 million cars in China used digital keys for access in 2024, a 59 percent increase from the previous year. More than 80 percent of China's cars will sport digital keys within five years, predicts the report.

Moving beyond keys, Zeekr's 7X is equipped with a facial recognition system for locking and unlocking. And Audi's collaboration with China's SAIC—an electric SUV under the brand ""AUDI""—was recently spotted testing on public roads packing a facial recognition camera to unlock its doors.

While many of those who have taken the plunge to be sans fob already find digital key use to be worthwhile, the tech really comes into its own for fleet use and car rentals. With digital keys, fleet managers get a centralized overview of who is driving what, where, and when. Fleet drivers benefit from easy access to vehicles without going out of their way for fobs.

Rent a Tesla from Hertz, and you can opt for a digital key. “Tesla's digital key can transform your rental experience,” the company claims.

Car owners who rent their cars through the peer-to-peer rental service Turo can send digital keys remotely, so they do not need to meet renters in person to hand over fobs. Car rental firms of all stripes can easily revoke digital keys when the hire period is up.

While key fob use will take longer to die out than connected-car analysts expect—and may never disappear completely, especially if an embedded fob keeps your pants up—it looks like that despite being available for some time now, it will take many years before digital keys become the norm outside of China.

“Your phone has replaced your travel pass and your credit card, so why not your car key?” suggests CCC's Johnson.

For that to happen, the auto industry—especially dealerships—will need to improve at educating consumers about the advantages of digital keys and how to get them. We asked Hyundai if its digital key was part of a subscription or free, as it's packaged with the brand's Bluelink app. The representative had to check to be sure. (All model new Hyundais come with a free 10-year subscription to the basic Bluelink LITE; after that there's a subscription fee.)

Tucker isn't optimistic. “People already don't know about loads of features on their cars, and dealers also often don't know about them or don't devote enough time to explaining them to consumers. For more than a decade, Ford Lincolns have been able to parallel park themselves, but in recent software updates, Ford discovered that almost no one has ever used the feature. I wonder if there are a lot of Polestar drivers out there who have no idea they have access to a digital key?”

You'd think cold plunging would be a straightforward task. Strip down to your swim suit, take a controlled breath, and calmly get into the freezing water to see how long you can last. But as with any wellness trend that purports to offer myriad physical benefits, there are important caveats to consider.

The experts suggest that launching yourself into a cold plunge pool at the right time can make all the difference to how you feel and how effectively you work out. It can also change, depending on what type of exercise you have planned. If you've invested in one of the best cold plunge pools, or simply want to make use of the ice bath in your local gym, here's what the experts suggest to gain the best results from your cold-plunge practice.

Immersing your body in ice-cold water may sound like a fun thing to do when you're too hot and on vacation in the Bahamas. But on a rainy workday in midwinter, it fast loses its appeal. When carried out responsibly, the practice of getting into water between 10 to 15 degrees Celsius (50–60 Fahrenheit) for one to five minutes after a workout can be very beneficial for some, however.

“Cold plunging can be done in a dedicated plunge pool, an ice bath, or even a cold, natural body of water,” says Mohammed Enayat, a general practitioner and founder of longevity clinic HUM2N. “While some people try it purely for the invigorating feeling, there is now solid scientific evidence that cold-plunging offers a number of health benefits. Studies have shown that cold immersion can reduce muscle soreness, support recovery post-exercise, stimulate circulation, and boost your mood by triggering the release of endorphins and norepinephrine.""

Enayat also notes that cold plunging may also turn white fat into beige or brown fat, which is the “good fat” that burns calories and generates heat.

While these mind and body health benefits sound enticing, when you cold plunge matters, and it can have an effect on how successfully you train. It's also important to note that cold plunging isn't right for everyone. If you have heart or circulation issues, it can put sudden stress on your heart and nervous system. If you have any health concerns or are unsure whether you can cold-plunge, you should always consult your doctor before dipping into the ice.

The beauty of ice bathing is that you don't need to broadcast your plunge on socials to enjoy the process. You don't need an expensive gym membership either. For most, it can be easy to cold plunge from the comfort and privacy of your own home in a number of ways. Online, you can find plenty of dedicated cold plunge pools for use in or around your home and yard. CalmMax, Hydragun and Sun Home Saunas are just a few of the brands that sell easy-to-inflate pop-up cold-plunge pools with prices starting at $50.

You will have to pay a premium for designs with a dedicated filter that can also chill the water to a precise temperature, however. Otherwise, you'll have to make use of a cold tap and a few buckets of ice.

Another option is to fill your existing indoor bath up with icy cold water. If you're still wincing at the thought, turning the dial to cold at the end of your shower may be another route into experiencing some of the benefits of cold-water therapy. Shower company Mira launched a guided cold water digital shower, called the Mira Activate with ColdBoost. It comes with a selection of timed cold-water shower modes that incrementally lower the temperature of your shower to get you used to the process. It's surely only a matter of time before more bathroom companies follow suit and make it a standard offering in shower design.

If you've come across the term “contrast therapy”—the practice of alternating between hot and cold for the physical and mental benefits—you'll know it's fast becoming a popular practice in fitness circles at the moment. You move between the sauna, the hot tub, and either an ice bath or cryotherapy chamber.

While it has long been used in sports and physical therapy, there are now dedicated wellness centers that offer “contrast therapy routines,” with breath work, mindfulness, and red light therapy sessions thrown in for good measure.

But how do you do it on your own? Should you end on hot or cold? Do you still get the benefits if you immediately go into a hot tub after cold-plunging?

“The rapid change in hot and cold in contrast therapy stresses the cardiovascular system in a positive way and can improve circulation, recovery, and mental resilience,” says Gary Brecka, founder of The Ultimate Human. “But I always recommend ending on cold, as cold keeps your core temperature lower and prolongs the metabolic and hormonal effects. Going back to hot right after cancels some of that benefit.”

So should you cold plunge before or after a workout? It all depends on what type of exercise you've done and what your end goal is. The general consensus among fitness circles is that cold plunging is best done after cardio-specific workouts or at the start of the day, but not before a workout.

“Cold-plunging is best done after cardio or first thing in the morning, but not right after weight training,” explains Brecka. “Cold exposure before a workout can also reduce muscle temperature and blunt the body's natural signals for strength and growth. While post-cardio plunging can help reduce soreness and support recovery, doing it after lifting or before a workout may actually hinder muscle growth. That's because cold exposure can blunt the beneficial inflammation that triggers muscle adaptation and growth.”

If you do a strength training workout, Harrison Stevens, a performance specialist at the gym Third Space, suggests waiting six hours before cold-plunging. “If the main goal is muscle growth or tendon rehab post-workout, leaving some time before cold-plunging will allow the exercise-induced inflammation to settle,” he says. “If the workout was endurance-based, then there's no reason not to cold-plunge immediately, as it will improve recovery and your ability to go again tomorrow. After a cardio session, cold-plunging is the number one thing I want to do, as cold exposure also can spike dopamine, and it always feels great after a workout.”

At first glance one might think a tech startup and a feature film are worlds apart. Yet, as it happens, bootstrapping and building a tech company and producing an independent feature film are surprisingly similar. This was something that surprised me as I pivoted from startup CEO to movie producer. 

What can you learn from this? Your skills may be more transferrable than you thought, grit matters a lot, as do equal doses preparedness and luck.

Years after co-founding Wellpepper, a digital health startup, I produced This Bloody Country, an independent feature film, and I had expected the two experiences would be completely different. 

At their core, both start with a unique idea and a small team, naïve and determined enough to believe they can pull it off. The risks are high and many never make it. However, it turns out a surprising number of the fundamentals are the same. 

It all starts with an idea. Every startup and every film begins with a spark. For a startup, it's a problem worth solving. For a film, it's a story that needs to be told.

At Wellpepper, the spark was helping patients manage care outside the clinic. For This Bloody Country, it was creating a Western from a perspective that hadn't been seen before: a religious family of mostly women and children defending themselves in 1860s Utah Territory.

You build a founding team. The best early teams have some relevant skills and just enough hubris to believe they can figure out the rest.

For Wellpepper, the founding team was CTO Mike Van Snellenberg and me. Neither of us came from healthcare. We were technologists who believed we could apply product and design thinking to improve patient experiences. That outsider perspective became an advantage when we asked naïve questions, challenged assumptions, and moved faster than people who “knew” how things were supposed to work. 

For This Bloody Country, the founding team was writer/director Craig Packard and me. We didn't have studio backing, but we had a shared creative vision and the stubborn optimism to figure it out as we went. We had an award-winning script, written by Craig. We sought out diverse opinions on the characters, setting, and historical period, and pressure tested how the page would translate to screen by putting ourselves in the eyes of the audience. 

In both cases, we started by ideating on how to make the idea real — sketching, testing, and adjusting until we found something that resonated. Then we needed to figure out how to get it done with a business plan that was encapsulated in a pitch deck. Next step was to find people who believed in our shared vision and were willing to invest. While Wellpepper was a C-corp, and the movie an LLC, both were designed as investment vehicles with cap tables. 

In startups, you're promising a future that doesn't exist yet. In film, you're selling a story that hasn't been made. The ability to convey “why this, why now, and why us” determines whether you find your first investors.

You need to be ready to take advantage of luck. Luck is when preparation meets opportunity, and we had early lucky encounters with both projects. 

For Wellpepper, we met Dr. Terry Ellis from Boston University when all we had was a prototype. Dr. Ellis, an expert in Parkinson's disease, was studying how care outside the clinic could help slow the progression of the disease and became one of our first research partners. That collaboration resulted in two randomized controlled trial studies (one also in collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Bean from Harvard), and publications in peer-reviewed journals — powerful validation that our product actually improved outcomes. 

For This Bloody Country, our lawyer's extended family happened to serve on the board of Deer Springs Ranch in Kanab, Utah — which became our primary filming location. The incredible vistas offered million-dollar backdrops to our movie. We also could not have made the film without the help of his extended family: our lawyer's sister-in-law, an expert in period costumes, was our costume designer, and his brother-in-law served as armorer, art department, and even played a bandit.

Sometimes good timing and luck show up disguised as coincidence. What matters is being ready to recognize opportunity when it knocks.

Beginner's mind helps you recognize patterns. Many people in both industries told me it couldn't be done. In healthcare, experts warned that startups couldn't navigate the complexity of clinical systems. In film, veterans said making an independent feature wasn't anything like running a startup. 

They were right — and wrong. The details are different, but the patterns are the same. Both require solving complex, human problems with limited resources and incomplete information.

Approaching each challenge with a beginner's mind — curious, open, and unconstrained by “how it's always been done” — was essential. The key is not assuming you know the answer but recognizing familiar shapes in new contexts: building a vision, assembling a team, creating a project plan, and delivering a product to a customer or audience. 

In both startups and films, you must hire quickly, fire carefully, and align people around the mission. You look for collaborators who can thrive in ambiguity, bring specialized expertise, and check their ego at the door. Whether it's an engineer or a cinematographer, success depends on people who believe in the vision and are willing to do what it takes to get the job done.

The ability to translate experience across domains — without assuming they're identical — is what made both ventures work. You can't import the playbook, but you can import the mindset.

Bootstrap before you scale. It's often said that a CEO needs to wear all hats before they hire them, they won't be the best at the role, but will lead better when the role is filled by an expert. In a startup or indie film, founder or producer; you're the marketer, accountant, and sometimes the one hauling gear or answering the tech support hotline.

You learn to do more with less, to make trade-offs, and to keep momentum alive even when there's no money left in the budget. You've got to be okay asking for favors and negotiating. In general, people want to help, and you'd be amazed at what you might get if you ask. 

Iteration, testing, and refining. There's a saying in startups that if you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you waited too long to ship. The same can be said for getting a rough cut of a film in front of trusted viewers. 

For both though, you have to be strong in your vision to explore any feedback that indicates that there may be a problem. In both the startup and the movie if something was confusing to the end-consumer, that was an indication that we needed to iterate and provided the north star for making changes.

Headwinds vs tailwinds. As Mike Tyson said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” Both paths are defined by risk, and can benefit from, or be challenged by factors outside of your control. Competitors get press or funded, a very similar film or genre succeeds or flops. Regulatory changes offer benefits or drawbacks. Wellpepper was helped by value-based care initiatives which provided tailwinds. The film faced some additional costs due to COVID-related regulations while we were screening. You wake up every morning knowing the plan may not survive the day. Being able to pivot and having resilience are key to getting it done. 

It's harder to do it in Seattle. When we started Wellpepper, we were turned down by a lot of VCs because we weren't in Silicon Valley. There were essentially only two VC firms in town. We were told to move. We didn't, and that probably made it harder, but it also paved the way for many more digital health startups in town. Similarly, it probably would have been easier to get a movie made in L.A. where the primary industry is showbiz, but we found a small, committed group here (shout out to our executive producers and camera department) and quietly made something outside of the system. 

What founders and filmmakers can learn from each other

Don't index on the outliers. We've all heard the overnight success stories: the film that had a bidding war at a big festival, the startup that came out of nowhere and was aquired by a big tech company. The reality is that most people toil for a long time before you hear of them. That film script might have been on the shelf for years. The startup might have pivoted from something you hadn't heard of. Build what you believe in for the customer you want to serve, and try not to pay attention to the seemingly quick wins others are getting. 

Think about distribution from the beginning. How is your product going to get to the customer? How will they hear about it? Where will they get it? Putting an app in the app store or a video on a streaming platform is really only the first step of distribution. While most film is now digital, there are still distributors that facilitate getting the content to all the places it can be streamed (which often have different format requirements or submission guidelines). While there are outlets such as FilmHub that enable self-distribution, rising above the noise often requires help from a third party, just like software. 

Build a team for the long run. The team will make or break your project, and while we all like to think success will be quick, you may be working with these folks over a long period. You're going to be having long nights, and need to pull off miracles with this team. Hire people that you would hire again and again whether that's for your next creative project, your next startup, or building a team within a big company if you decide to go that route. 

Learn how to tell stories. Storytelling coupled with passion convinces people. Whether pitching investors or distributors, clarity and emotional resonance are your most powerful tools. When this comes through in your product or your film, it connects with your users and audiences. Start measuring early — whether that's clicks, social media mentions, Kickstarter supporters. Showing that there is a market for your product or for your film requires data. Data is a key part of the storytelling that convinces people.

Be ready for luck. Be prepared (or know when to drop everything to prepare) to take advantages of opportunities when they present themselves. Getting more traction than you expected is a solvable problem. Don't be afraid to scale. 

Creating something out of nothing is an act of optimism. Sticking with it is an act of grit. The data back this up: roughly 90% of startups fail, and about 97% of independent films don't recoup their investment. Wellpepper was among that small group of startups that achieved a successful exit when it was acquired in 2020, which gave me the confidence to take on the film challenge. This Bloody Country has not finished its journey yet, but it has been picked up by Quiver Distribution, is receiving audience praise, and is available to buy and rent on most streaming platforms. 

At the end of the day, both journeys are about creating impact, whether for a patient empowered to manage their own health, or an audience thrilled and moved by a story. And in both worlds, the real victory isn't just the exit or the box office — it's gathering an incredible group of people to build an idea into something tangible to share with the world.

What's it like to pitch your dream on Shark Tank, get rejected on national TV in front of 8 million people — and then turn that failure into a company Amazon later buys for more than $1 billion? Ring founder Jamie Siminoff did just that. 

A serial inventor and entrepreneur, Siminoff joins us on this episode of the GeekWire Podcast to talk about his new book, Ding Dong: How Ring Went from Shark Tank Reject to Everyone's Front Door (out Nov. 10), sharing the messy, high-stakes, and ultimately inspiring story behind the company.

Now back at Amazon as a vice president leading Ring and the company's home-security businesses, Siminoff reflects on failure, reinvention, and what comes next in the age of AI.

Listen below, subscribe on Apple or Spotify, and keep reading for highlights. 

What he learned writing the book: The book was almost therapeutic — just going back and looking at this stuff. … My best traits, my most powerful traits, the things that make me successful, are also the worst ones.

The importance of having a bigger mission: At Ring, if we had failed, I could still sit here today and say “We tried to make neighborhoods safer.” At least we were successful at trying something. And so that's where I think mission is just so powerful.

Establishing a company culture with a strong point of view: A real culture is something that not everyone feels matches them … Two things can coexist at the same time: You can have a ton of empathy and care about people and also be a hard-charger.

The inventor's mindset: Invention is not just product. Invention's everything. It's the process. And I think you can invent everywhere. … If you boil down what an inventor is, anything I see that's broken, I'm fixing it. I can't help myself.

Returning to Amazon: The thing that you get from leaving and coming back is the clarity of everything. I got to really see clearly everything we did, what we did wrong, what we did right. And so coming back, I feel like I have a newfound clarity for the business.

The impact of AI: What's crazy now is with AI, all those timelines are collapsing on themselves. In the next 12 months, I can't even imagine what we're going to be able to accomplish. … AI understands more like a human, [which] allows you to do things that are just completely different and more efficient.

Startups have never been able to offer the same sizable salaries as big tech companies. Now with companies like Meta and OpenAI willing to pay million-dollar salaries amid the AI race — the compensation divide has grown even larger.

Early-stage startups are not doomed though. If they develop a compensation strategy that is generous, fair, and flexible, they can offer competitive compensation packages and give themselves room to adjust their approach as they grow, according to founders and experts who were onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.

Startups shouldn't try to compete with big tech companies anyway, Yin Wu, the co-founder and CEO of equity management software Pulley, said on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in October. She added that a stable tech company and a startup don't generally attract the same potential candidates to begin with.

Startups should instead be as charitable as they can in their compensation packages, Wu said, regardless of their inability to match a big tech company's paycheck.

“My pretty strong opinion when it comes to equity for a startup is that you should be more generous than what you think you should be,” Wu said. “I think it is unlikely, if the company is really successful, you're going to look back and say, ‘man, I gave away too much equity of everyone that was at my company trying to make this company really successful.'”

Randi Jakubowitz, the head of talent at 645 Ventures, agreed. Jakubowitz added that when a startup is looking to make a competitive offer, they should set clear goals for the person they are hiring to ensure that hire lives up to the compensation they are getting.

“Make sure you're holding them accountable and make sure that you understand what the implications are from a vesting cliff standpoint,” Jakubowitz said, regarding when employees gain control over their equity stakes. “That's where, if you don't move quickly if someone's underperforming, that's equity that you'll never get back if they are fully vested. Make sure that there's very clear accountability. “

The panelists also stressed that companies don't need to get their compensation and equity strategies set in stone from the start. Startups should instead ensure their approach is fair from the beginning, so even if they do want to change, they have the proper foundation to do so without setting themselves up for legal trouble or soured office politics.

For Wu, and her company Pulley, that meant setting standards around compensation packages. Wu said the company pays a set range for each role — regardless of where a potential employee is based — and consistently builds compensation packages with equity offerings in the 90th percentile.

“Having this framework allowed us to be able to grow and say ‘great, as the company continues to do well, the actual number of shares you receive is going to differ because the value the companies differ, but that framework is still applied.”

Rebecca Lee Whiting, founder of Epigram Legal and fractional general counsel, added that having these standards will help companies avoid potential legal pitfalls down the line. For instance, it helps companies avoid offering unequal pay across candidates of different genders — which is something all companies should try to avoid ethically — but is also illegal in states like California, Whiting noted.

Whiting, Wu and, Jakubowitz all agreed that as long as founders approach building their compensation packages with fair intentions, everything else can be adjusted or changed down the line.

“I think it's really important to think about not just that process. Think about who are the people you're trying to hire and what is going to incentivize them to take that offer,” Whiting said. “It's not something that you have to get right out of the gate. You will likely have to do clean up post the Series B and acknowledging that is okay. But don't try and get it perfect out of the out of the gate when you're hiring your first few people.”

I mean I'd probably say this for any cat story in politics; but this really does seem like a moment where the British media should be making serious attempts at facilitating a national discourse. The stats suggest something is going wrong in the political system that needs to be talked out. Just eyeballing the politics headlines I'm not convinced the Guardian has their finger on that pulse.[0] https://www.theguardian.com/politics[1] https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/keir-starmer-p...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_U...

That's news to me. And without advertising, sales and subscriptions have never covered the cost, and advertising has a strong effect on what is published, or more often, what is not. Belloc describes this in his book “The Free Press” [0].[0] https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18018

When I see that it is widely accepted that ApoB is better to measure than LDL-C, but the industry continues to measure LDL-C, but not ApoB, I wonder why. It makes me skeptical.When I see that the purpose of statins is to reduce plaque buildup in the arteries, and that we have the ability to measure these plaque buildups with scans, but the scans are rarely done, I wonder why. Like, we will see a high LDL-C number (which, again, we should be looking at ApoB instead), and so we get worried about arterial plaque, and we have the ability to directly measure arterial plaque, but we don't, and instead just prescribe a statin. We're worried about X, and have the ability to measure X, but we don't measure X, and instead just prescribe a pill based on proxy indicator Y. It makes me skeptical.In the end statins reduce the chance of heart attack by like 30% I think. Not bad, but if you have a heart attack without statins, you probably (70%) would have had a heart attack with statins too. That's what a 30% risk reduction means, right?As you can see, I'm worried about cholesterol and statins.

As to why medicine is like this, it's because it's conservative, usually about 17 years behind university research[0], and doctors are shackled to guidelines in most health systems or risk losing their licenses.  It isn't a coincidence that the article author had his out-of-pocket concierge doctor tell him the more up-to-date stuff.[0] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/

To expand, one of the coverage pillars of malpractice insurance (in the US) is the ""standard of care"". This is basically what most doctors and their associations consider acceptable, which by definition excludes new, better techniques.This is both a bug and a feature. A move fast and break things philosophy would cause more harm than good, but it also prevents rapid adoption of incremental improvements.

ApoB is shaping up to be an incremental improvement in measurements, but health and fitness influencers have taken the marginal improvement and turned it into a hot topic to talk about.This happens with everything in fitness: To remain topical and relevant, you always need to be taking about the newest, most cutting edge advances.

For practical purposes, measuring LDL-C is good enough for most people to get a general idea of the direction of their CVD risk. The influencers like to talk about edge cases where LDL-C is low but then ApoB comes along and reveals a hidden risk, but as even this article shows there isn't even consensus about where the risk levels are for ApoB right now.

Meta-analysis conclusion: This literature-based meta-analysis did not find evidence for the benefit of statin therapy on all-cause mortality in a high-risk primary prevention set-up.

reply

There have been a lot of studies on statins. If a meta-analysis comes along and only cherry picks a couple of them, something is up.

reply

This is totally unsourced now but I did a deep dive quite a while ago now and it seemed to me that studies largely found that statins after a heart attack helped all cause mortality (though not by a ton), but if they were prescribed to someone before a heart attack it wasn't nearly as clear. Considering how they often make people feel it seems like people should be a bit skeptical.

reply

Financed by who?

reply

    Key Takeaway: Get a CT or CTA scan, and if you can afford it go for the CTA with Cleerly.

There is a reason that we don't recommend getting imaging for everyone, and that reason is uncertainty about the benefit vs the risks (cost, incidentalomas, radiation, etc, all generally minor). Most guidance recommends calcium scoring for people with intermediate risk who prefer to avoid taking statins. This is not a normative statement that is meant to last the test of time: it may well be the case that these tests are valuable for a broader population, but the data haven't really caught up to this viewpoint yet.

Hang on a second.This guy is making a big big claim.The central point of his article is that he went to a doctor who followed the guidelines, tested him and found he wasn't at risk for heart disease.But then he went to another, very expensive concierge doctor, who did special extra tests, and discovered that he was likely to develop heart disease and have a heart attack.Therefore he is arguing that THE STANDARD GUIDELINES ARE WRONG AND EVEN IF YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND YOUR DOCTOR CONFIRMS IT YOU MAY BE LIKELY TO DIE OF HEART DISEASE ANYWAY, SO ONLY THE SPECIAL EXTRA TESTS CAN REVEAL THE TRUTH.I want a second opinion from a doctor. Is this true? Is this for real? Because it smells funny.

It's scarily common in medicine for doctors to start specializing in diagnosing certain conditions with non-traditional testing, which leads them to abnormally high diagnosis rates.It happens in every hot topic diagnosis:When sleep apnea was trending, a doctor in my area opened her own sleep lab that would diagnose nearly everyone who attended with apnea. Patients who were apnea negative at standard labs would go there and be diagnosed as having apnea every time. Some patients liked this because they became convinced they had apnea and frustrated that their traditional labs kept coming back negative, so they could go here and get a positive diagnosis. Every time.In the world of Internet Lyme disease there's a belief that a lot of people have hidden Lyme infections that don't appear on the gold standard lab tests. Several labs have introduced “alternate” tests which come back positive for most people. You can look up doctors on the internet who will use these labs (cash pay, of course) and you're almost guaranteed to get a positive result. If you don't get a positive result the first time, the advice is to do it again because it might come back positive the second time. Anyone who goes to these doctors or uses this lab company is basically guaranteed a positive result.The same thing is starting to happen with CVD risks. It's trendy to specialize in concierge medicine where the doctor will run dozens of obscure biomarkers and then “discover” that one of them is high (potentially according to their own definition of too high). Now this doctor has saved your life in a way that normal doctors failed you, so you recommend the doctor to all of your friends and family. Instant flywheel for new clients.I don't know where this author's doctor fits into this, but it's good to be skeptical of doctors who claim to be able to find conditions that other doctors are unable to see.

Mainstream medicine is hyper optimized for the most common 80% of cases. At a glance it makes sense: optimize for the common case. Theres some flaws in this logic though - the most common 80% also conveniently overlaps heavily with the easiest 80%. If most of the problems in that 80% solve themselves, then what actual value is provided by a medical system hyper focused on solving non-problems? The real value from the medical system isnt telling people ""it's probably just a flu, let's just give it a few days and see"" it's providing a diagnosis for a difficult to identify condition.So if your question is ""how do we maximize value and profit in aggregate for providing medical care to large groups of people"", mainstream medicine is maybe a good answer.But if your question is ""how do we provide the best care to individual patients"" then mainstream medicine has significant problems.

It feels like the guy had a... mediocre GP, got scared by skin cancer diagnosis and over-corrected to most expensive path possible and since stuff was found out we have this article, roughly correct but written in a sensationalist (or freaked out) style. Some claims are outright false (like GPs not knowing heart disease is the biggest killer... really).Wife is a doctor with overreach between public and private healthcare, and those private services also have their own motivations which aren't often straightforward help-as-much-as-possible, rather milk-as-much-as-possible with tests, scans, long term treatments and so on. Especially CT scans pour non-trivial amount of radiation on the body that on itself can cause cancer down the line.With public healthcare you at least know primary motivation isn't cash flow but helping patients, the issue is rather overwhelmed resources with limited time per patient. It always depends on individual, as with engineering there are better and worse, yet we all somehow expect every single doctor to be 100% stellar infallible expert with 150 years of experience across all branches of medicine (absolutely impossible for any human being). Look around at your work if you are an engineer and perceive the spread of quality/seniority of each colleague. Same happens in medicine, just stakes are (much) higher.

The best thing you can do for yourself is to establish healthy diet and lifestyle habits that are sustainable. A lot of people who jump from obsession to obsession do a great job at optimizing for something for a few years, but when their life changes they drop it completely and fall back to forgetting about it.Fad diets are the original example of this: They work while the person is doing it, but they're hard to maintain for years or decades. CrossFit and other exercise trends have the same problem where some people get extremely excited about fitness for a couple years before falling off completely because it's unsustainable for them. Some people are able to continue these things for decades, but most people do it for a short while and then stop.I'm now seeing the same pattern with biomarker obsessives: They go a few years obsessing over charts and trying things for a few months at time, but when the interest subsides or they get busy with life most of it disappears.The most successful people over a lifetime are those who establish healthy habits that are easy to sustain: Eating well enough, reducing bad habits like frequent alcohol or fast food consumption, some light physical activity every day, and other common sense things.The most important factor is making it something easy to comply with. The $300 biomarker panels are interesting, but most people don't want to pay $300 every year or more to get snapshots that depend largely on what they did the past week. Some people even get into self-deceiving habits where they eat well for a week before their blood tests because the blood test itself has become the game.

But that loaf you buy at the store? It'll generally be covered in mold before it gets hard, and that's quite the achievement since it also tends to be more resistant to mold as well! Bread should get hard. This is where a ton of old recipes come from. The Ancient Greeks would dip it in wine for breakfast, Euroland has bread soup/puddings, and even stuff in the US like Thanksgiving stuffings or croutons.

Actually they are not. ""Practically"" is carrying a lot of weight there. The factory baked cake will have a lot more extraneous ingredients and usually has a larger quantity of sugar and fat. Similar to how restaurant food generally has a lot more salt and fat than home cooked food.

The direct impact of those extra ingredients alone or in combination is not entirely clear at this point, aside from building evidence that people whose diets include more of that seem to be less healthy.

Some stuff is BIO, cream or coconut milk are lower fat version, or carrots are are without residual pesticides. Less salt since we use less salt, and taste buds quickly adjust so its still adequately salty, a better mix of herbs and spices so taste is.. simply better, more refined. We use with much less sugar, the same as for salt above (if you eat sweet stuff sparingly then even mildly sweet stuff tastes amazingly, just don't go from one extreme to another).

There are two known harms from scans:- Radiation. This is why people shouldn't get these scans several times a year, but 1-2 are very unlikely to move the needle. The average radiation from a full chest CT is just under the average dose for ~2 years of normal background radiation. (I don't know if a CTA uses less than average.)- Acting on something you would otherwise have ignored, where ignoring it might have been the right answer. The main problem here is that it's hard to get a medical opinion saying ""you should ignore this"" because of perverse incentives: there's an aversion to recommending doing nothing because that could lead to a lawsuit, whereas ""overtreatment"" will not get a doctor sued. However, you can make a deliberate decision to do this anyway even after getting the scan; seek second and third opinions, consider alternatives, weigh risk versus reward, make a considered decision.

Processed meats are so bad, they should be eliminated entirely from everyone's diet. The World Health Organization has classified processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen. No amount of it is considered safe.Unprocessed read meat is still a problem and WHO advises less than 350g a week. Which is 12–18 ounces of cooked meat. 12g is about one adult serving of steak. So you really are looking at 1.5 servings per week of unprocessed red meat to be safe. At most! You probably should try for less or closer to 12g.And really if you're at a healthy weight, then I'm not sure how helpful this is. Obesity is a bigger risk factor. This is a bit of the elephant in the room for heart health. Not only should we not be eating things associated with heart disease but also we need to keep ourselves at a healthy weight.

Most doctors recommend against these and against the full body MRI one can get because they believe you'll always find things you don't expect and that will make you indulge in interventions that have weak support, resulting in deleterious iatrogenic effects.I found that I had no such impulse with the data I had. But a friend of mine, supplied with evidence of a little arrhythmia went through a battery of tests and experimentation.

That's not totally off, but the thing about cardiovascular disease is it affects everything because it's how your body distributes oxygen. Stop distributing oxygen and you die.That's not to say other organs aren't important, it's just that if you replace ""cardiovascular"" with ""oxygen distribution"" it becomes apparent that almost by necessity it's going to include a lot of deaths.

Why the f* not.My in-laws are over 95. They refuse to go to an elderly home and as a result make everyone miserable, starting with themselves and inflicting infinite suffering on their children who each have a family of their own, and need to take care of them all of the time.I don't want to do that to my own children. I don't want to not die. I don't esp. want to die but I'm not really afraid of it, it's just a normal part of life.Preventing heart disease is probably a good thing, but if one prevents every ailment conceivable then how does this work eventually?

Even if you want to give OpenAI the benefit of the doubt by comparing it to other software primos, they're doing terribly. Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc. were profitable almost immediately after their founding. In the cases where they accumulated losses it was a deliberate effort to capture as much of the market as possible. They could simple hit the brakes and become profitable at will.In OpenAI's case, every week yet another  little-known lab in China releases a 99% competitive LLM at a fraction of their costs.It's not looking good at all now or in the long-term.

Entergy is not just going to sit around and take the L if the project doesn't ultimately turn out to be a good long-term investment. They're simply going to pass the cost on to their customers in the region (more so than they already plan to in the event of success). Meanwhile Louisiana taxpayers are footing the bill for all the subsidies going through these projects.So yeah I agree it's not quite as high risk because at least there's some in infrastructural investment, but that's not the kind of investment that is really needed in the region right now and having that extra capacity is not a good thing unfortunately.To be clear I'm not really disagreeing with you.

> Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn't have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won't have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.”> That's not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said.> Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he'd take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he'd seemingly be off the hook, they said.Is an intended takehome message of the article that Altman should invest his own money (with potential loss, or profit), or that he should be given a big compensation deal (maybe like the one Musk just got)?

All that the AI Industry is doing is scaling computation/data in the hope that the result may encompass more of ""existing real-world data"" and thus give the illusion of thinking. You don't know whether the correct answer is due to reasoning or due to parroting of previously seen answer data. I always tell common folks to think of LLMs as very very large dictionaries eg. with the words from a pocket oxford dictionary you can construct only so many sentences whereas from a multi-volume set of large oxford dictionaries you can construct orders of magnitude more sentences and thus the probability of finding your specific answer sentence is much much higher. Now they can understand the scaling issue, realize its limits and why this approach can never lead to AGI.

Not everyone that starts at the line gets a medal because there are people that don't finish and they don't get their medal.Once you start moralizing about only winners should get medals or trophies, then you have to start looking at arbitrary distinctions like men's and women's different divisions, age divisions, weight divisions, pro versus amateur, college versus high school.Really the extension of logic is that only the champion of a given sport or event at the very highest level should get a trophy.I think what rubs a lot of people about youth sports participation trophies, is that you're basically rewarding just showing up, well devaluing actual focus training preparation or genetic advantage of the better players.

I'm not a fan of QR code menus either, but printed menus are not necessarily cheap.

IIRC, the restaurant later shifted to a cheaper and simpler menu design.

reply

Even if he didn't have to adjust prices due to inflation, surely restaurants adjust the items on their menus frequently. I have been to a restaurant that printed new menus daily because it changed daily. It's like 10 sheets of paper or cardstock. It's not that expensive.

reply

If you're a restaurateur, do you have the .ai files your agency created, an Adobe Illustrator license, and know-how to get in there and change the prices? And then know where/how to deliver the result to get it printed? If so, you probably still have something better to do...You probably pay an agency an hourly rate plus markup to get them updated, prepped and sent off to be reprinted.Next time: negotiate fixed prices/timelines for small updates, own the files, and own the relationship with the printers.

Increasingly often, it is ""download our app"". And they will try to force it by sabotaging their website. I did a pickup order from Walmart once. You're supposed to take a numbered parking place and check in, but if you try it from the website on a mobile, it'll redirect you to download the app. There's no getting around it. I don't recall if I tried desktop mode on the website, but the website is a pretty cluttered widescreen mess anyway. (Fortunately at the parking area there's a phone number for checking in posted.)I run into similar sabotage issues with Facebook (yes I am just a year or so shy of being a boomer). You can no longer use messaging on mobile, it tells you to download the app. Desktop mode does work, though (for now; I'm sure someone will try to take it away). All this stuff used to work on phones.

Inspections don't help; any slight variations in road angle puts someone in direct sight of correctly adjusted headlights. Unadjusted headlights aren't the problem, and probably never will be, unlike the old headlights. Most LED headlights are relatively new and perfectly adjusted (and are designed to stay adjusted forever.)I don't know the whole story, but I heard that Europe has widely adopted dynamic masking on LED headlights and that in the US, lobbying of some sort is preventing adoption. I would LOVE if we had such a thing… or some fancy night goggles that could mask all bright points without masking anything dark (or maybe even boost the darks)… I would be willing to pay a lot of money for that.Edit: a search just informed me that the headlight laws changed in 2022, and dynamic masking is coming here. https://www.mcnicholaslaw.com/adaptive-driving-beams-on-the-...

If so, they are widely adopted here in the EU but only for full beams not the regular headlights.

Ah too bad if it doesn't apply to low beams… LED low beams are still extremely problematic.The search results are telling me that dynamic masking in the US will only apply to low beams and not high beams. Maybe that's a good thing? I'm just hoping the situation will get better somehow.

Definitely, I'd love for that here in the EU as well. With it being pitch black half of the year here in Sweden I'm constantly blinded by LED low beams to the point that high traffic country roads are becoming very difficult.However, LED matrix / dynamic high beams is also a godsend. On a country road, you can keep your high beams on and they will disable the pixels that would blind the other drivers, but still light up the side of the road where deers and moose appear.Maybe one day we can have both

The F150 lights are so high that they're blinding even when properly pointed down.  We need proper regulations for maximum height too.  And while you're at it, regulations for maximum hood height so that they stop killing so many pedestrians.

But I generally agree - ever since I got PRK eye surgery ultra white car lights are hard for me to handle.

Blue-white headlights are actually much less functional for human vision than yellow/amber headlights, so the engineers had to use the regulatory loophole to exponentially increase the output of their marketing-imposed blue-white lights.

By now, there's a mountain of evidence that social media—not to mention, like, the internet in general—is not particularly good for children. With an iPhone, the average teenager has access to every terrible thing on the web that adults do, but none of the emotional maturity to handle it. Teens now spend hours on their phones every single day, and, despite the fact that many teens say social media is bad for them, they can't seem to pry themselves loose from it.

And the problems linked to social media? Social and psychological maladies galore, increased anxiety and depression, etc, etc, etc.  

In the U.S., states are kinda sorta catching up to this fact and, in lieu of any federal action, producing their own regulatory restrictions on teen digital access. In other countries, governments have been a little bit more proactive. Indeed, Denmark has decided to take the most efficient route to protecting young users and decided to just ban them from using social media altogether.

Yes, the Associated Press notes that Denmark's Minister for Digital Affairs, Caroline Stage, has announced a ban on social media access for children under the age of 15. Australia is in the process of launching a similar effort.

“The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” Stage told the AP. Stage said that the Big Tech companies “have an absurd amount of money available, but they're simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”

Stage said that the ban would not take effect immediately, but would likely come together at some point in the next several months. “I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won't do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” the official told the AP.

From the available information, it's a little unclear exactly how such a ban would be enforced. Stage said that Denmark plans to create an official age-verification app, so presumably such an app might be part of the process.

Regulating tech has always been difficult, since it moves so fast and regulatory bodies notoriously move so slow. As governments move to finally inhibit the harms of social media, AI is busy getting accused of causing an assortment of new social harms.

Lenovo just kicked off what may be the single most aggressive Black Friday laptop deal of the season, and the best part is that you won't even find it on Lenovo's own website. The company rarely slashes prices this steeply through its own direct channels to protect brand perception, but Amazon has the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and 512GB PCIe SSD for just $599: That's a massive 76% off the $2,499 list price, which makes this the all-time low price ever seen for this configuration.

See at Amazon

Meanwhile, Lenovo's site is showing zero Black Friday discounts on comparable models while Amazon is practically giving away this business-class machine at a price that undercuts most budget laptops with far weaker specs.

The Intel Core i5-13420H processor powering this laptop brings serious capability to the table: This chip rips through multitasking scenarios that would choke lesser processors, thanks to 8 cores divided between 4 performance cores (up to 4.6GHz) and 4 efficiency cores (up to 3.4GHz). Complementing the processor is 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and it is faster and more efficient than the DDR4 memory found in most laptops at this price. This means smoother performance when you are flipping from one application to another, faster data processing, and better responsiveness in general.

The 15.3-inch WUXGA display (1920×1200) offers more vertical screen space than standard Full HD panels which translates to less scrolling when you're working on documents, browsing websites, or reviewing spreadsheets. The IPS panel ensures consistent colors and wide viewing angles so that you are not stuck trying to find the perfect screen tilt to avoid color shifting. At 300 nits brightness with anti-glare coating, this display remains readable in bright environments like coffee shops with huge windows or outdoor places.

As for port selection, it's actually useful: you get two USB-A (5Gbps) ports, one USB-C that supports both USB Power Delivery 3.0 for charging and DisplayPort 1.2 for hooking up another monitor, HDMI 1.4 for presenting or adding more display real estate, a headphone jack, an SD card reader for transferring camera photos, and a separate power connector.

For $599, this Lenovo Windows 11 Pro laptop costs less than many inferior laptops that sport older processors, slower DDR4 RAM, smaller storage capacities, and dimmer displays. The 76% discount brings this business-class laptop down to a price point where it actually undercuts generic brands that can't match Lenovo's build quality or performance capabilities.

Dell just dropped one of its most capable laptops down to an absolutely absurd low price for early Black Friday, and honestly, it's hard to believe this deal is real. The Dell Inspiron 15.6″ laptop packs some serious firepower with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor (10 cores), 32GB DDR4 RAM and a spacious 1TB PCIe SSD. Normally listed at $2,549, it's now down to just $749 at Amazon for a 71% discount and an all-time low price for this configuration. The kicker? Dell's own website isn't offering any discount on this model, so Amazon is the only shot at snagging this deal.

See at Amazon

The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U isn't your average mid-range processor: It boasts 10 cores split between 2 performance cores-each boosting up to 4.6GHz-and 8 efficiency cores going up to 3.4GHz which means it can handle heavy multitasking without breaking a sweat. That 32GB of DDR4 RAM backs up the processor beautifully and gives you enough headroom for demanding tasks. Mated to the 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, you get boot times in mere seconds and plenty of room for all your work files.

The anti-glare coating and narrow borders of the 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen (1920 x 1080) make this laptop a real pleasure to work on for extended periods. Intel Iris Xe graphics handle everyday visual tasks, from smoothly streaming 4K content to light creative work and casual gaming. The display's narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without bloating the laptop's footprint so you get a spacious viewing area in a package that still fits comfortably in most laptop bags.

Port selection is generous: one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C, one USB 2.0, HDMI 1.4 for external displays, a headset jack and an SD card reader built right into the laptop. But Dell sweetens the deal further by bundling an 8-in-1 Type-C hub that adds even more connectivity: an RJ-45 Ethernet port, two additional USB 3.0 ports, SD and Micro SD card slots, another headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port.

Windows 11 Professional comes pre-installed – in S Mode, though you can switch out of it free – giving you access to business features like BitLocker encryption, remote desktop capabilities, and enhanced security tools unavailable on the Home edition.

For $749, this Dell Inspiron laptop is less expensive than many budget laptops that carry far inferior specs, slower processors, half the RAM, and smaller storage capacities. The generic brands might tempt you with lower prices, but they rarely match the build quality, support network, and reliability that Dell brings to the table.

GEO Group, ICE's largest contractor, held an earnings call on Thursday where it discussed the future of its business as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up immigration enforcement in the U.S.

The company foresees a rise in the number of people held in detention, as well as more people being monitored through phone apps and ankle bracelets. But the numbers aren't quite as high as they envisioned before Trump came back into office for a second time in January.

GEO said it expects to “scale up immigration detention to approximately 100,000 beds or more from the approximately 60,000 beds ICE is currently utilizing,” according to a transcript of the earnings call from Seeking Alpha. The company expects even more people to be monitored in what's called “alternative to detention,” (ATD) schemes, which can include everything from check-in via a smartphone app to ankle monitors that are required to be worn at all times.

SmartLINK, the smartphone app, is currently used by about 147,000 people, while about 30,000 have ankle monitors, according to Bloomberg. The tracking program is run by BI Inc., which started in 1978 making a tracking device for cattle, according to the Washington Post. GEO said it expects to see more reliance on ankle monitors in the future.

The Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) is a subprogram within ATD that applies to people who are considered high risk for flight but are still allowed to live in the community rather than being locked up in a detention center. BI secured a contract worth as much as $1 billion for ISAP. GEO said Thursday a new contract allows for 465,000 participants in the ISAP program within the next two years, up from 183,000 in the old contract.

One of the bottlenecks for GEO has been the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has instituted a policy that any contracts above $100,000 be reviewed and approved by Noem personally. That new policy was blamed for a slow response by FEMA to a deadly flood in Texas back in July. Noem denied it, but the New York Times reported in August that other spending requests weren't getting through as quickly as they should.

GEO cited that bottleneck as the first of three reasons that the “pace of new detention contracts has been slower than anticipated.” The second reason was the government shutdown, which has meant that people awarding new contracts are being more cautious. The third reason cited by GEO is the lack of staff to ramp up deportation efforts. ICE wants to double its employee count from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people but GEO notes that is “time and staff intensive.”

“There's millions of people that are on the non-detained docket,” GEO founder and executive chairman George Zoley said on the earnings call. “And there's going to be a desire to provide more clarity as to where they are, what stage they are in with respect to their hearing process, and making sure they get to their hearing and if they're not qualified to be in the country to deport them.”

GEO Group donated $1 million to Trump's re-election campaign according to OpenSecrets. The company contributed $500,000 more to Trump's inaugural committee, according to CREW.

As Bloomberg notes, GEO has cuts its earnings forecast, which sent the company's stock down 10%. GEO Group saw its share price soar after Election Day, going from $14.18 on Nov. 4, the day before the election, to $26.48 a couple of days after the election. The stock price closed at $15.13 on Friday.

“While the exact timing of government actions, including new contract awards is difficult to estimate, as a management team, we are focused on maintaining a level of readiness to successfully pursue and capture future growth and continuing to allocate capital to enhance value for our shareholders,” said Zoley.

If you need something to look forward to this holiday season, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill duology is being re-released in theaters as a combination film, The Whole Bloody Affair.

Beginning December 5, the “single, unrated epic” can be seen in either 35 or 70mm film and feature a never-before-seen anime sequence from Production I.G of Ghost in the Shell fame. Being two movies fused into one, Affair will run over four hours long, but don't worry: Lionsgate is throwing in a 15-minute intermission. It's also going to live up to its name and be pretty bloody, which you can see in the trailer below.

Released in 2003 and 2004, the Kill Bill films star Uma Thurman as ex-assassin Beatrix Kiddo, who's hunting down her fellow Deadly Viper assassins after they try to kill her and her unborn her child on her wedding night. Inspired by 1970s kung fu flicks, the cast includes Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, and the late David Carradine, and both movies were well-reviewed, with Thurman earning Golden Globes nominations for each movie. They also made a lot of money—$180.9 million for the first and $150.3 million for the second, with the former having the highest-grossing opening weekend of Tarantino's career when it came out.

Tarantino previously screened The Whole Bloody Affair a handful of times, but this marks its first-ever nationwide release. He's also mentioned wanting to do a third movie, saying in 2021 he'd like to bring in Thurman's real-life daughter Maya Hawke as the grown version of Beatrix's daughter B.B. as they flee from assassins. But since he's apparently retiring after his tenth film, that may not be in the cards, ditto a home release for Affair.

Tickets for Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair should go up soon.

Consumers are in for a shock.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few Japanese computer stores in Akihabara have started limiting the sales of storage and memory modules due to limited inventory. According to Akiba PC Hotline [machine translated], several shops have imposed limits to prevent hoarding, with one limiting customers to just eight items per group. Another one has even more stringent restrictions, only releasing two storage drives or SO-DIMMs and up to four pieces of memory per buyer, although customers buying a completely new PC can negotiate for a higher limit.

These shops imposed these caps because they haven't been receiving the expected number of deliveries for these items, and their inventories are running low. Distributors are reportedly suspending deliveries of some products, with no clear outlook for when supply will return to normal. This crunch means that prices for these components are expected to skyrocket, with PC builders and enthusiasts looking for performance parts to be hit the hardest by the shortage and price hikes.

The shortage of these memory and storage chips is caused by the massive demand for AI GPUs, with manufacturers pivoting their production lines to accommodate the insatiable demand for SSDs, DRAM, and HDDs for the AI infrastructure build-out. It's gotten to the point that memory pricing has already climbed by 100%, meaning you'll have to pay a lot more for the best RAM for gaming.

You also won't save money if you opt for older DDR4 tech, as supply for these chips has also started dwindling, as memory makers transition to the newer and more lucrative DDR5 modules. This meant that companies still using this for cheaper product lines are now stockpiling supplies, further increasing your costs if you're looking to replace or upgrade the memory on your older system. While some companies are extending or restarting DDR4 production, their volumes are not sufficient to reduce market pressure.

This perfect storm of increased demand and reduced supply has pushed the memory and storage industry to the brink, with consumers getting shocked by the pricing changes. Even if manufacturers want to increase production capacity, it takes years to build new factories capable of churning out more memory and storage chips. Aside from that, there's the specter of the AI bubble, with many experts saying we are already in one, and that the pop is just a matter of time. Because of this, companies might avoid aggressive expansion, as demand could vanish at any time.

As the year draws to a close, anticipation for CES 2026 grows. Samsung has provided a preliminary preview of its forthcoming Detachable AutoSSD (AM9C1 E1.A) and PM9E1 M.2 22x42, a 2242 variant of the OEM drive designed to rival the best SSDs in the market. The radical new modular SSD design has a swappable NAND and SSD controller that can be detached independently. The company also showed off its new tiny 4TB PCIe 5.0 SSD.

Samsung introduced the original AM9C1 automotive SSD last year, a BGA drive that incorporates the company's proprietary 5nm PCIe 4.0 controller and 8th-generation V-NAND flash. The latest E1.A version of the AM9C1 maintains these components but now features a modular design. Consequently, Samsung markets the AM9C1 E1.A under the new Detachable AutoSSD series. The modular configuration separates the SSD controller from the NAND into two distinct modules, thereby facilitating upgrades and replacements. Samsung asserts that the new E1.A form factor also extends the product's operational lifespan by enhancing heat dissipation.

The original AM9C1 was available with capacities ranging from 128GB to 2TB, with sequential read speeds up to 4,700 MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1,400 MB/s. It's modular AM9C1 E1.A form factor provides extensive versatility, allowing automotive manufacturers or owners to replace the PCIe 4.0 controller with a faster PCIe 5.0 alternative in the future or to increase storage capacity with higher-capacity NAND components.

The AM9C1 E1.A caters to autonomous vehicles. However, it is reasonable to envisage a similar implementation within the consumer SSD market. Samsung can easily port this design to the mainstream market; however, the associated costs are likely to be substantial, as is typical for cutting-edge technology.

The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is essentially an iteration of the original PM9E1, rendered in a more compact form factor. The initial model is a M.2 2280, whereas this new variant, as indicated by its designation, is presented in an M.2 2242 package. Although not a prevalent form factor, it is commonly utilized in ultra-thin laptops, tablets, or mini-PCs. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is marginally too long for the Steam Deck, as the device employs M.2 2230 drives. Nonetheless, modifications exist to accommodate larger drives within Valve's gaming handheld; however, such alterations are not generally advisable.

The PM9E1 is a PCIe 5.0 drive featuring Samsung's 5nm Presto SSD controller and V8 TLC V-NAND. It essentially serves as the OEM variant of the Samsung 9100 Pro, tailored for the consumer market. The M.2 2242 segment is not very crowded; however, the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 will compete against Corsair's recently announced MP700 Micro. Similar to its competitor, the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 supports capacities of up to 4TB. This makes these M.2 2242 drives particularly appealing to Steam Deck users, as the increased surface area permits higher capacities, whereas M.2 2230 SSDs are limited to a maximum of 2TB.

The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 provides sequential read and write speeds of up to 14.8 GB/s and 13.4 GB/s, respectively. Consequently, it offers significantly higher performance compared to the MP700 Micro. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 demonstrates a 48% increase in sequential read speeds and a 58% increase in sequential write speeds. Although the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is classified as an OEM drive, Samsung's OEM products occasionally enter the grey market and are available at more competitive prices; however, this often entails the absence of the standard warranty typically associated with consumer products.

These are some robust storage devices.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has successfully recovered the black boxes — including the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) — of the ill-fated UPS Airlines Flight 2976, with the agency saying that it has fully pulled the cockpit audio from their charred remains. According to the NTSB's YouTube briefing, it secured over 2 hours of digitally recorded audio, including the last 25 seconds of the flight during which the accident sequence occurred. Below are also images of the black boxes throughout the data forensics process.

“The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of what we consider good quality digital recorded audio. In reviewing that audio, the crew completed their standard checklists and briefings in preparation for the flight,” said NTSB Member Todd Inman, one of the five officials leading the investigative agency. He also added, “About 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, a repeating bell was heard on the CVR, which persisted until the end of the recording 25 seconds later. During this time, the crew engaged in efforts to attempt to control the aircraft before the crash.”

The CVR and FDR are data recording devices mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for installation on all commercial aircraft. These are more popularly known as black boxes, although they are actually painted bright orange to make them easier to find in the debris field of any crash. Unfortunately, the recovered black boxes were severely charred black due to the intensity of the post-crash fire.

(Click 'See More' on the above tweet to see the embedded images of the black box.) These devices used magnetic tape when they were first introduced in the 1960s, but were eventually replaced by solid-state memory (SSDs) starting in the 1990s. This made them far more robust, allowing these units to safeguard the recorded data even in the most violent of events.

Once recovered, they assist the investigating body in determining the cause of the crash. The FDR records up to 25 hours of critical aircraft systems, and could include altitude, airspeed, heading, and over a thousand other parameters. In the meantime, CVRs record more than just the voices of the flight crew — instead, they capture everything audible in the cockpit, including aural warnings and other environmental sounds. These two devices have helped authorities solve mysteries time and again, allowing them to improve the entire aviation industry across the globe.

Even though the NTSB has already extracted UPS 2976's CVR, it's not releasing it to the public until the entire investigation is complete. Inman said that a team of experts on the MD-11, the model of the accident aircraft, will review the recording and output a transcript.

“Our role is not to speculate on the cause of why we're here. We want to know what happened and why it happened — and the most important thing is to make sure that it doesn't happen again,” says Inman. He then later said, “Now, this CVR transcript will be made public only when a majority of the other factual reports are placed in the NTSB public docket for this accident, and that will be several months from now.”

These black boxes are a marvel of engineering, especially considering how we often think of electronics as sensitive electronics. The FDR and CVR are designed to withstand 3,400Gs of impact force for 6.5 milliseconds, withstand 1,100 degrees Celsius for half an hour, and withstand 20,000 feet of underwater pressure. Nevertheless, we're sometimes surprised by the survivability of memory drives, like the 512GB SanDisk SD card found undamaged in the Titan submersible's wreckage.

It is undoubtedly the age of OLED these days, with a new display appearing about as fast as I can review them. Since they are so close in terms of contrast and color quality, the only way to differentiate the best OLED gaming monitors from the pack is with high refresh rates. We were satisfied with 240 Hz for quite some time, but now 500 Hz is the new normal.

Gigabyte's Aorus line has always contained high-performance displays, and the FO27Q5P is the latest addition. It's a 27-inch QHD 2560x1440 Quantum Dot OLED panel with 500 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, DisplayHDR 500 and wide gamut color. Let's take a look.

The FO27Q5P is absolutely packed with features and performance. Nothing has been left out, and, in a few areas, it outclasses all the competition. Starting with its 500 Hz refresh rate, that is a native figure, no overclocking required. I didn't even have to set the resolution when running Windows on it for the first time. It went right to 500 Hz without a hiccup. Of course, it's certified FreeSync Premium Pro, and it is G-Sync Compatible. It also features a black frame insertion option for reducing motion blur, and includes OLED anti-flicker technology to prevent artifacts during rapid changes in refresh rate. Every possible video processing option is included here.

The picture is stunning thanks to a Quantum Dot layer, which expands the color gamut to over 108% of DCI-P3. And accuracy comes out of the box with no need for calibration. Brightness is high, over 500 nits for HDR content, and you get variable brightness, meaning small highlights will exceed 1,000 nits. Black levels, it goes without saying, are OLED deep, meaning they are unmatched by any LCD technology.

Panel health is enhanced by passive cooling, which maximizes airflow through a graphene layer and component heatsinks, eliminating the need for fans. You also have extensive options for features like pixel shift, logo detection, and panel refresh. Gigabyte backs the FO27Q5P with a three-year warranty that includes burn-in.

Connectivity is also top-notch, with DisplayPort 2.1 support through two inputs, one of which is the mini version, and an output for daisy-chaining multiple screens with a single cable to your PC. You also get DP functions through the USB-C port, and there are two HDMI 2.1 inputs as well. KVM is supported by USB 3.2, one upstream and two downstream ports. There are two 3.5mm analog jacks, one for headphones and another for a microphone. The FO27Q5P is a complete gaming hub that lets you connect all your peripherals. A pair of internal speakers operates with 5 watts of power, and there's a backlit Aorus logo that can display different colors and effects.

My FO27Q5P arrived in a plain white box, suggesting that it was an early production sample. It's packed in cleverly engineered cardboard rather than crumbly foam, and the entire carton is recyclable. After assembling the three parts —base, upright, and panel —I found a small external power supply, plus HDMI, USB-C, and USB-A/B cables. There's a 100mm VESA mount for monitor arms, but no fasteners are included.

The FO27Q5P sticks to the two-piece version of OLED style, with the screen surrounded by a metal backing and a large component bulge attached to its backside. The bulge isn't too thick and is nicely accented up top by a backlit Aorus logo whose colors and effects can be controlled from the OSD. This separate panel approach makes cooling easier since air can flow through freely. There's a graphene layer behind the OLED, and no fans are required.

The stand is solid and substantial with a slender but wide base made from cast aluminum and finished in a fine crinkle powder coat. Adjustments include 5/20 degrees tilt, 20 degrees swivel and a 5.1-inch height adjustment. You also get a 90-degree portrait mode. Movements are firm with no wobble or play, which befits this premium display.

In the back, you can see a fine grill pattern offset by the LED lighting. There's an Aorus logo and two small accents underneath the stand attachment point. It doesn't draw too much attention to itself, but still adds a nice touch of visual flair. The stand has a cutout running its full length, and there's a cable clip to keep your wiring tidy.

The potential for lots of wiring is here thanks to the FO27Q5P's extensive connectivity. There are two DisplayPort 2.1 inputs, one standard and one mini, and the USB-C input supports DisplayPort. You also get two HDMI 2.1 inputs, and there's a DisplayPort output, something I rarely see. This means you can daisy chain multiple monitors with a single cable connection to the PC. USB is version 3.2 and has one upstream and two downstream ports. Full KVM functionality with a setup wizard is included in the OSD. Finally, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack and a 3.5mm microphone input. I'm surprised there isn't DVI and VGA back there too!

The FO27Q5P's OSD is packed with features for video processing and image adjustment. There are gaming aids, KVM switching, and even quick-change resolution options. Literally nothing has been left out here.

Gaming is first with VRR (Adaptive-Sync), which includes an anti-flicker function with two levels of correction. It is intended to prevent flicker during rapid changes in refresh rate. I ran several tests and never saw flickering, whether it was on or off. You also get Ultra Clear, which is a black frame insertion feature. It works at speeds below 250 Hz with VRR turned off. It cuts brightness by about 50% but it will eliminate blur at low frame rates. The magic number in my observation is 200fps. Anything above that doesn't need help, but below that, Ultra Clear is effective at keeping motion resolution high.

Each of the 10 picture modes has either all the image controls or a subset of them. Standard lets you change the important things like color temp and gamma. You also get gamut selection though to use sRGB, you must select the sRGB picture mode, which only allows brightness changes. The Native color space option covers just over 108% of the DCI-P3 color space.

The KVM wizard allows you to bind peripherals to video inputs via either USB-C or USB-B, enabling you to control multiple systems with a single keyboard, mouse, and display. It can be two PCs or a PC and a console, for example. The FO27Q5P has both PIP and PBP capabilities, allowing you to view two video sources simultaneously. The remaining settings are located in the System menu, where you can find the LED controls under RGB LED.

It took me a while to find the variable brightness options because Gigabyte hides them confoundingly in the OLED Care menu. It should be with the other image controls, not in a menu accessed outside the main OSD tree. It's called APL Stabilize and it has three settings. The closest one to constant brightness is Low. And it can only be adjusted for SDR content. In HDR mode, it's locked to its most aggressive level for the brightest possible highlights. Other options here include pixel shift, pixel clean and logo/corner dimming.

Gigabyte includes its full suite of Game Assist options with timers, a stopwatch, refresh rate indicator, and the ability to move the information around the screen. There are four different aiming points, and you get a sniper mode and night vision. Tactical Switch is a resolution toggle for changing screen aspect ratio and sizing on the fly.

Calibrating the FO27Q5P is purely optional if you pick the Standard picture mode. The default is Eco, and it limits brightness, so I recommend avoiding that one. With a few changes to the RGB sliders, I took grayscale tracking from good to great and tightened up the gamut chart in the process. Gamma tracks closely to the reference, so all detail is crisply rendered at all brightness levels. My SDR settings are below, with APL Stabilize set to Low. If you use Middle or High, you'll likely need a lower brightness value to keep the picture from being too harsh.

When an HDR signal is present, the FO27Q5P offers five specific modes, all but one of which are adjustable for brightness and contrast. The best choice there is HDR Peak 1000 because it has the most accurate luminance and color tracking. The FO27Q5P delivers some superb HDR with bright highlights and richly saturated color.

The FO27Q5P has several video processing options, so I'll take them one by one. Playing Doom Eternal and other similar titles at max detail on a GeForce RTX 4090-equipped PC, I saw framerates between 350 and 450 frames per second (fps). Though there was constant and wide fluctuation, I never needed to employ the anti-flicker setting. That's just as well because it doesn't work in HDR mode.

To use Ultra Clear, I had to disable Adaptive-Sync and reduce the refresh rate to 250 Hz. The only difference I noticed was the 50% reduction in brightness. It wasn't any smoother because motion was already perfect without help. It was obvious, though that this would be an effective tool to maintain high motion resolution at speeds below 200fps. There are no visible artifacts to spoil gameplay.

To explore the variable brightness feature, I had to play in SDR mode. With HDR content, the setting is grayed out and it's locked to the most aggressive level. That provides excellent HDR with brightly detailed highlights and deeply detailed shadow areas. Speaking of, the best HDR mode was Peak 1000. It delivers the best detail rendering and the most accurate color. Game and Cinema are very good too, but with a little less impact. Vivid should be avoided as it made the image look garish and cartoonlike.

Though a GeForce RTX 4090 provides very high frame rates, a 5090 would be the way to the FO27Q5P's full potential of 500fps. Black frame insertion (Ultra Clear) is something few OLEDs have, so if you have a slower card, it can adapt better than other displays.

Color and contrast were superb regardless of other settings as long as I stuck with HDR Peak 1000 or Standard for SDR content. I'm used to the larger DCI-P3 gamut for SDR even though it isn't strictly correct. The FO27Q5P has an sRGB mode which is accurate enough for critical work, but I noted slightly light gamma that could not be corrected. In Standard, there are gamut options but sRGB isn't among them.

For other tasks and media, the FO27Q5P is a great desktop tool. The pixel density of a 27-inch QHD screen provides a sharp image with no pixel structure visible at normal viewing distances. It certainly gave nothing away to Ultra HD screens when gaming. Smooth motion and high frame rates are always preferred over sheer pixel density.

I noted the FO27Q5P's large list of extras like USB ports, KVM, clear speakers with four audio modes, and its premium build quality and user experience. The speakers play clearly at decent volumes and the modes sound different from one another, with my favorite being Game for its broad and deep sound stage. Online players will appreciate the inclusion of both headphone and microphone jacks. That's something almost no monitors offer.

Takeaway: The FO27Q5P is a premium display in every way. It includes absolutely every feature under the sun for gaming, entertainment and productivity. The picture is gorgeous with rich color and contrast only an OLED can deliver. It exudes excellent build quality and solid feel. In the 27-inch QHD OLED category, it's hard to imagine better.

The K565RU3 is a 16KB DRAM IC that was cloned from Western chips found in classic machines like the Apple II, Commodore PET, and original IBM PC.

A fascinating Soviet-era retro electronics artifact was dissected and micrographed by CPU collector CPU Duke this weekend. Under the enthusiast's selection of microscopes this time was the ‘K565PY3.' The IC under scrutiny was a Dynamic RAM chip with a 16KB capacity, and this particular sample was believed to have come from the Mezon factory in what is now Moldova. For context, we think the K565PY3 is a reverse-engineered clone of the 1970s/80s era Intel-designed 4116 DRAM chip.

#WeekendDieShots!Thanks to @RetroNora7734 for sending over some Russian ICs. Today, I started with the 16K × 1-bit Dynamic RAM made in Moldova probably at “Mezon” factory.A 🧵…The lid was really solid… had to open it like a fish can… pic.twitter.com/gmhUx1CHmFNovember 2, 2025

The first thing CPU Duke noticed about the K565PY3 was its sturdy “fish can” construction. However, it didn't take long to pop that off and begin the in-depth silicon survey, starting with a stereo microscope in light reflection mode. Immediately clear are the chip's structures and multitude of memory cells (of course).

CPU Duke dove deeper, with their ring light making it possible to peer into structures below the surface layer. Did they count them all? Our intrepid silicon sleuth commented that the IC storage consisted of “a 128 x 128 matrix of storage cells.”

Next up, CPU Duke switched to their metallurgical microscope to reveal a different level of detail. It was noted that some Cyrillic etching could be translated as the English word “Tempo,” indicating this was fast DRAM. Further visual analysis highlighted the “CAS (Column Address Strobe), RAS (Row Address Strobe), and the row decode section of the DRAM.” Techy folks who've spent any time tuning their modern PC memory will be familiar with terms like CAS and RAS values, and their relevance to memory and system performance.

CPU Duke provided a little background detail about the provenance of this ‘fish can' memory chip. Our investigations make it pretty clear this is a clone or reverse-engineered version of the Intel 4116 DRAM chip, which roamed the Earth from the late 70s to early 80s.

In the West, versions of the Intel 4116 were used in legendary computers, such as the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Commodore PET, and IBM PC – as well as in classic arcade machines like Defender and Missile Command. CPU Duke's sample from the Cold War-era USSR could have been plucked from a Soviet home computer – again, likely a clone of a Western machine. Contemporary Soviet embedded systems and industrial electronics would also use 4116 DRAM IC clones.

The Intel 4116 DRAM wasn't just available from Intel in the West. Electronics makers also often sourced these ICs from makers like Texas Instruments and Mostek. It is thought that the Soviet K565PY3 was reverse-engineered from a Mostek sample. Whichever model you might find, in used and salvaged hoards, these truly old ICs should be functionally identical.

SAN ANTONIO — Distinguishing between the various forms of cutaneous lupus can be challenging, even for experienced clinicians. 

If a patient presents with a malar rash — also known as a butterfly rash — think acute cutaneous lupus until proven otherwise. “ That's nearly always associated with systemic lupus,” Amanda Mixon, a certified physician assistant at UCHealth's Rheumatology Clinic in Fort Collins, Colorado, said at the Society of Dermatology Physician Associates (SDPA) Fall Dermatology Conference.

Subacute cutaneous lupus typically appears as annular or psoriasiform lesions on sun-exposed areas. These lesions can be associated with SS-A antibodies, but can also be induced by drugs, including hydrochlorothiazide, terbinafine, and proton pump inhibitors. According to Mixon, 30%-50% of affected individuals present with mild systemic features, such as arthralgia and fatigue, “but that's rarely associated with severe organ damage,” she said. 

Chronic cutaneous lupus appears as discoid lesions or scarring plaques with follicular plugging, hypopigmented or hyperpigmented skin, and the potential for permanent alopecia. An estimated 5%-15% of affected individuals progress to systemic lupus, Mixon said, making it relatively rare for the condition to develop into systemic lupus, but a biopsy can be helpful to make that diagnosis.

Other cutaneous variants include lupus panniculitis, characterized by deep, firm nodules; tumid lupus, which presents as edematous plaques without scale; and chilblain lupus, characterized by acral lesions that are aggravated by cold temperatures. An estimated 5%-10% of these variants develop into systemic lupus.

Predictors of systemic involvement include high-titer antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and positivity for anti-dsDNA or anti-Smith (SM) antibodies, low complements, leukopenia, or anemia, widespread/disseminated cutaneous lesions (especially discoid lupus erythematosus below the neck), and younger age at onset.

“We often will get consults for ANAs of 1:40 or 1:80,” Mixon said. “We really do not get very worked up about those. But if I see an ANA of 1:120, I worry about that patient,” she explained, noting that more antibodies can contribute to chronic inflammation that may attack different parts of the body. “So, a higher-titer ANA raises the suspicion that something more systemic may be going on,” she said. 

Histologic features of cutaneous and systemic lupus are essentially the same. Characteristics include interface dermatitis, vacuolar alteration of the basal layer, necrotic keratinocytes, and mucin deposition, “particularly in chronic discoid lupus,” Mixon said. “Follicular plugging is also common in discoid lupus.”

The clinical and serologic context helps to differentiate cutaneous and systemic lupus. Mixon recommends asking patients questions such as, “How do you feel? Are you having problems doing basic activities like getting a milk carton out of the fridge or combing your hair? Do you feel tired?” Lupus “is a different type of tired,” the feeling of barely being able to function, she said. “It's very like flu-like. I tell my lupus patients, ‘Your body's fighting a war inside, so you're going to feel awful.' ”

Mixon routinely orders a direct immunofluorescence (DIF) biopsy in cases of suspected lupus. The so-called “lupus band test” shows deposition of IgG, IgM, and C3 at the dermoepidermal junction. “This will help guide you to tell you if this is an underlying autoimmune process,” she said. In cutaneous lupus, DIF is typically positive in lesional skin, while in systemic lupus, DIF can be positive in nonlesional sun-protected skin.

Management of lupus includes the regular use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 50, Mixon said, and hydroxychloroquine remains a cornerstone of treatment. Other common treatments include methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and the biologic agents belimumab and anifrolumab, Mixon said, noting that anifrolumab, in particular, is helpful in treating cutaneous lupus.

Mixon disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

Scientific theory predicts that having more offspring leads to a shorter life span, including in humans. However, despite some hundred years of research, there is no unequivocal evidence for this link. Researchers from the University of Groningen (the Netherlands), the University of Exeter (UK), and the University of Turku (Finland) have now shown that under harsh conditions, the biological cost of reproduction can indeed shorten women's lifespans. The results were published in Science Advanceson November 7, 2025. 

In the 1860s, Finland experienced several harsh winters, resulting in a series of poor harvests and famine. Researcher Euan Young from the University of Groningen used life-history data from Finnish parish records to study the effects of these harsh conditions on the relationship between reproductive effort and lifespan. 

In total, Young studied data from 4,684 women over a period of 250 years. Women who were exposed to the famine during their reproductive years (19-45 years old) lived shorter lives when they had had more children. Mothers with just one child on average reached the age of 71.6 years, while a mother with fifteen children reached the age of 64.3 years. So, each child shortened the mother's lifespan by about half a year. Women who were not exposed to the famine, or who experienced it during a different phase of life, did not experience a shorter lifespan. 

For over a hundred years, researchers have studied how reproduction influences lifespan, with mixed results. This has led some to believe that reproductive behavior is not a significant factor in shaping human aging. Contrary to this, our findings suggest that under harsh conditions, reproductive effort certainly affects lifespan.'

Researchers have unveiled the intricate molecular mechanisms governing TCF/LEF-mediated transcription in the canonical Wnt pathway, identifying these proteins as promising therapeutic targets for cancer and fibrotic diseases. The review, published in Current Molecular Pharmacology, systematically dissects how four mammalian TCF/LEF paralogs-TCF7, LEF1, TCF7L1, and TCF7L2-achieve functional specificity through modular domain architecture and extensive alternative splicing.

TCF/LEF proteins function as the final integrators of Wnt signals, converting β-catenin activation into precise transcriptional outputs. Their regulation involves a complex interplay of co-repressors, chromatin remodelers, and post-translational modifications that we've only recently begun to understand in detail.""

Yusuke Higuchi, co-author from Beckman Research Institute

The study reveals that Wnt enhanceosome components remain pre-assembled in a poised configuration even in the absence of signaling, enabling rapid response upon β-catenin nuclear translocation. Key regulatory mechanisms include TLE co-repressor clearance via UBR5-mediated ubiquitination, context-dependent TCF isoform switching, and phosphorylation by kinases such as TNIK and HIPK2.

Most significantly, the review documents the clinical translation of these findings. The TNIK inhibitor INS018_055, identified through artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, successfully completed Phase II trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), demonstrating reduced lung function decline over 52 weeks. ""This represents the first robust clinical validation that targeting TCF/LEF regulatory kinases can safely modulate Wnt signaling in humans,"" Higuchi noted.

While challenges remain in developing direct TCF/LEF binders due to their intrinsically disordered β-catenin binding domains, emerging PROTAC and AI-designed protein technologies offer new avenues. The study underscores the potential for selective TCF/LEF modulation to treat diverse diseases while avoiding toxicity associated with upstream Wnt inhibition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Real-time personalized music enhances emotional experience and performance","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251107/Real-time-personalized-music-enhances-emotional-experience-and-performance.aspx","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 03:49:00 GMT","

Researchers from University of Jyväskylä have found that personalized interactive music systems – smart technologies that adapt rhythm and tempo to users' movements – can make exercise more enjoyable and help people stay active longer.

These systems, known as PIMSs, use real-time data from wearables and smartphones to adjust musical features such as beat, tempo, and style to match the user's pace – whether walking, cycling or lifting weights.

For example, when the systems detects you speeding up, it raises the music's tempo to match your energy – helping you stay motivated and in rhythm.

This new systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to examine how interactive, adaptive music can influence both exercise performance and emotional experience. Participants who exercised with adaptive music reported more positive feelings and greater motivation during their workouts - in other words, they enjoyed exercising more.

The findings also show that faster music tempos were linked with greater benefits, supporting the idea that matching music to movement can help sustain effort and improve performance.

Music has always been a motivator for movement. By personalizing it in real time, we might better support people in sustaining exercise routines.""

Dr. Andrew Danso, Study Lead Author, Centre of Excellence in Music, Mind, Body and Brain, University of Jyväskylä

The review analysed results from 18 studies across Europe, Asia, and North America, highlighting the growing potential of adaptive music systems in making physical activity more engaging and sustainable.

The study suggests these technologies could play a key role in encouraging people to stay active - an important step in addressing global health challenges linked to physical inactivity.

New research reveals that contrary toconventional belief, primary glomerular diseases are not necessarily benign for children and young adults. In fact, some subsets of children and young adults may experience faster kidney function decline than older patients. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9.

Direct comparisons of outcomes between adult and pediatric patients with primary glomerular diseases are rare-including minimal change disease (MCD), focalsegmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy (MN), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Researchers analyzed data from CureGN, one of the largest longitudinal cohort studies of glomerular diseases. When they examined the rate of kidney function decline and the risk of progression to the composite outcome of kidney failure, ≥40% drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or death, children and young adults had similar or even higher risks of meeting these adverse outcomes as older adults.

Pediatric patients with a biopsy-diagnosis of MCD had steeper eGFR declines compared with adult patients with MCD. MN patients aged 13–17 years and FSGS and IgA nephropathy patients aged 18–44 years at the time of biopsy had thesteepest declines in eGFR among their diagnosis cohorts. For patients with MCD, FSGS, and MN, no differences were detected among various age groups in the risk of progression to the composite outcome of death, kidney failure, or ≥40% eGFR decline, while IgA nephropathy patients aged 6–12 years, 13–17 years, and 45–64 years had lower risks of progression compared with those aged 18–44 years.

These findings suggest that young patients who obtained a kidney biopsy diagnosis of primary glomerular disease face significant risk of reaching kidney failure and requiring dialysis and / or a transplant in their lifetimes. We believe that future studies are needed to shed light on the lifetime burden and morbidity of primary glomerular diseases on patients diagnosed at a young age.""

Margaret Helmuth, MS, lead author of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

""Our research also highlights the importance of including children in clinical trials for disease treatment to mitigate against the adverse outcomes they face,"" added co-author Chia-shi Wang, MD, MSc, of the Emory University School of Medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study reveals CKD affects nearly 800 million adults worldwide","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251107/New-study-reveals-CKD-affects-nearly-800-million-adults-worldwide.aspx","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 04:51:00 GMT","

The number of adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has more than doubled since 1990, reaching nearly 800 million worldwide, according to new research published in The Lancet. The findings come from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, which tracked CKD trends among adults age 20 years and older across 204 countries and territories from 1990 through 2023. 

The study was led by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, and the University of Glasgow. Drawing on 2,230 data sources, the analysis offers the most comprehensive assessment to date of the fatal and non-fatal burden of CKD worldwide. 

CKD was the ninth-leading cause of death globally in 2023, claiming nearly 1.5 million lives, and the 12th-leading cause of disability. Unlike most other leading causes of death, the global age-standardized mortality rate from CKD increased, from 24.9 per 100,000 in 1990 to 26.5 per 100,000 in 2023. 

China and India, with some of the world's largest populations, have the highest numbers of people affected by CKD, at 152 million and 138 million. But the disease is widespread, with the United States, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, and Turkey each reporting more than 10 million adults living with CKD. 

""Chronic kidney disease is a growing global health crisis, yet much of its impact is preventable. Reducing deaths is essential to meeting the WHO target of cutting premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third before 2030,"" said Lauryn Stafford, co-author author and researcher at IHME. 

The study also highlights CKD as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and points to the risk factors driving its rise. In 2023, kidney dysfunction accounted for almost 12% of global cardiovascular deaths, ranking seventh among risk factors for cardiovascular mortality, ahead of diabetes and obesity. 

The study identified 14 detailed risk factors for CKD, with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity driving the greatest loss of healthy years of life. Dietary factors, such as low fruit and vegetable intake and high sodium consumption, also made substantial contributions. 

Chronic kidney disease is both a major risk factor for other leading causes of health loss and a significant disease burden in its own right. Yet, it continues to receive far less policy attention than other non-communicable diseases, even as its impact grows fastest in regions already facing the greatest health inequities.""

Dr. Theo Vos, Study Senior Author and Professor Emeritus, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

The rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes, together with global population aging, is driving a growing burden of the disease. In 2023, the global age-standardized prevalence of CKD was around 14% among adults aged 20 years and older. The highest prevalence was found in North Africa and the Middle East (18.0%), South Asia (15.8%), sub-Saharan Africa (15.6%), and Latin America and the Caribbean (15.4%). Countries with the highest prevalence included Iran, Haiti, Panama, Nigeria, Mauritius, Seychelles, Grenada, Mexico, Libya, and Costa Rica. 

In 2023, most people with CKD were in the early stages of the disease (stages 1-3). This highlights the importance of screening programs and risk-reducing strategies, including more accessible treatments to control blood sugar and blood pressure. These approaches can reduce excess cardiovascular mortality and delay the need for costly kidney replacement therapies in advanced stages of the disease. 

Because access to kidney replacement therapies including dialysis and transplantation remains limited and uneven worldwide, greater emphasis is needed on preventing disease progression and ensuring equitable care. Expanding access to diagnosis and affordable care, tackling key risk factors, and investing in strategies that slow disease progression will be essential to lessen the growing toll of CKD on patients, families, and health systems worldwide.

University of Phoenix College of Doctoral Studies announces the publication of a new white paper, ""Recovering from Burnout Through Mentoring,"" authored by Carla M. Harris, Ed.D., and Sandra Sessoms-Penny, Ed.D, both Fellows at the University of Phoenix Center for Organizational Wellness, Engagement, and Belonging (CO-WEB). The paper examines how structured mentorship can support employees experiencing burnout and offers actionable guidance for organizations and leaders to foster resilience and engagement.

Grounded in current research and insights from the University's Career Optimism Index® study, the authors note that employee burnout remains pervasive, with 51% of U.S. workers reporting that they experience it, and argue that mentoring is a scalable, human-centered lever that can improve personal agency and workplace outcomes.

The white paper summarizes evidence-based benefits of mentoring for individuals navigating burnout, including helping mentees boost self-confidence, improve job performance, reduce stress and enhance overall well-being. It also details common emotional, physical and mental signs of employee burnout and provides practical strategies for recovery such as prioritizing self-care, reframing work perspective, reassessing priorities and seeking support.

""Mentorship gives people a partner in problem-solving,"" said Harris. ""When mentors offer consistent feedback, accountability and encouragement, employees can rebuild confidence and re-engage with their work in healthier, more sustainable ways.""

""Organizations don't have to wait for burnout to become a crisis,"" added Sessoms-Penny.

By equipping mentors and managers with clear frameworks, leaders can normalize help-seeking, reduce stigma and create pathways back to purpose and performance.""

Carla M. Harris, Ed.D., University of Phoenix

The full white paper is available on the University of Phoenix Career Institute® webpage or on the College of Doctoral Studies' Research Hub.

Harris is an experienced early childhood educator whose educational research focuses on issues in leadership, mentoring and student success. Sessoms-Penny is a Senior Research Fellow at CO-WEB and serves as a University Research Methodologist and faculty member in the College of Doctoral Studies.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes, have significant heart- and kidney- protective effects. In the kidney, SGLT2 reabsorbs approximately 97% offiltered glucose in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule, while SGLT1reabsorbs the remainder in the S3 segment.

In research conducted in rats, investigators found that dual inhibition of SGLT1 and SGLT2 more effectively reduces salt-sensitive hypertension and kidney injury than SGLT2 inhibition alone. The findings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5–9.

Salt-sensitive hypertension-elevated blood pressure due to excess salt consumption- affects nearly half of individuals with high blood pressure and substantially contributes to kidney disease, cardiovascular complications, and progression to kidney failure. When researchers compared selective SGLT2 inhibition (through treatment with dapagliflozin) with dual SGLT1/2 inhibition(through treatment with sotagliflozin) in a well-established rat model of salt-induced hypertension and chronic kidney disease, they found that both drugs had profound effects on slowing the progression of salt-induced hypertension.

Compared with selective SGLT2 inhibition, dual SGLT1/2 inhibition produceda greater reduction in mean arterial pressure and more effectively attenuated kidney injury, although it had no impact on blood pressure under normal-saltconditions. Sotagliflozin also reduced body weight, enhanced urinary sodiumand chloride excretion, and nearly doubled fractional glucose excretion compared with dapagliflozin. Neither treatment altered kidney function. SGLT2 inhibition modulated several metabolic pathways in a region-specific manner in the kidney, with pronounced effects on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling.

Our study provides preclinical evidence supporting the expanded use of dualSGLT1/2 inhibitors beyond heart failure and diabetes, extending their potential into hypertension management, particularly in salt-sensitive patients.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Studies uncover two novel, critical strategies for bacterial surface movement","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251108/Studies-uncover-two-novel-critical-strategies-for-bacterial-surface-movement.aspx","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 05:03:00 GMT","

New studies from Arizona State University reveal surprising ways bacteria can move without their flagella - the slender, whip-like propellers that usually drive them forward. 

Movement lets bacteria form communities, spread to new places or escape from danger. Understanding how they do it can help us develop new tools to fight against infections. 

In the first study, Navish Wadhwa and colleagues show that salmonella and E. coli can move across moist surfaces even when their flagella are disabled. As part of their metabolism, the bacteria ferment sugars and set up tiny outward currents on the moist surface. These currents carry the colony forward, like leaves drifting on a thin stream of water.

The researchers call this new form of movement ""swashing."" It may help explain how harmful microbes successfully colonize medical devices, wounds or food-processing surfaces. Understanding how metabolism drives bacterial movement could help researchers develop new techniques to limit infections, for example by changing local pH or sugar availability.

""We were amazed by the ability of these bacteria to migrate across surfaces without functional flagella. In fact, our collaborators originally designed this experiment as a 'negative control,' meaning that we expected (once rendered) flagella-less, the cells to not move,"" Wadhwa says. ""But the bacteria migrated with abandon, as if nothing were amiss, setting us off on a multiyear quest to understand how they were doing it.

It just goes to show that even when we think we've got something figured out, there are often surprises waiting just under the surface, or in this case, above it.""

Navish Wadhwa, Arizona State University

Wadhwa is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution and assistant professor with the Department of Physics at ASU.

The study appears in the Journal of Bacteriology. The paper has been selected by the journal as an Editor's Pick, highlighting the importance of the research.

When bacteria feed on sugars like glucose, maltose or xylose, they sometimes give off acidic by-products such as acetate and formate. These by-products draw water from the surface, creating currents that push the bacteria outward. Fermentable sugars are essential for this process - without them, the microbes can't move in this way. Sugar-rich environments in the body, such as mucus, may actually help harmful bacteria spread and cause infection.

When researchers added detergent-like molecules known as surfactants to the colonies, the bacteria stopped swashing. In contrast, surfactants did not affect swarming, a coordinated, flagella-powered form of movement that lets bacteria spread rapidly across moist surfaces. This suggests the two forms of movement use distinct physical mechanisms, and that surfactants that can be used to selectively suppress (or enhance) the movement of bacteria depending on whether they are swashing or swarming.

The fact that bacteria can colonize surfaces even when their normal swimming machinery is impaired has important implications for human health. Some microbes may spread by swashing across medical catheters, implants and hospital equipment. Blocking flagella alone may not be enough to stop them. Instead, we may need to interfere with the chemical processes they use to power this movement.

Both E. coli and salmonella can cause foodborne illness. Knowing they can spread on surfaces through passive fluid flows may help improve how food processing plants design cleaning protocols. And because swashing depends on fermentation and acidic by-products, strategies that alter surface pH or sugar availability could reduce bacterial colonization. The study showed that simple changes in acidity were enough to alter how the bacteria moved.

Something similar may also occur inside the body, where moist surfaces like gut mucus, wound fluids or the urinary tract create favorable conditions for bacteria. In these places, bacteria could use swashing to spread even when their flagella don't work well.

In a second study, corresponding author Abhishek Shrivastava and his colleagues looked at a type of bacteria known as flavobacteria. Unlike E. coli, these bacteria don't swim; rather, they navigate environmental and host-associated surfaces using a machine called the type 9 secretion system, or T9SS, which propels a molecular conveyor belt.

Normally, the T9SS helps these bacteria glide across surfaces. It does this by moving an adhesive-coated belt around the cell body, pulling the bacterium forward like a microscopic snowmobile. The researchers discovered that a conveyor-belt protein called GldJ acts like a gear-shifter, controlling the direction of this rotary motor.

If a small part of GldJ is deleted, the motor flips its spin from counterclockwise to clockwise, changing how the bacteria move. The study describes this molecular gearset in detail and shows how it allows bacteria to fine-tune their direction of movement, giving them an evolutionary edge in navigating complex environments.

Beyond enabling bacterial movement, the T9SS also has major implications for human health - serving both harmful and beneficial roles depending on the microbial community. In the human oral microbiome, T9SS-containing bacteria are linked to gum disease, where their secreted proteins promote inflammation in the mouth and brain, contributing to disorders such as heart disease and Alzheimer's. Conversely, in the gut microbiome, T9SS-secreted proteins can protect antibodies from degradation, thereby strengthening immunity and improving the efficacy of oral vaccines. 

Understanding how this gearbox works could help scientists design ways to block bacteria from forming slimy bacterial communities known as biofilms, causing infections and contaminating medical devices, but also harness its beneficial properties to promote health and develop targeted microbiome therapies.

""We are very excited to have discovered an extraordinary dual-role nanogear system that integrates a feedback mechanism, revealing a controllable biological snowmobile and showing how bacteria precisely tune motility and secretion in dynamic environments,"" Shrivastava says. ""Building on this breakthrough, we now aim to determine high-resolution structures of this remarkable molecular conveyor to visualize, at atomic precision, how its moving parts interlock, transmit force and respond to mechanical feedback. Unraveling this intricate design will not only deepen our understanding of microbial evolution but also inspire the development of next-generation bioengineered nanomachines and therapeutic technologies.""

Shrivastava is a researcher with the Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, the Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution, and assistant professor with ASU's School of Life Sciences. The research appears in the journal mBio.

At first glance, the two discoveries - fluid surfing and molecular gear-shifting, seem worlds apart. But they share a common theme: bacteria have evolved multiple, surprising ways to spread. The more strategies bacteria have, the harder they are to contain.

The new findings also underscore the need for fresh thinking in combating bacterial disease. Many traditional approaches have often focused on targeting flagella. But as these studies show, bacteria can get around that limitation.

The research suggests that controlling the bacterial environment, including factors like sugar levels, pH and surface chemistry, may be just as important as targeting bacterial genes. And disrupting key molecular machines like the T9SS gearbox could prevent bacteria not only from moving but also from secreting the proteins that make them dangerous.

An analysis of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) indicates that nearly all adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) would have benefits that outweigh the harm from a systolic blood pressure target of <120 mm Hg compared with a target of <140 mm Hg. Thefindings will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 November 5– 9.

In a benefit-harm trade-off analysis of 2,012 participants with CKD, investigators found that when predicting individualized treatment effects for multiple outcomesand simulating preferences for participants who view the benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering (reductions in death, cardiovascular events, and cognitive impairment) as much more important than treatment-related harms (such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations for acute kidney injury and fainting), 100% had a positive net benefit favoring intensive blood pressure lowering. When simulating benefits and harms to have similar, intermediate importance, 9 out of 10 still had a positive net benefit.

Compared with people with earlier-stage CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate(45–59 ml/min/1.73m2), people with more advanced CKD (20–44 ml/min/1.73m2) experienced more treatment-related harms from a lower systolic blood pressure goal; however, they also had larger benefits, which resulted in the more advanced CKD group having greater net benefits. The findings, which are consistent with KDIGO Guidelines that recommend a systolic blood pressure target of <120 mm Hg for adults with hypertension and CKD, could help patients and care partnersovercome therapeutic inertia that commonly occurs with intensifying blood pressure control in adults with CKD.

This study demonstrates that evidence about blood pressure targets from SPRINT can be personalized to adults with hypertension and CKD by using each individual's estimated risks and preferences for multiple outcomes related to bloodpressure lowering, which could help facilitate shared decision-making conversations.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","OSU researchers design a highly effective, low-dose, manganese-MOF MRI agent","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251107/OSU-researchers-design-a-highly-effective-low-dose-manganese-MOF-MRI-agent.aspx","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 04:47:00 GMT","

Scientists at Oregon State University have filed a patent on a design for a new magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent with the potential to outperform current agents while being less toxic to patients and more environmentally friendly.

The new material is based on a structure known as a metal-organic framework or MOF, whose development in the 1990s earned this year's Nobel Prize for chemistry as MOFs' many possible uses become increasingly apparent.

MOFs are made up of positively charged metal ions surrounded by organic ""linker"" molecules. They have nanosized pores and can be designed with a variety of components that determine the MOF's properties.

Researchers led by Kyriakos Stylianou of the OSU College of Science say their novel manganese-based MOF, which they named BVR-19, is a promising alternative to currently used contrast agents based on gadolinium. BVR is an abbreviation for beaver, OSU's mascot.

A contrast agent, also called a contrast medium, is a substance that enhances the visibility of tissues during medical imaging. Globally, the MRI contrast agent industry has an estimated value of more than $1.5 billion and is expected to grow by $750 million over the next five years amid rising demand for non-invasive diagnostic procedures.

Gadolinium is a rare earth element that comes with concerns regarding toxicity to patients, potential harm to the environment, and supply chain issues given that China accounts for many of the rare earth reserves and much of the processing and production capacity.

Manganese, however, is plentiful in the earth's crust. In addition to being used in making batteries, steel and ceramics, manganese is vital for human health in trace amounts, playing roles in antioxidation, bone formation and the metabolism of cholesterols, carbohydrates and amino acids.

""BVR-19 represents a paradigm shift in MRI contrast agent design,"" said Stylianou, who directs the OSU's Materials Discovery Laboratory, or MaD Lab.

We're replacing toxic metals with abundant, biocompatible ones, without compromising performance.""

 Kyriakos Stylianou, College of Science, Oregon State University

Gadolinium has been used in contrast agents for nearly 40 years, he said. The body doesn't metabolize the contrast agents, so they pass nearly unchanged into wastewater systems and are resistant to degradation in treatment plants. Their long-term ecotoxicological effects not well understood.

There is also risk, Stylianou said, from gadolinium retention in the body. Most agents are designed to be excreted within 24 hours of administration, but even in patients with normal kidney function, gadolinium can stay in tissues for months or years. Retention hasn't been conclusively linked to disease, but the Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings and requires patient education because of uncertainty regarding long-term consequences.

BVR-19 is the first manganese-based MOF to incorporate L-cystine, a naturally occurring, biocompatible amino acid, Stylianou said. Its synthesis takes place in water at room temperature, no toxic solvents or other harsh conditions are required, and tests show that it allows for brighter, clearer images at lower doses than required of current commercially available agents.

""This work underscores OSU's leadership in designing functional MOFs for medical and environmental applications and demonstrates how green chemistry and materials design can converge to create safer technologies,"" he said. ""It bridges chemistry, toxicology and medicine, showing how collaboration across disciplines can transform fundamental discoveries into technologies that directly improve human health.""

Doctoral student Jacob Lessard and undergraduate Dylan Pyle were first authors of the study, which was published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry B. Other contributing members of the MaD Lab were postdoctoral fellow Andrzej Gladysiak, doctoral student Emmanuel Musa and undergraduate Jeff Bowen.

The collaboration also included Robyn Tanguay, Lisa Truong and Siva Kolluri of the OSU College of Agricultural Sciences and Cory Wyatt of Oregon Health & Science University.

A new radioimmunotherapy approach has the potential to cure human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, according to new research published in the November issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine. The regimen, which pre-treats the tumor before delivering targeted alpha-radioimmunotherapy, resulted in durable major responses--including histologic cures--with minimal toxicities, paving the way for a safer and more effective treatment option for breast cancer patients.

Advanced metastatic breast cancer has a poor prognosis, especially for highly aggressive HER2-positive subtypes. HER2 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in 15-20 percent of breast cancers and is a clinically established therapeutic target. Although current HER2-targeted therapies offer improved outcomes, challenges remain because of treatment-related adverse events and tumor resistance to treatment.

Previous studies have shown that HER2-targeted radioimmunotherapy with the α-particle-emitting radionuclide 225Ac has been effective, but not safe, as alpha-particles were retained in the body, resulting in high toxicities. In our study, we used a pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) approach to directly treat the tumor and prevent potent alpha-particles from being absorbed in healthy tissues.""

Sarah Cheal, PhD, assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York

The radioimmunotherapy treatment approach consisted of a three-step intravenous regimen: first a bispecific anti-HER2/anti-DOTA antibody, next a clearing agent, and finally 225Ac-Pr radioimmunotherapy. Researchers began by testing the effects of 225Ac-Pr dosing during PRIT on tumor-targeting efficiency and tissue biodistribution in a BT-474 breast cancer xenograft model. The regimen was then evaluated in mice bearing the BT-474 xenograft or a patient-derived xenograft. The mice were treated with either one or two cycles of 225Ac-PRIT separated by one week. A dose escalation study was also performed on the BT-474 model to establish the nephrotoxic absorbed radiation dose.

In the BT-474 model, 100 percent of mice achieved complete responses and 85 percent achieved histologic cure. One-cycle and two-cycle treatments were equally effective. Treatments were well tolerated, with no chronic radiation toxicity documented. In the patient-derived xenograft model, a single 225Ac-PRIT treatment led to 60 percent complete response and prolonged survival versus no treatment. Lastly, researchers identified the dose in the 225Ac-PRIT regimen at which severe chronic nephrotoxicity was induced.

""This study illustrates the curative potential of 225Ac-PRIT as a treatment for highly aggressive subtypes of HER2-positive breast cancer,"" said Nai Kong Cheung, MD, PhD, member and attending physician in Pediatric Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ""If successfully translated to the clinic, HER2-directed 225Ac therapy could offer new treatment options in breast cancer and other HER2-expressing solid tumors.""

NWSL

Kansas City Current fans cheer for their team during a home game against the San Diego Wave Amy Kontras / Getty Images

Lo'eau LaBonta was standing on the sideline when the crowd inside CPKC Stadium began calling her name.

“We want Lo!” they yelled, with their cheers growing louder every passing minute. It wasn't long before U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes called the midfielder over to sub her in against New Zealand. The fans in Kansas City, Missouri, roared their approval.

Though LaBonta was representing the U.S. on that evening late last month, to fans in Kansas City, the KC Current midfielder was their captain. This is what home-field advantage looks like. It is a familiar scene at the 11,500-seat CPKC Stadium, which is regularly sold out.

It's loud. It's raucous. It's what fuels the Current every week.

The Current, who recently signed LaBonta to a three-year contract extension, have a chance to use that advantage on Sunday, when they host Gotham FC in the NWSL quarterfinals.

“They're always there. They always show up. We always hear them,” Current defender Hailie Mace said on Tuesday about the fans. “They're like our 12th man, and we're excited.”

The Current were the first team in the NWSL to clinch a spot in the postseason, doing so back in August. They ended their regular season with 65 points, 21 more than the second-placed Washington Spirit. The Spirit secured their playoff berth by September, netting home-field advantage in mid-October.

While there is no way of knowing how the NWSL playoffs will unfold, those involved in the game clearly believe home crowds have a way of fueling teams through the finish line.

“Home-field advantage is huge. We've shown that this stadium is a fortress. We defend this stadium with everything we can,” the Current's head coach Vlatko Andonovski said on Tuesday. “For us, it's important that we win for our fans, for our city and for our community.”

Last year's semifinal in Washington, D.C. between the Spirit and Gotham, which the home team won on penalties, was an emotional affair made even more poignant by the sold-out 19,000-plus crowd. The progress players had been pushing for in that moment felt tangible, with the fans filling Audi Field fueling the drama. It was evident even for those watching the game from home.

“Last year's playoff games were an immense success,” the Spirit's CEO, Kim Stone, tells The Athletic. “We sold out both our quarterfinal and semifinal. We call it ‘Rowdy Audi' because the atmosphere is so electric. Fans are incredible. They love this team, and this team loves them, so the atmosphere is amazing.”

Spirit players describe their home crowd as an “intimidating factor” for other teams, Stone said: “The fans do know that they have an impact on the environment and the energy, and they make it a little bit more difficult or intimidating for opponents to come into.”

Having ample time before the Spirit's first playoff game was key in preparing for what the team's business side expects will be another record-setting year. Stone said the team has found ways to improve the fan experience from last year. The month-long runway from securing a playoff berth to that first postseason match gave staff time to get creative.

The No. 2 seed hosts playoff first-timers Racing Louisville on Saturday.

“There is nothing like a playoff to galvanize a city,” Stone said. “Look no further than the World Series, where you had Toronto against LA and (the Blue Jays) galvanized an entire country (Canada). What sports can do, especially in playoffs, is like no other industry.”

This year, Washington's NWSL club unveiled the “Spirit Sphere,” a giant soccer ball-shaped balloon made by the same company behind the iconic balloons used in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. This sphere was taken to sites around the city, and more than 1,000 fans signed it.

“We've been having a lot of fun with that,” Stone said, “because this is the time the city and the fans want to be really proud of the team, and they want to show their support.”

Meanwhile, for fans of the Current, the past week has been one giant build-up to the playoffs.

That match against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium in late October was the USWNT's first time playing at the NWSL venue. It was a historic moment, with fans matching that energy in the stands. The Current staff quickly shifted gears for Decision Day a few days later.

Missy Jenkins, the Current's senior vice president of commercial, described the last week as a “whirlwind”: “It was good momentum to go from the U.S. women's national team (and) the end of the FIFA window, right into a regular-season win, and now, very quickly, we're heads down, getting ready for our match on Sunday.”

What the Current have built in Kansas City is unmatched in the NWSL. No other team in the league owns the stadium it plays in. The Current can reinvest their financial successes from their latest playoff run into the club's future. The stadium can stage other events too, like that recent USWNT match. Later this year, the venue will host the NCAA College Cup, where the best university-level soccer players in the country will compete for the national crown.

When it comes to Current matches, fans are committed to their team. That loyalty then translates to the field. Jenkins calls it a “wonderful, symbiotic relationship.”

“There is nothing like being at CPKC Stadium on a Kansas City Current home game,” Jenkins said. “I have worked for a number of sports teams, and I have loved all of those teams, but I have not ever gotten as emotional, perhaps, as I have at CPKC Stadium, because of the environment that's been created.”

Christian Pulisic could be good to go for AC Milan this weekend.

The U.S. men's national team star wasn't named to coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad for two upcoming friendlies, but he could be on the pitch for Massimiliano Alegri's side for Saturday's Serie A game against Parma. 

Pulisic has been hampered by a right hamstring injury since exiting the first half of the U.S. men's national team's 2-1 win over Australia on Oct. 17. But Allegri said the 27-year-old winger could be ready for action.

""We've got Pulisic back, who is doing well and available to play,"" Allegri said.

Pulisic was not named on Pochettino's roster for the USMNT's friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay on Nov. 15 and Nov. 18. Pochettino said he wanted Pulisic to remain in Italy with his club and ""to provide him the possibility to recover 100%.""

Pulisic has been in incredible form for Milan, scoring six goals in eight appearances in all competitions. The Rossoneri are in third place in the Serie A standings, just one point behind defending champions Napoli.

As well as providing an update on Pulisic, Allegri also said that Mexico striker Santiago Gimenez and French midfielder Adrien Rabiot would be fit to return from their injuries following the November international break.

On the eve of the 2025 CAF Women's Champions League, Egypt's FC Masar enter the tournament for a second successive year with captain Amira Mohamed setting out an uncompromising target: win the title on home soil and book a berth at the inaugural FIFA Women's Club World Cup. 

Speaking to CAFOnline.com, the skipper outlined the team's mindset, preparation and hopes of turning a nation's backing into silverware

Below is the full Q&A:



CAFOnline.com: Amira, you are taking part in the CAF Women's Champions League for the second successive year. What does this competition mean to you?

Amira Mohamed: We are very happy and proud to be here again—especially with the tournament in Egypt. It is a unique opportunity. We want to go as far as possible and, above all, win the title on our own turf in front of our supporters.

CAFOnline.com: How are you preparing for the finals? Is there anything specific in your build-up?

Amira Mohamed: We are working relentlessly—both domestically and for the continent. A competition at this level demands rigour and consistency. There is also a powerful incentive: the winners qualify for the first FIFA Women's Club World Cup™. That is a dream and an extra source of energy. We want FC Masar to be Africa's first representative at this historic event.



CAFOnline.com: In your view, how important will mentality be during this tournament?

Amira Mohamed: Mental strength is the key. Mindset and confidence count as much as tactics. The technical staff talk to us a lot and keep us motivated. Last season's experience helped us grow. And because the competition is in Egypt, we get a real psychological lift—we feel the crowd's support and the desire to perform.

CAFOnline.com: It's a strong field, with experienced clubs such as AS FAR and TP Mazembe. How do you assess the level?

Amira Mohamed: It will be very high, no doubt. Some clubs are used to the big stage; others arrive full of enthusiasm. But we fear no one. We have prepared seriously and we are ready. Playing at home gives us extra motivation. We will give everything—through our play and our attitude—to chase the title.



CAFOnline.com: What are your precise objectives for this edition?

Amira Mohamed: One objective: win the Champions League. It would be a first in our club's history and it would open the door to the first Women's Club World Cup. We want to make history for Egyptian football and inspire the next generation.

CAFOnline.com: How would you describe the team's spirit before kick-off?

Amira Mohamed: Unity is our strength. We have played together for more than a year, and that continuity has created real cohesion. Everyone knows each other's role. The spirit is excellent and we want to keep that chemistry throughout the competition.

 

CAFOnline.com: You follow African women's football closely. What do you make of its evolution in recent years?

Amira Mohamed: It is impressive. The level is rising across the continent—more professionalism, visibility and interest. It is a great development and I hope it continues. African women's football deserves the attention and resources it is getting.

CAFOnline.com: With the tournament at home, what do you expect from the Egyptian public?

Amira Mohamed: I hope the supporters come in large numbers. We represent the whole country, not only our club. Their presence and encouragement can make the difference. Feeling the crowd behind us gives incomparable energy.

CAFOnline.com: Your message to the squad as captain?

Amira Mohamed: Believe in ourselves. We have everything to succeed. The dream of winning this Champions League and reaching the FIFA Women's Club World Cup™ must guide us. We must play with heart, discipline and pride. Together, everything is possible.","{'href': 'https://www.cafonline.com', 'title': 'cafonline.com'}","soccer"

FIFA has officially announced the nominees for The Best 2025, recognizing the standout footballers from the 2024/25 campaign. For the first time, performances at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, held in the United States, were included as part of the evaluation criteria. 

A move that boosted the visibility of Brazilian clubs and helped the South American nation top the list with 11 players nominated for the Team of the Season. Portugal follows with 10, while France and Spain has eight representatives each one.

Brazil features players in almost every position, led by Raphinha, who's also in contention for the Best Men's Player award, and a remarkable showing among goalkeepers: four nominees in total. 

+ Premier League becomes Ancelotti's main source for Brazil squad

Raphinha (Barcelona) – Best Player & Team of the Season

Raphinha enjoyed his most complete campaign since joining Barcelona. With pace, flair, and sharp decision-making, he played a key role in their LaLiga and Copa del Rey triumphs, while also shining in the Champions League.

Alisson (Liverpool) – Best Goalkeeper & Team of the Season

Liverpool's ever-reliable shot-stopper was once again outstanding in 2024/25. A cornerstone of the Premier League title-winning side, Alisson pulled off match-winning saves against Arsenal and Chelsea, while maintaining top form in Europe.

Fábio (Fluminense) – Team of the Season

At 44 years old, Fábio continues to defy time. The veteran was crucial in Fluminense's 2023 Copa Libertadores triumph, which secured their spot at the 2025 Club World Cup. In the tournament, his calm under pressure and decisive saves — including a man-of-the-match performance — proved why experience still matters.

Weverton (Palmeiras) – Team of the Season

A model of consistency, Weverton was pivotal in Palmeiras' strong Libertadores and Brasileirão campaigns. His reflexes, command of the box, and leadership helped keep the side competitive on all fronts — earning him yet another nod among the continent's best.

John (Botafogo / Nottingham Forest) – Team of the Season

John's year was one of breakthroughs. He starred for Botafogo, anchoring the defense during their Brazilian League and Libertadores title runs, before earning a midseason move to Nottingham Forest. His rise reflects the new generation of Brazilian goalkeepers making their mark abroad.

Thiago Silva (Fluminense) – Team of the Season

Back home at Fluminense, Thiago Silva proved that class truly is timeless. At 40, the veteran center-back was the defensive pillar that led the team to a Club World Cup semifinal.

His composure, positioning, and leadership against elite opposition reaffirm his status as one of the great defenders of the modern era.

+ Sons of Cristiano Ronaldo, Thiago Silva and other football stars begin to shine

Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain) – Team of the Season

The PSG captain delivered yet another season of excellence — winning Ligue 1 and finally lifting the long-awaited Champions League trophy. Solid, composed, and ever-reliable, Marquinhos defensive awareness and leadership continue to set the standard at the highest level.

Gabriel Magalhães (Arsenal) – Team of the Season

Dominant in both league and European matches, his performances against top-six rivals cemented his reputation as one of the Premier League's finest defenders.

Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid) – Team of the Season

Although not as dazzling as in the 2023/24 campaign, the Brazilian star remained one of Real Madrid's top performers, showcasing trademark dribbles and flashes of brilliance. 

Luiz Henrique (Botafogo/Zenit) – Team of the Season

With flair and fearless dribbling, Luiz Henrique was the creative spark behind Botafogo's 2024 Libertadores triumph, earning him the “Rei da América” (King of America) award. 

João Pedro (Brighton / Chelsea) – Team of the Season

The breakout Brazilian of the Premier League season, João Pedro dazzled for Brighton before maintaining form after a big move to Chelsea. Sharp in front of goal and decisive in key clashes, he played a major role in his club's Club World Cup title in the U.S., showcasing Brazil's new attacking generation.

The FIFA The Best 2025 Awards ceremony will take place in Zurich this December, and anticipation is sky-high for Brazilian fans.

In last year's edition, Vinícius Júnior stole the show, winning The Best 2024 Men's Player Award after a spectacular season with Real Madrid.

Instrumental in both the Champions League and Club World Cup triumphs, Vini's goals and flair. Especially in the final against Borussia Dortmund.

The selection process for The Best 2025 unfolds in two stages. First, panels of experts — one for men's football and another for women's — draw up the shortlist. Then, a public vote on FIFA's official website (open until November 28) determines the three finalists in each category.

In the final phase, national team coaches and captains from FIFA's 211 member associations, selected journalists, and fans worldwide cast their votes. The weighted average of these four groups decides the winners across all categories.

DOHA - Canada played France to a scoreless draw Saturday to remain unbeaten at the FIFA U-17 World Cup.

The young Canadians are authoring a new story at the tournament after recording a dismal 0-20-4 record in eight previous trips. Canada ended that winless run in its opening game Wednesday, rallying for a 2-1 victory over Uganda thanks to an 88th-minute goal by Elijah Roche and 98th-minute penalty by Marius Aiyenero.

Uganda (0-1-1) mounted a rally of its own earlier Saturday, drawing Chile 1-1 on a 93rd-minute goal by Derick Ssozi.

Canada (1-0-1) stands second in Group K, trailing France (1-0-1) on goal difference, and is in good position to move into the knockout round for the first time at the tournament.

A win or draw against Chile (0-1-1) on Tuesday will assure the Canadians a berth in the round of 32. Canada could still advance with a loss, depending on the score, with the top two teams in each group plus with the eight best third-placed sides qualifying for the round of 32.

“I'm proud of the boys,” said Canada coach Mike Vitulano. “We went toe-to-toe with one of the top teams in the world and showed we belong at this level. We were ready, believed in ourselves, and played on the front foot.

“It is a solid performance to build on as our mindset shifts to preparing for an important match versus Chile.”

Canada's Tim Fortier was named player of the match.

France, which blanked Chile 2-0 in its opening game, won the U-17 title in 2001, was runner-up last time out in 2023 and finished third in 2019. The French, coached by Lionel Rouxel, qualified this time by virtue of finishing runner-up to Portugal at the UEFA Under-17 European Championship in June.

The expanded 48-team, 104-game FIFA competition runs through Nov. 27 across eight pitches at the Aspire Zone complex. The final will be staged at Khalifa International Stadium, which is also on the Aspire Zone site.

France outshot Canada 9-5 (5-1 in shots on target).

Vitulano made three changes to his starting lineup with Aiyenero, Shola Jimoh and Johnny Selemani, who all came in off the bench against Uganda, slotting into the starting 11.

The first half was essentially a stalemate with the only attempt on goal coming in the 36th minute. A Canadian turnover resulted in a chance for Jah-Mason Telusson but his shot was deflected to safety by Roche.

Aiyenero was booked late in the half which, coupled with a yellow card against Uganda, means he will miss the Chile contest.

The first shot on target, by French captain Abdoulaye Camara in the 48th minute, was easily handled by Canadian ‘keeper Jonathan Ransom. Camara, a 17-year-old midfielder, joined Italy's Udinese in July on a four-year contract from Montpellier. 

Canada sent on Aidan Evans and Van Parker in the 58th minute.

The subs had an immediate impact. Canada's first chance came in the 62nd minute when Evans' through ball found Parker streaking in towards goal. The ball ended up at the feet of Jimoh whose shot was blocked by sliding French goalkeeper Ilan Jourdren.

Ransom made a fine reflex save off a corner in the 72nd minute to preserve the tie. At the other end, Parker had a chance in the 80th but sent his shot over the crossbar.

Pierre Moungengue came close in the 83rd minute, dribbling around a Canadian defender only to see his shot bounce off the post. An unmarked Isaiah Bohui had a free header in stoppage time but sent it straight at Ransom.

That sent Venezuelan referee Yender Herrera to the pitchside monitor to check for a possible infraction in front of goal on the play. But it didn't lead to anything, much to France's ire.

The tournament's video support system allows coaches two requests per game for a video review. If the review by the referee results in the original decision being changed, the team retains its request.

Ahead of the tournament, Aiyenero, Antone Bossenberry, and Sasha Cernic were added to the roster with André Ali-Gayapersad, Owen Graham-Roache and Stefan Kapor withdrawing through injury.

The young Canadians booked their ticket to the World Cup in February, topping their five-team qualifying group — featuring host Bermuda, Anguilla, Curaçao and Turks and Caicos — with a perfect 4-0-0 record. They outscored their opposition 28-2 with both goals conceded coming from the penalty spot.

Spain's Pedri, Brazil's Neymar and Alisson Becker, England's Phil Foden and South Korea's Son Heung-min are among the world stars who have taken part in the U-17 World Cup.

DOHA, Qatar (November 8, 2025) – The U.S. Under-17 Men's National Team utilized goals from Nimfasha Berchimas and Cavan Sullivan on both sides of halftime to earn a 2-1 comeback win against Tajikistan in the team's second match of the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup. With six points from two matches, the result ensures the USA has clinched a place in the Round of 32 and can claim top spot in Group I with a win or draw in Tuesday's group stage finale against Czechia (9:45 a.m. ET; FS2, Universo, Peacock).

Heading into the affair, U.S. head coach Gonzalo Segares made four changes to the lineup that defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 in a tight matchup on Wednesday, inserting Luca Moisa, Cavan Sullivan and Mateo Tsakiris in midfield and Chase Adams up front.

It was Tajikistan that got off to a hot start, scoring in just the third minute. Intercepting a pass in the U.S. half and darting forward towards goal, Muhammad Nazriev ran onto a lobbed ball over the top from Mehrubon Odilzoda and finished with a powerful strike past ‘keeper Aidan Stokes to give the side a 1-0 lead.

For the first 25 minutes, the USA found it difficult breaking through the final third, as the opposing team employed a disciplined and compact defensive game plan after taking the lead. As a result, the U.S. concentrated much of its attack on the left side of the pitch, with the team looking to Mathis Albert and Cavan Sullivan to create chances.

After some promising looks, the U.S. finally found the equalizer on a corner kick in the 30th minute. Sullivan curled a precise in-swinging cross to the back post where Nimfasha Berchimas elevated himself and confidently nodded home past Tajikistan ‘keeper Rahim Rahmonov. Berchimas not only brought the USA level, but he also earned a place in history as the only U.S. player to score in two editions of the FIFA U-17 World Cup, having tallied three during the 2023 edition in Indonesia.

Momentum began to shift in favor of the Americans and a few moments later, Sullivan received the ball in the 18-yard-box and was able to fire off a shot on goal, but the attempt was saved by Rahmonov.

At the 43rd minute, Ramiz Hamouda played Sullivan on the left touchline who took a touch and struck a low cross into the box, allowing Chase Adams to slot the ball home. The go-ahead goalwas called back following a VAR challenge, as Adams was ruled offside when Sullivan struck the ball.

Play resumed and moments later the U.S. quickly moved forward again, with Adams finding himself on the receiving end of a floating cross, heading the ball towards goal only to have Rahmonov make a fantastic diving stop to deny the chance.

During first half stoppage time, the U.S. was inches away from taking the lead on two separate occasions having both attempts denied on the goal line. First, Adams had his shot blocked on the line and then Luca Moisa's attempt met the same fate, sending the teams into the locker room tied 1-1.

In a match where the USA outshot Tajikistan 19-2, Segares' side continued to dominant throughout the second half. Adams continued his strong performance early on, forcing himself into the box with the ball, creating enough space to get off a shot, but the ball was deflected and went out for a corner kick. After a quick look, Segares called for a VAR review for a potential handball in the box, but referee Tanguy Bemiame deemed that it did not occur, moving forward with the set piece.

In the 56th minute, Berchimas made a crucial run into the box and was fouled hard by Ramazon Bakhtaliev prompting the ref to blow his whistle and signal to the penalty spot. After a failed VAR request from Tajikistan head coach Marco Ragini upheld the penalty, Sullivan took the ball and showed no signs of pressure, coolly chipped his take straight up the middle to give the USA a 2-1 advantage in the 61st minute.

With the lead in hand, the U.S. was comfortable building up play from the back. In the 70th minute, the team bore the fruits of its labor, stringing passes together to put Mateo Tsakiris in position to strike from the top of the box where he curled his effort just wide.

In the 74th minute, substitute Jamir Johnson took on his defender coming from the left side and put the ball onto his right foot to fire a shot that careened off the cross bar and out for a goal kick. Six minutes later in the 80th, Moisa sent the ball to the back post for Sullivan, who nodded home a header, but the goal was called back for offside.The USA saw out the remaining minutes to ensure a well-earned 2-1 victory and a place in the Round of 32.

Rough Draft Atlanta


					Hyperlocal news for metro Atlanta				




Invest Atlanta's Board of Directors have approved $925,000 in Tax Allocation District (TAD) funding to support local small businesses, the City of Atlanta announced.

The funding is part of the city's ongoing efforts to invest in Atlanta's small business community to ensure that “they can fully capitalize on major events coming to Atlanta, including the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said a press release.

Included in the funding is $250,000 in Small Business Improvement Grants, which provides companies with up to $50,000 for various interior and exterior improvements, such as signage, lighting, storefront upgrades and code compliance repairs, to name a few.

Recipients of the grants include Bottle Rocket Fine Food & Beverage, Big Daddy's Kitchen, Crates record shop, Strikeout Wingz, and Subs & Salads Junction. 

“Small businesses are the backbone of Atlanta's economy, and these grants are one way we can help them grow and remain sustainable,” said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who also serves as the board chair of Invest Atlanta.

Another $500,000 will go into the “Small Business World Cup Opportunity Fund,” an initiative that will distribute microgrants to assist in the accelerated activation of vacant or underutilized small commercial spaces in downtown Atlanta, as well as create opportunities for small businesses in advance to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

In charge of administering the microgrants is Invest Atlanta's downtown community development partner, Central Atlanta Progress, a nonprofit whose goal is to bolster the economic vitality of downtown Atlanta, according to its website.

“Atlanta's small businesses are the heartbeat of our city,” said A.J. Robinson, president of Central Atlanta Progress. “By investing in them, we are investing in the character of our neighborhood — something that will be on full display during major events like the World Cup.”

In the spirit of the upcoming FIFA tournament, the remaining $175,000 funds will be used to construct a StationSoccer facility at the HE Holmes MARTA subway station. 

Once built, the development will offer free soccer programming and is slated to serve 200 players between the ages of 6-12, said a release.

Cavan Sullivan delivered yet again at the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup on Saturday, scoring a cheeky penalty kick to give the United States a 2-1 win over Tajikistan in Group I play.

The Philadelphia Union homegrown midfielder gently chipped his shot down the center of the goal – commonly called a ""panenka"" – and past the diving goalkeeper to complete the comeback result.

Charlotte FC homegrown attacker Nimfasha Berchimas headed home an equalizer in the 30th minute, and Sullivan provided a moment of magic in the 61st minute to continue the US's strong start to the Qatar-based tournament.

A beautiful panenka from Cavan Sullivan to give the @USYNT the lead 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/vCtMSxULaB

Sullivan's panenka marked his second goal in as many games at the U-17 World Cup, after he subbed on in the second half and finished from close range in Wednesday's 1-0 opening win over Burkina Faso.

The 16-year-old, who's one of 11 MLS players representing the US at the U-17 World Cup, will hope to keep the momentum going in Tuesday's group-stage finale vs. Czechia. With six points from two matches, the US are well-positioned to advance to the knockout stage.

Previously called a ""generational talent,"" Sullivan signed with Philly in May 2024 as a 14-year-old and quickly debuted for the first team. He's played 18 times for the Union and has featured extensively in MLS NEXT Pro for Philadelphia Union II.

Sullivan will reportedly join English Premier League side Manchester City in the future. In the meantime, he's helped Philly win the 2025 MLS Supporters' Shield and secure the Eastern Conference No. 1 seed in the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

The final pathways to the game-changing FIFA World Cup 2026™ will be mapped out when the draw for the FIFA World Cup 2026™ Play-Off Tournament and the European Play-Off draw take place at the Home of FIFA in Zurich, Switzerland, on Thursday, 20 November 2025.

New Caledonia will represent the OFC at the six-nation FIFA World Cup 26™ Play-Off Tournament and will soon learn who they will face in pursuit of their first-ever FIFA World Cup™ appearance. Their place in the tournament was secured after reaching the final of the FIFA World Cup 26™ Oceania Qualifiers against New Zealand.

The draws will define the routes the 22 competing nations – six via the Play-Off Tournament and 16 through European Play-Off matches – will need to successfully navigate to seal a spot at the first-ever 48-team FIFA World Cup™, which will be staged in Canada, Mexico and the United States from Thursday, 11 June to Sunday, 19 July 2026.

The draws will be staged back-to-back, with the draw for the FIFA World Cup 2026 Play-Off Tournament commencing at 13:00 CET, followed by the European Play-Off equivalent.

The draws will take place just two days after the completion of the November 2025 international match window, which promises to be another action-packed period as the list of qualified nations for the 23rd edition of the FIFA World Cup continues to take shape.

Twenty-eight teams have already booked their places at next year's historic tournament, with a further 14 nations – three from Concacaf and 11 from UEFA – set to punch their tickets to the finals via confederation qualifying this month.

The November international window will also define which teams from the AFC, CAF and Concacaf will join Bolivia (CONMEBOL) and New Caledonia (the OFC) at the six-nation FIFA Play-Off Tournament, as well as the 16 countries that will compete in the European Play-Offs, during the international match window from 23 to 31 March 2026.

The FIFA Play-Off Tournament will feature two finals where the winners of the two semi-finals between the unseeded teams will face the two seeded teams, with the eventual winners securing two spots at the FIFA World Cup 2026.

The European Play-Offs will be made up of 12 group runners-up and the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League section winners. The 16 teams who enter will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams in each. Play-off matches will be played in single-leg semi-finals followed by single-leg finals to decide Europe's final four FIFA World Cup 2026 participants.

To ensure both draws can be conducted in accordance with the relevant draw procedures, the next edition of the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking will be published on Wednesday, 19 November 2025.

Fans around the world will be able to follow the draws live on FIFA.com, FIFA+ and via FIFA media partners. Further details, including additional broadcast information, will be published on FIFA.com in due course.

Dutchman spares sleeping Manuel Ugarte & shot-shy Benjamin Sesko as Red Devils rally in crazy ending","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/man-utd-player-ratings-vs-tottenham-matthijs-de-ligt-manuel-ugarte-benjamin-sesko/blt531a9f448c1d730a","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 14:37:01 GMT","

Matthijs de Ligt scored a 96th-minute equaliser as Manchester United managed to snag a 2-2 draw from their trip to Tottenham, snapping a run of four successive losses to Spurs. Thomas Frank's side trailed for much of the game but a late turnaround saw them close in on three points, only for Ruben Amorim's men to claw back at the very last and enact at least some sort of revenge after losing last season's Europa League final.

United went in front just after the half-hour mark. Spurs failed to clear their lines when playing inside their own box, and when the ball came back in courtesy of an Amad Diallo cross, Bryan Mbeumo slipped behind Pedro Porro to head in at the far post.

Tottenham nearly pulled level on the other side of half-time when Cristian Romero flicked on a Wilson Odobert cross, only for Senne Lammens made a fine save with his feet. Moments later, the Belgian threw up a strong hand to bat away a half-volley from Joao Palhinha.

Spurs had the ball in the net through Brennan Johnson but the flag was quickly raised for an obvious offside as the hosts continued to push for an equaliser. With only six minutes to go, United finally caved in. Odobert skipped past Manuel Ugarte with ease before teeing up Destiny Udogie to put in a low cross, which was received by Mathys Tel and finished on the swivel by the Frenchman.

What became a manic end to the game opened up for Benjamin Sesko to find a winner when slipped through by Mason Mount, but the Slovenian dawdled on the ball too long and was tackled at the last by Micky van de Ven. Sesko walked away from this challenge injured and had to hobble off, but as United had used all their substitutes, they had to finish the match with 10 players.

Entering six minutes of added time, Tottenham turned the game around completely. United couldn't clear from a Spurs corner, with the ball falling to Odobert on the edge of the box. The Frenchman curled an effort back in, which was flicked on by Richarlison and past a helpless Lammens.

Yet there was still time for one final twist. United won a corner, which sailed to the back post for De Ligt to nod over the line by a matter of inches and save a point. The result means both sides missed the chance to climb to second in the Premier League table before Manchester City's meeting with Liverpool on Sunday.

GOAL rates United's players from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium...

Senne Lammens (7/10):

Started off nervily by letting a pass from De Ligt roll under his foot and out for a corner but recovered well with a series of saves.

Matthijs de Ligt (7/10):

Had some early trouble watching Richarlison's marauding runs from the left, though the Dutchman quickly figured the Brazilian out in that regard. Saved the day with one of the most important headers of his United career.

Harry Maguire (7/10):

A rock at the back. Stifled Randal Kolo Muani before his half-time substitution and did the same to Richarlison afterwards. Withdrawn with a minor injury for Yoro. No surprise it all went to pot after his substitution.

Luke Shaw (6/10):

Protected by Dorgu so well that there was little on Shaw's plate to clean up, even despite Spurs seeing more of the ball.

Noussair Mazraoui (6/10):

Didn't need to worry too much about Spurs' threats on his flanks given how inverted they were on that side. Substituted for Sesko.

Casemiro (7/10):

Didn't offer a lot in possession but swept up well when needed. Replaced by the fresh legs of Ugarte, whose introduction effectively cost United two points.

Bruno Fernandes (7/10):

One of few players on the entire pitch who enjoyed getting the ball on the floor and spreading play. Grabbed the assist for De Ligt's leveller, with his menacing playmaking rewarded at the very end.

Patrick Dorgu (7/10): 

One of his better outings since joining United in January. Nullified Spurs' threats coming down his side and stretched play when in possession. Subbed for Dalot with United protecting the lead.

Amad Diallo (7/10):

Bumped up into the frontline from the off after rescuing a point in last week's draw at Nottingham Forest. Came up with the cross for Mbeumo's goal before moving to wing-back after Sesko's introduction.

Bryan Mbeumo (7/10):

Began on the left to accommodate Amad on the right. Was the subject of interest from Tottenham and former boss Frank over the summer, but only wanted United and it's a decision that is already paying dividends. Peeled away from Porro to break the deadlock and extend his fine run of form.

Matheus Cunha (6/10):

Started as the false nine, dropping into midfield to try and link midfield and attack. Showed flashes of his brilliance though that was about it. Taken off for Mount.

Benjamin Sesko (3/10):

Still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League, which became almost too obvious when he was both thwarted and injured by Van de Ven when in on goal. Walked back down the tunnel as United ended with 10 men.

Leny Yoro (5/10):

Didn't provide nearly as much authority and confidence as Maguire.

Manuel Ugarte (2/10):

Walked past by Odobert for the equaliser, played Richarlison on for Spurs' second. A cameo to forget.

Mason Mount (6/10):

Played in Sesko for United's chance to win the game.

Diogo Dalot (N/A):

The usual United scapegoat but the collapse was hardly his fault.

Ruben Amorim (6/10):

A real mixed bag. The starting XI did their job, but Amorim's substitutions nearly cost United any sort of result.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Felix were on target as Al-Nassr comfortably thrashed Neom 3-1 to extend their lead over Al-Taawoun to three points at the top of the Saudi Pro League table. After a quiet second half, the floodgates opened with Gabriel's powerful shot before the Portuguese icon doubled the lead. Felix then scored the final goal to seal a memorable win for the Saudi giants. 

Al-Nassr and Neom played out an exciting first half, albeit goalless, as both teams had numerous chances to break the deadlock. Al-Nassr, of course, dominated proceedings with each of Ronaldo, Joao Felix and Sadio Mane coming close to opening their account in the game but they failed to keep the ball inside the goal.

Ronaldo possibly squandered the easiest chance of the half as he failed to keep his header on target from close range. Mane too missed a simple opportunity after miskicking the ball when inside the box.

The Saudi giants, though, did not take much time in the second half to open their scoring as in-form midfielder and ex-Chelsea star Angelo Gabriel broke the deadlock with a picture-perfect finish. In the 48th minute, Ronaldo took a free-kick from just outside the box, which was blocked by the Neom defenders but from the rebound, Gabriel scored with a brilliant grounded shot. 

Just seven minutes later, Neom were dealt another blow as striker Luciano Rodríguez was given his marching orders for a reckless challenge. The Uruguayan attacker was taking his position on the edge of the box to meet a cross from the left side when he intentionally elbowed an Al-Nassr player in the neck. The referee consulted the VAR before brandishing a red card. It was indeed a massive blow for Neom as they had already lost ex-Arsenal star Alexandre Lacazette in the first half due to injury.

Ronaldo soon completed his 953rd career goal after finding the back of the net from the penalty spot. In the earlier move, Ronaldo had seen his attempt saved from close range by compatriot Luis Maximiano but Joao Felix chased the second ball. The Portuguese forward tried to regain possession, but he was shoved from behind, which led to the spot-kick.

Ahmed Abdo pulled one back for the hosts in the 84th minute as Mohamed Simakan was caught napping. Abdo received the ball behind Simakan and comfortably placed it into the goal. Neom's celebrations were, however, short-lived as Joao Felix scored the third and final goal of the game to secure crucial three points. 

Ronaldo was once again on target as Al-Nassr extended their winning streak in the Saudi Pro League to eight games. The 40-year-old veteran star displayed a lively performance throughout the 90 minutes and also scored the team's crucial second goal from a spot-kick. 

Uruguayan striker Rodríguez was the main villain for Neom tonight as his reckless behaviour on the pitch led to his team being reduced to 10 men. Up until the sending off, Neom were fighting tooth and nail against the giants of the league, but his red card completely changed the complexion of the game. Rodriguez should have kept in mind that he was the team's last attacker for the night, especially after Lacazette's injury.

The Herons might miss the Uruguayan when they take on Nashville Saturday night, yet his absence could offer some answers as to how they function going forward

Luis Suarez just had to do it again. In fairness, this is what Luis Suarez does: mayhem, chaos, rule-breaking - and often in rather nasty ways.

His latest act? Kicking Nashville's Andy Najar in the groin during the second half of Inter Miami's playoff clash. It was the kind of thing Suarez has probably gotten away with countless times - a ball about to enter the box, Najar holding him, Suarez pushing off and flicking his leg with a quick, snapping motion.

Whether he intended to plant his studs in the defender's groin isn't clear - that would require a frightening degree of accuracy, a no-look shot for the ages. But the broader point holds: Suarez made a deliberate act to injure an opponent. Few caught it in real time, and there was no punishment on the pitch, but MLS reviewed the play afterward and handed him a one-match suspension. He'll now miss Saturday's elimination game against Nashville - if Miami lose, their season ends, and Suarez won't be on the pitch to help them.

Perhaps more importantly, though, this is a test for the Herons. They have survived without Suarez in the past. They have, arguably, looked better without him at times. And so, it becomes a strange balancing act. Suarez is a key player, to be sure. But they have shown previously that his absence isn't necessarily damning. And this game - win or lose - might just offer an idea of how a post-Suarez Inter Miami could function, not just in the next few weeks, but also for years to come. 

Of course, this was bound to happen. Every few months, Suarez reminds the footballing world why he's one of the game's great villains - an immense talent, but a truly unlikeable one. This is the Suarez brand: brilliance wrapped in chaos. The contradiction is that what makes him great - the tenacity and relentlessness - also fuels the misdemeanors. In a twisted way, good and evil Suarez must coexist for elite Suarez to thrive.

At his best, Suarez remains an unrelenting pest of a forward, even in his twilight years. He keeps running, shouting, and scrapping long after his body tells him not to. Everything about his 38-year-old frame - the worn knees, the heavy legs - suggests his career should be over. Yet somehow, he's still fighting on. That persistence doesn't justify the occasional kick or outburst; it's simply part of who he is (and still shouldn't be condoned).

These incidents are forgivable when Suarez is fit and firing. But when he's off color? Then they start to seem a real issue. He has already been suspended once this season, that time for spitting at a Seattle Sounders staff member after losing the Leagues Cup final. He was banned for three games and should have been out for longer. And now, Suarez is out again.

The immediate issue here - beyond that, of course, of having an aging superstar with serious anger issues - is how Miami approach Game 3. Suarez is having a poor season by his standards, with 10 goals and 10 assists in MLS. He is not the goalscoring threat he once was, but remains an influential part of the Miami attack. It's a footballing cliche of sorts, but Suarez makes all of the intelligent runs and occupies all of the right spaces. Strikers of his age are supposed to conserve energy and only move when they absolutely have to. Suarez is hardly ever static. Even when he is less effective in front of goal or slower getting to his spots on the pitch, he remains a nightmare for defenders. 

Miami don't have the personnel to replace him or his impact. What they will have to do, then, is some tactical tweaking. The silver lining to having a player who gets suspended a lot is that you tend to learn how to operate without him when needed. And Miami have done so on a couple of occasions this season. The most obvious solution is a tried and tested formula that has worked for 15 years: play Lionel Messi as a false nine. It worked wonders for Barcelona, and Argentina have done a similar thing for years.

That might, in fact, be the only option for the Herons. Young striker Allen Obando has hardly played all season. Tadeo Allende is a peripheral option. Messi, who is the team's best attacking player and playmaker, appears to be the most logical choice. 

But there will undoubtedly be a bit of a knock-on effect - at both ends of the pitch. Although they started the season in a 4-3-3, recently, Miami have played in a more recognizable 4-4-2. Suarez operates as a central striker of sorts, with Messi able to roam around in a free role just behind him. That makes perfect sense from an attacking point of view. It allows the outside players to get forward and scamper into good crossing positions, which then opens some space for Messi in the middle. This isn't tactically revolutionary as much as basic soccer.

When you don't have a central striker, though, things change. The concept of the false nine is inherently reliant on having two attacking outside players who pour forward and sacrifice a little bit defensively. It's almost counterintuitive, but playing without a natural forward tends to be far more offensive of a setup - mostly because it can leave teams frighteningly exposed when they don't have the ball.

Anyone who has watched Miami at any point this season would tell you that is not a very good idea. They're a pretty simple team to cut through, offering far too much space in the middle of the pitch, and limited pressure on the ball when they don't have it. The appeal of a 4-4-2, rather than a 4-3-3, is that it offers a more reliable defensive structure that is harder to play against. Effectively, then, in losing Suarez, Miami will be forced to leave themselves a little more open going the other way. 

Suarez is a real pain, but his presence alone makes Miami better - at least in theory. Without him in August, they were mixed: narrow wins over Seattle and D.C. United, but a 3-0 thrashing by Charlotte that exposed their flaws.

That game was perhaps more indicative of how Miami can be attacked than the two wins. Charlotte had far less of the ball, and were comfortable in their defensive shape. They kept Messi quiet, and were incredibly direct and opportunistic when they had the ball. They managed four shots on target, and three ended up in the back of the net. That is, perhaps, a bit of a statistical anomaly. But it is indicative of how Miami can be hit when they're without Suarez. That could easily happen against Nashville Saturday night. 

More broadly, it could offer some indications about Miami's future. Messi's under contract for multiple years, but Suarez's deal ends after this season. Despite Jorge Mas' hints that the Uruguayan could stay, there's been no public indication of renewal. There is every chance that he has played his last game for Miami. Now, the Herons have to figure out how to move forward without him. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged Benjamin Sesko to “embrace” the challenge of proving his doubters wrong after receiving criticism following his slow start to the season. The Slovenia international has found it difficult following his £74 million (€84m/$97m) move from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig but his manager has now challenged him to change the script.

Excitement was sky high over the summer as United invested over £200m on a new forward line consisting of Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. However, while Mbeumo and Cunha have hit the ground running for the Red Devils, it has been a different story for Sesko, who has scored just two goals in 11 appearances in all competitions.

Such has been Sesko's difficulties adapting to English football that United legend Gary Neville has questioned whether the forward represents a good investment by the 20-time champions.

Speaking to NBC Sports on the back of United's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest in the Premier League last Saturday, Neville said: ""I'm no further forward with him, the jury's still out. He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in, like Cunha and Mbeumo. He looks awkward, his touch was off a few times when balls went over the top. For £80m [sic], yes he's young and still settling but you want to see something more.”

However, while United head coach Amorim accepts Sesko has struggled upon his arrival from German football, the Portuguese has advised his charge not to take criticism from club legends too personally.

Offering an insight into how hard Sesko is working behind the scenes in order to change the narrative surrounding his big-money move, Amorim said: ""I'm relaxed, [but] he's not relaxed. I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle. That is normal. He has no experience here.

""The first impact [is] when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing and you hear that about Sesko. Then you come to one club that is the hardest club. If you don't perform every week, you are going to hear a lot of things from club legends, from pundits, from the media - and sometimes they are right.

""Of course, nobody likes to hear but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact. So, let's embrace that. It is hard to hear but it's not personal. It's an opinion that is going to change in three weeks. Everything that is true today, in three weeks, could be a lie.

""Ben is a young kid, a control freak. He wants to control everything - and he's not going to control everything.

""He has more potential than I was thinking [but] we need to understand how he likes to play and also to put in our ideas. I'm quite relaxed with that. He is going to be our striker for the long term but he's going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride. That is a normal thing in football.""

Sesko will be hoping to ease the pressure on his shoulders when United travel to Tottenham in the league on Saturday. It is the first meeting between the two sides since the Europa League final in May, when Spurs ended their 17-year trophy drought with a 1-0 victory over Amorim's men.

United, however, head to north London in great spirits following a four-game unbeaten run in the league. The Old Trafford club - who are currently eighth in the league and just a point behind sixth-placed Tottenham - secured three consecutive victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton before last weekend's draw with Forest.

Previewing his side's trip to Spurs, Amorim said: ""I think we are improving as a squad. We are winning games because we train better, we understand better the game. We have more options. So it's more, the consistency from the results is more a squad thing than a starting XI.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Bryan Mbeumo has revealed his stance on a potential Cameroon national team call-up for the African Cup of Nations in December as the winger is determined to avoid the club vs country row. The AFCON 2025 kicks off in the last week of December, while the players are expected to link up with their respective national teams two weeks before the competition commences.

Mbeumo enjoyed a stellar campaign with Brentford in the 2024-25 season as he scored 20 league goals and provided eight assists in 38 matches and emerged as the Premier League's fourth-highest goalscorer. His impressive form for the Bees caught United boss Ruben Amorim's eye as the Portuguese coach splashed a whopping £65 million ($87m) to secure the winger's signing. Amorim identified the Cameroonian as a key part of his squad overhaul after overseeing a nightmare debut campaign at Old Trafford. 

The 26-year-old has so far had an impressive outing in his maiden season with the Red Devils as he has scored four goals and contributed with an assist in 10 league matches. Last month, Mbeumo recorded three goals and one assist, playing a pivotal role in United's turnaround after a sluggish start to the season. His all-action displays reflected both his maturity and tactical intelligence under Amorim, who has given the 26-year-old the freedom to attack from the right-hand side while drifting into central positions. It also helped him bag the Premier League Player of the Month for October. 

Mbeumo is expected to receive a national team call-up next month as Cameroon are all set to take part in the AFCON 2025. The tournament starts on December 21 and according to FIFA's international competition regulations, clubs must release players two weeks before the start of major tournaments to allow for preparation. United are scheduled to face Wolves on December 8, the day Cameroon are expected to begin their preparations. 

The Sun reports that the Red Devils will urge the Cameroon Football Association, led by legendary striker Samuel Eto'o, to allow Mbeumo to stay in England for the club's crucial fixtures against Bournemouth and Aston Villa on December 13 and 21 respectively. 

The report adds that Mbeumo is very clear about his stance on this potential conflict, as he is determined not to upset either his employers or his country and wants a clear agreement between all parties in the coming weeks.

Other than Mbeumo, United will also miss key first team figures like Noussair Mazraoui and Amad, who are expected to represent Morocco and Ivory Coast respectively, at the continental competition. Speaking about missing three of their star players in December, United boss Amorim said: ""We will have time to suffer. We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity. When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us. They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.""

After a brilliant run of form in October, where they won three games in a row, something United had failed to achieve earlier in the Amorim era, their form somewhat took a dip as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Forest last weekend. Despite the draw, United have moved up to the eighth position in the Premier League table, courtesy of collecting 10 points in their last four games. They will now aim to get back to winning ways on Saturday as they travel to north London to face Tottenham. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Leny Yoro is adamant he has no “regrets” over joining Manchester United, saying he is “really happy” with his decision. The France Under-21 international has become a regular fixture for the Red Devils following his £52 million (€59m/$68m) move from Ligue 1 side Lille in July 2024, turning down interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid in the process.

After emerging through a famed Lille youth system which has also produced the likes of Eden Hazard, Benjamin Pavard, Lucas Digne and Lucas Chevalier, Yoro endured a difficult first season at United. 

The 19-year-old struggled with injury in a debut campaign which saw Ruben Amorim's side finish 15th in the Premier League - their lowest finish since 1990. United were also beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final in May, with Brennan Johnson scoring the only goal of the game as the Old Trafford club failed to clinch European football for 2025-26.

Things could have been a lot different for Yoro, had he decided to join La Liga heavyweights Real instead. Then-managed by Carlo Ancelotti, Los Blancos were keen to strengthen their defensive options by signing the young prodigy, who - at the time - had just one year left on his contract with Lille.

However, despite receiving a baptism of fire in England, Yoro insists he made the right decision by joining United, telling The Guardian: “Even with last season, I never had this feeling of regret.

“I know Manchester United, I know sometimes you can have a bad season, but this club is a top club, so you cannot have doubts about this. I knew the project of the club before I came.

“Of course I cannot expect the first year to finish in 15th position. These are some things you need to face also. But you have the director of the club, the coach, all the players, they are here to push you every day. You have confidence in this club. You need to put your heads up every day and try to do your best.

“Today my choice is Manchester, so I'm really happy with this. I know some people talked about this last year because of the results. I can understand them, but honestly, it's my choice, my career.”

After a testing opening to the 2025-26 season which saw United win just one of their opening five games in all competitions, things are now starting to look up for Amorim's men. The Red Devils are currently unbeaten in their last four league games, having downed Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, while also earning a point away at Nottingham Forest.

Such has been United's sharp upturn in form that Amorim was named Manager of the Month for October, with the Portuguese expressing his delight at getting his hands on the award.

""I'm really happy,"" said Amorim. ""Not just for my staff, but also for my players.

""I think they deserve full credit for this award because, in the end, the manager that wins this kind of award is not the best team, but the team that performs maybe better during this month.

""So I just expect to win the next one because it is a sign we won football matches.""

United and Yoro are looking to stretch their unbeaten run to five games when they lock horns with Europa League conquerers Tottenham in the league on Saturday afternoon. While United head to north London in high spirits, Spurs will be hoping to register a much-improved league performance following last weekend's dire derby-day defeat against Chelsea.

Thomas Frank's side were booed off the pitch following the 1-0 reverse against Enzo Maresca's Chelsea, though they gave the home faithful plenty to shout about in Tuesday's 4-0 victory over Copenhagen in the Champions League.

Defender Micky van de Ven scored one of the goals of the season as Johnson, Wilson Odobert and Joao Palhinha also found the back of the net for Tottenham, in what was just their second victory in their last six games in all competitions.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank has claimed he was happy to have only given up five shots to Manchester United during their 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday due to the visitors' attacking strength. The Red Devils led for much of the game before Spurs scored twice in quick succession late on, only for Matthijs de Ligt to head in a 96th-minute equaliser to ensure the spoils were shared.

United took the lead midway through the first half through £71 million ($93m) summer signing Bryan Mbeumo, who rose highest to meet an Amad Diallo cross. Mathys Tel came off the bench to bring Tottenham level on 84 minutes, and then Richarlison thought he had won it with a deft header to redirect Wilson Odobert's shot from distance. However, one last United corner saw Bruno Fernandes plant the ball atop the head of De Ligt, whose effort crept over the line to salvage a point for the visitors.

De Ligt's header was only United's fifth attempt of the game, with both of their shots on target going in. They accumulated 0.63 expected goals, compared to the 0.96 tally of Tottenham, who had 10 shots with four on target.

Much of the buildup to this fixture centred on United's run of four straight defeats to Tottenham across all competitions, including in the Europa League final in May. But Frank denied that match or this record had any bearing on his plans, claiming Ruben Amorim has done well to make the Red Devils a more threatening outfit.

Frank told GOAL: ""I think I saw this game as one game ahead of us, to try to do everything we could to try to win it. That was the aim of the game. I spoke before the game about it's clear they have improved this season. They look, how can you say, more in sync together. But I think especially going forward they look like a big threat. That's why I actually think, I know we conceded two goals, but if you said to me before the game concede five shots in the game, I would take that. So we're all happy.""

The Spurs boss also came up against a familiar face in Mbeumo, who was signed by the Dane at Brentford in 2019. Mbeumo scored 70 goals in 242 matches under Frank before completing a mega-money move to United this summer, despite interest from Tottenham and his former manager.

Though the Cameroonian has been a revelation from his favoured right-wing position this season, Amorim shifted him to the left to face Spurs, pushing Amad into the front three and dropping striker Benjamin Sesko to the bench. Nevertheless, Frank said this was a wrinkle he wasn't totally stunned by.

""I think it's not the first time Ruben has, how can you say, played around with the front three,"" he added. ""I think no matter where Bryan plays he's a threat, which he showed again today.""

Regarding the game in general, Frank said: ""Of course, the emotions inside me are high but I take the positives out of this game. That's what I believe and how I believe in building a good team and keep adding layers to it.

""Overall, a fine/good performance against a good Man United team which is definitely in flow. We are talking a bit about our, how can you say, level of defensive/attacking threats and to play against a Man Utd side that play with confidence with [Matheus] Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad and Sesko coming on and we kept them to five shots. It's just another example on the other way around that it's not that easy to create in the Premier League even though they had all their big boys out there.

""Second half, I was extremely happy with our response. We are playing at home and of course we all want to win and don't talk too much about (Tottenham's bad) home form and all that. I know we need to win before we don't talk about it. The way we turned it around to stay in the game, kept doing the right thing throughout the second half very happy with that. So close to winning it. On any other day, we win it.""

Ahead of the rest of the weekend's fixtures, Tottenham sit third in the Premier League table, while a resurgent United, who are unbeaten in their last five games, are seventh, but only behind Tottenham on goal difference.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Is Vinicius Junior entering his Real Madrid end game? Rows with Xabi Alonso, Kylian Mbappe's red-hot form and teenage talents threaten to force Brazilian superstar towards Saudi Arabia","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/vinicius-junior-entering-real-madrid-end-game-xabi-alonso-kylian-mbappe-brazilian-superstar-saudi-arabia/blt94555070fca05bb8","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

With just under 20 minutes to go in the first Clasico of the current campaign at the Santiago Bernabeu, Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso made a double substitution with his side 2-1 up on Barcelona. Federico Valverde accepted his withdrawal with good grace. Vinicius Junior did not. Five times he incredulously asked ""Me?!"", to the understandable bewilderment of his manager. ""Come on, Vini, damn it!,"" Alonso pleaded. But there was no calming the winger down.

""Always me! I'm leaving the team! I'm leaving!"" Vinicius said as he walked off the field and straight down the tunnel. ""It's better if I leave, I'm leaving."" At this stage, that might well be for the best for everyone concerned, because Vinicius' shameful show of insubordination wasn't the least bit shocking. 

On the contrary, it was entirely in keeping with his combustible character, just another temper tantrum from a player that is now very much running the risk of becoming more trouble than he's worth to Real Madrid...

Not so long ago Madrid were willing to tolerate Vinicius' egotistical behaviour - and sometimes even support it.

The winger was utterly convinced he was going to win last year's Ballon d'Or and even brought up his seemingly imminent triumph during a heated exchange with Gavi towards the tail end of Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona just two days before the ceremony in Paris. 

It was a rather revealing insight into his mindset. Vinicius clearly felt that boasting about his Ballon d'Or bid while his team were being humiliated on home soil by their most hated rivals was some kind of zinger; that individual glory was somehow more significant than collective failure in a team game like football. But the joke was on the Brazilian - because Vinicius didn't win the Ballon d'Or, and he took it very, very badly.

Even though Rodri made for a most deserving winner of the 2024 Ballon d'Or, Vinicius refused to attend the Manchester City midfielder's coronation.

Of course, not a single representative from Real Madrid turned up either. ""It is obvious that the Ballon d'Or and UEFA do not respect Real Madrid,"" an unnamed source told AS. ""And Real Madrid is not where it is not respected.""

As hissy fits go, it was pretty hysterical, the unintentional irony almost overwhelming. Madrid and Vinicius felt disrespected - and yet it was they who had disrespected Rodri.

Still, at least a Ballon d'Or boycott was something that los Blancos could easily get behind. Vinicius' very obvious personality clash with Alonso is far more problematic for Florentino Perez & Co.

Alonso is a likeable leader - as Bayer Leverkusen double-winners would attest - but the Spaniard does not have anything like the same laissez-faire approach to man-management or team tactics as his predecessor as Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, whose father-like relationship with Vinicius and the other Brazilians in the Bernabeu dressing room undoubtedly played a part in the Italian's appointment as Selecao coach.

Consequently, the arrival of Alonso was always likely to ruffle some feathers at Real - at least initially - but that wasn't considered a bad thing. The feeling was that after a disastrous final season under Ancelotti, Madrid's superstars would benefit from less freedom and more structure.

Kylian Mbappe is certainly thriving under the new boss. The Frenchman won the European Golden Shoe last year, with 31 goals in 34 Liga games, but his strike-rate has actually improved this season, while there's also a greater dynamism about his all-round play.

Mbappe is now, without a shadow of a doubt, the leader of Madrid's attack, as well the club's poster-boy - which was Perez's plan all along. It's why he invested so much time, money and effort in convincing Mbappe to leave Paris Saint-Germain for Madrid.

The knock-on effect, though, is that Vinicius no longer feels as appreciated as he once did at the Bernabeu.

Vinicius' current contract expires in two years' time and it could yet be renewed. However, whereas an extension was considered a given as recently as last season, the forward's future is now shrouded in uncertainty - and Vinicius' strained relationship with Alonso is the reason why.

The first signs of tension between the two appeared during the Club World Cup, when Alonso informed Vinicius that he would not be starting the semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, which did not go over well at all with the forward.

In the end, Vinicius started the game in East Rutherford - but only due to an injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold, and even then the 25-year-old was less than impressed at being deployed 'out of position' on the right wing. Vinicius nonetheless played his part in Madrid's strong start to the 2025-26 season. 

However, it quickly became clear that he was not happy with being occasionally rotated and regularly subbed by Alonso. With 13 minutes to go in the 2-0 win over Espanyol on September 20, Vinicius was replaced by Rodrygo. He responded by waving his arms around in disbelief before throwing a water bottle to the floor in frustration.

Vinicius and his entourage would likely disagree vehemently but he's actually very lucky that he has a coach as composed as Alonso, who has handled his childish conduct with the same kind of class he exuded during his playing days.

After the Espanyol outburst, Alonso pointed out that Franco Mastantuono, who had come off at the same time as Vinicius, was disappointed by his withdrawal too.

""Franco said to me, ‘Are you taking me off?' And I said, ‘Yes.' Something similar happened with Vini, but it happens to everyone,"" Alonso rather reasonably explained. ""But I'm very happy with Vinicius' performance. The only thing he was missing today was a goal.

""It's true that he came off the pitch when he was feeling best, so I could have waited a bit to replace him, but I understood that we needed fresh players to maintain control. The schedule is demanding and we have to keep going like this.""

When Alonso was pressed on the matter again just a couple of days later, he struck an even more empathetic tone.

""I've been a player too,"" he pointed out on the eve of his team's game against Levante. ""When I was substituted, it wasn't always the nicest moment. So, [frustration], it's normal, it's natural.

""We talked about things after the game, as I like to be close to the players, and I won't make a big deal out of something small.""

Vinicius, though, is evidently incapable of such restraint.

Vinicius' Clasico conniption was always going to cause a colossal amount of controversy. This wasn't Espanyol. It was Barcelona. In the biggest fixture in football. The whole world was watching, meaning everyone had an opinion.

Ex-Brazil international Luis Fabiano accused his compatriot of showing his replacement, Rodrygo, ""a lack of respect"", while former France international Christophe Dugarry spoke for a lot of people when he proclaimed himself tired of Vinicius' antics.

""He's always whining, he's always crying at the referee and at the opponents - he's unbearable now,"" Dugarry told RMC Sport. ""You can be disappointed after being taken off, with your head down, grumbling, but insulting your coach, this is going too far.

""Have you ever asked yourself the question that if the coach doesn't play you, it's because your performances aren't at the right level? Get out, man, get out. Your performances are not up to scratch. He's still a long way from his level of recent seasons. He needs to reassess himself.

""He's a future Ballon d'Or winner, a leader of Brazil, one of Real Madrid's best. But he needs to show something else if he wants to be at the same level. Florentino Perez will get rid of him.""

As for Steve McManaman, he was annoyed at Vinicius for overshadowing what was a hugely significant win for his old club. ""We shouldn't be talking about someone getting substituted after 75 minutes. It drives me mad,"" the European Cup winner said on ESPN. 

""Because it's not about [Vinicius], it's about the team. It's about the collective. It's about winning. It is about going five points clear. It's about beating Barcelona after they beat you four times last year. It's about winning Xabi Alonso's first Clasico as coach."" 

Vinicius wasn't without his defenders, though. Toni Kroos, for example, argued on his own podcast that ""nobody can judge or imagine the emotion"" that a player experiences during a Clasico played in front of 80,000 people. ""In the cold light of day and with a bit of distance, he'll probably think: 'Well, I could have held back the anger a little longer.' As you can see in the images, it's not been conveyed in the ideal way,"" the former Madrid midfielder acknowledged. ""Even so, I want to point out that it's an emotionally exceptional situation to be down there in a match like that.""

Crucially, Vinicius' team-mate Dean Huijsen also leapt to his defence, with the Spain centre-back accusing the media of making ""a huge fuss"" out of a small matter. ""He apologised, which I thought was fair, but he's an incredible team-mate, a really good guy, and it's no big deal. These things happen in football.""

However, the issue with Huijsen's argument is that the apology was arguably even worse than the act itself. In his 98-word statement on his meltdown, there was no mention of his coach.

Vinicius basically said sorry to everyone bar the man he disrespected - and that was no oversight. The omission of even a reference to Alonso was very deliberate - as was the fact that the public apology was posted online on the very same day that The Athletic published a piece in which an anonymous source said that Alonso ""thinks he's Pep Guardiola, but so far he's just Xabi.""

Alonso, to his enormous credit, continued to rise above such underhanded attempts to turn this into a struggle for public approval between a player and his coach, preferring instead to praise Vinicius for his ""valuable"" and ""positive"" apology and draw a line under the matter. 

This affair is far from over, though, as underlined by ongoing leaks to the press, with AS reporting that Vinicius is now 'seriously considering' leaving Madrid, while BILD have gone as far as to claim that the decision has already been taken to sell the attacker at the end of the season.

It certainly wouldn't be a shock to see Vinicius make a long-mooted move to Saudi Arabia. His prime years may still be ahead of him but it's hard to see any elite European club meeting Real's rumoured €150 million (£132m/$174m) asking price.

Obviously, an awful lot could change between now and next summer - particularly at the Bernabeu, where a coach is never more than a couple of defeats away from a crisis. Still, Alonso is presently in a position of real strength, with Madrid top of La Liga, while Vinicius' hand has been weakened by his petulance and patchy performances (no goals or assists in his last five matches in all competitions).

He may still believe he's the best player in the world but he's not even the best player at the Bernabeu. As former France international Emmanuel Petit recently told JeffBet, Mbappe is the new ""king"" of Madrid and ""Vinicius Jr is upset he's not being paid the same amount of money and the fact the team has been built around Mbappe. It felt like even Jude Bellingham was annoyed by Mbappe's arrival because he wasn't scoring as much, but that has changed recently. Everything has changed, in the media, in the changing room, the tactics on the pitch. Bellingham has been acting professionally and more intelligently in his communication than Vinicius.""

Perhaps even more worryingly for Vinicius, there are a number of promising teenage talents in the Madrid squad capable of taking his place in Alonso's starting line-up, including Mastantuono and Endrick. Furthermore, if he were to be sold, the massive amount of money raised could then be easily invested in a star centre-forward (Erling Haaland, anyone?!) if Alonso wanted to move Mbappe onto the left wing.

The Blancos boss would never say such a thing in the current climate, of course. He's just trying to keep the peace for now, as he knows how valuable Vinicius could be to Madrid's hopes of winning major silverware this season.

However, Alonso has also acknowledged that for Vinicius to reproduce his very best form, ""He has to feel important and comfortable."" Right now, he clearly feels neither, meaning the next time he threatens to leave, Madrid might well usher him out the door.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

 With the Green Art Wall Project, the Nitto ATP Finals has become inextricably linked to the city of Turin. A mural that promotes sustainability and respect for the environment, it is an artistic creation that, in addition to contributing to urban regeneration, helps to improve air quality. 

 The project, born from the collaboration between the Nitto ATP Finals, the tournament's title partner Nitto, and with the support of the city of Turin, places particular emphasis on the theme of CO₂ reduction, both in the subject matter and in the construction of the work itself. The mural has been created using special Airlite paints capable of purifying the air and concretely contributing to the improvement of the surrounding environment. 

 This work forms part of a broader initiative, the Nitto ATP Finals Torino Green Project, launched in 2023 to promote sustainability and innovation in the city of Turin.

 The Green Art Wall is an expression of gratitude from the Nitto ATP Finals towards the citizens of Turin: a legacy that the event leaves to the city, marking the culmination of its first five-year presence in Turin. 

 The mural, created by the Turin-based artist MrFijodor and hosted on the wall of the Istituto Comprensivo Leone Senigaglia, tells the story of the connection between sustainability and tennis, a bond founded on shared values such as commitment, growth, and respect. The choice of a school, a symbolic place of learning and the future, represents an additional source of pride for all partners involved. 

 The creation of the mural will accompany the entire duration of the Nitto ATP Finals and will be completed on 16 November, when the artist will sign the work, making it officially part of the cultural heritage of the city of Turin.

Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler capped their 2025 season in style on Saturday at the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Hellenic Championship, where they won their third ATP Tour title of the year.

The second seeds rallied past Santiago Gonzalez and David Pel 4-6, 6-3, 10-3 in the final, during which they won 16 of 17 first-serve points in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Cabral and Miedler partnered for the first time in April this year before lifting trophies in Gstaad, Hangzhou, and now Athens to close out the season on a high note.

“It's unbelievable. It was the perfect way to wrap up a great season,” said Cabral. “We started in April and we [just] missed the Nitto ATP Finals. It's bittersweet, but overall we're very happy with the year we did.”

Following their run in the Greek capital, both men are at career highs in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Rankings. Cabral is No. 20, while Miedler is at No. 23. As a team, they occupy the 11th spot in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings, three places shy of the qualification spots for the prestigious season finale in Turin.



Halys/Herbert triumph on home soil in Metz
Quentin Halys and Pierre-Hugues Herbert rose to the occasion in front of their home fans on Saturday at the Moselle Open in Metz.

The Frenchmen upset third seeds Guido Andreozzi and Manuel Guinard 7-5, 6-3 in the championship match to capture their first team title in just their second tournament together. With their triumph, Halys and Herbert became the first French pair to lift the Metz trophy since Nicolas Mahut and Edouard Roger-Vasselin in 2018.

Halys and Herbert's run at the indoor hard-court ATP 250 was anything but straightforward. They rallied from a set down to defeat fourth seeds Fernando Romboli and John-Patrick Smith in the first round and then saved two match points to sink second seeds and defending champions Sander Arends and Luke Johnson in the semi-finals.

The Cincinnati Open, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha and the Nordea Open in Bastad were named Tournaments of the Year in their respective categories for the 2025 ATP Awards based on the results of player surveys.

The Cincinnati event was named the ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year for the first time after completing a $260 million transformation at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Doha received an upgrade of its own, becoming an ATP 500 event this season and leading the voting at that level, while the seaside Bastad event was named the ATP 250 Tournament of the Year for the 13th time.





The Cincinnati Open lived up to the considerable hype after doubling its footprint to more than 40 acres, turning its grounds into an unforgettable campus that blends elite tennis with the atmosphere of an amusement park. The $260 million investment was made collectively with the City of Mason, Warren County and the State of Ohio.

In its 126th year, the event welcomed more players than ever — 96 in the singles main draw and 32 in doubles — as it expanded to 12 days, while also creating one of the most fan-friendly environments on Tour.

“We are incredibly honored to be named ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year for the first time in our history,” said tournament director Bob Moran. “This recognition is a reflection of the vision and commitment of Ben and Kelly Navarro, who set out to create a best-in-class experience not just for fans, but for the players who make this sport so special. This award is a true team achievement, and we're grateful to the ATP and the players for recognizing that effort.”

Carlos Alcaraz captured this year's Cincinnati men's singles title, while Rajeev Ram and Nikola Mektic claimed the doubles crown at the August event.

The Qatar ExxonMobil Open, a six-time honouree in the ATP 250 category, raised its exceptional standards in tournament organisation, player services and hospitality to mark its elevation to the ATP 500 level with Tournament of the Year honours.

The February tournament's upgrade further strengthened its global standing — attracting an elite player field that included Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic — and enhanced its impact within the region and beyond.

“We are truly honoured to receive this award for best tournament in the ATP 500 category,” said tournament director Karim Alami. “This recognition reflects the passion, dedication and teamwork that define our event. From our incredible players and loyal fans to our committed sponsors and staff, everyone contributed to creating a world-class experience both on and off the court. 

“This award inspires us to continue raising the bar and delivering an unforgettable tournament for years to come.”

Andrey Rublev won the Doha men's singles title and the event's coveted “Golden Falcon” trophy, beating Jack Draper in a three-set final. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool won an all-British doubles final against Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.

The Nordea Open, voted ATP 250 Tournament of the Year for 11 consecutive years from 2002-12, has now won the award in two of the past three seasons. The Swedish event, one of the most scenic on the ATP Tour calendar, also topped the voting in 2023, when it celebrated its 75th anniversary.

""This is great news and we are of course happy and thankful. Our ambition is always to give the best services and hospitality to all our guests; players, partners and spectators,” said CEO & Managing Director Christer Hult. “This is confirmation that the team is doing a great job and it inspires us to continue developing the tournament even more. A big thanks to the players, our organisation and the ATP support team.""

Sixth-seeded Italian Luciano Darderi won this year's Bastad singles title in July, while doubles top seeds Guido Andreozzi and Sander Arends won the doubles final in a Match Tie-break.



This year, the ATP is unveiling changes to the ATP Awards, designed to enhance the prestige and excitement of the season's most celebrated honours. 

For the first time, members of the exclusive ATP No. 1 Club – the 29 current and former players to have reached World No. 1 – will decide the winners of Breakthrough of the Year and the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award. 

The new Breakthrough of the Year category goes to the player who made the biggest breakthrough on the ATP Tour this season, with consideration given to milestone wins, significant jumps in the PIF ATP Rankings and first ATP Tour titles. Whilst there are no age restrictions, the Award is aimed at Next Gen and young players.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Babos, Stefani run continues; Kudermetova, Mertens save match point to set WTA Final","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4398023/babos-stefani-top-hsieh-ostapenko-to-reach-wta-finals-riyadh-title-match","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 00:08:45 GMT","

Timea Babos reached her fourth WTA Finals title match and Luisa Stefani her first as the duo defeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko in the Riyadh semifinals, coming from a break down to win both sets. Not to be outdone, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens saved a match point against Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend to reach the final for the first time in three years.

In their debut as a team at the WTA Finals, No. 7 seeds Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani will play for the title after coming from a break down in both sets to defeat No. 6 seeds Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-6(5) in the semifinals.

WTA Finals: Scores | Draws | Order of play

It's new ground for Babos and Stefani as a team -- Stefani, who is playing the first WTA Finals of her career, becomes the first Brazilian to reach the final of the tournament in its history -- but familiar territory for Babos. The Hungarian is a three-time WTA Finals champion and has now reached her fourth final with a third different partner.

She previously won with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova in 2017, and Kristina Mladenovic in 2018 and 2019 -- memories that helped her as she helped deliver another victory here.

""I never lost in a semifinal of the WTA Finals before, so I'm just keeping that,"" Babos said in her on-court interview. ""I'm very proud of us.""

The in-form Babos and Stefani have also advanced to their fifth final of 2025 -- and first above WTA 500 level -- and third in a row following Ningbo (runners-up to Nicole Melichar-Martinez and Liudmila Samsonova) and Tokyo (champions).

In a first-time encounter, Babos and Stefani were the most consistent team throughout. Hsieh and Ostapenko led 3-1 in the first set and 4-2 in the second but were too up-and-down to press home their advantage either time. The Hungarian-Brazilian duo delivered spectacular defense on several key points, holding firm at net to repel both Ostapenko's biggest blows and Hsieh's most creative angles, leaving little space for their opponents to get past.

Hsieh and Ostapenko showed flickers of the magic they can produce -- the Latvian found some accuracy to go with her power to break Stefani for 4-2 in the second set, and Hsieh's touch came to the fore as they saved the first two match points against them trailing 5-4. In the ensuing tiebreak, they were also handed a lifeline from 5-2 down by a pair of nervy volley errors by Babos and Stefani.

But at 5-5, Ostapenko once again was unable to find a way through, netting a forehand for her team's 43rd unforced error of the day, and Babos sealed her third match point with a service winner.

""Really tight in the score, and such a different game style than we've been playing in the past few days,"" Stefani said afterward. ""Two different faces, two different styles. We stayed together -- Timi helped a lot in the first set, I felt I pushed us through the second, and we both helped each other this whole tournament.""

Three years ago, Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens defeated Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in a match tiebreak to capture the Martina Navratilova Trophy in Fort Worth. 

Early Saturday morning, the duo returned to the WTA Finals championship match for the first time since, defeating Siniakova and Taylor Townsend in another match tiebreak, 4-6, 7-6 (6), [10-6] in 1 hour and 52 minutes in Riyadh after saving a match point in the second-set tiebreak.

The match ended just before 1:30 a.m. local time.

Hard fought victory! 💥Mertens/Kudermetova defeat Townsend/Siniakova to secure their spot in the final!#WTAFinalsRiyadh pic.twitter.com/Tw3ArYLKFk

""It's pretty late,"" Mertens said after the match. ""Thanks everyone for staying. It really makes a difference. We had to dig really deep against two incredible players. I'm very happy with the super tiebreak that we played. My partner was on fire there. Thanks to our team for cheering.""

Kudermetova indeed stepped up on several big points, saving match point with a volley in the second-set tiebreak and sealing the comeback with a smash winner.

Her turnaround followed a rocky start.

""When I started the match, I could not feel the rhythm,"" she said. ""The girls (Siniakova and Townsend) did an amazing job. They tried some things that were not really comfortable for me. But I was fighting a little bit with my husband and then I was angry. And then I woke up and I go, 'OK, we go for it.'""

Siniakova and Townsend broke to open the match and again for a 5-2 lead in the first set. Kudermetova and Mertens broke back when the Australian Open champions served for the set but couldn't complete the rally. The second set opened with another exchange of breaks, as the teams traded service games through the first four games before eventually reaching a tiebreak.

Siniakova and Townsend held match point at 6-5, but Kudermetova's volley kept the title hopes alive. Moments later, a Kudermetova winner clinched the set to force a match tiebreak. From there, Kudermetova and Mertens raced to a 7-3 lead and closed out victory a few points later to advance to the final against Babos and Stefani.

The pairs met once earlier this season, with Kudermetova and Mertens winning in straight sets in Rome en route to the final. 

On the line Saturday is a second WTA Finals crown for Kudermetova and Mertens. Meanwhile, Babos is chasing her fourth, while Stefani, making her debut, seeks her first.

The ""dream final"" at the inaugural Hellenic Championship is set: top seed Novak Djokovic will face second seed Lorenzo Musetti at the ATP 250 event in Athens. While Djokovic is aiming to lift his first trophy in his new home city on Saturday, Musetti continues his pursuit of the last of the coveted spots at the ATP Finals in Turin.Djokovic booked his place in the title match on Friday afternoon with a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 victory over German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann, ending the 33-year-old's impressive run. Just weeks after being pushed to three sets by Hanfmann at the Shanghai Masters, the Serbian was in command for most of the rallies in Athens.The only moment of concern came midway through the first set when Hanfmann broke serve for a 3-1 lead, prompting Djokovic to glance at the jumbotron above the court with a little hint of frustration. But the World No. 5 immediately regained control, breaking back to 4-3 and never looking back. After just over an hour of play, Djokovic sealed the win to reach yet another tour-level final - this time in Greece.

After just over an hour of play, Djokovic sealed the win to reach yet another tour-level final - this time in Greece.

“I think it was the best tennis I've played this tournament,” said Djokovic, who broke a four-match losing streak in semifinals to reach an ATP Tour final a 23rd country for his career. “It came at the right time. Hanfmann poses a great threat because he serves big, has a big game, so I needed to really stay focused. I was a break down in the second, but I held my composure. I'm very excited for the final.”The 38-year-old Belgrade native will appear in his 144th tour-level championship match, his third of the season after Miami and Geneva, and his 95th on hard courts. Djokovic is eyeing his 101st tour-level title.Part of Djokovic's preparation for the final will take place on unusual ground, as the Serb was planning to attend die Euro League basketball game between Olympiakos Piraeus and Partizan Belgrade. “The match time wasn't too long,” Djokovic stated during his press conference. “I have to do recoveries in the next couple of hours and probably won't make it to the beginning of the game, but I will try to make it.”

Meanwhile, Musetti fought past Sebastian Korda from the United States 6-0, 5-7, 7-5. In a topsy-turvy match, the 23-year-old Italian needed to save one match point to prevail after two hours and 20 minutes.“We both played a really fantastic match. The level was very high, and it was an intense match for the crowd,” Musetti said during his on-court interview. The world No. 9 is seeking his third career title after lifting trophies on home soil in Naples and Hamburg, Germany three years ago.Since then, Musetti has finished runner-up five times, twice this season.“I wasn't really lucky with finals in the past years. Hopefully this will change tomorrow,” Musetti said. “I am playing for two goals, and I am already focusing on tomorrow.”

The 24-time Grand Slam champion thinks there would've been no better final for the first edition of the tournament. In that spirit, a spectacular conclusion awaits.“No. 1 seed against the No. 2 seed is a dream final for probably every tournament. It'll be great,” Djokovic said.“I have a very good win score against him, but he is still looking for a place at the ATP Finals and needs to win the tournament. He plays well and that's what everyone wants to see: high-quality tennis,” said Djokovic, who leads the head-to-head record with Musetti 8-1. Their last meeting took place in the round of the last 16 at the Miami Open earlier this season, when the Serb won in straight sets.“I invite everyone to come back tomorrow. Let's make the stadium full and let's enjoy tennis,” Djokovic told the crowd on Friday.

Germany's Tim Ruehl continued his breakthrough season by capping off another impressive week on the ATP Challenger Tour when he captured the doubles title at the Hamburg Ladies & Gents Cup in late October, partnering Belgium's Michael Geerts. For Ruehl, it marked his second Challenger doubles crown of the season, following their triumph earlier this year at the Dutch Tennis Open in Bunschoten.Reflecting on his latest success at the ATP Challenger 50 hard-court event in Hamburg, Ruehl said: “It was overall a very positive week. We had a tough draw but started strong and handled our matches well. The final was very close again, but in the end, we maybe got one or two more returns in the court, and that made the difference.”Read More: How stepping away from tennis helped George Loffhagen find his game againThe 27-year-old from the small town of Waldshut-Tiengen, nestled in in the southwest of Germany, has enjoyed a steady climb up the doubles rankings this season, currently sitting at a career-high world No. 161. His long-standing partnership with Geerts continues to thrive—both on and off the court.“We've known each other for a long time and played together at Arizona State University,” Ruehl explained. “He's strong from the baseline, and I feel more comfortable at the net, so we complement each other well. We've also spent a lot of time together off the court, which makes it special.”

Looking ahead, Ruehl remains focused on finishing the year strong after achieving one of his main goals for the season—breaking into the Top 200.“At the start of the year, that was the target, and I've managed to achieve it and solidify it with this title. Now Patrick Zahraj and I are heading to the U.S. for three weeks. Let's see what more we can do. Overall, I'm very satisfied and want to end the season on a high note.”Beyond competing, Ruehl is also working on giving back to the sport. Later this year, he and Zahraj will host a new national doubles event in his hometown: The Schlatter Open. Running from December 19–21, it will feature €15,000 (approx. $17,300 USD) in prize money plus hospitality.“We want to create a platform for doubles players, who really deserve more recognition,” Ruehl said. “It's exciting—players like Jakob Schnaitter, Constantin Frantzen, and even 2010 Wimbledon doubles champion Philipp Petzschner will compete. It's going to be a great event.”

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Championship leader Lando Norris has extended his lead after taking victory in the Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, while the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri crashed out of the event.

Lando Norris has taken victory in an action-packed Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, the McLaren driver holding off Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli amid changing conditions in an event that saw the other papaya car of Oscar Piastri crash out early on.

While the Sprint got off to a relatively calm start – with Norris leading smoothly away from pole – the picture changed within a few laps when Piastri hit the barriers after getting on the damp kerbs at Turn 3, with Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto subsequently going off at the same corner moments later.

The Sprint was subsequently red-flagged as the damage was cleared, but Norris again held the lead when the event resumed shortly afterwards. That position looked in doubt during the final laps, however, as the Briton struggled with his rear soft tyres and found himself under increasing pressure from Antonelli.

With the event ending under double yellow flags following a heavy crash for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, Norris ultimately held off Antonelli to take the win, the championship leader doing so with a margin of just 0.845s.

George Russell added to a solid outing for Mercedes in third, while Red Bull's Max Verstappen took some valuable points in fourth should he hope to keep his title bid alive. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari after a late pass on Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, with the other Scuderia car of Lewis Hamilton and Alpine's Pierre Gasly following in seventh and eighth places.

With one only hour of practice taking place on Friday, a busy Sprint Qualifying session later in the day had seen Norris claim pole position for the 100-kilometre dash, a format that awards points to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8.

The Briton's closest challenger was Antonelli, whose own effort was just 0.097s adrift of Norris' pace-setting time of 1m 09.243s. Behind them were the other respective McLaren and Mercedes cars of Piastri and Russell in third and fourth.

It was a tricker session for title contender Verstappen, who shook his head in disappointment after crossing the line in sixth, while both Ferraris also appeared to be struggling for pace as Leclerc and Hamilton claimed eighth and 11th places.

Despite a potentially mixed weather forecast for Saturday, showers that had fallen earlier on had faded as the drivers started to assemble at Interlagos for the Sprint, though parts of the track still appeared damp.

It was confirmed in the build-up to the event that both Yuki Tsunoda and Carlos Sainz – who had qualified in 18th and 20th respectively – would start from the pit lane due to modifications being made to their cars under parc ferme conditions, that being a set-up and front wing/nose assembly change for Tsunoda and a set-up change for Sainz.

While questions remained in the build-up over whether slick or intermediate tyres would be the preference owing to the damp patches on track – and with a 30% chance of rain during the Sprint – it was confirmed when the tyre blankets were removed that the majority of the field had bolted on the medium compound, while Antonelli, Russell, Verstappen, Leclerc, Isack Hadjar and Alex Albon were the exceptions on the soft tyres.

As the lights went out for the 24-lap event, Norris made an excellent start to surge ahead in the lead, while Antonelli faced pressure from Piastri but managed to hold onto second. Behind them, Verstappen was quick to pick off Alonso for fifth and Hamilton had also made moves, climbing up to eighth place to run behind team mate Leclerc.

Lance Stroll had lost out to drop down two positions to ninth, and further back there was contact between Ollie Bearman and Liam Lawson at Turn 4, an incident that sent the former into a spin to drop him down to P18.

Following an investigation by the stewards post-Sprint, Bearman was later handed a five-second time penalty and one penalty point for driving in a manner deemed potentially dangerous between Turns 3 and 4, while Lawson also received the same punishment for causing a collision at Turn 4.

Within four laps, Norris had stretched out a gap of nearly one and a half seconds from Antonelli, with each of the top five running in relatively clear air. The margins were much finer behind, however, as Alonso was chased by Leclerc and Hamilton.

That calm quickly unravelled with a dramatic sequence of events on Lap 6, as Piastri took too much kerb and crashed into the barriers at Turn 3. With water seemingly being dragged onto the track, Hulkenberg and Colapinto then both went off at the same corner, resulting in the Safety Car being deployed.

While Hulkenberg was able to get his Kick Sauber going again and return to the pits with a broken nosecone, Piastri and Colapinto were both out of the running – and with those cars needing to be recovered and the barriers requiring repairs, a red flag was thrown to bring the Sprint to a halt.

The remaining cars made their way back to the fast lane of the pit lane during the stoppage, before a restart time was confirmed a short while later. Kick Sauber had fixed Hulkenberg's car in time to rejoin the Sprint, meaning that he was released onto the track to get himself to the back of the queue in the pit lane.

Ahead of a rolling start, the Safety Car led the pack out – all having changed tyres during the break – and Norris again executed a good start when the action resumed with 15 laps remaining. Behind him Russell looked to challenge Antonelli, but it was the latter who held position through Turn 1.

Alonso was also looking racy, the Aston Martin driver attempting a move on fourth-placed Verstappen before having to back off and settle for fifth. While Verstappen then started to pull away, Alonso again found himself under pressure from Leclerc behind.

As the halfway mark of the Sprint passed, Norris was leading Antonelli by 1.2s, with Russell, Verstappen, Alonso, Leclerc, Hamilton and Stroll completing the points-paying positions, though Stroll had the Alpine of Gasly hot on his tail.

Alonso – still being chased by Leclerc – was told to lift and coast by his race engineer, while further back Gasly was still looking to get ahead of Stroll for eighth. The Frenchman was still keeping an eye on what was happening ahead, reporting: “That Ferrari needs to get past Alonso.”

At the front, Norris appeared to be struggling with his rear tyres on the drying track, the Briton having switched to the soft compound during the stoppage. Could second-placed Antonelli eat further into the McLaren's 1.1s lead?

By Lap 20, Antonelli had closed to just 0.4s behind Norris. Behind them, Leclerc finally found a way past Alonso to move up into fifth, leaving the Aston Martin to face pressure from the other Ferrari of Hamilton.

As the final lap arrived, all eyes were on Antonelli as the Italian continued his pursuit of Norris. But with a hefty crash into the barriers for home favourite Bortoleto – after which the Brazilian fortunately reported that he was okay – meaning that the Sprint ended under double yellow flags, it was Norris who took victory as the chequered flag fell, allowing him to extend his championship lead over Piastri to nine points.

Antonelli crossed the line just 0.845s behind, while the other Mercedes of Russel followed in third. Verstappen claimed fourth place, with Leclerc, Alonso, Hamilton and Gasly taking the remaining points on offer.

Stroll and Hadjar just missed out in ninth and 10th respectively, while Haas' Esteban Ocon and Bearman were 11th and 12th, the latter holding enough of a margin from the car behind to maintain his place despite his aforementioned five-second time penalty.

While Lawson had originally followed in 13th, his five-second time penalty later dropped him to 16th, promoting Tsunoda, Sainz and Hulkenberg up by one position each with Albon completing the classification in 17th. Bortoleto, Piastri and Colapinto, meanwhile, were the three retirees from the event after their respective crashes.

""It was tough,"" said Norris. ""It makes the win more rewarding when you have a race like this, especially with Kimi here – he was certainly not making my life easy. It's one of those ones where you have to push because you know the guy behind is going to try and push that little bit more. It was sketchy – I had a couple of little lifts, but even with the wind it was tricky. With the degradation on the tyres, it was difficult so definitely not an easy race but probably the race you expect here in Brazil. It's always a difficult one.""

Following the Sprint, the drivers will next return to action during Qualifying for the Grand Prix later on Saturday, with the session set to begin at 1500 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Although he led from start to finish, Lando Norris' win in the Sao Paulo Sprint was far from straightforward.

Lando Norris has conceded that McLaren have “homework to do” in order to keep their competitors at bay after he came under intense pressure from Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli before winning the Sprint in Sao Paulo.

The Briton executed a strong launch to kick off the 24-lap session, charging away from the young Italian racer and maintaining a consistent advantage for the opening stint. However, this was thrown into jeopardy when the second McLaren of Oscar Piastri crashed out of the Sprint.


After his car, along with Franco Colapinto's Alpine, was recovered under red flag conditions, Norris faced the challenge of controlling a rolling restart on soft tyres around the slippery track.

He got away well while Antonelli went side-by-side with his team mate George Russell, but as Norris' tyre performance began to fade away, the 19-year-old was able to speed into DRS range and force the McLaren driver to defend right up to the chequered flag.

“It was tough,” Norris summarised. “It makes the win more rewarding when you have a race like this, especially with Kimi here – he was certainly not making my life easy.

“It's one of those ones where you have to push because you know the guy behind is going to try and push that little bit more. It was sketchy – I had a couple of little lifts, but even with the wind it was tricky.

“With the degradation on the tyres, it was difficult so definitely not an easy race but probably the race you expect here in Brazil.”

He went on to elaborate on the unexpectedly small gap to the Mercedes, concluding that it was “a struggle” to manage the tyres over the final five laps whilst keeping Antonelli behind.

He added: “The Mercedes were quick and Kimi kept me under pressure for the whole race. I just expected us to be a little bit better and we weren't. I don't know how much of it was down to the tyres or just that they did a good job and were quick today. We've got some homework to do before Qualifying.”

Norris' victory could prove to be critical in the championship battle as he netted eight points compared to Piastri's zero, with fellow title contender Max Verstappen settling for P4 and five points.

However, the combination of tight competition across the field and tricky weather conditions make the remaining Qualifying and Sao Paulo Grand Prix far from predictable.

He explained: “I think our Qualifying pace was good, but the wind changed a lot today. The conditions are quite different so today is different to yesterday.

""Tomorrow is going to be another day, but they're going to put us under pressure, I'm sure. Like they said, it's small gaps and you've got to do some perfect laps.”

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Lando Norris managed the precarious track conditions in Interlagos to secure another win.

Grey skies and a damp circuit were not enough to dissuade Lando Norris from storming to victory in the Sao Paulo Sprint, narrowly beating the Mercedes duo of Kimi Antonelli and George Russell.

After a strong start for Norris, his McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri learned just how tricky the mixed conditions were – he drove onto the wet kerb at Turn 3, which sent him into a spin that ended in the barriers.

Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto replicated his error and the Sprint was halted to recover the stricken cars, with race control confirming that there would be a rolling start controlled by Norris.

He sped away from Antonelli at the restart, with the Italian coming under pressure from the second Mercedes of George Russell. While the order remained the same to the chequered flag, Norris struggled with his soft tyres for the final laps, bringing Antonelli threateningly close behind him – he ultimately finished just eight-tenths behind the Sprint winner.

As they crossed the line, home hero Gabriel Bortoleto suffered a massive crash that saw him slam into the inside wall before flying across the circuit to hit another barrier. He thankfully confirmed that he was uninjured.

Oscar Piastri's championship ambitions were thrown off course in Brazil as he found the barrier during the Sprint.

Oscar Piastri dramatically spun into the barrier during the Sprint in Sao Paulo, putting a dent in his hopes of picking up maximum points in a remarkably tight championship battle.

Conditions around Interlagos were treacherous from the formation lap onwards, with parts of the track appearing damp and slippery, making it tricky to find a racing line that was both dry and effective.

This came to a head on Lap 7, when Piastri drifted onto the kerb at Turn 3. The slick surface sent up a spray of water, forcing him into a spin that ended with his McLaren crashing into the wall and out of the Sprint.

There were eerily similar incidents for Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto, both of whom dropped a wheel onto the kerb before finding the barrier. The amount of debris resulted in the red flag being waved, temporarily halting the session.

Click go on the video player above to watch the moment that cost Piastri a handful of points.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Lando Norris came out on top during Sprint Qualifying at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver beating Kimi Antonelli and Oscar Piastri to pole position.

Lando Norris put in an impressive lap to take pole position during Sprint Qualifying at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, the Briton beating Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri to seal P1.

After setting a benchmark with his banker lap during SQ3, Norris went even quicker with his final effort of 1m 09.243s, a time that proved unbeatable to his rivals. Antonelli was the closest challenger, the Silver Arrows racer 0.097s behind as he took the other spot on the front row.

Despite showing good pace during Friday, Piastri had to settle for third, while George Russell added to a decent day for Mercedes in fourth. Aston Martin also enjoyed a solid outing at Interlagos, with Fernando Alonso clinching fifth ahead of Lance Stroll in seventh.

Sandwiched between them was Max Verstappen, the Red Bull man seen seemingly shaking his head in disappointment after crossing the line. Charles Leclerc was eighth for Ferrari, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10.

Lewis Hamilton missed out on SQ3, the Ferrari driver finishing SQ2 in P11. The seven-time World Champion will also be investigated after the session for a yellow flag infringement, with the flags having been thrown when team mate Leclerc suffered a spin.

Joining Hamilton in the elimination zone were Williams' Alex Albon, the Alpine of Pierre Gasly, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman in the Haas.

Hours on from being confirmed to remain with Alpine in 2026, Franco Colapinto ended the session in P16, one place ahead of Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson, while Yuki Tsunoda finished SQ1 in P18 for Red Bull.

Haas' Esteban Ocon wound up in 19th place, and Carlos Sainz had to settle for 20th and last place following a lock-up on his final run in the Williams.

A few hours on from Norris just pipping Piastri to top the timesheets in the weekend's sole practice session, the drivers and teams returned to action for Friday's Sprint Qualifying in order to decide the grid for the penultimate Sprint of the season on Saturday.

Tsunoda – whose running was limited in FP1 following a spin off track – was the first to head out when the 12-minute SQ1 began at 1530 local time, with the medium tyres mandatory for all in the first segment.

Despite a potentially mixed weather forecast for the weekend ahead, conditions were dry and sunny as the action picked up during SQ1. When all 20 drivers had put a lap on the board, it was Norris who had gone quickest on a 1m 09.702s, leading the way from Piastri and Russell.

At the other end of the timesheets, Albon, Ocon, Colapinto, Sainz and Tsunoda were the drivers in the elimination zone as the segment entered into its final minutes. The Ferrari pair also appeared to be struggling for pace, with Hamilton and Leclerc both several tenths away from the top.

While both of the Scuderia's cars improved to slot into sixth and eighth respectively, the track was about to get even busier as the pack all tried to better their efforts and guarantee their place in SQ2.

Albon hauled himself up into the top 10, but Colapinto – recently confirmed to stay at Alpine in 2026 – could only move to P15. The Argentinian was subsequently pushed down to P16 as others improved.

Lawson had also found himself in the drop zone in P17, while Tsunoda ended up in P18. Behind them was Ocon, but perhaps the biggest shock was that Sainz could not move himself forwards after locking up on his last run, leaving the Spaniard – who had missed Thursday's media day due to illness – down in P20.

At the front, Verstappen had slotted into second place, with Norris remaining on top via a lap of 1m 09.627s.

Knocked out: Colapinto, Lawson, Tsunoda, Ocon, Sainz

Another 10 minutes went on the clock for SQ2, in which the medium tyres would again be mandatory. Bortoleto was the first to set a lap in front of his home crowd, while some – including Piastri and Russell – were content to head out on track a little later.

Alonso had put his Aston Martin into P1 after the first round of laps, the two-time World Champion's time of 1m 09.330s giving him an edge of 0.043s over Norris, with Piastri following in third.

The Ferrari pair again looked to be experiencing some tricky moments, with Leclerc and Hamilton both locking up after placing in ninth and 11th respectively. Alongside Hamilton, the drivers at risk of elimination entering into the final minutes were Albon, Gasly, Bearman and Bortoleto.

While Alonso and Piastri opted to remain in the pits as the clock ticked down, the rest of the field battled to improve. However, a spin for Leclerc saw the double yellow flags briefly make an appearance, meaning that some drivers had to abort their final efforts.

Despite this moment, Leclerc made it through in P9 – but team mate Hamilton was not so fortunate, the seven-time World Champion exiting in P11 after not making it to the line in time to start his final run. It was also confirmed that Hamilton will be investigated after the session for a yellow flag infringement at Turn 10.

The other names in the bottom five – Albon, Gasly, Bortoleto and Bearman – were also ultimately unable to get themselves out of the danger zone.

Knocked out: Hamilton, Albon, Gasly, Bortoleto, Bearman

As the dust settled on SQ2, it was time for the eight-minute top-10 shootout of SQ3. With the soft tyre the mandatory compound for this segment, Norris was looking quick from the off, the Briton going fastest on his banker lap of 1m 09.271s.

While Norris led the way from Antonelli, Russell, Piastri – three-tenths away from his team mate – and Leclerc, different strategies were at play for the rest of the pack, with the likes of Verstappen and Alonso opting for only one flying run.

McLaren, meanwhile, embarked on a cooldown lap before going for a final effort. Elsewhere, Verstappen appeared disappointed as he crossed the line in sixth, the Red Bull driver shaking his head, while Russell took fourth to demote Alonso to fifth.

Norris seemed clear at the top on a lap of 1m 09.243s, Piastri having been unable to beat that time – but all eyes were then on Antonelli, with the young Mercedes driver looking to be on a quick lap.

While he missed out to Norris by 0.097s – meaning that the British driver had secured his first Sprint pole of the campaign and fourth of his career – the Italian still managed to slot between the McLaren pair in P2.

At the other end of the top 10, Stroll claimed seventh for his best Sprint starting slot of the season, followed by Leclerc, Hadjar and Hulkenberg.

""It was a little bit tougher than I would have liked,"" Norris said of his session. ""It was close between a lot of cars – Mercedes were quick on the soft [tyre]. It's always tricky when you've got the medium and the soft and knowing how much more to push, or not push sometimes. We did the job we needed to do, which was to be fastest today. It was trickier than Mexico. I've not been feeling quite as comfortable, but therefore it's a great result.""

With the grid decided, the drivers will line up for the Sprint at 1100 local time on Saturday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri started the Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend closely matched.

Lando Norris topped the timesheets during Friday's one and only practice session for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, leading the way from McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg.

With the Sprint format returning for the fifth time this season, the drivers and teams had just one hour of practice to get to grips with the track and dial in their cars before Sprint Qualifying takes place later in the day.

Unsurprisingly, that led to a queue of cars forming at the end of the pit lane for the session start at just after 1130 local time, with the entire 20-strong field beginning their practice programmes on the hard compound tyre.

Drama ensued inside the opening 10 minutes, though, when Yuki Tsunoda lost control of his Red Bull exiting the Descida do Lago complex and slid into the barriers – multiple hits causing damage to the front and rear.

While Tsunoda managed to recover and limp back to the pits, it was an early blow to his weekend chances at Interlagos, given that mechanics would be spending a chunk of the practice hour carrying out car repairs.

Once every driver had got a lap on the board, Mercedes man George Russell led the way with a 1m 11.188s, just ahead of reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, followed by the Williams of Carlos Sainz and the two Ferraris.

Meanwhile, the tight, twisty nature of the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace was highlighted through a series of traffic-related moments – Kimi Antonelli, Isack Hadjar, Russell and Norris all shown getting held up during their hard-tyre runs.

As the session developed and drivers sampled the softer tyres available, a flurry of green and purple sector times led to plenty of leaderboard movement, and a new benchmark time of 1m 09.975s from Norris on mediums.

Piastri was just a few hundredths away from his team mate in P2, as the pair continue their battle for the Drivers' Championship title, with fellow contender Verstappen looking set to join them before backing out of his late soft-tyre run.

Kick Sauber made an eye-catching start to the weekend, with Hulkenberg and home favourite Gabriel Bortoleto classifying third and fifth respectively, sandwiching the lead Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.

Russell dropped back to sixth position after his early phase at the front on hard tyres, just over half a second off the pace, from Sainz, Hadjar, Mercedes team mate Antonelli and Liam Lawson in the other Racing Bulls machine.

Alex Albon placed 12th in his Williams, ahead of Haas duo Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman, Lance Stroll's Aston Martin, newly re-signed Alpine driver Franco Colapinto and the aforementioned Verstappen, who did not get a representative time on the board.

It was a low-key session for Ferrari, with Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton – who spun exiting Mergulho in the closing stages – sticking to hard tyres on their way to P18 and P19 respectively, in front of only Tsunoda.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Interlagos paddock and ponder any set-up changes before taking to the track again in Sprint Qualifying, which is scheduled to get under way at 1530 local time.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

McLaren's Lando Norris controlled the opening lap of the Sprint in Sao Paulo to retain his lead.

Polesitter Lando Norris got the perfect launch on the opening lap of the Sprint around Interlagos, managing a damp track to charge away from Kimi Antonelli and Oscar Piastri.

While earlier rainfall wasn't as dramatic as anticipated, the track surface was still slick in parts at the beginning of the Sprint, presenting a unique challenge for the drivers.

Norris executed a strong start while Antonelli had a slower reaction, putting him under pressure from the second McLaren of Piastri. The Mercedes was able to defend well despite weaving on the damp circuit, ultimately keeping the Australian in third position.

Further behind, there was contact between Liam Lawson and the Haas of Ollie Bearman, with the latter sent into a spin that forced him down the order.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from Friday practice and Sprint Qualifying at the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

McLaren started Friday strongly in Brazil, with their drivers vying for the top spot in practice. The good news for the papaya team is that the two team mates were evenly matched, and head and shoulders faster than the rest of the field. In the end Norris edged it, and he did likewise at the start of Sprint Qualifying. Piastri was pushing him close, though, always within a few hundredths. But in SQ3 when the soft tyres went on, Norris excelled – and Piastri could not quite find the same pace on the C4 rubber, dropping behind Antonelli too.

Lando Norris, 1st, 1:09.243

""A good start to the weekend today. The team did a good job to get us in a decent position, and some nice laps were enough to secure the Sprint Pole. There's still a little bit of work for us to do ahead of Qualifying tomorrow to get us even more comfortable in the car, but we're in a good spot. We'll focus first on the Sprint tomorrow, which could be interesting given the weather, but we'll just go out and focus on having the best Sprint we can before turning our attention to Quali.”

Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:09.428

""P3, a decent session and day overall. The car was a little bit tricky in Sprint Quali, but I feel much happier today than I have over the last couple of weeks, which is good. Just some things to tidy up to put us in the best position for tomorrow, but ultimately, I am happy.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A good start to the weekend. Lando and Oscar were very competitive and very close to each other today, which is a solid starting point for the rest of the event. That said, there is a threat from Mercedes and Red Bull being very competitive, not to mention Alonso, who was equally fast throughout SQ. We know that the weather conditions are very uncertain tomorrow: we will have to be perfect in every operation, both on the track and in the garage, to score as many points as possible.”

Mercedes looked heavier on fuel than some of their rivals in FP1, and as such, their true form remained a little unknown heading into Sprint Qualifying. What they unleashed in the second session was a very fast car, with both drivers making it to SQ3 – albeit after Antonelli scraped out of SQ1 after getting caught out with traffic. But in the top 10 shootout, their car came alive on the softs. Antonelli grabbed an impressive second row berth, having the beating of his team mate on both flying laps in SQ3 despite next to no experience of this track.

George Russell, 4th, 1:09.495

""P2 and P4 are good positions for us to be starting from tomorrow. We had strong pace across the whole of Sprint Qualifying and the car balance felt good. That is encouraging for us given how close the fight for P2 in the Constructor's Championship is. Hopefully we can carry that speed and momentum into the rest of the weekend.

""The weather forecast for tomorrow shows that we may have rain on the way. Even if that is the case, I am confident that we will have the car underneath us to fight with our rivals and to score important points in the Sprint. From there, it is onwards to Qualifying where we will be aiming for a similar performance as we've put together today.""

Kimi Antonelli, 2nd, 1:09.340

""Today's Sprint Qualifying session was really good. SQ1 was a little bit more stressful than expected, as we finished it in P15, but the car felt good and I was confident my lap was going to be good enough to get through. I was able to build from there and find a good rhythm for SQ2 and SQ3.

""My first push lap in SQ3 was looking really strong but a mistake at turn 10 likely cost me pole position for tomorrow's Sprint. Many other drivers had moments though, so the conditions clearly weren't easy; it's a difficult track too but very enjoyable to drive. P2 is a good position to start from tomorrow and I want to thank the team, both in Brackley and Brixworth, for giving us the car to perform as we did today.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""Today was a very solid effort by the team and drivers. Considering Kimi hasn't driven here before, a front row position after one hour of practice is very impressive. George also backed that up with yet another decent performance to put both cars in the top five.

""FP1 was a relatively smooth session but we knew we had work to do. Our performance looked solid on the Hard compound in the early running, but we struggled on the Medium tyre. The engineers did a good job to put the car in the right window for Sprint Qualifying and whilst it's not perfect, it was clearly an improvement. We saw how difficult it was for every driver to put the lap together in SQ3. George had a moment in turn six on his first push lap; that put a fair bit of temperature into the tyres which ultimately led to a slide in turn 10 and cost him a shot at the front row. Kimi looked set to improve on his final run but locked a wheel into turn 10 which cost him time and led to a messy final turn.

""All the weekend's points still lie ahead of us so whilst we're off to a decent start, we will be taking nothing for granted. We will likely see some challenging conditions over the next two days so we will need to be at our best and ensure we maximise each of the remaining three sessions over Saturday and Sunday.""

Aston Martin were the only midfield team to get both cars into the top 10 shootout, as they came alive in Brazil. The car looked quick in practice but was electric in Sprint Qualifying, with Alonso winding up on top of the pile in SQ2. He qualified fifth, ahead of Verstappen in an impressive display. Stroll made SQ3 for the first time since China as he bagged his second-best one-lap performance across both Qualifying formats of the year.

Fernando Alonso, 5th, 1:09.496

""It feels great to be back here at Interlagos. This circuit has always been very special to me. The car felt good in FP1, and to reach SQ3 this afternoon and finish P5 is a strong result. Today was a good boost for the team and a positive way to start the race weekend. Hopefully we can keep this level of performance tomorrow, but you never know what can happen here.""

Lance Stroll, 7th, 1:09.671

""I love coming back to this track. There is so much passion for the sport in Brazil and the fans are amazing. It's just a lot of fun to drive here and we got some nice laps in today. The car was feeling good and we will be starting the Sprint tomorrow morning from P7. It's still early in the weekend and we will see how the rest of the weekend goes. Hopefully we can fight for some points tomorrow and there could be some rain so anything is possible.""

Red Bull had a tricky first practice session, with Tsunoda spinning into the barriers early on. That cost the Japanese racer plenty of track time, and he was lucky not to do worse damage to his RB21. Meanwhile, Verstappen was also struggling, running wide and unhappy with the set-up of his car. The Dutchman seemed slightly more content at the beginning of Sprint Qualifying on the medium tyre, but his pace fell away on the soft tyre in SQ3 as he called the car “undriveable”. Starting sixth, he has his work cut out to prevent both McLaren drivers pulling further away in the championship.

Max Verstappen, 6th, 1:09.580

""Today has not been our day both this morning during FP1 and this afternoon for the Sprint Quali. I had a lot of vibration in the car and general ride problems which really isn't what we want, I wouldn't say that it is any worse than yesterday, but we are definitely suffering with a lack of grip. Our middle sector wasn't great either and I struggled to get the car to turn but at the same time I also couldn't really rely on the rears, so the overall performance is quite poor I would say. We are slightly lacking something and I don't expect that it will be miles better in the wet but let's see, tomorrow is a new day and you never know what a change in weather could bring.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 18th, 1:10.692

""The lap itself actually felt okay and I couldn't see a mistake in it, so it's a shame to not go beyond SQ1. I struggled with the grip throughout the lap and in practice also, which has been challenge for us to get on top of so far. Of course, we lost a little bit of time in practice which didn't help but it didn't make a major difference to the performance in SQ1. Actually what we got out of FP1 in the end was good, I got time in both the long and short runs which we'll take into tomorrow. We'll have to see what the weather brings, it could be mixed conditions and I don't have a preference either way.""

Pierre Wache, Technical Director

“It was a difficult day today. To be honest the Sprint format always throws up difficulties across the weekend. The car isn't behaving as we expected here, especially on the Soft tyre. On that compound the car looks like something is wrong with it and is not performing. We are looking into a lot things overnight to see if we have to change something. We are investigating what the issue is, it's across both cars and we are aiming to have the car in a better window for the rest of the weekend. This is all a good learning for tomorrow, for Qualifying and then for the race. Finally, a well done to the Team in the garage who did a very good job to repair Yuki's car so quickly in FP1, to give him the chance to get back out there and collect important learnings.”

Ferrari opted not to run the medium or the soft tyre in FP1, instead concentrating on one set of hards. Hamilton also spun late on, managing an impressive full 720-degree turn. But that left them short of data, but with extra tyres in the bank for the rest of the weekend. Both drivers seemed to lack pace, and both locked up. The Ferrari just did not look a fast car out there, with Hamilton missing out in SQ2 after failing to make it to the line to start his final lap – not helped by a spin from his team mate bringing out the yellow flags. Leclerc did make SQ3, but he had no better pace on the softs than he did on the mediums.

Charles Leclerc, 8th, 1:09.725

""It was a tricky qualifying for us today, from SQ1 to SQ3. The car felt alright, but we didn't have the performance we needed, so we have some work to do and improvements to make going forward. I don't think that we are off in terms of set-up, so we will see how things go. We will be back for the Sprint and try to turn things around tomorrow.""

Lewis Hamilton, 11th, 1:09.811

""Despite everyone's best efforts, today obviously didn't work out as planned due to events that were ultimately out of our control. We've made good progress in recent races and built solid momentum, so it was a shame not to see that reflected in today's results, but I'm confident we'll recover. The focus now is learning from the day, and coming back stronger for the rest of the weekend.""

It was a mixed bag for Racing Bulls in Brazil. Lawson was very frustrated to miss out in SQ1, as he seemed to get caught out by traffic. Hadjar made it all the way to SQ3, though, in a good showing. He qualified ninth, so will start just one place outside the points tomorrow. But much will depend on the weather – and the Frenchman is in a good place to capitalise on any chaos ahead.

Isack Hadjar, 9th, 1:09.775

“We had quite a good Sprint Qualifying and everything went well before SQ3, where we committed to only one final lap on the Soft tyre. It was a bit of a learning lap as it was the first time we tried this tyre here. Normally, you just expect more grip on a softer compound but it seemed like it was hard to finish a lap on it, so overall I felt more comfortable on the Mediums. Tomorrow in the Sprint we start just one place away from points, so we'll try our best to gain a few places.”

Liam Lawson, 17th, 1:10.666

“The car has been very quick today, however we didn't complete a second lap in SQ1. We came out of the garage for the second run and everyone was slowing down at the pit exit, meaning I ran out of time. We'll of course review what happened and learn from it as a team, however it's going to be tough starting from so far behind. That being said, it's important to take the positives from having a quick car ahead of Qualifying tomorrow.""

Mattia Spini, Chief Race Engineer

“Interlagos may be a short track, but it puts constant stress on drivers and tyres, with the majority of the lap spent cornering, even at full throttle. Both drivers came up to speed quickly in FP1 on the Hard compound, adapting well to the steep track evolution. The later runs on Medium tyres were within the expected performance window by the end of the session. We made some setup tuning before Sprint Qualifying but unfortunately, we did not give Liam a clean SQ1; we will make sure to revise what we could have done better for the future. Isack was immediately comfortable with the car balance on the Medium compound, progressing confidently through the sessions to reach SQ3, he struggled a bit more on the Soft compound, but still ended up in a strong P9.”

Both Kick Sauber drivers made it out of SQ1, but home favourite Bortoleto could get no further than that. Hulkenberg could, the German making SQ3 for the second straight Sprint event. He will line up 10th tomorrow, so within touching distance of a point or two. It might be harder for Bortoleto to score, but he will hope to have learned plenty by the time Qualifying rolls around.

Nico Hulkenberg, 10th, 1:09.935

“Overall, it was a clean session. Shootouts can always be tense, and this place isn't the easiest to navigate in terms of traffic, but I think we got the most out of it today. We've been working hard behind the scenes to unlock more performance, and hopefully that carries through into tomorrow. Points are the goal, as always. The midfield is incredibly tight this season, so every opportunity really counts.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 14th, 1:09.923

“Q1 was quite good: we managed to do a clean lap, and I was happy with how everything came together. In Q2, I just lacked a bit in sector one on my first push, and while the second lap felt better, my tyres were not quite there anymore. That's on me – I should've tried to get more out of that first push. Still, it's my first time driving on this track and I'm really enjoying it. The atmosphere here is amazing: the fans have been giving so much support, it's incredible. I wanted to give them a bit more today, but we'll keep pushing and look to deliver tomorrow and on Sunday.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“We had a very smooth run through the day, and the team executed the program cleanly in FP1, which set us up well for sprint qualifying. It's worth remembering that this is Gabi's first time at Interlagos, so with just one session to prepare, he handled it exceptionally well. With a bit more track experience, he might have reached SQ3, but P14 is still a rock-solid result. Nico also delivered a composed session, bringing the car into P10 for the Sprint. Both drivers managed the pressure brilliantly, and Gabi in particular showed great composure and maturity at his first home Grand Prix. He didn't let the moment get to him and drove beautifully. The weather looks unpredictable for tomorrow, so it promises to be an exciting Sprint. Racing in Interlagos is never boring and always good for some surprises.”

Williams were quick in practice and looked in the fight for the top 10 today. But instead, their form deserted them when it mattered. Neither driver set an impressive first flying lap in SQ1, but while Albon managed to improve late on, Sainz locked up into Turn 1 of his final lap and ran wide, ending any chance he had of making it through. But in SQ2, Albon just did not have the pace to make the top 10 at a track he has struggled at in the past couple of seasons.

Alex Albon, 12th, 1:09.813

""I think we knew we were going to struggle a bit at this circuit. There's a lot of lap time just in getting the balance of the car right, but I don't know if it's totally achievable. I don't know if it's a little bit more fundamental in the car, however we'll try and fix it between the Sprint and qualifying tomorrow. It was tricky but I don't think we're in a bad place. The positives are that we improved the car a lot from practice to Sprint qualifying, and we're heading in the right direction.""

Carlos Sainz, 20th, 1:11.120

""We simply didn't do a good Sprint qualifying today. My first run was messy with traffic and getting the tyres up to temperature but the second run we made our life more difficult and almost didn't get two laps in. Ultimately, I finish this session not knowing the limit or performance of the car, so it's not ideal. Looking at FP1, I know there was more in it, so we'll learn from today and hopefully execute a better session tomorrow.""

Colapinto was celebrating the news he will be on the grid next year, after Alpine opted to retain his services for 2026. But despite the pressure to impress being off, the Argentine racer could not make it out of SQ1 in Brazil. Gasly, though, looked very quick, the Frenchman tending to often go well here. He made it into SQ2 comfortably, but once there got hampered by the late yellow flags and thus lost out on the chance to improve.

Pierre Gasly, 13th, 1:09.852

“On one side, I am very happy, on the other I am very frustrated with the end result in Sprint Qualifying. Today's pace and overall performance was good and the car was feeling a lot better than it has for quite a long time. That is positive and gives us some things to look at and try to understand. We definitely had the pace for the top ten today. In SQ1 we were fast, then SQ2 we were improving before a yellow flag for the Ferrari ruined our last push lap. It's a bit frustrating as it's the first time for a few months that I have had a good feeling in the car and the potential to put it in the top ten. We will focus on tomorrow and take the positives. We have the speed for Qualifying, in the dry, and probably in the wet, if it rains. I feel we can be in the mix so we will give it another go and really push for a better result.”

Franco Colapinto, 16th, 1:10.441

“Firstly, it was nice to see so many fans in the grandstands today. As drivers, we can really feel and feed off the support, especially after the positive news earlier today about continuing for next season with the team. After that, though, focus and attention quickly switched to what's happening on track and trying to maximise the performance this weekend. It was super tight out there with fine margins throughout the leaderboard, which is to be expected with the short nature of this track. I feel like there is more in myself and the package and that we're looking more competitive here this weekend, at least from today's running. The forecast tomorrow looks mixed, so it could be a lot of fun and we'll be prepared whatever the weather.”

Not to be for Haas in Brazil, after their impressive exploits in Mexico City. Ocon could not extract much pace from the VF-25 and exited at the first time of asking and while Bearman made SQ2, he could go no further – one of many drivers hampered by the late yellow flags for the spinning Ferrari of Leclerc. But with the weather set to play a part tomorrow, there is still a chance of pulling off a result, with both drivers tending to go well in the wet.

Esteban Ocon, 19th, 1:10.872

“I had the wrong track position for a lot of it. My first run wasn't very clean, and there was traffic in places, but on my second run, I've never overtaken so many cars before – it must've been like 10 or 12. There is a lot more pace in the car, so it's been a disappointing session, and we need to review. The weekend is far from over, though, so we'll bounce back tomorrow.”

Oliver Bearman, 15th, 1:09.946

“My first lap in SQ2 was okay. I lost a bit of time at Turn 4, so going into my second lap I was actually quite confident because I had a really good feeling in the car. On my second lap, I lost a tenth and a half, and we know how tight the margins are around here, so it's a shame. I think there's a lot of potential in the car, so we just need to fine-tune things tomorrow.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“That was a very disappointing Sprint Qualifying. After FP1, even though it didn't look great on the timesheets, driver feedback was actually okay, but we knew SQ1 was going to be tight. We don't quite understand what happened with Esteban's second run, he had traffic from Turn 8 onwards, but he hadn't made any improvement up to that point either.

“Ollie did a very good job in SQ1 to finish P6. In SQ2, his first lap – other than Turn 4 – would've been enough to get into SQ3, but sadly he carried a bit too much speed and got on the kerb, losing two and a half tenths, which is a shame. I think the good thing is that the car seems to be able to get into the top 10 in terms of potential, so we can fight for points in the main race on Sunday. Starting P15 and P19 for the Sprint will be difficult, but with wet weather expected, there's an opportunity as well.”

Simone Berra, Chief Engineer

“Following the lap times we saw in the short qualifying session today, there seem to be two different types of possible strategy in terms of compound choice for tomorrow's sprint race. The times show that the performance gap between the medium and the soft is very little, which make both compounds a valid option for tomorrow's race.

""The compact nature of the track here is one reason why that gap is so small, as well as the fact that the teams have only had a very limited chance so far to run the soft tyre and work out how to maximise its potential. The drivers starting the sprint on the C4 should have an initial grip advantage but will have to manage degradation at the end of the race.

""As for the hard tyre. the results we saw with it in FP1 were quite varied and seemed to largely depend on the different setups used by the teams during the only session so far that it was run. Some drivers managed to get good performance out of it while others struggled to find a satisfactory level of grip.

""Even though the trio of compounds selected for this year are harder than those nominated in 2024, the lap times in FP1 were up to seven-tenths of a second faster. Asphalt temperature was definitely one factor influencing this, which was lower than last year.

""The support races are helping to provide significant track evolution as expected, which could nonetheless be neutralised tomorrow morning if the predicted rain arrives. Strong gusts of wind are expected as well that could also drop temperatures further – which might push the teams towards using the softer compounds for the rest of the weekend.”

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Oscar Piastri crashed out of the Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix after six laps, with the McLaren driver subsequently losing ground to team mate Lando Norris in the championship standings.

Oscar Piastri has given his take on the crash that put him out of the Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the Australian labelling the incident a “silly mistake”.

After making a clean start from P3 on the grid, Piastri was still in third place on Lap 6 when he appeared to take too much kerb – with parts of the track remaining damp following rainfall earlier in the day – which sent him into the barriers at Turn 3.

This was followed by two further crashes at the same corner for Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and the Alpine of Franco Colapinto just moments later. And while Hulkenberg was able to continue on back to the pits, Colapinto joined Piastri in finding himself out of the race.

The red flags were thrown after the incidents while Piastri's McLaren team mate Lando Norris went on to take victory when the action resumed, meaning that the Briton has extended his championship lead over Piastri to nine points.

Sharing his reflections on what happened, Piastri explained: “I just dipped a wheel on the white line of the kerb and around I went.

“A silly mistake really, an unfortunate mistake, so that's it.”

Speaking separately to Sky Sports F1, the 24-year-old added that his focus ahead of Qualifying later on Saturday would be to “try to put this behind [me]”.

""There's a lot more points on offer tomorrow, so the better job I can do in Qualifying to get a good starting spot, the better it will be,” he explained.

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Mercedes enjoyed a strong result in the Sprint ahead of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with Kimi Antonelli and George Russell both finishing in the top three.

Kimi Antonelli has admitted that “confidence is high” at Mercedes despite the competitive nature of the field, after he was able to challenge Lando Norris during the Sprint at Interlagos and secure a P2 finish.

The 19-year-old missed out on pole position by just 0.097s to the lead McLaren, and after a shaky start to the Sprint he was able to settle into second place around the damp circuit.

Following a red flag interlude, Antonelli came under pressure from his team mate George Russell, but the lack of dry patches away from the racing line aided him in defending his position, and he set his sights on a struggling Norris.

With the McLaren on old soft tyres, Antonelli was able to get within DRS range of the Sprint leader for the final five laps, and although he couldn't find a way past, he crossed the line less than a second behind Norris.

“It was a very fun race,” he said. “There were very tricky conditions, especially at the beginning. We tried to keep the pressure on Lando and just came short but tyre degradation was quite big and wind was picking up during the race so it was a struggle.

“The confidence is high but the field is so tight. At the end yesterday, it was really hard to put a lap together and I believe everyone made a few little mistakes so we'll see today what we can do. Hopefully we can achieve the same result or even better.”

It was an encouraging result for Mercedes as a whole, with Russell following closely behind in third position to put them on the front foot ahead of an unpredictable Qualifying hour.

The Briton explained: “It was a good race for us both – Kimi did a great job and obviously put Lando under a bit of pressure. P2, P3 was a really good result but we need to try and do the same again this afternoon.

“Qualifying is so tight. It's very difficult to overtake at the moment so that's going to be key.”

Questioned on whether the relative lack of rainfall had helped the team take more lessons into the rest of the weekend, Russell replied: “No, it's so different when you're doing Qualifying laps versus the consecutive laps. There was a lot of tyre degradation there so at the end it was a bit difficult and I think Lando was struggling.

“We feel good. The temperatures are cool and we know that's how we like it so let's see what we can do later.”

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Mercedes duo Antonelli and Russell hit the Fanzone stage

2025 Sao Paulo GP: Bearman and Ocon meet the fans at Interlagos

Aston Martin enjoyed a superb Sprint Qualifying as Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll both secured spots in the top 10.

Fernando Alonso was keen to keep motivation high after Aston Martin achieved a strong result in Sprint Qualifying at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the Spaniard taking P5 on the grid.

It's been a frustrating season for the Silverstone-based team as they have struggled for momentum, but they are nevertheless locked in a close midfield battle with three points separating them from sixth-placed Racing Bulls, and Haas a further seven behind.

Aston Martin were undoubtedly the strongest of the three in Sprint Qualifying at Interlagos as Lance Stroll finished two positions behind his team mate, providing them with a great opportunity to bring home important points in the Sprint.

Reflecting on the day, Alonso said: “The car felt good in FP1 – we were P4 and now we are P5, so it definitely seems like we started the weekend in the window of the operation of the car.

“With only one Free Practice, obviously if you start on the right foot then everything becomes easier.

“I think today is a good boost for everyone. We are not giving up, and let's keep trying every day.

“If it was dry, then it would probably be easier to hold the positions, but we expect a wet Saturday so anything can happen tomorrow.”

With a high risk of rain and wind forecast for the Sprint, the typical order could easily be shaken up, but Stroll admitted that “the plan” among the team is to maintain their hard-fought positions from Sprint Qualifying.

“The car was feeling good and I had some nice laps so I enjoyed it,” the Canadian concluded. “It's still just Sprint Qualifying so we'll see tomorrow.”

The former couple met in early 2021 while collaborating on music, and their joint single ""Flames"" dropped just weeks later.

	Mod Sun is looking back on his high-profile engagement to Avril Lavigne — and how the fallout helped him grow.


	Appearing on the Nov. 6 episode of Bunnie Xo's Dumb Blonde podcast, the multi-genre artist opened up about the relationship's end with surprising clarity, saying: “We're two different people, but I think I had a great influence on her.” He added that the “Sk8er Boi” singer helped him “grow up,” and that he's now more secure in his identity than ever before.


	The former couple met in early 2021 while collaborating on music, and their joint single “Flames” dropped just weeks later. A whirlwind romance followed, with Mod proposing in Paris in April 2022. Less than a year later, the pair called off the engagement in February 2023.

	Though Lavigne has remained publicly silent on the split, Mod has continued to speak openly. In July 2023, he released the breakup track “Strangers,” with lyrics detailing the rise and fall of their relationship. The Paris-shot music video — filmed in the same city where he proposed — added further emotional weight.


	On the podcast, Mod said that his perspective on the breakup has shifted over time: “We're two different people, but I think I had a great influence on her.” 




	He continued, “Like now, I'm very secure of who I am, because I've been lost in the last three years of wondering, ‘Where do I fit in?'”


	He added later, “If we had done this talk three months ago, I might've been like, ‘F— that person,' but now… If I run into you? It's all love.”


	He also spoke about developing greater empathy in the aftermath, saying, “When someone does you wrong, stop thinking, ‘You did me dirty, and I'm out for revenge.' Step in their position.”


	Lavigne was briefly linked to rapper Tyga following the split, but the pair separated in mid-2023. Mod, meanwhile, focused on his tour and healing. “Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing,” he wrote on Instagram days after the breakup. “I just know there's a plan for it all.”

No broke boys? No new friends?

	The nominations for the 68th annual Grammy Awards were announced Friday morning (Nov. 7), with the Recording Academy once again recognizing the dance/electronic genre across four categories: best dance electronic recording, best dance/electronic album, best dance pop recording and best remixed recording.


	These categories welcome back a list of familiar faces, specifically in Fred again.., Kaytranada, Disclosure and Skrillex. These artists have tallied a combined 49 nominations and 13 wins, with Skrillex arguably being the Academy's most loved dance artist, with his nine wins going back to 2012. (Meanwhile Fred again.. has two awards, as does Kaytranda, while Disclosure has been iced out of any wins thus far during their storied career.)


	This repeat pool of nominations suggests that the Grammys have found a cadre of dance/electronic artists that are not only worthy, but with whom the Academy feels comfortable returning to again and again. Fred, Skrillex, Kaytranada and Disclosure make up nearly the entire dance/electronic recording category, which is rounded out by Tame Impala's “End of Summer,” a worthy track that carves out space for recognition of the artist's new electronic-focused album Deadbeat, which was released after the 2026 eligibility window closed.


	Elsewhere, the categories bring in less frequently nominated artists, including FKA twigs and PinkPantheress, both welcome sights to see nominated for dance/electronic album, a category that also includes fellow Grammy favs Rüfüs du Sol, a group that's aggregated six nominations and one win over its career.


	While none of these nominations comes as a true shock, being that there are only five slots in each category, as always, there were also a few surprises sprinkled across the categories. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises in the dance/electronic nominations for the 68th annual Grammy Awards.


	The culture-permeating earworm that unseated Marshmello and Kane Brown's “Miles on It” from its long reign at No. 1 on Hot Dance/Electronic songs seemed like an obvious choice for a best dance pop recording nominee. “No Broke Boys,” the dance world's unofficial song of the summer, started as an edit heard during Disco Lines' set at EDC Las Vegas in May, getting an official release as a new single with fresh vocals from Tinashe that meshed her 2024 original with Disco Lines' bouncy beat. But just as the song's lyrics go, in terms of 2026 Grammy recognition, there were indeed “no new friends.”


	The Chicago-born producer and bona fide global phenom was shut out of the 2025 Grammys during his breakout year — a year during which he also released his Grammys-eligible debut album Comfort in Chaos. The academy might have made up for the snub with a 2026 nod, particularly given that Summit's eligible January track “Focus” featuring Cloves marked some of his best and most mature work to date. But even as Summit headlines actual football stadiums, he's apparently and surprisingly still not a focus for the academy.


	The dance world rejoiced when Jamie xx released In Waves, his long-awaited follow-up to his 2015 classic In Colour, in September 2024. While this latter album was nominated for best dance/electronic album in 2016, In Waves didn't get that acknowledgement, a snub considering how well the project was received and how great it is. With In Waves singles also being submitted for best dance/electronic recording, it's surprising that voters didn't manage to carve out any space for the project or the beloved producer, especially as the academy makes Grammy darlings out of fellow left-of-center indie dance producers like Fred again.. and Kaytranada.


	We're not surprised that the Canadian-Haitian producer is nominated in best dance/electronic recording this year, as anything Kaytra does has the Midas touch. The surprise is that the producer is only nominated for best dance/electronic recording for “Space Invader,” given that the album that the track comes from, Ain't No Damn Way! is excellent start to finish. One wonders the factors weighed by voters as they sent a single from the album through to the nominations pool, but not the album it came from.


	The Australian producer specializes in, and in fact helped form, the kind of slinky, acid-ey new wave of tech house that's been one of the dance world's dominant genres for the past several years. One would think that voters might acknowledge Dolla for that contribution, particularly as his hypnotic February single with Daya, “Dreamin',” was rinsed by DJs around the world this year. This accomplishment happened in tandem with the producer rising to festival headliner status while also pushing his name and dance music at large further into mainstream consciousness via his A+ contribution to the F1 The Album film soundtrack, “No Room for a Saint.” But at the 2026 Grammys there was apparently indeed no room.


	Amid her breakout year, the dance world favorite released some of her finest work to date on her 2024 album Dotr. Exploring the experience of grief in a way few artists are able or willing to do, a nomination for the album would have further established the Oregon-born, Texas-based and fully globe-trotting artist as a dance world force, although she'll no doubt continue being so without the nod.


	Pop divas are no stranger to the dance categories, with Britney Spears, Madonna, Beyoncé, Cher, Rihanna, Lady Gaga and more making appearances in the dance/electronic album and dance/electronic recording categories since they were introduced in 2005 and 1998, respectively. But never has queen diva Mariah Carey shown up in these categories, until now. Kaytanada's slinky, sexy remix of Carey's 2005 anthem “Don't Forget About Us” brings Carey (who has five Grammy wins to her name) to the dance field, also marking the first remix from UMG's catalog division UMe to ever be nominated.


	Longtime dance world fav Chris Lake did get a 2026 nomination for his boss remix of The Chemical Brothers' “Galvanize,” but one thought he might also get the nod for best dance/electronic album for his July LP Chemistry, his first ever studio album after a more than 20-year career. Apparently the project, excellent start to finish, didn't quite alchemize with voters.


	Perhaps it's not actually that much of a surprise, but three years into its existence the best dance pop recording category is basically entirely dominated by pop stars, with Zara Larsson, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco, Tate McRae, PinkPantheress and Lady Gaga getting 2026 nominations. Given that the dance/electronic fields have historically under-recognized female producers, seeing female artists dominate this category is a welcome development, although this category more and more feels like a space for bona fide pop stars who don't totally inhabit the dance world to just submit their most dance-centric output.


	The Australian producer is in the midst of her breakout moment, an achievement she's been working towards for years and which she has finally and deservedly realized with her August album I Love My Computer, easily one of the year's best dance/electronic albums. Awards in her home country have met this moment, with Ninajirachi being nominated for a host of Australian awards including the ARIA Awards,  the NSW Music Prize and the Australian Music Prize, the latter of which she won this week. A Grammy nomination would've brought her breakout buzz to a new level while delivering some fresh energy to the nomination fields, but alas, no love.

	“Dear Auckland, I've done everything I can,” he wrote on Instagram. “I just can't shake it. It breaks my heart, I've probably missed three shows in the last decade. I pride myself on showing up no matter what. Just couldn't do it this time. Please forgive me.”


	Fans reported that they didn't discover news of the cancellation until arriving at the venue. The late notice left many frustrated and disappointed, particularly as some had travelled long distances to attend Jelly Roll's first-ever New Zealand performance.


	The cancelled concert was set to wrap Jelly Roll's tour across Australia and New Zealand, which marked the country-rock star's first-ever visit to the region. The run included back-to-back shows at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena (Oct. 28–29), a sold-out night at Sydney's Qudos Bank Arena (Nov. 4), and an Adelaide show at AEC Theatre (Oct. 26). He also headlined the inaugural Strummingbird Festival on the Sunshine Coast (Oct. 25), followed by dates in Newcastle (Nov. 1) and Perth (Nov. 2).

	











	In 2023, his album Whitsitt Chapel peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and in 2024, his follow-up Beautifully Broken debuted at No. 1 — marking his first chart-topping release on the all-genre tally. He has also earned eight consecutive No. 1 singles on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, including fan favourites like “Heart of Stone,” “I Am Not Okay,” and “Liar,” the latter of which held the top spot for six weeks.


	Live Nation have issued a statement on the show's cancellation, saying: “We regret to announce the Jelly Roll Down Under 2025 Tour tonight at The Outer Fields at Western Springs in Auckland will no longer go ahead due to illness.  


	“All ticket holders will receive an automatic full refund. For any further refund enquiries please contact your point of purchase. We thank the fans for their understanding, and we look forward to welcoming Jelly Roll in future.”

	As artificial intelligence becomes less discernible and more prevalent, Vince Gilligan is setting an example about transparency in Hollywood.


	The Pluribus creator, whose new show premiered the first two episodes Friday on Apple TV+, made sure to note in the credits of the post-apocalyptic sci-fi series that the production did not rely on AI.


	“This show was made by humans,” reads the credits, following a list of acknowledgments from the producers.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In Pluribus, Rhea Seehorn plays Albuquerque author Carol Sturka, one of 12 people on Earth who is immune to an extraterrestrial virus that transforms everyone in the world into a relentlessly optimistic hive mind.

	











	Gilligan previously slammed AI as he discussed the series. “I have not used ChatGPT, because as of yet, no one has held a shotgun to my head and made me do it,” he told Polygon.


	“I will never use it. No offense to anyone who does,” added Gilligan. “I really wasn't thinking about AI [when I wrote Pluribus], because this was about eight or 10 years ago.”


	Meanwhile, Coca-Cola has faced backlash this week for another AI-generated holiday campaign, and the entertainment industry has expressed concern over AI creations like Tilly Norwood replacing human actors and other crew members.

It's time for the WGA and all writers to stop viewing AI as the bogeyman.  It has it's uses – and they are allmost all non-creative uses – that are no different than a word processor or grammar check only more sophisticated.  This conversation has been totally hypocritical.  Is AI potentially problematic? Yep.  But writers should be the test pilots and not the scared sheep – like in the space program.  Saying something was made by humans is facile: AI was made by humans.  Embracing technology is necessary and a little scary.  If we switch the power dynamic we may find the tech useful.  Not to replace, but to aid.  It seems strangely dystopian to use all technologies in your art-form except one because fools started a narrative based on fear. Does Vince Gilligan write with Final Draft, or is he sitting in a log cabin by candlelight with a feather and ink?  Enough with the fear – own the tech, use it, exploit it.  Ideas are the key, hard work is the engine. AI is a tool. The power is ours IF we make the choice to control it.

Yes! This made me like it more!

The fact that you have to specify in the credits that a show wasn't made using AI means it's indistinguishable and you know it, otherwise there wouldn't have been any need. Good luck with that.

Completely disagree. It feels like virtue signaling to include because guess what, AI still sucks and they couldn't have made this with AI even if they wanted to. We give too much power to the narrative by making it seem like AI even could replace artists yet. It can't. It can create incredibly short, bad, uncanny valley clips, and it can clean up your incoherent work emails. The stuff AI can actually be meaningfully used for on a film right now would not infringe on real human work, and is mostly digital clean up and effects stuff. Who cares?

	With Stranger Things embarking on its final season, Millie Bobby Brown is leaving behind-the-scenes rumors in the Upside Down.


	While reuniting with co-star David Harbour at Thursday's Season 5 premiere, the 2x Emmy nominee raved that she's “so lucky” to have her onscreen dad in her life for nearly a decade since the Netflix show premiered.


	“It's been amazing. We're so lucky to have each other,” Brown told Extra. “The show means so much to the both of us, and to everyone here. This has been the last 10 years of our lives.”

	Despite reports to the contrary, the pair seemed to get along great as they shared a hug and a laugh while posing together on the red carpet Thursday at TCL Chinese Theatre, ahead of the Part One premiere Nov. 26 on Netflix.

	











	Netflix shared a video to Instagram of the pair celebrating “one last Stranger Things premiere” after the Duffer Brothers' show premiered in 2016.

	Brown stars in Stranger Things as the psychic-powered Eleven, who escapes Hawkins National Laboratory in Season 1, where she was subject to experiments with the Upside Down. After escaping the facility, Harbour's Jim Hopper ends up adopting her.


	Season 5 continues in the fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, with the characters united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will's disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they've faced before. To end this nightmare, they'll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.

	











	The highly anticipated fifth and final season will release on Netflix across three premiere dates with Volume 1 on November 26 (four episodes), Volume 2 on Christmas (three episodes), and The Finale on New Year's Eve. Each volume releases at 5 PM PT.

SATURDAY AM: 20th Century Studios' Predator Badlands is looking good, knock on wood, coursing to a very near record opening for the franchise, around $37M, after a $15.6M Friday/previews and the best CinemaScore a Predator movie has ever seen of A-. As we told you, the previous highs for a Predator movie were the original 1987 installment and 1990 sequel which earned B+s. That audience score is further boosted by the Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak definite recommend of 78% and five stars — which is platinum for any movie. 


	It's clear audiences are enjoying this version of Predator from director/producer/writer Dan Trachtenberg and producers Ben Rosenblatt and John Davis, hence the higher-than-expected ticket sales which were expected to be around the $25M range. The movie's momentum is in a better position than Disney's early October attempted tentpole, Tron: Ares thanks to word of mouth. At the end of the day, no matter how much stunting a studio does in a highly competitive social media-streaming landscape, the movie ultimately sells itself; meaning audiences discover it upon viewing and spread the gospel from there. Both Tron: Ares and Predator: Badlands dazzled Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con with equally memorable stunts; the lead character of the latter, Dek, stepping on stage to scan the audience with his eye vision. 

	











	Switching ratings, i.e. from R to PG-13, hasn't dented the appeal for the alien killer movie, this particular installment casting the series villain as the protag. That's the hook as far as distinguishing itself from previous Predator movies. Rather than just one sheet the fleshy toothy faced guy in a profile shot, Badlands one-sheets really went hardcore sci-fi with epic shots of him battling creatures, etc. The problem with the static opening between 2018's The Predator and 2010's Predators opening to around the same number of $25M, stemmed from the campaigns being quite similar and not selling anything fresh. There was no one-up.

	What's interesting though is that by going to PG-13, that may not have necessarily brought in a younger audience: Badlands only pulled in 5% for the 13-17 demo. Badlands compared to 2018's The Predator shows that older males still come out for the IP (57% to 45%), as well as older females (about the same between both installments at 22%). However, men under 25 shrunk between The Predator and Badlands (went from 21% to 16% share) in addition to women under 25 (11% to 5%). Diversity demos are 44% Caucasian, 26% Latino and Hispanic (bigger than The Predator‘s 23%), 15% Black and 8% Asian American. 


Predator: Badlands has nearly all the Imax and premium large format screens which are driving 53% of the weekend. Pic is playing best in the South Central and West with the latter seeing 43% of the gross coming from there vs a norm of 38% for all other titles in the marketplace. The AMC Burbank is Badlands' best theater in the country with over $59K to date. 


	With a social media universe of 244M across TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and X, Badlands reach is very similar to the reach of Alien: Romulus before opening, that being 246M. Elle Fanning is promoting to her 6.7M fans. Social media data corp RelishMix remarks, “Convo runs positive for Predator: Badlands as fans are lit up at the idea of expanding the Yautja universe beyond Earth, praising its young-blood narrative and connections to Prey and Predators (2010). Enthusiasts loved the lore depth and ‘proving hunt' concept, calling it ‘refreshing' and ‘bad ass.' Comments like ‘Looks fantastic — reminds me when people clowned on Prey and it was awesome,' and ‘Teenage Yautja with something to prove? Sign me up,' highlight genuine anticipation. Others noted the Monsterverse-style shift toward creature-led storytelling, celebrating it as ‘finally giving us the Predator story we've been waiting for.'


	As far as the new upscale adult films, oy, nothing is mind-blowing gross wise. See below. 


	2. Regretting You (Par) 3,196 (-229) theaters, Fri $2.2M (+80%), 3-day $7.3M (-7%), Total $38.7M/Wk 3The Constantin $30M production brought into Paramount by former Global Marketing and Distribution Boss Marc Weinstock is bound for $100M worldwide. Phenomenal hold here. 


	3. Black Phone 2 (Uni) 2,943 (-362) theaters, Fri $1.5M (-38%), 3-day $5.2M (-38%), Total $70M/Wk 4


	4. Sarah's Oil (AMZ) 2,410, Fri $1.7M 3-day $4.4M/Wk 1The best of the adult bunch. Who knew? No surprise when you realize that it's a Kingdom Story production (their fanbase knows about these faith-based films). A+ CinemaScore which is where faith-based audience scores live. Nothing shocking here: over 55 is 48% of the audience, 66% women. The Zachary Levi movie is playing where these pics play best in the South, South Central and Midwest with 63% of the gross coming from there compared to a norm of 44% for all other titles in the marketplace. The Southlake Pavilion in Atlanta is the movie's top grossing location with just over $5K. 


	5. Nuremberg (SPC) 1,802 theaters, Fri $1.4M 3 day $3.8M/Wk 1No CinemaScore, but great PostTrak exits of 5 stars, 76% definite recommend, and 93% positive to overshadow those middling reviews of 69% fresh. The over 55 crowd was prominent at 51% (they gave it an amazing 88% definite recommend), over 45 at 67%, and male leaning at 57% for the WWII drama. Pic is playing on the coasts with 48% of the gross coming from there versus 43% of all films in the marketplace. AMC Grove in LA is the top grossing multiplex with just over $13K. Caucasian 75%, Latino and Hispanic at 10%, 6% Black and 5% Asian American. 


	6. Bugonia (Foc) 2,043 theaters, Fri $1M (-43%), 3-day $3.7M (-26%), Total $12.5M/Wk 3


	7. Chainsaw Man (Sony) 2,285 (-718) theaters, Fri $900K (-31%), 3-day $3.6M (-42%), total $38M/Wk 3

	











	8. Die My Love (Mubi) 1,983 theaters, Fri $1M, 3-day $2.7M/Wk 1A huge chasm between critics at 78% on Rotten Tomatoes and audiences who dismissed this Jennifer Lawrence-Robert Pattinson melodrama about a woman's depression from Lynne Ramsay with a D+. Remember Lawrence's other big swing from Darren Aronofsky, Mother! got an F back in 2017. Despite the great acting in Die My Love, this is a tough movie about a very sad situation; that's hard if you want to lasso people off their couches.  Can't write this enough: Mubi paid $24M for domestic and multiple foreign rights on the movie (versus $12.5M they shelled out for The Substance; that hipster horror pic opened to $3.2M and did a 5.5x multiple with a final domestic of $17.5M).  A 29% definite recommend on PostTrak is the kiss of death. Male leaning at 51%., 25-34 being the biggest show at 44% with 18-34 at 78%. Diversity demos are 60% Caucasian, 22% Latino and Hispanic, 9% Black, and 6% Asian American. Coastal play, which is what these upscale adult movies do, with 50% coming from the East and West. AMC Lincoln Square in NYC is the top grossing location with $12k. 


	9. Springsteen…(20th) 2,200 (-1260) theaters, Fri $637K (-24%) 3-day $2.2M (-39%)/Total $20.4M/Wk 3


	10. Tron: Ares (Dis) 1,970 (-605) theaters, Fri $477K (-21%), 3-day $1.9M (-37%), Total $71.3M/Wk 5


	11. Christy (Black) 2,184 theaters, Fri $600K, 3-day $1.25M/Wk 1The biopic about female boxer Christy Martin, Black Bear finance's foray into domestic theatrical distribution, gets a B+ CinemaScore better than A24's MMA movie Smashing Machine which landed an B-. PostTraks are better with a solid 84% positive and a 59% definite recommend. Maybe this builds more momentum today off that and breaks into the top 10. Sydney Sweeney championed the movie all the way through including appearances last night at the AMC Century City with director David Michod. Black Bear put this theatrical release together quite quickly, taking their own movie off the table from domestic buyers and positioning it for an asap theatrical release post its TIFF world premiere. The town says we need more theatrical distributors in an environment where major studios like Paramount and Warner Bros could potentially collapse into each other. Let's see where Black Bear winds up in the long run. It took a while for A24 to build-up its brand; Bling Ring with Emma Watson was one of its early releases and only grossed $5.8M before we got to the Hereditary, Uncut Gems, Everything Everywhere All at Once, etc. 


FRIDAY AFTERNOON UPDATE: 20th Century Studios' Predator: Badlands is creeping toward the second-best Friday start ever for the franchise at $14M, which would get the Dan Trachtenberg-directed movie to the second-best opening ever for a Predator movie at $33M. The John Davis-produced feature is booked at 3,725 theaters.


	The best Friday and opening for a Predator movie belongs to 2004's Alien v. Predator with $16.4M and $38.2M, respectively. Friday ticket sales of $14M includes the combined previews from Wednesday and Thursday of $4.8M.


	Some might say, “Oh, well, this looks like Tron: Ares,” given how that movie a month ago posted a $14.4M Friday and a $33.2M start. But Predator: Badlands has some of the best reviews and audience scores for its franchise, plus it cost 52% less than the $220M pricetag of the Jared Leto movie.


RELATED: ‘Regretting You' Review: True Love Inevitably Prevails In A Ridiculous Romantic Drama


	Second place goes to Paramount's Colleen Hoover adaptation Regretting You with a third Friday of $1.9M and third weekend of $6.5M, -17%, at 3,196 theaters for a running total by Sunday of $37.9M.

	











	At 2,943 theaters, it's the fourth frame of Universal/Blumhouse's The Black Phone 2 with $4.2M, -50%, after a $1.2M Friday and running cume through Sunday of $69M.


	Fourth is Amazon MGM Studios/Kingdom Story/Wonder Project's Sarah's Oil is the best of the original adult bunch with $1.6M today, and $4.1M for the weekend at 2,410 theaters. 


	Focus Features' third weekend (second wide) of Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia is looking at $1.1M today at 2,043 theaters, $3.7M for the frame, -26%, for a total by EOD Sunday of $12.5M.

	Sony Pictures Classics' Nuremberg starring Russell Crowe, Rami Malek, Michael Shannon, John Slattery and more is seeing $1.4M today for a $3.5M opening at 1,802 theaters. 


FRIDAY AM: The Dan Trachtenberg-directed Predator: Badlands speared $4.8 million in previews, which includes both Wednesday fan and Thursday night shows.


	The preview number is less than that of another sci-fi genre title, Alien: Romulus‘ $6.5M, which also was a franchise reboot for the revived 20th Century Studios under new owner Disney. That Fede Alvarez-directed revival went on to open to $42M stateside. But keep in mind that movie was R-rated and had a mid-August release in 2024. Also, Predator: Badlands, with its female action hero sensibility, also is getting comperd by Disney sources to Ballerina, which did $3.8M in previews before a $24.5M opening in June. Badlands previews are also ahead of 2017's Blade Runner 2049 which did $3.5M before a $12.5M Friday, and 3-day of $32.7M.


	Also good news for Badlands at this point in time: Total previews here are ahead of The Predator, which did $2.5M in Thursday previews back in September 2018. That pic posted a $10.3M Friday on its way to a $24.6M start.


	2004 crossover title Alien vs. Predator owns the franchise opening record at the domestic B.O. with $38.2M. 2010's Predators from director Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez follows as the second-best U.S./Canada opening for the series at $24.7M. The forecast going into the weekend for Badlands was $25M+, hopefully the second-best start in the Predator franchise.


	1987's Predator and 1990's Predator 2 own the best CinemaScores for the series conceived by Jim and John Thomas with a B+.


Predator: Badlands cost $105M net before marketing, shot in New Zealand with tax credits. Trachtenberg breathed new life into the Predator movies in August 2022 with the direct-to-Hulu Prey, which was the streamer's most-watched premiere ever at the time. Critics believed the movie should have been booked in theaters, hence, here we are with Badlands. 


	On the Rotten Tomatoes audience scale, Badlands is the fan favorite of the franchise with 96%, ahead of the original 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie at 87%. Prey remains the most critically acclaimed in the alien series at 94%.


	Amazon MGM Studios release of Kingdom Story's Sarah's Oil posted $460K in previews. The Cyrus Nowrasteh-directed faith-based movie starring Zachary Levi, Sonequa Martin-Green and Garrett Dillahunt follows the true story of 11-year old Sarah Rector, an African American girl born in Oklahoma Indian Territory in the early 1900s who believes there is oil beneath the barren land she's allotted and whose faith is proven right.

Predator only has ONE bad movie in seven movies: The Predator from 2018. Badlands is a middle of the pack movie but damn, I had fun seeing this in a laser projection theater. If you're a fan of Predator, see this movie and don't let the PG13 rating deter you. It's mainly because of a loophole in the violence area and limited profanity. Oh and for those trying to say this is a woke movie but haven't seen it, you couldn't be further wrong, it's NOT a woke movie so please, stop it already.

Reviews are irrelevant.

It's odd how a lot of the coverage of the potential hits of this month is leaving out THE RUNNING MAN. PREDATOR: BADLANDS is great, but I feel like RUNNING MAN will steal quite a bit of its business in its second weekend.

Who asked for this movie? I hope they didn't spend more than 50 mil.

Since you inquired, I specifically asked for it.

I asked for an excellent pizza

thank you.

lol

Fan of the series, but not all movies have been worth seeing to be honest. This one definitely IS! By the same guy who did PREY and KILLER OF KILLERS. Very smart move to not have any red blood but the same amount of action. Gets more people in the theaters, and more money. Anyone not seeing because it is PG13 will see it anyway once they hear how good it is. IF they don't, that's their loss. Can't make everyone happy. BUT, definitely Happy I Saw It!

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	The world premiere of Stranger Things‘ fifth and final season Thursday night was a largely joyous affair for everyone involved (save for the time close to 1,000 invited guests had to spend cooped up in the Chinese Theatre with their phones locked as the screening started an hour late.)


	The cast and creators smiled and posed for photos on the red carpet as they appeared to be enjoying each other's company. That included stars Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour who hugged and shared a laugh in front of photographers.


	The two were closely watched at the premiere, their every movement and word scrutinized, as their reunion came days after a Nov. 1 Daily Mail report that claimed that the British actress, who plays girl with supernatural abilities Eleven on the show, had filed a harassment and bullying complaint against Harbour, who portrays her adoptive father Jim. 

	











	The controversy, fueled by the silence from all parties involved and Harbour's ex-wife Lily Allen's recently released “revenge album,” threatened to overshadow the premiere. It didn't happen, with the cast and creators presenting united front, Brown and Harbour arriving together, Netflix releasing video of them and Brown posting a joint photo on social.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Nobody addressed the accusations directly, with Brown and Harbour praising each other in separate interviews and co-creator Ross Duffer telling THR that “nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.”

	











	According to sources, there was a tiff between Brown and Harbour, and she did complain about his behavior, however it may not have been as recent as the report suggested, but earlier in the series' run. It was dealt with, and there hadn't been issues since, sources said.


	After posing on the red carpet, Brown, Harbour and the rest of the cast took the stage inside the Chinese Theatre, where they were introduced by the series' creators, Matt and Ross Duffer.


	The Duffer brothers, the series director/executive producer Shawn Levy and Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Chief Creative Officer Bela Bajaria spoke before the screening of the Season 5 premiere episode, all becoming emotional as they did. 

Shawn Levy teases how emotional he was watching the final episode (Episode 8) of #StrangerThings Season 5 – which will have a theatrical release on December 31 pic.twitter.com/9qI4ODq8h8


	“I was in a magical place 10 years ago when Stranger Things was pitched to Netflix,” Sarandos said, noting that while House of Cards put the streamer on the original series map, “our real moment was when we put on Stranger Things,” a show that “moved the culture.” 


Stranger Things was the first hit produced and fully owned by Netflix (earlier standouts like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black came from outside studios), and its massive popularity turned it into a lucrative brand and merchandising bonanza for the tech company.


	The Duffer brothers thanked the people they considered to have played a crucial role in Stranger Things‘ success, including Dan Cohen, the former executive at Shawn Levy's company who was the first to champion their script after many rejections, Levy who embraced it, Sarandos, who got it on the platform, and the fans who helped to make it into a world phenomenon. They also acknowledged Bajaria for her support of the show over its last two seasons.


	The speeches made it seem like Sarandos was the one who took the Stranger Things pitch and greenlighted the series. As Chief Creative Officer at the time, Sarandos did have ultimate greenlight authority, and his role in Stranger Things‘ success is undeniable. There were others, too.


	Several years ago, the Duffers presented a different version in an essay for Time magazine about Cindy Holland, Netflix's former head of English-language scripted originals under Sarandos.


	“When we pitched Stranger Things to Netflix, we were told Cindy Holland was the key,” they wrote in 2018. “As it turns out, she's also extremely difficult to read in a room. We left the pitch certain of only one thing: Cindy hated it. One day later, she greenlighted our show, and our lives changed.”


	There was no mention of Holland in any of the on-stage remarks at the premiere. That is not unusual — it is standard Hollywood practice for executives to be erased once replaced. Still, an occasion such as the end of an extraordinary successful show could call for an exception.


	Another detail from the on-stage remarks was not lost on the attendees. The Netflix executives made a point to introduce the Duffer brothers — who are set to leave the streamer in April for a film and TV deal at Paramount that will allow them to make theatrical features and reunite with Holland and another former Netflix exec involved in Stranger Things‘ ascend, Matt Thunell — as being “a big part of the Netflix family.”


	Season 5 of Stranger Things premieres Nov. 26 with Part 1, followed by Part 2 on Dec. 25 and the finale on Dec. 31.

			By Jake Kanter, Max Goldbart 


	Uncertainty over ITV‘s future has been one of the dominant themes of 2025. Famed for launching Downton Abbey, the network has been courting sale interest for well over a year, but for all the industry chatter and press speculation, ITV's silence has been stony. That all changed on Friday, when the UK broadcaster dropped a bombshell worthy of Love Island: a buyer has entered the villa.


	In a 70-word statement, ITV told shareholders that Comcast-owned Sky has made a £1.6B ($2.1B) bid for its media and entertainment division, which houses its TV networks and streaming service. If a deal is completed — and it remains an if — then ITV will be split in two, with shareholders retaining control of ITV Studios, the production and distribution unit behind shows including Fool Me Once and The Voice.

					ITV Confirms Talks With Sky Owner Comcast Over $2.1B Sale Of Networks Arm		
			








	Deadline hears that Sky has been laying the groundwork for this moment for some time. Sky, which is very much leading on the deal with its parent Comcast in the background, has been quietly talking to ITV leaders about the shape of the takeover and why it makes sense for both parties. Work has also been undertaken to examine whether regulatory hurdles can be cleared. A formal deal remains weeks, if not months away, but a source familiar with the talks said there is “goodwill and momentum.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	ITV's much-discussed and notoriously sticky share price (chair Andrew Coslett was heckled over it at ITV's latest AGM) jumped more than 10% after the bid was announced, but Sky's move has left some in the industry scratching their heads. 


	The pay-TV operator is one of the British media's great success stories, forged when Rupert Murdoch was at his swashbuckling best. But in recent years, the company has been managing decline and has at times felt like an unloved child in the Comcast empire. On a recent earnings call, Comcast chiefs, including Brian L. Roberts, did not mention Sky once — usually because it raises awkward questions about the hefty $39B Comcast paid for Sky in 2018. On the Sky side, there is a view among some at its West London HQ that Comcast has mismanaged its asset. Sky, which has made mass layoffs over the past year but did return to profit, has had its value written down by £1.2B, (nearly a quarter) since it was acquired.

	











	So why is Comcast backing Sky's pursuit of another contracting business? Or, as one observer dryly put it: “Why would you want to take the bad part of ITV away from the really good part?”


A Scale Play


	Those close to the deal will tell you that Sky sees ITV as complementary, bringing together the UK's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster with the top pay-TV platform. There is a belief that this will present a compelling offer for advertisers and help unlock new subscribers for Sky. For both parties, bigger is seen as better in a world in which they are competing for viewers, and therefore revenue, with global giants like YouTube and TikTok. This, of course, mirrors what is happening in the U.S., with buyers circling Warner Bros. Discovery as the ink dries on the Paramount-Skydance merger. “The way the market is looking, a deal like this does make sense,” said a Sky insider.


	Industry execs noted that Sky has been mulling a free-to-air acquisition in the UK for some time, given that the pay-TV network took a serious look at Channel 4. Ultimately, the British government abandoned plans to sell Channel 4 in January 2023.


	A former Sky executive said the company is constantly exploring ways to bolster its declining and aging customer base, meaning it could view ITV, and its streaming service ITVX, as another shop window for its content, not least sport. Sky remains the biggest home for Premier League football in the UK. “Not everyone who watches ITV watches Sky, but everyone who watches Sky watches ITV,” said an industry observer.


	The former Sky executive pointed to its heavily marketed Essential TV deal — which bundles Sky Atlantic (home to House of the Dragon) with an ad-tier Netflix plan for £15 — as evidence of the company's efforts to reach new subscribers. They said this sort of offer would have been unthinkable, even five years ago. “Sky is like a massive cruise liner with a small hole. It will sink eventually, but maybe ITV plugs this gap a little longer,” the source said. 


	While there is crossover between the ITV audience and Sky subscribers, Tom Harrington, Head of Television at Enders Analysis, said the broader audience will be a much better sell to advertisers. “You'd be enormous in a shrinking market,” he added. “If you have a declining business in many ways and combine it with another [declining] business then suddenly you look a lot bigger. That is better, even if putting them together won't really arrest what they are facing.”


	Another well-placed former Sky insider agreed the deal makes sense if Comcast wants to run Sky and ITV for cash, essentially juicing what remains of declining but still lucrative ad businesses. This person, along with numerous other sources, said there would be significant cost-cutting that could be achieved in slamming the businesses together (broadcasting union Bectu quickly voiced alarm that the deal would have “huge implications” for ITV staff). But ultimately, the former Sky insider came back to an analogy often whispered among bankers who are merging weakening businesses: “Two drunks propping each other up at the bar.”


An Ad Monopoly?


	Other questions linger. There is no guarantee a Sky takeover of ITV would be cleared by regulators. The deal would need to be approved by Ofcom and the Competition Markets Authority. There is confidence this can be achieved, and the UK government has signaled in recent months that it wants to make it easier for broadcasters to come together. 

	











	Nevertheless, Sky and ITV are estimated to cover around 70% of the advertising market, meaning that any deal would certainly raise eyebrows from commercial competitors, not least Paramount-owned 5. “That would be the biggest hurdle,” noted a Sky insider, who said the deal would be the first big test of whether the government will greenlight consolidation.


	Ex-ITV chair Peter Bazalgette, an industry doyen, told BBC Radio 4's Today show that regulators should be flexible, given that ITV is now taking on the likes of Google and Meta in the video advertising space, not just its more immediate rivals like Channel 4. Bazalgette's argument mirrors the one that ITV has begun making to UK lawmakers and regulators.


	There is also the question of the duo's overlapping news businesses. Both are widely respected, but Sky News has been loss-making for years and its current funding guarantee from Comcast — one of the stipulations of the 2018 deal — expires in 2028. A person close to Sky News suggested that the service could end up producing ITV News, which would get Comcast out of a “really difficult decision in 2028,” but would be bad news for current supplier ITN.


	Breaking ITV apart would also lead to questions over the deep ties between its network business and studios arm. “They are so inextricably linked,” said the market observer. “But the terms with which they relate to each other would, of course, become less advantageous and beneficial. So you're buying something that wouldn't be as good as it is now.”


	The assumption from some of our sources is that ITV CEO Carolyn McCall will seek a buyer for the studios business soon after the sale of networks. Banijay and RedBird IMI have held talks, but interest has cooled in recent months. ITV insiders value it at £3.5B, and there is little doubt that it is an attractive asset in a consolidating market.


	ITV, a grand old institution of British broadcasting, recently celebrated its 70th birthday. The company knows better than most that it must adapt to survive. Executives will hope that their courtship with Sky can turn into an enduring union, even if the takeover bid has left some perplexed.


	Sky, ITV, and Comcast declined to comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jeremy Renner denies allegations of misconduct from filmmaker Yi Zhou","https://www.avclub.com/jeremy-renner-denies-allegations-yi-zhou","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 04:41:00 GMT","

A representative for actor Jeremy Renner has issued a denial of claims made against the Hawkeye star by filmmaker Yi Zhou, who has alleged that Renner sent her unsolicited nude photographs of himself, and later threatened to call ICE on her when the pair's relationship soured.

This is per Rolling Stone, reporting on a long series of Instagram posts from Zhou, who also gave an interview to The Daily Mail about her alleged relationship with Renner. Which, per the artist, model, and filmmaker, began when he solicited her with nude pictures via social media earlier this year, and eventually saw the two collaborate, at least in part, on Zhou's documentary Chronicles Of Disney. (As far as we can tell, the film was released last month, and is built off of interviews conducted with a fairly small collection of people affiliated with the company—including a very noted inclusion of Renner himself in its marketing materials.) Zhou says things soured with Renner after he refused to promote the film, including a request from her that he publicly disavow that the film had been generated with AI. (Zhou is also currently producing an AI-animated film, titled Stardust Future, that Renner was reportedly involved in.) “When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly,” Zhou wrote in one of several posts that she's made public since Monday, “To respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me.”

Per Rolling Stone, a representative for Renner has called the allegations against the actor “totally inaccurate and untrue.” Zhou's account currently includes a number of pictures posted as “receipts,” including candid photographs that appear to show Renner, and screenshots of a text conversation allegedly showing him making a threat to call immigration on Zhou.

Ted Lasso and Shrinking star Brett Goldstein has landed his latest streaming project (on both the acting and the creative sides) as Deadline reports that Goldstein has just secured a Prime Video landing spot for his new series Escorted. As the title implies, the series centers on Goldstein, playing what we're going to go ahead and assume will be some variant of a Brett Goldstein type—i.e., a divorced dad who (we're guessing) has a gruff exterior covering massive amounts of silliness—who “accidentally becomes a male escort.”

And while it's not clear, at present, how many other plotlines the show will pull from the rich oeuvre of Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo duology—will a very large fishtank, perhaps, feature heavily?—the show does have a pretty good creative pedigree. That most especially includes Goldstein, who will write, produce, and star in the series, alongside Shrinking collaborator Brian Gallivan. The series, which has been given a direct-to-series order at Prime Video, is being produced at Warner Bros. Studios, with Amazon's Amazon MGM studios as a co-producer.

Among other things, the series represents Goldstein's first big solo push since Ted Lasso introduced his stoic, thoughtful take on comedy to the masses on both sides of the pond—including the fact that that he's clearly just as enthusiastic about working as a writer as as an actor. (He previously co-created, but never appeared in, a science-fiction anthology show, Soulmates, which debuted on AMC back in 2020, just as Lasso was first taking off. The series ran for a single season.) Escorted has been ordered for an eight-episode first season, and will reportedly be a “romantic comedy about second chances, the mayhem of co-parenting, and whether real intimacy can ever be bought”—none of which, if memory serves, were ever addressed directly by the Deuce Bigalow films, so there's clearly some creative room left here to explore.

Former “Dancing with the Stars” contestant Chrishell Stause has announced her departure from Netflix's “Selling Sunset” after 9 successful seasons. The 44-year-old real estate agent and actress confirmed her exit in a candid interview with Bustle, citing concerns about her mental health and personal well-being.

Stause, who joined the show as an original cast member when it premiered in 2019, has become one of the most recognizable faces on the popular real estate reality series. Her journey on the show has included personal milestones, professional growth, and various interpersonal conflicts that have entertained audiences worldwide.

The announcement comes following a particularly challenging ninth season that featured intense drama between Stause and several cast members, including longtime friend Emma Hernan and newcomer Nicole Young. The season's conflicts ultimately influenced her decision to step away from the series.

Despite the difficulties she faced during filming, Stause emphasized that her choice wasn't made lightly. The financial security provided by the show made the decision particularly complex, given her humble beginnings and appreciation for the opportunities it created.

In her interview with Bustle, Stause explained the practical considerations behind her departure. “I've gotten to a place where I don't need the show financially,” she revealed. “I'm lucky to have other forms of employment, because it's no longer good for my mental health.”

The reality star acknowledged the internal struggle she faced when making this choice. “I've vacillated back and forth with this decision in the past. I have to be honest — having come from nothing, it's really hard to turn something like this down,” she shared with the publication.

Her determination to prioritize personal wellness over professional obligations became clear when she stated that not even “Jesus Christ himself” could convince her to return for additional seasons. 

The decision crystallized during the filming of the season nine reunion special, which Stause described as particularly difficult. “I think, after so many hours, I felt like, ‘Sit here, get through it. You're not a quitter, but you never have to do this again,'” she told the outlet.

Despite the circumstances surrounding her exit, Stause maintained a gracious attitude toward the show and her former colleagues. “If they do continue, I wish them the best,” she explained. “The show has given me so many opportunities, and I don't want to be bitter about it, even though I'm leaving not in the way that I would've loved.”

Her future plans include focusing on projects that align with her personal values and identity. “Since I've come out, I think four or five things I've done have all been queer,” she noted, expressing interest in leading holiday movies featuring LGBTQ+ storylines.

Stause's departure represents a significant shift for “Selling Sunset,” though Netflix has not yet officially announced whether the series will continue for a tenth season.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans Concerned After ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Postponed Due to ‘Personal Matter'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-postponed-personal-matter/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 12:46:54 GMT","

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was unexpectedly pulled from its Thursday lineup as Jimmy Kimmel tended to a “personal matter,” sparking concern among fans. 

Ticket holders for the Thursday, November 6, show were reportedly informed that their taping had been abruptly canceled, according to New York Post.

“Tonight's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live has been postponed. Apologies for any inconvenience. We will contact you to reschedule for a future taping,” one fan shared via Reddit in an apparent screenshot of an email received from the ticket company. ”

Madison Beer — who was scheduled to be the musical guest on the November 6 show — took to social media to address the change. 

“Due to unforeseen circumstances, @jimmykimmellive needed to reschedule my performance that was originally scheduled to air tonight to a later date,” Beer wrote in a post shared via her Instagram Story. “I'll share more details on timing when I can. I can't wait for you all to see it.”

Actor David Duchovny and “Stranger Things” star Joe Keery were both set to sit down with Jimmy Kimmel. 

ABC ultimately aired a rerun of the October 28 episode, which LateNighter explained was due to a “personal matter” for Kimmel. 

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is scheduled to return with new episodes on Monday, November 10, the outlet revealed.

While no further details were shared regarding the postponement, late-night fans showed their support for the host via social media.

“I hope it's not due to a family emergency and everything is okay,” one fan wrote via Reddit. 

“Given what just happened in Sept. any missed tapings makes me anxious. I am hoping it's nothing bad,” another wrote. 

Kimmel's absence raises concern as just two months prior ABC briefly suspended the hit show after receiving pressure from the FCC and station owners. 

The network ultimately reinstated “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” just one week after announcing the suspension.

“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” ABC said in a statement on September 22. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.”

Kimmel, 57, later admitted he believed his late-night career was over throughout his suspension. 

“‘Well, that's it,'” Kimmel said on Bloomberg Screentime on October 8. “Because there seemed to be a list of demands presented to me, and I was not going to go along with any of them. So it's was like, ‘Well, I guess we're done.' I said to my wife, ‘That's it. It's over.'”

Neither Kimmel nor ABC has publicly addressed the postponement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Erin Krakow's Intriguing 4-Word Response to Whether Lori Loughlin Will Return to 'When Calls The Heart'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/erin-krakow-on-lori-loughlin-wtch-return/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 16:55:51 GMT","

When the 13th season of Hallmark Channel's hit series “When Calls The Heart”  premieres in 2026, at least two past guest stars will return to Hope Valley — Melissa Gilbert, who first joined the cast in 2024, and Brooke Shields, whose character hasn't appeared in a decade. 

That begs the question: could Lori Loughlin be close behind? On November 7, 2025, series lead Erin Krakow gave Us Weekly an intriguing four-word answer: “I sure hope so.” 

Loughlin, who first rose to fame as Aunt Becky on “Full House,” played beloved “When Calls The Heart” character Abigail Stanton from 2013 to 2019. Hallmark cut ties with her during season six and removed her from the cast following her arrest and eventual jail sentence for her involvement in the largest college admissions scandal in U.S. history. 

But in recent years, many fans and former castmates have expressed hope, like Krakow, that Loughlin will be forgiven and allowed to return to Hope Valley. 

Krakow, whose new movie “Christmas Above the Clouds” premieres on November 8, told Us Weekly, “I love Lori Loughlin, and I love the character she created, Abigail Stanton.” 

Noting that Loughlin's return is “something I've been hoping for for years and years,” Krakow told the outlet, “I'm very much a fan of hers and a friend of hers, so I really hope that it's happening.” 

This is not the first time Krakow has publicly advocated for Loughlin's return. In 2024, she and her “When Calls The Heart” co-star Kevin McGarry both said they'd welcome her back with open arms.

“She's an incredible person, a very dear friend,” Krakow said at the time. “She's got a real good heart. People don't even know how special a person she is, and it would be wonderful to have her back in Hope Valley.” 

McGarry weighed in, “I think there's been lots of people that (have) said we'd love to have her back. It's not our decision of course.” 

Even show co-creator Brian Bird said in 2023 that he was open to bringing Loughlin back on the series, stating on the “When Calls The Heart Aftershow” podcast that there had been “good conversations” about her potential return. 

He said in that interview, “Our attitude always has been, you know as the producing team and the writing team around ‘When Calls the Heart,' that what better place for second chances than Hope Valley. And so in theory, it should work, right? But again, can't fully promise it but we're working on it.”

Following their 2019 arrests, Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded guilty in 2020 to charges of mail and wire fraud, per Us Weekly, after they and dozens of other parents were charged with paying to help ensure their teenage children were admitted to the colleges they wanted to attend. Loughlin and Giannulli's daughters — Bella and Olivia Jade — were accepted by the University of Southern California.

In 2020, Loughlin served two months and Giannuli served five months in jail, per Us Weekly, and tried to move past the scandal together, with Loughlin slowly returning to acting, including two movies on Great American Family. 

But in early October, after nearly three decades of marriage, TMZ reported that Loughlin and Giannuli had separated and were no longer living together.

On Friday nights, IndieWire After Dark honors fringe cinema in the streaming age with midnight movies from any moment in film history.

First, the BAIT: a weird genre pick, and why we're exploring its specific niche right now. Then, the BITE: a spoiler-filled answer to the all-important question, “Is this old cult film actually worth recommending?” 

I.C.E. agents are horror fans too, right? It seems like you'd have to be to voluntarily risk your reputation for a hobby most famously associated with slasher villains. Sure, there are the red-blooded Americans who say they joined up to salute a bigoted version of Superman that never existed. But when I want to talk to Dean Cain, I prefer walking directions to the most publicly pathetic man in Las Vegas.

No, this midnight movie recommendation is for you, the true-blue horror movie lover who is spending this Friday night gainfully employed by the world's foremost dipshit militia. Are you doing it because you like scaring people? I know a bunch of guys who get it. Jigsaw torments blind guys, too. Art the Clown likes brutalizing women. And though Pennywise doesn't typically choose which kids to traumatize based on color, I'm sure he'd like to start. It's nice to see yourself on screen, isn't it? Good boy! Here's a treat.Directed by Phil Guidry, Simon Herbert, and David Whelan, “Savageland” is about your favorite thing: undocumented immigrants. Set along the U.S.-Mexico border, this genius found footage flick from 2015 centers on a mysterious massacre, supposedly carried out by a single man. Francisco Salazar (Noé Montes) is a shy photographer who crossed into Arizona years before the attack. On June 2, 2011, he was found fleeing the scene of a bizarre mass casualty event: 57 people, an entire village of immigrants and one notable white family, slaughtered in a single night. How can that be? The answer probably lies in the strange bite marks covering the corpses… and Salazar, too. But that fact won't make it into court. 

 










Convicting the killer is of paramount importance to Sheriff John Parano (George Lionel Savage) and the staunchly anti-immigrant base that voted him into office for the last four decades. But to him, this case is open and shut. Salazar — the bloodthirsty murderer from Mexico! — did this, plain and simple. Parano is supported by a Rush Limbaugh-type (Edward L. Green) and the subtle bias of Salazar's own defense attorney (Jason Stewart), who insists his client got a fair trial despite more evidence, photographs Salazar took that night, showing a swarm of monsters and victims, being thrown out by a crooked judge. Framed as a broadcast true crime documentary made after Salazar's trial, this brilliant lo-fi effort enlists several more talking heads to balance out the whodunnit. A civil rights expert (Lawrence Ross) compares the carnage to a slew of historic events implicating a racist government, such as the Tulsa massacre. There's also a psychologist (Renee Davies) who finally gets the stoic defendant to talk in a clinical interview.

She believes Salazar when he says a mob of monsters attacked his community and the family he worked for — but she has trouble explaining why her patient would've been taking snapshots of the mutants instead of fighting them off. Enter the late Len Wein, a real comic book legend who plays a critical part in “Savageland” and represents the single most intriguing element of the film when revisited in 2025. 

 










Listen, I know you're a big-time genre buff, and I'm just a girl “journalist” (lulz!), but I think you'll like what comes next. Crafted in the spirit of George A. Romero, this extraordinary testament to independent filmmaking dares to ask what would happen if Duane Jones (yeah, the Black guy) didn't get shot by police in “Night of the Living Dead,” but instead lived to endure the white mob's torment in the light of day. 

Look. Illinois may have denied Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem access to a bathroom during her latest visit — but I earnestly want you to enjoy this movie. Seriously. Kick back and relax! We're all in “Savageland” now, and if you take your mask off long enough, horror might just save your soul.

“Savageland” is now streaming for free on Tubi. 
 










There's too much happening right now to seriously fret about AI ruining the believability of found footage movies. But amid a sea of smart choices, the decision to have Salazar photograph his attackers on film sticks out a decade later. In “Savageland,” the late Len Wein — a real-life artistic superhero who created Marvel's Wolverine, among many other triumphs — appears as photojournalist Len Matheson. He recalls hanging from a helicopter despite a fear of heights to capture vital scenes from the Vietnam War.

Matheson's testimonial in the faux documentary provides essential context for Salazar's ultimately fruitless legal defense, explaining how looking through a camera lens can make someone feel invincible even in the face of certain peril. Now more than ever, capturing the truth is important, and journalism is a valuable vocation, one of a small handful explicitly named in the Constitution. Without a weapon, Salazar faced the terror that had befallen his town by documenting what he could and sharing that harsh reality with the world — regardless of the consequences. The suggestion that the photos are doctored makes sense in a post-fact America, which was emerging even when this movie originally premiered before the first Trump term.

Since then, faith in politicians has declined precipitously, while the rise of AI has made the public's perception ever easier to manipulate. The government officials in “Savageland” are obviously corrupt, but true cinephiles can take some small comfort in Matheson explaining why film photos would be harder to fake than digital images. Still, you'd be hard-pressed to find any No Kings protesters lugging around a Pentax17. Despite the growing similarities between modern news and Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” no one is watching CNN in VistaVision. Toss in the possibility that it might actually behoove killer AI to let a zombie attack wipe out humanity, and the point stands even stronger. (When your enemy is made of metal, isn't all warfare biological?)

“Savageland” further bolsters its credibility by casting real experts to play fake ones in the film. Wein was indeed a Vietnam veteran, and Lawrence Ross is a real journalist and historian who has seen a number of well-respected texts and novels about social injustice published under his name. In fact, this entire project is underpinned by the UCLA academic filmmaking scene — and the man who played Salazar, Noé Montes, continues to champion communities close to the border with his work as a visual artist. 

 










Per his professional website, “For more than 20 years, Montes has documented and worked with underrepresented communities to effect change through storytelling, education, and advocacy around social, economic, and environmental issues.” Now through April 19, 2026, you can see “Regional History” — an exhibition of three collections from Montes — on display at the Riverside Art Museum in the Bobbie Powell and R. Ross DeVean Galleries.

8.1

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Columbia

Reviewed:

November 8, 2025

In 1956, Robert Zimmerman was a 15-year-old kid, a misfit in his small Midwestern town, and leader of a ragtag rock'n'roll combo who compensated for their lack of technique with boundless enthusiasm. In 1963, Bob Dylan was arguably the most celebrated pop artist in America, whose songs were hailed as standards before he could even record them and whose fans considered him to be a living, breathing manifestation of the American folk impulse. That kid wailing on his band's cover of Shirley & Lee's “Let the Good Times Roll” back in St. Paul, Minnesota, could never have predicted where he'd end up in seven years (he'd not even heard of Odetta or Woody Guthrie yet), and the conquering hero closing out his first sold-out Carnegie Hall performance with a spirited and weirdly prophetic “When the Ship Comes In” had already tried to erase his old self from his biography. He claimed to friends and interviewers and colleagues and onlookers that he was born and raised in New Mexico, ran off with the circus, toured with Conway Twitty, and any other fabulation that crossed his mind, so perhaps he thought those two versions of himself were incompatible. But there was always something of the rocker in the folkie and a bit of the folkie in the rocker.

Through the Open Window, the 18th installment of Dylan's never-ending reissue series, connects these two figures intimately, tracing the artist's seven-year rise across 8 CDs, 165 tracks, and nearly nine hours. It's not the largest Bootleg entry; the collector's edition of The Cutting Edge beats all comers with 18 CDs, while Trouble No More sprawls to as many as 10 CDs. (You want that much mid-'60s electric Dylan, but who besides the most committed Bobophile needs that much born-again Dylan?) Regardless, nothing in the series has the same scope of this new set. Most Bootleg installments drop you into a pivotal moment in Dylan's life, a meaningful year or two, but Through the Open Window covers almost a decade during which he made great strides. It plays less like a box set and more like the audiobook of a Great American Novel: a travelogue from the Midwest to Greenwich Village and a coming-of-age story of an artist hitting young adulthood amid the dreamers and schemers of New York City. It follows Dylan as he hangs out in shabby Manhattan apartments, as he lingers over coffee at Café Wha?, and as he tries out new songs and routines and personae onstage. It follows him into tiny Cue Recording Studio and historic Columbia Studio A, to a poorly attended show at the tiny Carnegie Chapter Hall, and finally to his climactic sold-out show at Carnegie Hall.

Here's a box set where the length is not only justified but an essential part of the experience. It's made for total immersion; whether you're a committed obsessive or merely curious, it's meant to be lived with for a few weeks, part of your daily routine for a while, exactly like a good book. You won't get that experience with the 2xCD highlights edition or even the 4xLP set, which are really just the CliffsNotes versions. So start with the first track and listen for a while. Mark your place and start again later. Ignore other people to keep listening. Imagine those apartments with their thin curtains and bare mattresses on the floor, those clubs with their cigarette smoke and lines of hopefuls waiting for their few minutes on a small stage, those studios with their pristine acoustic tiles and engineers in suits and ties. Listen as Bobby Zimmerman becomes Bob Dylan.

You couldn't write an opening chapter better than pimply Bobby leading his fellow teenagers through “Let the Good Times Roll.” The lo-est of fi, it is barely legible, and there is honestly nothing noteworthy in the performance beyond who is performing. It's exactly the kind of track, however, that works well in the context of a sprawling box set, partly because it's very short (37 seconds) and mostly because it so perfectly sets Zimmerman up as a nobody who becomes somebody. How many teenagers were obsessed with rock'n'roll in 1956? This kid was only one of a couple million. Later, you can hear the moment he learns about folk music and when he begins his defining obsession with Woody Guthrie: The guitars switch from electric to acoustic, there is more strain and gravity in his performances, the sound of someone trying to live up to the songs he's singing. This is when he breaks free of those millions of kids and becomes one of thousands besotted by folk. Where they might have seen the music's history as something that would automatically justify their presence on any stage, Dylan saw that and much more.

These are not lost years in Dylan's life; in fact, they are among the most documented in his biography, thanks to Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964, Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home, James Mangold's A Complete Unknown, and even Dylan's own Chronicles Volume One. It's not the most glamorous era, lacking the prickly rebellion of going electric and the gleeful rowdiness of The Basement Tapes, nor is Dylan the most sympathetic of protagonists. His penchant for self-fictionalization during this period is notorious and at times obnoxious—he insisted on the three Ns in his early stage name, Elston Gunnn—but less well known is his wide-eyed wonder, his gawky attention-seeking. This is the guy who carried around The New York Times with Robert Shelton's article about him, which Dylan would read aloud to anyone within earshot. There's a bit of boastful self-regard there, but also a kind of dumbfounded amazement that he actually exists to other people.

Inside of a song, he's an even wilier character, and Through the Open Window reveals an artist trying to find his voice and then convincing others to listen to it. At first he sounds most purposeful when he's playing with other people, such as Danny Kalb, a slightly more experienced musician who adds sharp guitar runs to “East Virginia Blues” and “K.C. Moan.” Even as a session player, he sounds like a perfectionist, always absorbing new tricks and techniques. More telling than his harmonica playing on Harry Belafonte's 1962 cover of Lead Belly's “The Midnight Special” is the tense exchange with producer Hugo Montenegro over a riff Dylan was asked to play on the intro. Belafonte, chill as ever, tells the kid to take his time. He tried so many different things during this era, even working with a jazz combo for a flop single (although their cover of “That's All Right Mama” sounds like a test run for his thin-wild-mercury sound just a few years later). While very few of them stuck, you can hear him learning as he goes.

As he hones his picking and strumming, Dylan gains confidence as a vocalist who knows when to howl or bleat or holler or croon or hang back and be quiet. The sheer force of his voice is no real revelation, but this compilation explores his developing technique in greater depth than any other Dylan set even attempts. Listen to his stark versions of Guthrie's “Pastures of Plenty” and the country song “Remember Me,” both recorded at a friend's home, and marvel at how he seems to be editing his vocals and guitar playing, removing every note but the most essential. Or cue up the various versions of “Blowin' in the Wind,” regarded as his first masterpiece and a hit for Peter, Paul & Mary before he'd even released his own version, and hear how he lets the song be a little slippery, how he revels in what Sean Wilentz in his lengthy liner notes calls its “ambiguous indeterminacy.” Dylan always pushed against his reputation as a protest singer, despite writing some of the greatest protest songs of the rock era, and he sings this song like he's trying to figure it out himself, finally realizing that it means something completely different depending on who's singing it and in what context. Through the Open Window includes that and other songs from his first appearance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963, back when he wouldn't dare plug in. If he had divided feelings about the venue and his role there, it doesn't come across in his performance, especially when he leads a choir of contemporaries—Joan Baez, Peter, Paul & Mary, the Freedom Singers, and others—in a rousing sing-along. They all sing “Blowin' in the Wind” with a sense of destiny, as though they are making a new world just by singing this song together.

In one of the finest moments of sequencing on this set, the next song up is “Boots of Spanish Leather,” an outtake from the Freewheelin' sessions with Tom Wilson (Dylan would eventually re-record it for The Times They Are A-Changin' in 1964). The contrast between the rousing chorus of “Blowin' in the Wind” and the stillness of “Boots” is jarring enough to bring out new aspects of each song, with “Boots” sounding even lonelier, even more despairing. Written during a trip to Italy as his relationship with Suze Rotolo appeared to be crumbling, it sounds intimate and unguarded, intensely private rather than public; he needs a quiet moment to himself in order to rouse an audience with his friends.

Though known in folk circles, Dylan was still struggling to find a larger audience and break through to the pop market. He signed with Columbia in late 1961, which is roughly where Act II begins. He recorded his self-titled debut with John Hammond producing, but it was not the breakout anyone expected. Here's where you might want to place your bookmark and give that album another listen, just to get a feel for how this young man presented himself to the world; unexpectedly, Bob Dylan might work better as an addendum to this bulky novel than as a standalone release. Even Dylan considered it a failure, both commercially and creatively, and he was moving so fast that these traditional tunes and talking blues were old news by the time it was released.

His follow-up, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, did not come easy. He worked through a series of aimless sessions over several months, finally piecemealing an album that wasn't too dissimilar from his debut. At the last minute Columbia decided that “Talkin' John Birch Society Paranoid Blues” was potentially libelous and removed it from the album. Dylan was irate, but it worked out in his favor, as it gave him a chance to quickly record several new songs and redo about half the album, including “Girl from the North Country” and “Masters of War”—two of his best compositions from the era. The new tracklist sharpened his Cold War fears while also introducing more intimate struggles, in particular his insecurities about Rotolo. The album toggles gracefully between the public and the private, each lending weight to the other, which contributes to its status as Dylan's breakthrough as well as just one of the best folk albums ever made.

Through the Open Window could end there, with Freewheelin' hailed as a masterpiece that sealed his reputation with the folkies while bringing folk music to a larger audience. But that album is merely the set-up for the set's cinematic climax at Carnegie Hall, which takes up the last two discs. The crowd sounds rowdier than expected, bringing their basket-house manners to this grander venue and seemingly cutting short his introduction to “A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall” with their applause. He brings so many different Dylans to the stage: the outraged protest singer (“The Times They Are A-Changin'”), the lovelorn poet (“Boots of Spanish Leather”), the talkin' bluesman (“Talkin' World War III Blues”), the guy scared of nuclear annihilation (“Masters of War”), and the artist who's over it all (a rambling story about the film Hootenanny Hoot and the commercialization of the folk movement).

This Bootleg installment ends with Dylan triumphant, hailed as a hero and a new kind of pop star: not merely an entertainer but an artist. Of course, it wouldn't be long before many of his applauding fans were jeering at him, calling him a traitor for plugging in and writing such inscrutable lyrics. Through the Open Window gestures toward the rest of the story, toward everything that has happened in the past 62 years. Dylan has always had a strained relationship with this early material, especially those topical songs, and sometimes he kicks against them and sometimes he embraces their possibilities. During these seven years Robert Zimmerman discovered he could be Bob Dylan and Bob Dylan discovered he could be just about anybody. Anything was possible and nothing was certain, and this might be the only time in his life when that was true.

	Soon after Hayley Williams dropped her new song “Showbiz” — the closing track on the complete edition of her recent album Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party — the Paramore singer revealed that she will embark on her first-ever solo tour.


	Just as Williams surreptitiously debuted Ego Death on her website before its official release, the singer similarly “leaked” her tour dates via a .jpeg she titled “oops.” The “Hayley Williams at a Bachelorette Party” tour kicks off March 28, 2026 in Atlanta and runs through May 12 and 13 at Los Angeles' the Wiltern.


	Along the way, Williams has scheduled a two-night stand at her native Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, two shows at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, and a gig at Austin's Moody Theatre. After the run of North American shows, Williams will head off to Europe in June 2026 for two weeks worth of shows.


	Williams previously hinted that she would finally embark on her first-ever solo tour in a Dec. 2024 message to fans, suggesting that the trek would take place in 2025. However, the years-in-the-making tour will instead kick off in March 2026, six years after the singer first announced her intention for a solo jaunt.

	











	Back in March 2020, just weeks before the coronavirus took hold of North America, Williams announced a tour in support of her then-upcoming solo albums Petals for Armor.


	“Wow. I am going on tour. Myself. It's not Paramore and truthfully, it's just a little terrifying,” Williams wrote at the time. “But if I know anything, it's that there's no safer place (besides at home with my dog) than to be in a room, on a stage, in front of the people who I've grown up singing my lungs out for. There was a time I thought I wouldn't tour Petals for Armor. What a joke. I must.”

	











	However, the pandemic disrupted those plans, and Williams was forced to stage a series of virtual performances — like NPR's Tiny Desk from Nashville — during the album's promotional push. By the time the lockdown subsided, Paramore had reunited, releasing a new album This Is Why and embarking on their own jaunt that included a stretch on Taylor Swift's Eras Tour.

Olivia Rodrigo is making it clear that she is not happy with the Trump administration (and his Department of Homeland Security) using her music to promote their policies. On Friday, the pop singer slammed the White House and DHS for posting a video about self-deportation using one of her songs.


	A video posted to Instagram on Tuesday opened with the chaotic, rock part of her Guts favorite “All-American Bitch” showing clips of ICE agents detaining undocumented immigrants with the caption “If ICE finds you,” and then undocumented immigrants seemingly choosing to self-deport with the softer, more peaceful part of the song that follows.


	“LEAVE NOW and self-deport using the CBP Home app,” read the DHS post's caption. “If you don't, you will face the consequences.”


	In a comment that has since been deleted (although it's unclear if by Rodrigo or DHS), Rodrigo wrote, “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” Since its deletion, fans of Rodrigo have been copy/pasting her original message to remind viewers of Rodrigo's take.

	











	In response to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment on the matter, a DHS spokesperson said, “America is grateful all the time for our federal law enforcement officers who keep us safe. We suggest Ms. Rodrigo thank them for their service, not belittle their sacrifice.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Rodrigo has been a loud voice against Trump's policies and racist approach to immigration enforcement. When ICE started targeting Angelenos in mass raids back in June, Rodrigo shared an Instagram story condemning deportations.

	











	“I've lived in L.A. my whole life and I'm deeply upset about these violent deportations of my neighbors under the current administration,” Rodrigo wrote. “L.A. simply wouldn't exist without immigrants. Treating hardworking community members with such little respect, empathy, and due process is awful.”

	Marvel star Jeremy Renner is facing accusations that he sent unsolicited “intimate” photos and video to a Chinese filmmaker and threatened to “call ICE” on her after she “called him out privately” on alleged misconduct.


	Filmmaker and artist Yi Zhou, director of the documentary Chronicles of Disney featuring Renner, made the allegations in a series of Instagram posts and in an in-depth interview with the Daily Mail. Zhou, 38, alleges she had a personal and professional relationship with Renner, 54, that left her fearing for her safety.


	“Mr. Renner first contacted me directly in June, sending personal and intimate photographs of himself, behavior that, according to public reports, he has exhibited before,” she wrote on Instagram. She claims Renner wooed her over calls and text discussions, saying he wanted a relationship. Zhou alleges they started dating and working together on two projects, including Chronicles of Disney, and that Renner “appears in 80% of the film.” She claims that when the documentary was released last month, Renner “refused to make any public promotion,” despite allegedly having entered into written agreements with her Italian production company, Into the Sun Films. Zhou says she appealed to Renner to help her combat fan accounts falsely claiming the documentary was generated by AI without his consent, but he purportedly refused.

	











	“When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” she wrote. “Such behavior is unacceptable and emblematic of the imbalance of power that continues to harm women in our industry.”

	A rep for the actor called the allegations “totally inaccurate and untrue.” The Marvel actor has not commented publicly.


	In her interview with the Daily Mail, Zhou claimed it was Renner who pursued her. “I did not reach out to him,” she said. “I didn't even know his name, never watched a movie of his. He used me and denied me and denied our work.” She shared a screenshot of a pornographic image that Renner allegedly sent to her via WhatsApp in June.


	She went on to claim that one night in August, Renner drank a bottle of wine and yelled at her for two hours during a work meeting at his house. Zhou claimed she had to “lock” herself in a room, “scared for [her] life.”

	Renner nearly died in a snow plow accident on New Year's Day 2023. He recounted the accident — which left him in critical condition — in a Diane Sawyer interview a few months later. “I chose to survive. That's not gonna kill me, no way,” Renner said.


	The actor previously was married to Canadian model and actress Sonni Pacheco. During a bitter child custody battle, Pacheco accused him of substance abuse and threatening to kill her.

Alien buffs are scratching their heads after footage emerged of what seems to be a UFO hovering over an active volcano.

The video, captured by a webcam, shows the eerie glowing object floating above the crater before it suddenly zooms off at high speeds. The suspected extraterrestrial craft seemed to be observing the smoking crater as smoke and flames shot into the sky.

This strange event was recorded by surveillance cameras at the Popocatepetl volcano in the states of Puebla and Morelos in Mexico on Thursday, October 30, reports the Daily Star. 

Popocatepetl, standing at an altitude of 17,802 feet (5,426 meters), is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes.

As of now, officials have not commented on the origin of the mysterious airborne object.

The National Center for Disaster Prevention reported 19 low-intensity eruptions accompanied by vapor, gases, and small amounts of ash on the day in question.

They urged the public to keep their distance from the crater and respect the 12-kilometer exclusion zone.

Last year, UFO expert Jaime Maussan, 72, suggested that Popocatepetl is functioning as an ""inter-dimensional portal,"" a gateway in space-time that allows intergalactic travelers to enter one place from another.

He pointed out that no man-made object could enter the crater as temperatures reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius, as reported by What's the Jam.

Maussan elaborated: ""The University of Bergen in Norway discovered that under the volcano there are magnetic storms necessary to be able to generate X-points "" or regions of electron diffusion "" and be used to create a Dimensional Portal.""

X-points are unique locations where Earth's magnetic field connects with the Sun's, creating a direct path from our planet to the Sun's atmosphere, a staggering 93 million miles away.

These points are dubbed as X-points due to the intertwining of the Sun's magnetic force with that of the Earth, forming an 'X' shape.

A new analysis of surface temperature readings from NASA's Cassini Mission has determined that Saturn's moon Enceladus is losing heat from both poles.

The study, conducted by researchers from Oxford University, the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), and the Planetary Science Institute (PSI), overturns previous assumptions that Enceladus was only losing heat from its active South Pole, thereby increasing the odds that the icy moon could support biological activity.

“This stability means Enceladus' ocean could have existed for a long-term, potentially giving life a chance to have evolved,” explained the study's lead author, Dr Georgina Miles from SwRI and Visiting Scientist at the Department of Physics, University of Oxford, and study co-author, Oxford Prof. Carly Howett, also from the PRI, in an email to The Debrief.

The research team behind the new analysis also described Enceladus as “a top contender for extra-terrestrial life,” because it has heat, liquid water, and the right chemicals, such as complex hydrocarbons and phosphorus, needed for life on Earth. The researchers also told The Debrief that future missions to Enceladus could reveal critical data about the moon's age and the age of its subsurface ocean, which is necessary to confirm its potential habitability.

Although researchers have suspected for some time that Enceladus' ocean might support life, its long-term stability, which is required for life to evolve, has remained in question. This stability can only exist if its energy losses and gains remain in balance.

For example, if the moon's squeezing and stretching caused by Saturn's gravity creates too little energy, the surface activity would slow or even stop, resulting in the sub-surface ocean freezing. Conversely, if this gravity-induced tidal activity generates too much heat, the ocean's activity would increase, which the researchers note would also dramatically alter its environment.

To determine if the ocean could stay stable over the geological timescales needed for life to develop, the researchers examined surface temperature data captured by Cassini between 2005 and 2017.

“We used north polar late winter observations (when the north pole was in winter darkness) and summer observations permanent daylight) for this study,” Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief.

The researchers said using data captured by Cassini during the moon's deep winter (2005) and deep summer (2015) was important because heat conducted through the surface ice shell during the winter might be mistaken for the pole still cooling down from the summer. However, they note, this “wouldn't be the case” for observations collected in summer.

“Observations from both seasons were required to rule that out,” they explained, adding that warmer regions were “easier to spot” when the moon's surface is at its coldest.

According to a statement detailing the research, the team used this data to create expected surface temperature models during the polar night and compare them against infrared observations captured by Cassini's Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS). These models revealed that the surface of the North Pole, which had previously been considered inactive, was approximately seven times warmer than previous models had predicted.  The team said this discrepancy could only be explained if the sub-surface ocean was leaking heat through the icy shell.

Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief that the moon's maximum total outgoing heat “is comparable to the best current estimates” of Enceladus' tidal heating rate. In short, the heat generated and lost are a close match. The team said this finding indicates it might be possible for the sub-surface ocean to be maintained in liquid form “so long as its orbit around Saturn remains stable.”

“With current theories about ‘tidal locking,' this is entirely possible,” they added.

In the study's conclusion, the researchers suggest that a better understanding of Enceladus' age would help constrain the duration of its subsurface ocean's likely existence in liquid form. Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief that the age of all of Saturn's moons is “highly uncertain,” and noted that Enceladus “is particularly difficult to age” because it has been continually resurfaced by alternating heating and cooling episodes throughout its icy shell.

“The fate of the moon is tied to the evolution of Saturn and its interior structure,” they said, adding that “Enceladus could be up to 1 billion years old, or as young as 150 million years, with current best estimates of 200-450 million years old.” For comparison, the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.

When asked about any potential experiments that could help confirm the habitability of Enceladus' ocean, the researchers said one viable method would involve in situ measurements of the size and composition of the nanoparticles previously observed by Cassini in the plumes ejected into space from the moon's south pole. These readings could be used to “provide limits” on how long they've been at the rock-ocean interface, they explained, while also noting that “a lot of laboratory work is needed to verify this too.”

When discussing what tools or missions are necessary to confirm the moon's potential habitability, the team said their work directly highlighted the need for long-term missions to ocean worlds like Enceladus that may harbor life, “and the fact [that] the data might not reveal all its secrets until decades after it has been obtained.”

“Our estimates of the energy balance will be significantly improved by future missions to Enceladus,” Dr. Miles and Prof. Howett told The Debrief.

Only one mission is currently selected to return to Enceladus, the European Space Agency's next Large Class L4 mission. However, they said several more missions “are in the proposal stage.”

“The best information comes from Enceladus' polar regions, which are hard to view from Earth-based observing systems,” the researchers told The Debrief. “You really need to return there to observe Enceladus with a modern instruments suite to understand its habitability potential.”

The study “Endogenic heat at Enceladus' north pole” was published in Science Advances.

Comic Book Questions Answered is a feature where I answer whatever questions you folks might have about comic books (feel free to e-mail questions to me at brianc@cbr.com). Today, I will try to figure out where the new Supernatural comic book series is set.

There is an old joke that goes:

A Scout Master was teaching his boy scouts about survival in the desert. ""What are the three most important things you should bring with you in case you get lost in the desert?"" he asked. Several hands went up, and many important things were suggested such as food, matches, etc.

Then one little boy in the back eagerly raised his hand. ""Yes Timmy, what are the three most important things you would bring with you?"" asked the Scout Master. Timmy replied: ""A compass, a canteen of water, and a deck of cards."" ""Why's that Timmy?"" ""Well,"" answered Timmy, ""the compass is to find the right direction, the water is to prevent dehydration..."" ""And what about the deck of cards?"" asked the Scout Master impatiently. ""Well, Sir, as soon as you start playing Solitaire, someone is bound to come up behind you and say, ""Put that red nine on top of that black ten!""

I thought of that joke when I noted just HOW many people repeated the same thing about the new Supernatural comic book series, specifically this part about the description of the series in the solicitation:

THE BROTHERS WINCHESTER RETURN!

Get ready to hit the road again with Dean and Sam as they prowl the highways and byways of small-town America in search of demonic wrongdoing to put right!

Set between the foundational first and second seasons of the landmark television series, this brand-new title from acclaimed author GREG PAK (Darth Vader, Lilo & Stitch) and preternaturally gifted artist EDER MESSIAS (Sam Wilson: Captain America) brings readers back to where the dark magic first began - and reveals a disturbing new threat that the bickering brothers will have to face before they can return to hunting down the demon who killed their mother.

As COUNTLESS people pointed out, the comic book COULDN'T be set between the first and second seasons. Okay, so when IS the comic book set?

 Simply put, the reason why the comic book series can't be set between the first and second season is that there ISN'T a gap between the first and second seasons. The final episode of Season 1 ends on a cliffhanger. Sam and Dean Winchester's father, John, is captured, and the brothers have to go save their dad.

However, after they save him, it is revealed that the demon Azazel has possessed John. John tells Sam to kill Azazel (and thus, in the process, kill him, as well), but Sam can't bring himself to do it, and instead shoots his possessed father in the leg, which forces Azazel to leave John's body. The brothers then drive their wounded father to the hospital, but their iconic Impala is then blindsided by a semi-truck being driven by a demonically possessed truck driver.

The second season picks up right after the accident, with the Winchesters being taken to a hospital. John ultimately sacrifices himself to save Dean's life (John and Sam had gotten through the accident with minor injuries, but Dean was stuck in a coma). So clearly, the stories in this series CAN'T take place between Seasons 1 and 2.

Notably, though, writer Greg Pak gave at least one interview with the Cryptid Creator Corner in the lead-up to the release of the series where he noted that the comic book was actually set towards the end of the first season (specifically, he said, ""We're setting our stories basically near the end of the first season, when it was really a monster of the week show with these guys on the road and every episode is a self-contained story with new locations, new characters, and a new monster""), and that, of course, is where the series really HAS to be set.

The key scene in the first issue (by writer Greg Pak, artist Eder Messias, colorist Thyago Brandao, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry) is when Sam and Dean talk about not knowing where their dad is. Clearly, since Sam and Dean ARE hunting together, the stories have to take place IN the first season (as opposed to being a prequel), so it is just a matter of figuring out which episode it would have to be for them not to know where their father was.

Okay, so it can't be set in the Season 1 finale, ""Devil's Trap,"" and it can't be in the episode BEFORE that, ""Salvation,"" since that one leads directly into the finale. John is a major character in the 20th episode, ""Dead Man's Blood,"" so it can't be set after that one.

John sends his sons a message in Episode 18, ""Something Wicked,"" and could at least ARGUE that him getting a message to them doesn't preclude them from not knowing where he is, but I think it is likely safer to just go before that episode. The 17th episode doesn't have any John in it, but Episode 16 DOES, so we have to rule that one out, as well.

So I think the safest bet is to say that the series is set after the 15th episode of Season 1, ""The Benders."" Not only does it fit the timeline where they don't know where their father is (but AFTER their father let them know that their mother was killed by a demon in Episode 11's ""Scarecrow""), but it is also set in Minnesota, while the comic book is set in Wisconsin, so that seems to line up pretty well, as well.

So there ya go, folks, I'm going with the comic book series being set between Episodes 15 and 16 in Season 1 (but anywhere after Episode 11 and before Episode 16 is at least a POSSIBILE answer).

Manav Kaul as Ridwaan Sayyid, Bhasha Sumbli as Gulnaar Sayyid 

Warning: This post contains spoilers for Baramulla.Set in December 2016, against the snow-covered landscapes of Kashmir, Baramulla begins as a police mystery but unfolds into a haunting reflection on faith, trauma, and redemption. The story follows DSP Ridwaan Sayyed (Manav Kaul), a police officer transferred to the quiet town of Baramulla to investigate a string of child disappearances. Along with his wife Gulnaar (Bhasha Sumbli) and their children Noorie (Arista Mehta) and Ayaan (Rohaan Singh), he moves into an old, abandoned house—unaware that it holds memories of bloodshed and spirits that have yet to find peace.As the investigation deepens, Baramulla reveals that the real mystery lies not only in the streets but within the walls of the house—and in the conscience of those who try to bury the past.Let's break down all the major plotlines in Netflix's film Baramulla, premiering on Nov. 7.

The house that Ridwaan and his family move into once belonged, decades earlier, to a Kashmiri Pandit family, the Saprus: Kamalanand, his wife Mansi, and their children Eela and Sharad. The Pandits, a Hindu minority who lived for centuries in the predominantly Muslim region of Kashmir, were targets of persecution and a broader campaign of mass displacement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when militant separatist groups began demanding both the region's independence and its conversion into an Islamic state.During that period, thousands of Pandit families were forced to flee their homes in the valley, while others were killed by extremists. Baramulla revisits this painful chapter by situating the Sapru family massacre within this context: the house was invaded by militants, who murdered Kamalanand first, followed by Mansi and Eela, after Eela's best friend, Zainab—who was in the house at the time—revealed their location to the armed men. Only Sharad, who was away during the attack, survived, but even he disappeared shortly afterward.The tragedy turned the house into a place of eternal mourning. The souls of the Saprus—especially those of Eela and Mansi—remain trapped there, reliving the trauma of their deaths. The film shows how these spirits manifest through white flowers that appear before each child's disappearance in the present day.

At first, Ridwaan believes that local extremists have abducted the missing children to recruit them as soldiers. But as the investigation unfolds, he discovers that the truth is far more complicated.The first case involves Shoaib Ansari, the son of an influential former politician, Ismail Ansari. Shoaib vanishes during a magic show, moments after stepping inside the magician's box on stage. Soon after, another boy, Faizal, disappears while fishing at a lake. The tension escalates when Ridwaan's own daughter, Noorie, mysteriously vanishes at home—and before his eyes, another boy, Yassir, is swallowed by a tree that morphs into a dark portal.These children are being targeted by extremists Khalid and Juneid—the latter being Yassir's uncle—who plan to recruit and indoctrinate them into their militant movement, manipulating vulnerable youth with promises of faith and belonging under the orders of a mysterious leader known as Bhaijaan. Yet before the recruitment can take place, the children vanish after touching white tulips seen near the crime scenes.Those flowers are the mark of the Sapru spirits, who rescue the children before they can be captured. Taken to a spiritual realm, the children remain asleep and safe from the extremists' influence. The film, in a striking inversion of horror tropes, reveals that the ghosts aren't the kidnappers—they're the saviors.

In the final act, Baramulla ties all its threads together. Juneid and his men storm Ridwaan's house in retaliation, believing the police officer is hiding the missing children. Chaos erupts as the house—already marked by a massacre decades earlier—once again becomes the stage for violence, and the past literally repeats itself.During the assault, the Sapru spirits intervene to protect the Sayyed family, killing most of the extremists. Juneid, however, manages to escape, taking Zainab—revealed to be the same Zainab who betrayed the Saprus in the 1990s and now a teacher at Blooming Petals Public School, where all the missing children studied—as a hostage. She had gone to the Sayyed home earlier that day to say she'd been receiving threats from militants.Surrounded by police, Juneid demands a clear path to flee. In that moment, Gulnaar, now possessed by the spirit of Mansi, shoots Zainab from the second floor, while Ridwaan kills Juneid. Only after the gunfire subsides does the truth come out: Ridwaan uses Juneid's phone to call Bhaijaan, but it's Zainab's phone that starts ringing. She herself is Bhaijaan, the extremist leader who used her position as a teacher to identify and recruit vulnerable children.After Juneid and Zainab's deaths, the children who had mysteriously vanished begin to reappear in the very same places where they were last seen—unharmed, as if awakening from a long dream.

In the final minutes, Ridwaan is celebrated for solving the case. He and his family leave Baramulla and move elsewhere. Six months later, in Mumbai, the film shows Ayaan handing a small box of seashells to an older man—the same keepsake that once belonged to young Eela Sapru. The man is Sharad Sapru, the sole survivor of the massacre. In tears, he holds the box and stares into the distance, in one of the most emotional moments of the film.

The ending closes on a note of spiritual reconciliation: the Sapru spirits finally seem at peace after decades of unrest. Baramulla ultimately transcends its supernatural thriller form to become a parable about guilt, faith, and collective memory. By merging horror and political trauma, the film transforms its ghosts into metaphors for Kashmir itself—a land where the past is never buried, only silenced, and where true liberation depends on acknowledging the pain of all sides.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Jeane Dixon: The psychic who predicted JFK's assassination","https://www.history.co.uk/articles/jeane-dixon-psychic-jfk-assassination","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 05:02:56 GMT","

The assassination of John F Kennedy on 22nd November 1963 was one of the most shocking occurrences in United States history. JFK was only the fourth US president to be assassinated. 

However, at least one person apparently saw it coming long before JFK was even elected. In 1956, astrologer Jeane Dixon predicted that a Democrat would win the 1960 US presidential election before dying in office.

It's just one of many accurate forecasts to Jeane's name. So, was she just a lucky guesser, or did she genuinely have psychic powers? As with other self-proclaimed soothsayers, there's no way to be absolutely certain. 

So, it's interesting to closely assess how well Jeane's predictions have actually stood the test of time. Below, we at Sky HISTORY deliver our verdict on the woman who was once a media superstar but is now one of the lesser-known prophets.

Jeane Dixon was born Lydia Emma Pinckert in the Wisconsin city of Medford in 1904. After growing up in Missouri and California, she married James Dixon in 1939. 

In May 1956, Jeane was featured in Parade magazine, where she made some now-astonishing predictions about the 1960 election. These included that it would be ‘dominated by labor and won by a Democrat'.

Kennedy was indeed selected as the Democrat candidate, and benefitted from a recent economic recession that had damaged the ruling Republican Party's standing with voters

Jeane also reckoned that the victorious Democrat would die or be assassinated in office but ‘not necessarily in his first term'. On 22nd November 1963, less than three years into his four-year term, Kennedy was fatally shot in the Texas city of Dallas.

After the assassination, Jeane's reputation as a prophetess soared - doubtless helped along by her own efforts to publicise her correct prediction. 

She conveniently didn't draw too much attention to the fact that, as the 1960 election approached, she had actually backtracked on her original prediction. That's when she switched to opining that the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, would triumph instead.

Nixon himself became a big admirer of Jeane. The two even met at the White House in 1971. For better or worse, Nixon evidently took her alleged psychic abilities seriously during his own tenure as US president.

During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, several members of the Palestinian militant group Black September killed two Israeli athletes and took nine others hostage.

The incident, today known as the Munich Massacre, appeared to vindicate a warning Jeane had previously issued about an impending terrorist attack. Swayed by her foresight, Nixon formed a committee aimed at warding off potential terror threats on US soil.

After Ronald Reagan became US president in 1981, his wife Nancy consulted multiple astrologers for guidance, including Jeane. However, Jeane later fell out of favour at the White House, with her forecasts thought to have become more erratic and less reliable. 

Many eye-opening predictions made by Jeane Dixon have not come to pass. One example is that the Soviet Union would beat the United States to putting the first man on the Moon (this proved false despite the Soviets building an early lead in the Space Race).

Other examples include that, in the 1960s, trade union leader Walter Reuther would win the US presidency and a cancer cure would be discovered.

Jeane's projections generally became darker and more apocalyptic over time. It's a relief, then, that many of those also didn't come true. One is that a new holocaust in the 1980s would usher in Rome's re-emergence as a leading hub of culture, religion and learning.

Though many of Jeane Dixon's predictions were proven wrong, the fame she garnered after the JFK tragedy made her a pop culture icon. 

This paradox led mathematician John Allen Paulos to coin the term ‘the Jeane Dixon effect'. This refers to a phenomenon where a soothsayer with many inaccurate predictions still becomes reputable due to the greater publicity surrounding their few correct calls. 

Jeane Dixon died of cardiac arrest in 1997 at the age of 93. Her popularity fuelled the public's interest in psychics, effectively elevating more of them to celebrity status.

The horrific murder of a Devon widow who was bludgeoned with a cider bottle and strangled with her own stockings is among 1,000 cold cases that have been highlighted in a new crime map.

Every case has been the subject of a major police investigation, with some dating back to the pre-war era and others occurring in the last decade.

This exclusive list was compiled from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, supported by research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives.

Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers with no apparent motive.

They include the murder of Esther Soper in 1976. After the death of her husband, the former dockyard worker moved to Mutley Plain and became a member of the Plymouth Brethren, a non-conformist Christian movement.

Esther's body was found on New Year's Day, 1976 in the hallway of her house. She had been bludgeoned with a cider bottle and strangled to death with her own stockings.

The killer had then wrapped her body in a curtain.

While most of the country was waking up after over-indulging the night before, the 51-year-old grandmother was the least likely of anyone in Mutley to have been suffering anything like a hangover. She lived alone and followed an austere, pious lifestyle.

The idea that she would have entertained an evening of debauchery, drinking alcohol and enjoying a lascivious night of passion with a gentleman friend at her small terraced home would have been completely implausible, preposterous even.

The widow, mother and grandmother would have most likely seen out 1975 doing her domestic chores, perhaps looking back at her life and forward to the new year and the changes it would inevitably bring. Perhaps she took a few moments to fondly remember her husband, who had worked at Plymouth's dockyard. Perhaps she paused, thinking about his death which led her to move from their home in Western College Road into a small terraced house in Trematon Terrace, behind Mutley Plain.

At the time Mrs Soper was in the process of trying to sell her home and it is possible she was tidying in preparation for visits by potential buyers. She had already shown her home to a number of people in the weeks leading up to her untimely death and more were awaiting appointments to view the property.

However, the alarm was raised at around 9pm on New Year's Day when she failed to show up to a Plymouth Brethren meeting. Two of the group's members had called at her house to check she was all right – but found her dead in the hallway, wrapped in her own curtain. At the time detectives described it as a ""frenzied attack"".

Due to the suspicion over potential house-buyers, officers made a large number of inquiries with estate agents , particularly in the North Hill area of Plymouth.

By August 1976 around 33,000 people, as far afield as Europe, America and the Commonwealth, had been interviewed in connection with the investigation

Her murder file has undergone a series of reviews over the years. As forensic science has moved on - to levels which would have been considered pure science fiction back in the 1970s - and police have made attempts to trace her killer. One such move came in 1997 when efforts were made to establish a DNA 'fingerprint' of her killer which could then be cross-referenced with the national DNA database.

Police sent away items of her clothing, including her tights and underwear, to the forensic laboratory in Chepstow in the hope that traces of alien DNA could be found. But experts failed to find anything other than the DNA of Mrs Soper herself.

In 2004, retired senior detective Barry Joliff reviewed the case. He told the media how Mrs Soper did not socialise with the rest of the local community and that at the time of her murder, Mrs Soper was trying to sell her house in Mutley. As such, she had made a number of appointments which were crucial to the original inquiry.

One such appointment was made by a man named ""Clifford Sparks"", said to be aged between 35 and 50. He was set to view the house on New Year's Day at 5pm. He'd even visited the house a few days before.

There were a large number of men by the name of Clifford Sparks identified and interviewed throughout the South West, and even further afield. But police failed to find any clues to suggest a link to Mrs Soper, leading them to believe that name may have been fabricated. In February 1976 the Sunday Mirror noted that police had ""questioned nine men in Britain with that name and drawn a blank.""

Other Devon cases highlighted in the map include the shocking murder of 14-year-old Kate Bushell, who was knifed by an attacker as she walked a neighbour's dog in 1997 in Exwick, and the disappearance of Genette Tate, who vanished while delivering newspapers in Aylesbeare in 1978.

She is presumed dead, but her body has never been found.

You can search our interactive map to find out if there are any unsolved murders near you.

The online map has been produced to support the special publication Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders Vol II: Midnight Stalkers.

It seeks to reexamine cold cases that have been held in the files of police forces nationwide, in some cases for decades.

The publication includes a full timeline of 1,000 unsolved murders, dating from the pre-war period to the last decade, alongside more than 20 in-depth features.

Many of the cases are so famous that they remain locked in the national psyche, such as the Bible John murders that terrified Scotland during the 1960s.

Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel Harper and Alice Pittman, who were both strangled during the wartime blackout.

Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

A few weeks ago, I 
    
        published results
     
    from six waves of the massive Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) annual survey of undergraduate students. 
    The data were unequivocal: the share of students identifying as a gender other than male or female—that is, as non-binary—peaked in 2023 and has halved in the two years since. This is a stunning reversal in the culture that will reverberate through society and politics in the coming years.


The survey captures over 50,000 students per year from nearly 250 leading American universities. Its size guarantees statistical power and enables us to look at small subgroups like trans or queer people. FIRE data is a random sample, a small percentage of each university's student body, and I wanted to be sure it triangulated with two surveys capturing a much greater share of the total. One comes from the elite Andover Phillips prep school near Boston; the other is run by Brown University's student newspaper. Both interview a far higher share of their target pool than FIRE surveys (up to 50 percent for Brown freshmen, and 75 percent in the Andover case). As Figure 1 shows, these surveys corroborate the “peak trans” pattern in the FIRE data, revealing a rapid decline since 2023.

I expand more fully on these findings in my University of Buckingham Centre for Heterodox Social Science report, which also found that the decline in non-binary identification was matched by a 10-point drop in unconventional sexual identification. Namely, in students identifying their sexual orientation as something other than heterosexual or homosexual—such as pansexual, queer, questioning, bisexual, or asexual. Many students who identify as neither male nor female also identify as sexually non-conforming, so the correlation trend is unsurprising.

Sexual orientation has been measured in more youth surveys for longer than gender identity has been. While gay and lesbian share remained flat through 2020 to 2025, Figure 2 shows that the broader non-heterosexual group—covering bisexual, queer, pansexual, asexual, questioning, and other labels—rose steeply to 2023 and then fell across a wide range of surveys. The non-heterosexual proportion peaked at around 30 percent overall, reaching as high as 40 percent at progressive-leaning Ivy League schools like Brown and 50 percent in liberal arts colleges such as Smith College. Importantly, the decline in non-conforming sexual orientation parallels the decline in non-conforming gender identity, suggesting a common underlying dynamic.

A thread on 𝕏 summarizing my findings went viral—retweeted by accounts such as Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., Matt Walsh, and others, and has been viewed 19 million times. Beyond my piece and interview in UnHerd, it was covered by National Review, Laura Ingraham (Fox News), and other outlets.

Two main critiques followed. First, that “non-binary isn't trans.” Second, that the analysis erred by not using weighted data. Let's consider both.

Some trans-skeptical activists such as “Billboard Chris” Elston worried that declaring “trans decline” could undercut the political momentum behind the campaign against gender ideology. Their substantive argument is that non-binary people who do not identify as male or female differ from binary trans individuals who do identify as male or female, just the opposite sex from the one in which they were born. Benjamin Ryan, a health and science journalist, added that the findings were based on the “false presumption” that trans and non-binary were linked.

However, in practice, trans advocacy organizations explicitly include non-binary identities as part of trans. Second, even if one restricts “trans” to binary switchers, many who change their gender from female to male, or vice-versa, are likely to pass through a non-binary stage of gender indeterminacy. Conceptually, non-binary identity functions as a gateway to binary transition.

Trends in the two should, and do, correlate. On the Cooperative Election Study (CES), where people are asked whether they are trans separately from their gender, those who identify as trans are nearly 70 times more likely to identify as non-binary than a person who does not identify as trans, a monumental correlation. While it's possible for non-binary to fall while binary trans holds steady, the CES data, summarized by Jean Twenge, shows that the two trends move together, with trans and non-binary both in decline.

Progressive commentators, led by Erin Reed, who based her rebuttal on the analysis of blogger Jacob Eliason, claimed the analysis was “dead on arrival” because it did not use survey weights. (Weights correct demographic imbalances in the survey sample to approximate population-level estimates.) Eliason applied weights and showed that doing so flipped my trend. Now, instead of trans decline, non-binary was stable at 2 percent from 2020 to 2023 then surged to 10 percent in 2024-25. Alongside some friendly statisticians commenting generally about the importance of weighting, and FIRE statisticians saying weights should be applied, they felt they had a “gotcha.”

But weighting can distort rather than clarify when applied to small subgroups like trans respondents. Weights artificially adjust samples to match population demographics by sex, race, and institution. That's useful for FIRE when comparing institutions in particular years in college free speech rankings. Over time, however, changes in sampling frames and weighting formulas can introduce arbitrary noise, rendering weighted data considerably more error-prone than raw unweighted results.

Eliason's weighted time series produced an erratic spike in 2024 because College Pulse, who conduct the FIRE surveys, suddenly revised their gender weights. I had run the data both ways and found that weighting produced erratic results while unweighted data aligned with the more representative Andover and Brown trends.

After I explained these issues in a rebuttal, Eliason conceded that the weighting was problematic. He then pivoted to claim that unweighted samples overrepresented certain graduating classes. Yet a fixed-effects regression controlling for college, cohort, financial aid, socioeconomic background, race, religion, and ideology can account for this, and yields the same profile as the chart I initially circulated.

Meanwhile, FIRE, having examined the assumptions underlying their data over time, revised their view, cautioning that weighting was not actually the recommended approach in this case.

Following the heated debate sparked by my 𝕏 thread, Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, and arguably the leading quantitative youth trends researcher in the country, made an important discovery. Using data from the CES that I had overlooked, she was able to examine the question of transgender identity separately from gender identity. Her conclusion:

These findings echoed the Census Bureau's official Household Pulse survey, which revealed a large decline in youth non-binary identification in the first half of 2024. More than that, Twenge found, as I did, that the youngest cohorts were least likely to identify as trans, portending future decline in transgenderism. Her intervention turned the tide with skeptics such as Benjamin Ryan, and informed the work of Colin Wright, who followed up with an Opinion Editorial in the Wall Street Journal declaring trans a social contagion.

A few weeks later, Twenge analyzed data from the Monitoring the Future survey, which surveys teens as young as age 13. The share of 8th, 10th and 12th graders identifying as neither male nor female dropped in half between 2022 and 2024, with the change sharpest among the 8th graders. Twenge writes that the trends confirm a broader pattern in which new patterns arise first among the youngest, spreading later and less forcefully to older teens.

Altogether, Twenge's analysis and my data, spanning 6 major youth surveys, present a robust and compelling case against attempts to downplay the reality of the decline.

Why is the trans curve bending downward? Are young people becoming more conservative and religious? No. The same FIRE student surveys that show non-binary gender and queer sexuality dropping like a stone find no shift to the political right over time, and no rise in the share affiliating with a religion. Students are also no more supportive of free speech, and no more opposed to shouting down speakers, than they were in 2020. They are as woke as ever, just less trans and queer.

Not only that, but the rise and fall pattern for gender non-conformity took place on both red and blue state campuses, among both liberal and conservative students, albeit from different baselines. At ultra-liberal Oberlin College, for example, the share of students identifying as non-binary plunged 20 points between 2023 and 2025. On Ivy League campuses, the collapse was more pronounced than it was among students at less prestigious institutions.

Could a decline in mental health issues explain the decline of trans identification? There is evidence that student mental health improved substantially between 2023 (when five mental health questions were first introduced in the FIRE data) and 2025. The share who said they were anxious most or all of the time declined from 38 to 28 percent while the proportion who said they were depressed fell from 17 to 10 percent. The CDC finds an improvement in mental health among high school students between 2021 and 2023, the latest data point. Statistical analysis shows that better mental health helps to explain only part of the decline in non-binary gender identification.

Most of the change in gender identification is not accounted for by better mental health, with mental health issues also declining among non-binary students. Instead, it seems to largely be an independent youth fashion that operates on a plane that is separate from politics and mental health.

Faced with mounting evidence that trans is in decline, some progressive and transactivist writers have shifted to arguing that Republican attacks on their movement have pushed trans people back into the closet. However, the FIRE data shows that non-binary students self-censor their opinions less than other students, and feel as free as anyone else to voice their views on transgender issues, with no change after Donald Trump took office for the second time. Accounting for the political views of non-binary students and their peers, there is no evidence that the speech climate for non-binary students worsened on red state campuses more than blue state campuses after 2024. This is not about trans people going back into the closet.

The trans downturn might not have been caused by politics, but it has major political implications. First, the data suggest that trans was a social contagion that rose and fell. That means health practitioners who went along with transitioning permitted ideology to trump their responsibility to safeguard their patients from a fad, and to do no harm.

Secondly, since the 2010s, the rise of trans and queer identity has been umbilically connected to a progressive story of the inevitable progress of marginalized groups remaking the mainstream. Cultural reversals profane the progressive left's eschatological “arc of history overcoming resistance” narrative. A movement based on millenarian inevitability cannot accept a loss in the court of public opinion without undermining the sacred narrative. Youth gender identity, alongside public opinion toward natal males accessing female spaces, have both moved against the progressive narrative in recent years. This has opened up a cleft between an insurgent anti-woke center-left and the establishment woke left that continues to roil the Democratic Party.

What the Fairlife phenomenon tells us about the dairy industry.

 Listen to Odd Lots on Apple PodcastsListen to Odd Lots on SpotifySubscribe to the newsletter

Protein seems to be everywhere these days, with brands from Starbucks to Pepsi jumping on the trend. But the obsession with protein may have started earlier — with a humble dairy product that defied the broader decline in US milk consumption. Fairlife, which uses a specialized filtering process to boost protein and cut sugar and lactose in its milk products, helped spark the modern protein craze that's unfolded alongside the rise of Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs. Since Coca-Cola acquired the brand in 2020, Fairlife has become one of the company's biggest growth drivers. Yet its success also highlights deeper challenges facing the American dairy industry, where per capita milk consumption continues to fall. So how did Fairlife buck the trend? And what does its story reveal about the future of US dairy? On this episode, we speak with Corey Geiger, lead dairy economist at CoBank.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

US Government Shutdown:

Volunteers sort donated food items at New York Common Pantry in New York on Oct. 31. 

The Trump administration asked the US Supreme Court to intervene on an emergency basis Friday night to block the transfer of $4 billion in food-aid funds for needy Americans.

The filing came as a federal appeals court declined for now to say the US could keep making only partial payments during the government shutdown while the administration challenges a Rhode Island judge's directive to fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, at 100%.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

President Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.

""I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,"" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.

The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.

The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.

Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a ""non-starter.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.

Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.

In the same post, Trump reiterated his call for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.

Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying they would not support a change this week as Trump called for his party to exercise what he called ""the Nuclear Option"" on the rule.

Ukraine is facing widespread power outages after Russia launched a massive overnight aerial assault across the country, killing at least two people, Ukrainian authorities say.
    


            Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky, with the latest assault coming as many were asleep.
    


            State energy company Centrenergo described the barrage as “the most massive strike on our thermal power plants since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.”
    


            The Russian attacks came as temperatures dropped into the single-figures celsius across Ukraine.
    


            “The enemy is once again launching massive attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure,” said energy minister Svitlana Grynchuk.
    


            Emergency power cuts had been introduced in a number of regions, she added, and would be cancelled when the power system stabilizes. Residents of Kyiv face extensive power cuts through the weekend, according to schedules published by energy companies.
    


            Two people were killed and 11 injured by a drone attack that struck a nine-story apartment building in the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine. Video captured the moment the drone struck in the darkness.
    


            “There's nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.
    


            “I don't know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.
    


            “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.
    


            Altogether, ten people have been killed by Russian strikes in the last 24 hours, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service, and nearly 50 injured.
    


            Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.
    


            “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs [drones] have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.
    


            “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”
    


            The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriots, an air defense system that has proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.
    


            Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.
    


            Russia's defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”
    


Russian forces are poised to finally capture Pokrovsk, a symbolically important victory with a heavy cost



            The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production and caused extensive power cuts across the country. Ukrainian officials have said they'll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.
    


            “Despite the enemy's plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.
    


            The Ukrainian military and security services have also stepped up drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.
    


            On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.
    


            A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.

LONDON, November 8. /TASS/. The European Union plans to create a specialized center ""for democratic resilience"" in order to ""counter disinformation"" allegedly coming from Russia, China, and other countries, the Guardian said, citing a leaked EU document.

The newspaper specified that the document, initiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is slated to be published on November 12.

According to the Guardian, the ""European Commission intends for the center to bring together expertise across the EU and from countries seeking to join the bloc to fight foreign information manipulation and interference.""

The newspaper insists that the European Commission sees the biggest threat in purported Russia's ""hybrid attacks, waging a battle of influence against Europe,"" naming China as another source of a ""disinformation threat.""

""The center would be a hub for EU institutions and member states to share information and early warnings, as well as raising public awareness about foreign governments seeking to manipulate information,"" the Guardian noted.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

As tens of thousands of military personnel work without pay and others are furloughed, a local pantry sees its numbers increasing as restaurants are losing customers

When Jane Doorley and her husband Bill arrived at the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry they help run on 28 October, they couldn't get into the parking lot, such was the number of cars belonging to people seeking food.

“Our numbers are way up. Last Friday was really bad too,” says Jane. “Around 250 families, including 300 children, come to the pantry every day it's open.”

The pantry is situated a half mile from Wright-Patterson air force base – the largest single-site employer in Ohio with 38,000 workers – outside Dayton, Ohio, which has been rocked by the federal government shutdown.

With tens of thousands of military personnel working without pay, and local contractors and civilian workers furloughed, the wider regional economy is in trouble.

About 8,100 civilian workers at the Air Force Material Command, headquartered at the Wright-Patterson air force base, have received furlough notices, according to local media.

The effects of this are being starkly seen at food resource centers.

“In September, we were probably averaging 250 families a week. This week, I anticipate we'll probably help 500 families,” says Doorley.

“We're seeing this heightened anxiety. You can just feel it when people come. Everybody wants to come at the beginning [of the day], for fear that the food is going to run out.”

For decades, the military has been regarded as a stable source of employment, even through recessions and other economic crises. For a part of the industrial midwest that's never fully recovered from the collapse of manufacturing activity in the late 20th century, the air force base has been a lifeline, fueling an additional 40,000 off-base, indirect jobs.

Every year, the base generates nearly $16bn for the local economy. Dotted along streets outside the facility, which spans 8,000 acres, are dozens of military-adjacent and defense companies such as Lockheed Martin, GE Aviation and Northrop Grumman, which have provided decades of stable employment, largely through contracts from the federal government that are paid for by taxpayers. Startups such as Joby Aviation have recently flocked to the area to take advantage of access to air force facilities and intellectual property.

But now, local businesses are feeling the full effect of the shutdown.

“We've really lost most of our customers because of the government shutdown. It used to be really busy but now it's empty,” says Tik Taew, who works at Tik's Thai Express, a restaurant located a short distance from the base that's been in business for more than 15 years.

“Weekday mornings are usually our busiest time, but right now, it's really quiet; we're only getting five to six [customers].”

Across the country, around three-fourths of a million civilians work with the US military. Around half are thought to have been currently furloughed. Reports from the Trump administration made public on 4 November suggested many of those furloughed may not be legible for back-pay, or that it could be used as a negotiating tactic with Democratic party leaders working to end the shutdown.

Democrats have refused to sign a funding deal to end the shutdown unless subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which provides medical care at a reduced cost for millions of Americans, is renewed into 2026, a measure the White House opposes.

While a last-minute measure late last month saw the Trump administration pull together $5.3bn to ensure military service members were paid on 1 November, avoiding an historic first, experts say service members are unlikely to be paid at the next payroll date if a deal isn't reached.

“[B]y November 15 our troops and service members who are willing to risk their lives aren't going to be able to get paid,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Face the Nation on 26 October.

Polls show that more Americans blame Trump and the Republican party than Democrats for the shutdown, which is now the longest in US history. And yet, a plurality of voters in Ohio, Greene county, where the base is situated, members of the air force and military veterans as a whole, broadly vote for Republican political candidates.

The air force base isn't the only large military entity in the Dayton area to be closed by the shutdown.

The National Museum of the US Air Force, the world's largest military aviation museum that's adjacent to the air force base has also been closed since 1 October. More than 66,000 people from around the country visit the museum every month, adding millions of dollars to the local economy by staying at local hotels and dining at restaurants.

Local county authorities are having to add millions of additional dollars to support food banks. The Dayton Foodbank, which includes a network of 122 local pantries, has delivered 500 emergency food boxes to the base since the start of the shutdown.

“While base civilians, who are still unpaid during the shutdown, might be living above poverty levels while receiving a paycheck, they may not have the funds needed easily available via savings or a credit card in the case of an emergency like now,” says Lee Lauren Truesdale of the Dayton Foodbank.

One local restaurant is offering a $5 menu to military members to help them offset the financial strain. Others are giving away free cooked meals.

“While going unpaid, these civilian employees still must pay day to day expenses such as rent, daycare (to hold spots in anticipation of returning to work), buy food, pay medical bills, car bills [and] utilities.”

All the while, the Trump White House has worked to undermine these groups.

Thousands of pantries across the country, including the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, used to receive financial support worth a total of $117m through the federal government's Emergency Food and Shelter Program, but that was taken away in January.

“That's on a pause, probably forever,” says Doorley. “We [now] rely entirely on donations.”

At the Fairborn Fish Food Pantry, which has initiated dedicated days for military families, Doorley says meat is the number one sought after commodity.

“The donations have increased a little bit, but we go and buy meat for 500 families a week. That is not sustainable for us,” she says, adding that it's time for politicians in Washington DC to find a solution.

“It's time for the two sides to recognize that we are all Americans and we have people who are hungry and need help. [They need to] get together and somehow find a middle ground to move things forward and help those in our community.”

Nov.10 to Nov.16

As he moved a large stone that had fallen from a truck near his field, 65-year-old Lin Yuan (林淵) felt a sudden urge. He fetched his tools and began to carve.

The recently retired farmer had been feeling restless after a lifetime of hard labor in Yuchi Township (魚池), Nantou County. His first piece, Stone Fairy Maiden (石仙姑), completed in 1977, was reportedly a representation of his late wife.

This version of how Lin began his late-life art career is recorded in Nantou County historian Teng Hsiang-yang's (鄧相揚) 2009 biography of him. His expressive work eventually caught the attention of a local magazine, who invited newspaper reporters to visit in April 1980.

Early reports often compared Lin to Hung Tung (洪通), another untrained laborer who suddenly took up painting at the age of 50 and sparked a national craze several years earlier (see “Taiwan in Time: Brief stardom of the ‘Mad Artist,'”Feb. 19, 2023). Lin tried to visit Hung in 1981, but the reclusive Hung refused to see him. 

Lin remained prolific until his death in 1991, leaving behind at least 10,000 works spanning sculpture, painting, drawing, installation and embroidery. Often signing his works as a “genius,” his motto was, “No political party, no artistic style, only my own ideas.” (無黨無派，自我思想).

LIFE OF LABOR

Born in 1913, Lin spent his entire life in the rural settlement of Jiadaokeng (加道坑) in Nantou County. His parents were poor tenant farmers, and he had a sickly elder brother and mentally disabled younger brother to care for. After his mother died when he was five, he began helping with chores such as cooking, planting vegetables, feeding livestock and cowherding. 

Lin didn't start school until the age of 11, and he had to quit just two months later due his elder brother's death. He later taught himself how to write his name, some basic characters and numbers, which often feature in his drawings.

He began farming at 15, but as tenant farmers, his family could barely scrape by. Lin also did odd jobs such as stone cutting, construction, coffin board cutting and camphor oil processing. When there was no work, he gathered firewood, vines and shoulang yams and carried them to Puli (埔里) — a three hour round trip on foot — to sell, often making multiple trips a day. To save money, he often made his own tools, developing a fine craftsmanship and understanding of different materials. 

At 23, Lin married Chen Chiu-mei (陳秋梅), convincing her reluctant father that he would treat her well and paying the bride price in installments. They had eight children, with Lin breaking conventions by personally delivering the last six after observing the midwife. 

Lin continued to show his resourcefulness during hard times, and finally at the age of 32 was able to buy the land his family farmed on.

ARTISTIC AWAKENING

Chen died in 1968. Lin never remarried, raising his children alone. After his original house was destroyed in a flood, he bought new land and built a three-sided courtyard home. 

His children convinced him to retire in 1977. At first, he entertained himself by crafting toys for his grandchildren, but that same year, he began sculpting. His son was supportive, even helping him find more stones to work on. Curious villagers gathered to watch, chiding him as a fool who didn't choose a more lucrative hobby.

But Lin lost himself in his art. Soon his entire property, and even the roadsides nearby, were scattered with his figurative sculptures depicting all sorts of animals, people and historical or mythical figures.

By that time, the Hung Tung craze was on the downswing. “Discovered” in 1972, Hung's rise coincided with the “nativist movement” (鄉土運動), which championed local culture and identity as Taiwan's international status declined. As writers turned to realism to depict everyday Taiwanese life, musicians ventured to rural areas to document traditional folk songs. Hung's destitute background and reputation as an eccentric, self-taught genius fit right in, culminating in several high profile exhibitions in 1976. However, Hung shunned the spotlight and retreated to his village soon after.

In 1978, county councilor Huang Ping-sung (黃炳松) founded the community magazine Puli Local Life (埔里鄉情). Two years later, magazine board member Chan Yuan-ho (詹元和) noticed Lin's sculptures while delivering goods in the area. Chan informed Huang upon returning to Puli, and on April 9, 1980, they visited Lin with a United Daily News reporter. Huang was enamored with the work, buying everything — 53 stone sculptures and eight wood carvings — for about NT$30,000 apiece.

SECOND HUNG TUNG?

Lin's fame spread after the United Daily News published an article the following day, describing his art as “rustic and unpretentious,” and dubbing him the “second Hung Tung.” 

Media outlets flocked to the remote hamlet, and Huang also invited master sculptors Chu Ming (朱銘) and Yang Ying-feng (楊英風) to meet Lin; both praised his work. 

Chu Ming reportedly told Huang in a stern tone, “Lin Yuan must be given space for pure creation — both in his mindset and surroundings. He must never be distracted by worldly fame or fortune, and you must not put any restrictions on his creative freedom. Just provide him with materials and let him create freely.”

On July 20, 1980, Lin's work was displayed for the first time in the garden of Puli mayor Chou Hsien-wen (周顯文). He created a special piece for the occasion, depicting the 1930 Wushe Incident, an anti-Japanese uprising by the Indigenous Seediq that was brutally suppressed.

That winter, Lin traveled abroad for the first time, visiting South Korea and Japan with Huang. Lin was particularly inspired by Hokkaido's Showa Shinzan volcanic dome, and upon returning home he visited his son-in-law's factory to obtain screws and scrap metal, producing his first installation within a few days. 

In the following years, Lin's reputation spread internationally, and French painter Jean Debuffet donated photographs of his work to the Collection de L'Art Brut in Lausanne. On Nov. 12, 1982, Lin had his first solo show in Taipei's Spring Gallery, followed by exhibitions in Taichung, Tainan and Hong Kong.

In 1984, Huang began creating the New Era Sculpture Park in Puli. Lin traveled there daily, creating several large-scale works as well as more than 1,000 smaller sculptures, installations, wood carvings and paintings. It opened to the public in 1987.

Lin continued exhibiting and creating until his death from pancreatic cancer in September 1991. Eight years later, both his studio and the park were severely damaged in the 921 Earthquake. The park has since evolved into a resort and spa, featuring a museum dedicated to Lin.

Editor's note: The story was updated to include an additional statement from law enforcement. 

The commander of a Ukrainian unmanned systems battalion was charged with negligence after holding an award ceremony for soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast earlier this month, despite a ban.

The military gathering was hit by Russia, the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said on Nov. 7.

The strike killed 12 servicemen and seven civilians, while 36 others were injured, according to the Prosecutor General's Office. 

According to the investigators, the officer organized on Nov. 1 a formal assembly and award ceremony for over 100 servicemen in front-line areas of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, including locations where civilians were present.

Although the General Staff had prohibited such gatherings, the commander neither halted the event nor dispersed the soldiers during an air raid alert, the SBI said.

At that time, Russia reportedly struck the assembly points with three Geran drones and two Iskander missiles.

Earlier, the 30th Marine Corps, which includes the 35th Marine Brigade, confirmed that its service members had been targeted in the recent Russian attack.

Kostiantyn Huzenko, Ukrainian photographer and serviceman with the 35th Separate Marine Brigade, was also killed in the strike, Huzenko's friends told the Kyiv Independent.

A court in Dnipro took the commander into custody, the SBI said later on Nov. 8.

If found guilty, he could face up to eight years in prison. 

Similar incidents have happened before, where Russia killed elite Ukrainian soldiers during award ceremonies in front-line areas. This Soviet-era practice has been criticized by both President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian military.

Following a series of Russian attacks on training grounds and military centers, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi announced in July that gathering troops and equipment or stationing soldiers in tent camps is banned.

All thermal power plants (TPP) operated by Ukraine's state-owned energy company Centrenergo are down following ""the largest Russian attack"" which targeted all of them, the company announced on Nov. 8.

According to the company, the same thermal power plants that had been restored after attacks in 2024 were struck again, with multiple Russian drones targeting them ""each minute"" overnight on Nov. 8.

Ukrainian forces downed 406 out of the 458 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched 45 cruise and ballistic missiles, nine of which were downed, the statement said.

Centrenergo operates three thermal power plants, which were essentially all the company's assets: Trypillia in Kyiv Oblast, Zmiivska in Kharkiv Oblast, and Vuhlehirska in Donetsk Oblast.

Last spring, Centrenergo announced that the Zmiivska thermal power plant had beed completely destroyed. On July 25, 2022, Russian troops occupied the Vuhlehirska thermal power plant.

The recent attack destroyed all restored capacity, leaving the plants generating no power, the company said.

""For safety reasons, we remained silent, but we did everything possible to ensure that Ukrainians got through the last winter with electricity and heat, overcoming hellish challenges to successfully start the current heating season,"" Centrenergo said.

""Less than a month has passed since the previous strike, and last night the enemy again hit all of our power generation facilities simultaneously.""

Throughout the fall, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure as it attempts to plunge the country into yet another harsh winter. One of the worst strikes on Oct. 3 and 5 wiped out around 60% of Ukraine's gas production sites.

During the Nov. 8 attack Russia primarily targeted the cities of Kremenchuk in Poltava Oblast, Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv, causing emergency power cuts in several regions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday accused foreign-owned meat packers of driving up the price of beef in the U.S. and asked the Department of Justice to open an investigation.

The Republican president announced the move on social media days after his party suffered losses in key elections in which the winning Democratic candidates focused relentlessly on the public's concerns about the cost of living. But experts said it's unlikely that an investigation would result in lower prices at grocery stores, and a trade group representing meat packers said they're not to blame.

Trump did not present evidence for his claims, writing on social media that “I have asked the DOJ to immediately begin an investigation into the Meat Packing Companies who are driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.”

He said he was taking the action to help ranchers, who were recently angered by his suggestion that the U.S. would buy Argentine beef to bring down stubbornly high prices for American consumers.

“We will always protect our American Ranchers, and they are being blamed for what is being done by Majority Foreign Owned Meat Packers, who artificially inflate prices, and jeopardize the security of our Nation's food supply,” Trump said.




Beef prices have soared to record levels in part after drought and years of low prices led to the smallest U.S. herd size in decades. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, have also curbed imports.

Meanwhile, demand for beef remains strong. Prices are high because consumers want to eat it, and they're willing and able to pay for it, said Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University.

Tonsor said the ownership mix in the meat packing industry has not changed significantly in the past four years.

Concentration in the meat packing business has been a longtime concern for farmers and politicians on both sides of the aisle. Four major meatpacking companies dominate the beef market in the United States.

There's no evidence to back up claims that the big packers have undue market power and use it to drive up beef prices, said Derrell Peel, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University.

“The packing industry in this country has been investigated and researched for 50 years, and it's been an issue for over a hundred years, at least, for some producers,” Peel said, expressing skepticism that consumers or producers will benefit from the investigation Trump announced.

“If the outcome is to break up the big packers, the outcome will be higher beef prices for consumers, and lower cattle prices for producers,” Peel said.

Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Friday that he and fellow Republican senators Cindy-Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Tim Sheehy of Montana visited the White House earlier in the day to speak with Trump about recent volatility in the beef market. Mullin said Trump agreed to have the Justice Department look at the issue.

Mullin blamed meat processors, saying that “we're seeing the same exact game play again out” as a 2019 lawsuit against large meatpackers for violating antitrust laws.

JBS, which is based in Brazil, is the largest U.S. beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees.

The company has faced price-fixing charges before. In 2022, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement with grocery stores and wholesalers who accused JBS, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods and other companies of working together to suppress the number of cattle being slaughtered in order to drive up beef prices. 

JBS did not admit wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Messages seeking comment were left Friday with JBS USA.

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., last week called on the administration to renew an investigation into meat packers that was opened in Trump's first term. Cramer's office said he has pushed for such a probe since March 2020. 

The Meat Institute, a trade group that represents JBS and other meat producers, said its industry is being pinched by the price of cattle, despite record prices for U.S. beef.

“For more than a year, beef packers have been operating at a loss due to a tight cattle supply and strong demand,” Meat Institute President and CEO Julie Anna Potts said in a statement. “The beef industry is heavily regulated, and market transactions are transparent. The government's own data from USDA confirms that the beef packing sector is experiencing catastrophic losses and experts predict this will continue into 2026.”

Trump's accusations have renewed a bipartisan presidential fight against rising food prices.

Then-President Joe Biden talked with independent farmers and ranchers about initiatives to reduce food prices by increasing competition within the meat industry. And then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in winning reelection last year, used her campaign to vow to crack down on food producers and major supermarkets' “ price gouging.”

“Grown men with big d***s … in the women's locker room!”

That's what singer Tish Hyman yelled about during an argument at Gold's Gym in Los Angeles, in a video that has since made national news. Footage of Hyman confronting gym employees and a biological male who identifies as a transgender woman named Alexis Black has gone viral and sparked furious debate online.

Hyman's complaint is simple. She felt uncomfortable that Black and other biological males who identify as transgender had observed her naked in the Gold's Gym women's locker room and didn't understand why people with male genitalia were allowed in. Black, in response, argued that Black was “registered as female with gym,” touted Black's own “self-feminine power,” and dismissed Hyman's concerns as “fearmongering.” Notably, Black doesn't appear at all feminine and has been taking hormones for less than a year.

Most people online sided with Hyman in the initial dispute. But then, disturbing revelations about Black's past came out that not only bolster Hyman's concerns but also reveal the utter lunacy of Democratic gender policies.

As it turns out, Black has a dark criminal past. According to the New York Post's reporting, “Black, formerly Grant Freeman, pleaded guilty in 2022 to savagely beating his wife Alexis Freeman, causing a compound fractured jaw among other serious injuries.” Black then later took on the Alexis name as part of his transgender persona. And that's not all. “Black had been convicted of both domestic violence and drug trafficking in the past, and has faced a slew of other charges, including resisting arrest, records show,” the New York Post further reports.

That's right: The person making women uncomfortable in the gym locker room is also reportedly a convicted domestic abuser who beat women. But what's actually insane is that California law quite literally entitles Black to use the women's locker room, Black's criminal past and the obvious threat Black poses to women be damned. So don't get too angry at Gold's Gym, it's not really its fault!

According to the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, “Under the Unruh Civil Rights Act … people who are transgender or nonbinary have the right to full and equal participation in a gym or spa experience, including access to locker rooms and other spaces based on their gender identity.”

Legally speaking, this is entirely up to a person's self-identification. In fact, the ACLU says that California law prohibits businesses from requiring a “driver's license, birth certificate, court order, medical record, or other identification to access gender-segregated facilities or amenities.”

Yup: Anybody who simply declares themselves a woman or even nonbinary is entitled to walk into a women's locker room at their whim, under California state law. And that law doesn't even include exceptions or prohibitions for convicted criminals!

What could possibly go wrong? 

Well, just ask Hyman and the other women like her who've suffered because of the legal erosion of women's rights in the name of “progressive” social policy.

WHAT WILL AND WON'T MATTER IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS FROM TUESDAY'S RESULTS

Of course, the vast majority of transgender people with gender dysphoria are no threat to anyone. But these self-ID policies open the door to predators and make it easy for them to legally prey upon women — in fact, they secure their right to do so as a matter of civil rights law!

Most people now see that transgender activism went much, much too far. That's why even the likes of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) are signalling a desire to moderate on some related issues, such as allowing biological males to compete in women's sports. But we can't let them escape responsibility for the real harm their extremist policies have done.

Beaches, balmy weather, bustling nightlife, and, of course, attractive savings on capital gains taxes.

The day traders of San Juan seem to have it all.

That, at least, is the story that has circulated among young investors, as the number of traders who have relocated to Puerto Rico has surged in recent years. They're drawn by the tax advantages, and the fact that, if you squint, it really just looks like you're on permanent vacation.

But, for traders who have joined the exodus, being happy in Puerto Rico is tougher than it seems at first glance. Many who make the move often say that life isn't quite what they expected, even though they are, after all, saving a lot of money.

Anand Sanghvi, a trader who moved to Puerto Rico around 2018 and now ""onboards"" others relocating to the island with the help of a sprawling network of lawyers and realtors, says the move has never been more popular.

The number of traders who moved to the island this year under the mentorship of Sanghvi's firm, TradeSpace, has already surpassed 2024's total. Numbers have nearly tripled over the last two years since Sanghvi first came to the island himself, he told Business Insider.

Andrew Gordon, the managing attorney at Gordon Law Group, says he counsels ""hundreds"" of traders each year about whether they should move to Puerto Rico. The number of traders who made the move about doubled in 2024 compared to the prior year, he estimated.

Sanghvi and Gordon say the allure of moving to the island has only grown in recent years as the stock and crypto markets have soared. Traders who seek their help — many of whom are young men, Gordon says — are often sitting on a mountain of capital gains, which they know will eventually draw a hefty tax bill.

Many also express disdain for US politics and are looking for a change from cities like Miami, Sanghvi said. For those, Puerto Rico is the simplest option, he said, referring to how US citizens don't need to a visa to move there.

The sun and party scene in San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, are cherries on top.

""They want the nightlife, they want the partying, they want the bars, they want the nice restaurants, they want all that kind of stuff,"" Sanghvi said. ""You got two choices. You got Dubai and you got Puerto Rico. So what are you going to choose? You know what I mean?""

Luke Lintz, a 26-year-old crypto trader who moved to Puerto Rico during the pandemic, said he was sold on the idea when he was preparing taxes for his business in 2020. Lintz jumped on a call with his accounting team to figure out how they could best mitigate the tax hit, and then packed his bags to Puerto Rico a week later.

Lintz, who moved to Puerto Rico with his brothers, says he loves the island. His town, Palmas Del Mar, is ""mellow"" and allows him to put his head down and focus on business.

""It's being on a permanent vacation,"" he said. ""We're doing a ton of things and a lot of activity, and then being able to come back to a place where really all I want to do is just take good care of my body, get a lot of sunlight, and then work — it's great because there's very little distractions.""

Steven Dux, a 31-year-old trader, moved from California to Puerto Rico this spring. His wife had been making the case to move there to reap the tax benefits for years. After a trip to the island, the couple finally relocated to Dorado, a luxury area where a high-end rental can go as high as $100,000 a month. It feels like a movie, Dux says, though he's aware that the town is different from most of the island.

""I think we're happy overall. Of course, there's benefits and there's some sacrifice,"" he said, adding that the biggest pro was the ability to save tons of money.

There seems to be one big catch to life in Puerto Rico: assimilating is harder for some than others. Sanghvi and Gordon estimate that around half of the traders they know who move to Puerto Rico and find themselves unhappy — or, at least, surprised by what it's like once they arrive.

""There are people unfortunately who come down here and who expect everything to be on the level that it was in the States, and you don't realize this is a whole different world,"" Sanghvi said. ""They continue to kind of bang themselves on their head about this. They get frustrated.""

Many traders find it hard to adjust their expectations when it comes to the conveniences they take for granted in the US. There's no such thing as one-day delivery in Puerto Rico, for instance. Lintz said.

Power outages are a common occurrence. For traders, this means having a backup generator is critical, Gordon said.

The majority of the island's food is also imported, which makes finding clean eating options ""frustrating,"" Lintz added.

Puerto Rico's social scene, though, seems to be the biggest issue. It can be hard for a newcomer to meet people, Sanghvi says, depending on whether they already have contacts and how much they're willing to put themselves out there.

Dux said life in his neighborhood could be ""very boring"" at times, due to the community being small and having little to do.

Lintz said he felt Puerto Rico was cliquish. There are a handful of prominent social networks across the island, he said, with some being more insular than others.

""It's just hard to get to know people because I just don't think there's that many events and opportunities to meet people in person,"" he said, adding that he and his brothers planned to be more focused on work for the next several years.

Tension between locals and newcomers adds another challenge. The streets of San Juan are filled with graffiti telling recent transplants to go home, Lintz said.

Much of the tension revolves around traders who don't understand the history between Puerto Rico and the United States, Sanghvi said.

""They don't feel comfortable. They don't feel welcome,"" he said of those traders. ""They don't feel like they're fitting in, but they're not doing the things they need to in order to fit in.""

Family and relationship issues are also common. Many traders who move with their families find that their wives are bored, Sanghvi said, adding that it was common for married couples to move back to the States.

To Sangvhi, who says he runs into connections everywhere he goes in Puerto Rico, the key to being happy on the island isn't so much a secret as it is a personality and a willingness to step outside one's comfort zone. His advice is straightforward: Learn Spanish, network, and explore the island beyond San Juan.

""Most people who come here, they just sit inside their bubble, and that's it,"" Sanghvi said. ""If you're not a person who is willing to step out of said comfort zone, it's going to be hard for you.""

Sanghvi said some traders treat their time on the island like they're in prison. He believes those are traders who haven't properly assimilated into the island's culture and only stay there for the bare minimum — 183 days of the year — to claim the tax benefits and work in peace.

""You talk to them, they're like, 'Yeah, I got to do my days.' I'm like, 'Bro, you're in jail.' I'm on the beach at six in the morning, having a great time,"" he said. ""So this is my world. I don't go anywhere.""

Trump's Second Term:

Sweeping Democratic wins in this week's elections have given new urgency to President Donald Trump's efforts to midterm-proof his second term, with the president keenly aware of the consequences if Republicans lose control of Congress.

Securing the midterms won't be easy. Tuesday's results underscore the extent to which the political and economic paradigm has shifted for Trump from his electoral victory a year ago, a period in which he aggressively reshaped Washington with little opposition. Now, the 2026 midterms are shaping up as a much tougher referendum on his political brand. Polls — and the GOP's electoral setback — indicate voters have grown weary of the president's firebrand politics and uneven stewardship of the economy.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Novo Nordisk A/S CEO Mike Doustdar in the Oval Office of the White House, on Nov. 6.

Novo Nordisk A/S Chief Executive Officer Mike Doustdar may have lost out to Pfizer Inc. in a $10 billion takeover battle for obesity drug developer Metsera Inc. But don't expect him to give up on dealmaking any time soon as the Danish company seeks to regain lost ground in the booming weight-loss market.

Novo, the owner of Wegovy and Ozempic, will continue to look at opportunities in obesity, diabetes and their associated comorbidities, according to people familiar with the situation. The company had viewed Metsera as a potential bolt-on transaction rather than a transformational acquisition, the people said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

U.S. Bank and Bank of America cards are currently not available on CNBC Select and links have been redirected to our credit card marketplace where you can review offers from other issuers like American Express or Chase. You can also check out our list of best credit cards for alternative options.

Terms apply to American Express benefits and offers. Visit americanexpress.com to learn more.

The American Express Platinum Card® is packed with a seemingly endless list of perks in exchange for an $895 annual fee (see rates and fees) — but not everyone wants to pay such a princely sum for the entire slate of benefits — and you don't have to. 

Other cards offer similar benefits at a much lower price — in some cases without an annual fee at all. We looked at a few of the best perks of the Amex Platinum Card and figured out how to closely replicate them cheaply. We prioritized cards in this order: those without an annual fee, those with an annual fee under $100 and a couple that have an annual fee that's waived the first year. 

Of course, the Amex Platinum has a few benefits that can't be duplicated, like Centurion Lounge access, but you can get a card or two that offer similar benefits with a much lower price tag.

Did you know Amex Platinum's rental car coverage* is actually secondary? Shocking but true. In fact, Amex requires you to enroll in premium rental car protection and pay either $19.95 or $24.95 every time you rent if you want primary coverage. 

A big benefit of the premium rental car protection is that you're covered for up to 42 consecutive days (up to 30 days for Washington State residents), whereas other plans typically end after 31 consecutive days. That won't matter if your trips are usually less than a month, but it's worth pointing out. 

To get primary rental car insurance without an $895 annual fee or additional fee for every rental, get the Bilt Mastercard®.

You might've heard of the Bilt Mastercard® if you're a renter because it allows you to earn points on rent without any transaction fees and has no annual fee. Its primary rental car insurance covers up to $50,000 in damage or theft (except for New York residents renting within the United States, then it's secondary).

That's an excellent benefit for a no-annual-fee credit card that earns points that transfer to a long list of partners like Air Canada Aeroplan, Alaska Atmos Rewards and United MileagePlus. 

*Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance can provide coverage up to $75,000 for theft of or damage to most rental vehicles when you use your eligible Card to reserve and pay for the entire eligible vehicle rental and decline the collision damage waiver or similar option offered by the Commercial Car Rental Company. This product provides secondary coverage and does not include liability coverage. Not all vehicle types or rentals are covered. Geographic restrictions apply. Eligibility and Benefit level varies by Card. Terms, Conditions and Limitations Apply. Please visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for more details. Underwritten by AMEX Assurance Company.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) fell from $126,000 in early October back to $100,000 after climbing from $75,000 earlier in the year.

55% of traditional hedge funds now hold digital assets compared to 47% in 2024.

Tightening liquidity from the U.S. Treasury's cash buildup and the government shutdown contributed to Bitcoin's recent decline.

Some investors get rich while others struggle because they never learned there are two completely different strategies to building wealth. Don't make the same mistake, learn about both here.

After a red-hot summer, it looks like ""crypto winter"" is here and Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) is back in the headlines. The BTC price is moving fast, but not necessarily in a positive direction.

This raises the question of whether it's time to buy the Bitcoin dip or brace for lower prices. Since BTC recently touched $100,000, it's halfway between $75,000 and $125,000 -- but which target will Bitcoin hit first? Opinions vary, but following the money flow could provide crucial clues about Bitcoin's next big move.

Currently, $100,000 the key battleground between the Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Because it has so many zeros, the $100,000 price level has an emotional significance and is, without a doubt, being closely monitored by cryptocurrency traders.

From January through early November of this year, Bitcoin's path to $100,000 has been wild and sometime unnerving. The BTC price started off 2025 near $100,000, then dipped to $75,000, rallied to $126,000 in early October.

However, Bitcoin buyers hoping that October would be ""Up-tober"" were disappointed. In recent weeks, the BTC price has fallen back to $100,000, marking a round trip from the beginning of the year.

Future price predictions are all over the map, with Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick evidently in the bullish camp. Not long ago, Kendrick proclaimed that Bitcoin's recent dip under $100,000 may be the ""last one ever.""

If Kendrick's thesis that decentralized finance will eventually overtake traditional finance holds up, then Bitcoin's long-term target ought to be much higher than $125,000. Still, there are some bearish factors to keep in mind, so let's explore that topic right now.

It's difficult to pinpoint the main driver of the recent Bitcoin price pullback. The U.S. government shutdown is a likely culprit, but a surge in the relative strength of the dollar is another contributing factor.

Complicating matters further, it could be argued that the dollar's strength and anxiety over the prolonged government shutdown are interrelated factors. Also somewhere in the mix are vague fears about technology stocks being too richly valued; market participants often tend to lump tech stocks and Bitcoin into the same psychological bucket.

Along with all of those factors, analysts with Citigroup (NYSE:C) point to tightening liquidity conditions as a problem for Bitcoin holders. The U.S. Treasury's has shored up its cash balance, thereby draining liquidity from the banking system and putting pressure on risk-on assets. However, the Citigroup analysts suggest that liquidity could soon improve and this may buoy the BTC price.

Thomas ""Tom"" Lee, co-founder and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, put all of these pieces together to form his own theory. ""Bitcoin is very sensitive to market liquidity and also perceptions about risk appetite,"" Lee explained.

In addition, Lee considered ""headwinds building right from the government shutdown to a hawkish Fed cut"" as notable factors weighing down the Bitcoin price. At the same time, Lee remains optimistic about Bitcoin, declaring, ""[H]eadwinds become tailwinds when you can resolve these things.""

We've discussed a range of contributing factors that could put Bitcoin down to $75,000 or up to $125,000. Yet, there's one more consideration and it could be the deciding factor.

As the old saying goes, follow the ""big money"" -- i.e., the institutional players. According to the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), 55% of surveyed traditional hedge funds have exposure to digital assets in 2025, up from 47% in 2024.

Moreover, 47% of surveyed institutional investors said that the evolving U.S. regulatory environment is encouraging them to increase their digital-asset allocations. Plus, the AIMA reported that ""tokenization is gaining traction in alternative investments,"" with 52% of surveyed hedge funds ""now expressing interest.""

The AIMA concluded from these survey results that digital assets (and presumably Bitcoin) are ""now moving from the margins toward the mainstream of hedge fund and institutional investing."" Plus, a confluence of crypto-positive factors have prompted the AIMA to find that ""conviction in digital assets as an investable asset class"" among institutional entities ""are clearly on the rise.""

Following the sentiment and money flow of hedge funds isn't a guarantee of success for Bitcoin investors. Nevertheless, it's often a smart strategy to align one's own strategies with those of the big-money players.

Based on this more than anything else, I expect the BTC price to head toward $125,000 rather than fall to $75,000. If Bitcoin does sink to $75,000, though, don't be too surprised if hedge funds snap up some tokens at a discount price even if retail traders panic and sell.

Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) dominance sits around 60% as November trading turns choppy. Prices have dropped below $100,000, pushing the broader crypto market lower and shifting attention toward emerging altcoins that are holding up better.

Bitcoin's pullback has investors asking: Can it maintain market leadership, or are altcoins ready to take over?

Arsenii Palivoda / Shutterstock.com

Bitcoin hit $126,000 three months ago. Since then, it's been mostly downhill. The price crashed to about $106,000 after the crypto flash crash in early October, bounced back to $110,000-$115,000 by late October, then fell again. BTC now trades at $103,000 as of early Novermber.

The numbers tell the story: Bitcoin has dropped 16% in 30 days. Q4 momentum is gone as brief rallies get sold. Long-term holders are still up 49% over 12 months, but recent weakness has traders worried.

tungtaechit / Shutterstock.com

Bitcoin's market position keeps shifting. Price swings, liquidity moves, and investor mood all play a role. It's still the biggest cryptocurrency, but its market share keeps shrinking. Here's why:

The main problem: Bitcoin can't stop falling. After peaking around $126,000, it tumbled below $100,000. Each drop weakens confidence and pushes traders toward other assets. Traders are taking profits early or rotating into digital assets with stronger short-term charts. Lower highs and fresh selling waves have choked off new money. Capital is spreading out across the broader crypto market.

Regulation and trade wars are hitting Bitcoin hard. Worries about Trump administration tariffs spooked risk markets, triggering sell-offs in stocks, commodities, and crypto. Bitcoin, despite being called digital gold, got caught in the downdraft.

Stricter rules in the U.S. and European Union aren't helping. Compliance demands and ETF approval delays have made institutional investors cautious. Big money flows have dried up. Profit-taking picked up after the flash crash. Tariff fears and regulatory uncertainty have dented Bitcoin's appeal as traders moved to stablecoins or hedged with other assets.

Altcoins are eating into Bitcoin's dominance. Lately, alternative cryptocurrencies (especially those tied to DeFi, AI, and layer-2 projects) have attracted serious interest. These coins move quicker and offer bigger short-term gains, siphoning liquidity from Bitcoin.

As portfolios diversify, Bitcoin's share of total crypto market value slides. More investors are branching out instead of sticking with Bitcoin. This ongoing shift has weakened its market position.

DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com

Bitcoin has given up ground, but several trends could help it reclaim the top spot:

Stronger institutional buying could flip the script. BlackRock's ETF launch on the ASX and expanding spot ETFs worldwide signal institutional infrastructure is growing. If regulatory clarity arrives and the macro environment settles down, institutional money could pour back in, boosting Bitcoin's liquidity and restoring its leadership.

Potential U.S. crypto rules and Bitcoin's classification as a CFTC commodity could deliver the stability investors want. Clear rules would cut uncertainty, pull capital back into Bitcoin, and separate it from altcoins. A stable regulatory setup would make Bitcoin the safest, most compliant digital asset, helping it win back market dominance.

AlyoshinE / Shutterstock.com

Here are the bullish, base, and bearish scenarios for Bitcoin heading into 2026.

If institutional money flows back through spot ETFs, regulatory clarity improves, and Bitcoin gets recognized as a CFTC commodity, confidence could return fast. Fresh liquidity and stronger risk appetite could push Bitcoin to $120,000-$130,000, cementing its leadership and expanding its dominance.

If markets stay mixed, with moderate institutional activity and cautious trading, Bitcoin will likely range between $100,000 and $115,000. This would reflect consolidation—neither bullish nor bearish—as investors wait for clearer signals from global economic and policy events.

Bitcoin could slide further if regulatory uncertainty grows, geopolitical tensions heat up, or another sell-off hits. BTC could drop to the $90,000-$95,000 range, mirroring risk aversion and deeper market uncertainty.

Bitcoin's recent performance shows a cooling period, not an extended downtrend. Volatility remains high, but Bitcoin's institutional support, global adoption, and traditional finance integration ensure it remains at the heart of the digital assets market, regardless of short-term swings.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Donald Trump was elected president again one year ago this week, though some of the crypto industry's lobbyists quietly say they feel like they've aged many years in this tumultuous 12 months, which saw a range of lofty highs and deep frustrations in the young sector's hunt for U.S. policies.



President Trump surged back into the White House with wide support from crypto voters and optimism from many of the most prominent U.S. leaders of the industry that he'd secure their place in the U.S. financial system. In many ways, that faith in the politician has paid off.



He quickly issued executive orders demanding progress on friendly crypto policies and the establishment of a bitcoin BTC$102,126.31 reserve to stash the government's holdings as a long-term investment.



""Since day one he has issued executive orders and moved for agencies to pay attention to digital assets and how blockchain can increase transparency across the government,"" said Cody Carbone, CEO of the Digital Chamber, in a statement to CoinDesk.



In Congress, the industry shifted from pariah of 2022 (during its struggles with failing firms and fraud prosecutions) to a top priority of 2025, with significant support from a president who made continual demands of allied lawmakers. In a stunning example of rapid, bipartisan legislating, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) Act became law, the first major U.S. crypto policy effort to do so.



The Trump administration's Treasury Department and banking agencies have already begun trying to sort out its implementation — a lengthy process as it winds its way through public-comment periods and eventually through multiple rule proposals.



The GENIUS Act was meant as a companion to advance alongside the more important legislation that would set up rules of the road for U.S. crypto markets beyond the stablecoin issuers. While that effort again passed in the House of Representatives this year, the Senate hasn't yet acted.



As he continues goading Congress, Trump has made some consequential appointments to run the U.S. financial regulators. At the top of that list for crypto advocates is Paul Atkins, who was confirmed to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is a crypto supporter who made friendly new policies his top priority at the agency. He's lately promised concrete rule proposals in the coming months.



Trump also installed Jonathan Gould, a former crypto lawyer, atop the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.



""The past year has delivered what many thought impossible: a complete reversal of federal crypto policy, transforming America from a jurisdiction defined by regulation-by-enforcement to one that's racing to lead the global digital economy,"" said Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute.



On the flip side of his administration's crypto progress, Trump's volatile leadership has potentially threatened other parts of the agenda. The current, prolonged shutdown of the federal government — the longest-ever, beating the record set during Trump's first term — has contributed to a derailing of the Senate's legislative work, including the single most important U.S. policy aim for crypto: the market structure bill.



Polling has consistently shown voters blame Trump and Republican lawmakers more for the shutdown than Democrats. The budget impasse not only redirects lawmakers' energies toward settling that dispute, but it also has furloughed federal workers who are meant to focus on helping write the legislation.



Even without closing down government operations, the legislative negotiations were at a precarious point, with some Republicans balking at the idea the Senate's version of the House's Digital Asset Market Clarity Act was ready to advance. Some crypto lobbyists have privately shifted their expectations as far as 2027 before Congress will finish that job, because next year's midterm elections would be expected to turn Capitol Hill into a political battlefield in which bipartisan action could become difficult.



The shuttered doors of government have also stalled the industry's pursuit of product approvals and public-offering pursuits that need sign-off from the SEC.



And despite Trump's orders to set up crypto reserves at the federal level, that project hasn't gone anywhere past the planning stage. Those working on it have suggested congressional action may be needed to clear the final hurdle to establish the funds. Like other legislative efforts beyond the market-structure push — such as overhauling the tax code for crypto activity — this one could be waiting in line for a while.



Meanwhile, though the crypto industry has lined up a long list of allies among Democratic lawmakers, Trump has drawn sharp criticism from members of the opposition party for his personal stake in digital assets businesses. There are few corners of the sector his and his family's interest don't touch, and the potential conflicts of interest for the president came to a head when the biggest holders of his memecoin were invited to a private evening event with him.



Many of the top investors in Trump's coin were foreign nationals, and the administration declined to identify those attending the dinner and rubbing elbows with the president.



Also, Trump's successes in appointing regulators, such as at the SEC, OCC and in slowly remaking the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, have been countered somewhat by challenges, such as his having to withdraw his first choice as chairman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



Most of the prominent leaders of the industry have become cozy with Trump, and White House crypto events have seen CEOs and founders — such as the chiefs of Coinbase, Ripple, Tether and Gemini — eagerly participating in the president's celebrations. But while that relationship has strengthened, the president's public popularity has fallen. In this opening year of his second administration, Trump's approval ratings have declined rapidly to plumb depths not touched by other recent presidents, with 58% disapproving of the job he's doing — especially the younger voters who had been relatively enthusiastic about giving him a return to the White House.



As this week saw a number of state-level elections considered potential bellwethers for the congressional midterms a year from now, the voting public's feelings about Trump's presidency were on potential display. One year after reelecting Trump, they rebounded dramatically toward supporting Democratic candidates. If that holds for the 2026 midterms, Democrats could make gains in Congress and possibly retake the House majority, ending the lock Republicans hold across the executive and legislative branches of government.



If that takes place on Trump's watch, his crypto agenda may have to adjust to a more overtly bipartisan cooperation during his final two years in office. But Trump's opening year has already provided more policy progress than the industry had ever achieved before, and advocates say it's having significant results on U.S. businesses.

""We've seen digital asset companies reshore operations, expand their presence and grow headcounts as a result of President Trump and a pro-crypto Congress,"" said Summer Mersinger, the CEO of the Blockchain Association who was a recent U.S. commodities regulator in this administration.

 Weak demand from spot Ethereum ETFs, soft derivatives data, and macro fears have left Ether struggling to sustain $3,400 despite signs of steady onchain activity. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum ETF outflows and cautious traders show limited confidence in ETH price going higher for now. 

Low derivatives premiums suggest a muted outlook for Ether's price.

Ether (ETH) fell 11% over the past week, even after reaching the $3,400 mark on Saturday. The drop came alongside a 4% correction in the Nasdaq index, which erased gains from the previous two weeks. Traders are now debating whether ETH still has chances to reclaim the $3,900 level.

Concerns about global economic growth surfaced after weak quarterly results from consumer-focused companies and renewed worries over high valuations in the artificial intelligence sector. Meanwhile, the longest-ever US government shutdown continues to hurt the economy.

Ether futures are trading at a 4% premium to spot markets, unchanged from the previous week. The data shows a limited appetite for bullish positions, although it has not yet approached panic levels below 0%. 

Under normal market conditions, this premium typically sits between 5% and 10% to account for the longer settlement period.

Market anxiety grew after US consumer sentiment expectations plunged to their lowest levels ever, according to a University of Michigan survey. 

November's reading, released Friday, was the second weakest since at least 1978 and was largely blamed on the ongoing US government spending shutdown, AP reported.

Part of Ether investors' frustration stems from ETH 4% weekly underperformance compared to the broader crypto market. This suggests that, beyond rising macroeconomic risks, other factors have likely made traders more cautious toward Ethereum.

The total value locked on the Ethereum network fell to $74 billion—the lowest since July—marking a 24% drop over the past 30 days. Investors were caught off guard after one of Ethereum's leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, Balancer v2, was hit by a $120 million exploit on Monday.

Ethereum decentralized applications (DApps) generated $80.7 million in revenue in October, an 18% decline from September. The decrease is particularly concerning for ETH holders, as lower onchain activity puts downward pressure on the native staking yield. 

Ethereum's design includes a mechanism that burns ETH during periods of high demand for blockchain data processing, helping balance network activity and supply.

However, the first week of November shows early signs of strength for Ethereum compared with rival blockchains. Active addresses climbed 5% over the past seven days, while transactions rose 2%. By contrast, both Tron and BNB Chain saw declines in onchain activity.

ETH trader sentiment has been weighed down by the lack of demand for Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). US-listed products recorded $507 million in net outflows during November, and there were no notable ETH corporate reserve purchases, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data.

Currently, ETH's only clear catalyst is the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, slated for early December. The update is designed to deliver several scalability and security enhancements to the network. 

However, with derivatives markets signaling weakness and investors wary of a slowing global economy, the chances of a breakout toward $3,900 in the short term appear limited.

This story originally appeared on Mother Jones and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there's at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president's anti-environment policy moves.

If you're in the market for a vehicle, you've probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren't just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front—especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules—cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump's agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again—leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump's deregulation push could cost drivers more. By weakening fuel efficiency and pollution rules, the administration is setting up consumers to spend more on gasoline and vehicle maintenance—the opposite of what Trump says he's aiming for.

Automakers hate the whiplash. Constantly shifting climate rules—from Obama to Trump to Biden and back—have made it nearly impossible for car companies to plan, adding costs that get passed on to buyers.

Rolling back standards means locking in pricier, dirtier cars for longer. Energy analysts estimate households could spend an extra $310 billion on fuel by 2050 as efficiency progress stalls.

The US is falling behind. While Europe and China double down on electric vehicles, Trump's policies discourage EV investment.

The big picture: Policies meant to “save money” are instead locking Americans into higher energy bills, costlier cars, and a slower transition to cleaner, cheaper technology.

Trump's transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect. That's because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can't plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration's moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations—but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car's price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos' is a good word because they're getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people's health and the environment.

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration's own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA's greenhouse-gas emission regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal-combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don't have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won't come out until 2030—when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That's why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration's efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.

Though car companies often grumble about the expenses and effort they have to expend when environmental regulations become stricter, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a much bigger nuisance. “These changes in regulations are really disruptive to the industry and are hurting our global economic competitiveness,” said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. “It's not only hurting in terms of setting us back with regard to decarbonization of the transportation sector, but the cost to consumers in the United States.”

A recent letter from OpenAI reveals more details about how the company is hoping the federal government can support the company's ambitious plans for data center construction.

The letter — from OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane and addressed to the White House's director of science and technology policy Michael Kratsios — argued that the government should consider expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) beyond semiconductor fabrication to cover electrical grid components, AI servers, and AI data centers.

The AMIC is a 35% tax credit that was included in the Biden administration's Chips Act.

“Broadening coverage of the AMIC will lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investment, and unlock private capital to help alleviate bottlenecks and accelerate the AI build in the US,” Lehane wrote.

OpenAI's letter also called for the government to accelerate the permitting and environmental review process for these projects, and to create a strategic reserve of raw materials — such as copper, alumimum, and processed rare earth minerals — needed to build AI infrastructure.

The company first published its letter on October 27, but it didn't get much press attention until this week, when comments by OpenAI executives prompted broader discussion about what the company wants from the Trump administration.

At a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, CFO Sarah Friar said the government should “backstop” OpenAI's infrastructure loans, though she later posted on LinkedIn that she misspoke:  “OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word ‘backstop' and it muddied the point.”

CEO Sam Altman also weighed in, writing that OpenAI does not “have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”

“We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote, though he said the company had discussed loan guarantees “as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US.”

In the same post, Altman wrote that the company expects to end 2025 “above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030,” and he said OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in capital commitments for the next eight years.

This is a great idea if you've developed your 'full-stack', but if you're interfacing with others, it often doesn't work well. For example, if you use an external payment processor, and allow bots to constantly test stolen credit card data, you will eventually get booted from the service.

reply

reply

That is also notably a completely unnecessary dumpster fire created by the credit card companies. Hey guys, how about an API that will request the credit card company to send a text/email to the cardholder asking them to confirm they want to make a payment to Your Company, and then let your company know in real time whether they said yes? Use that once when they first add the card and you're not going to be a very useful service for card testing.

I don't suppose they use DNS to find their command-and-control servers? It'd be funny if Cloudflare could steal the botnet that way. (For the public good. I know that actually doing such a thing would raise serious concerns. Never know, maybe there would be a revival of interest in DNSSEC.) I remember reading a case within the last few years of finding expired domains in some malware's list of C2 servers, and registering them in order to administer disinfectant. Sadly, IoT nonsense probably can't be properly fixed, so they could probably reinfect it even if you disinfected it.

Sometimes the greatest discoveries are actually rediscoveries. In Canada, for example, researchers revealed North America's most northeasterly woolly mammoth find after taking a second look at a mammoth tooth first discovered in 1878.

In a study published last month in the journal Canadian Science Publishing, researchers analyzed a worn mammoth tooth found almost 150 years ago on an island in Nunavut—a northern Canadian territory. The results have led the team to reclassify the tooth, formerly believed to have belonged to a Columbian mammoth, as the remains of an older cold-adapted woolly mammoth. The research sheds light on this individual in its final days and reveals woolly mammoths reached significantly farther east than previously thought.

“On the basis of morphology, we cautiously identify the tooth as the worn stump of the third left upper molar of a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius),” the researchers wrote in the study.

They re-examined the tooth's morphology, dated the fossil, and conducted isotope analyses. Simply put, isotopes are different versions of the same element, and experts use stable isotope analysis to investigate ancient diets, among other things. Louis-Philippe Bateman, lead author of the study and a graduate student in McGill University's Department of Biology, compares isotopic analysis to “high-stakes dentistry on precious fossil remains.”

The isotopic tests revealed that the mammoth consumed standard Ice Age vegetation, grasses, and other plants, even though it likely lived during an interglacial period (a time between ice ages free of large ice sheets) between 130,000 and 100,000 years ago, when the area had similar temperatures to today's. The tests also showed higher nitrogen levels than expected, suggesting that the animal may have suffered from malnutrition at the end of its life.

“Now that we know woolly mammoths likely ranged here, it's very tempting to go out and look for some more. They can turn up in the most unexpected of places!” Louis-Philippe Bateman added. On a broader scale, the paper underscores museum collections' long-lasting value. “A specimen kept for almost 150 years still has secrets to reveal,” Bateman added. “Studying them can give us insights into how organisms evolve and respond to climate change.”

In other words, museum collections have the potential to be a gift that keeps on giving. On a different note, I don't know why anyone would be surprised at the idea of a woolly mammoth roaming farther than expected. After all, Manfred (aka Manny, everyone's favorite mammoth in the animated movie Ice Age) certainly went out of his way to return a human child to its family. Maybe the owner of this tooth was on a similar mission.

This move underscores a rapidly tightening memory market, affecting both flash and DRAM.

SanDisk has reportedly raised its NAND flash contract prices by a staggering 50% for November, according to DigiTimes Asia. This move underscores a rapidly tightening memory market, driven by both unrelenting demand from AI data centers as well as tightly constrained wafer supply.

The report cites market sources who say SanDisk's pricing update sent a shockwave through the storage supply chain, prompting module makers such as Transcend, Innodisk, and Apacer Technology to pause shipments and re-evaluate quotes. Transcend, in particular, suspended quoting and deliveries starting November 7, anticipating ""continued favorable market conditions."" Translation: ""prices are likely going higher before they settle down.""

If you want a snapshot of just how hot the memory business has gotten, look at the numbers:

 




All three credited their performance to the supply concentration at wafer fabs, which are prioritizing the production of high-margin DRAM, such as DDR5 and HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), for AI servers and high-performance computing gear. The catch: older DDR4 products — still essential for industrial and enterprise systems — are now in shorter supply, further inflating prices downstream.

It's the same story we've seen across the chip industry all year: AI workloads are sucking the air out of the room. Fabs are dedicating more lines to cutting-edge memory for GPUs and accelerators, leaving commodity segments like consumer SSDs, embedded modules, and mainstream DDR4 short. The result? A structural shortage that's boosting profits for memory vendors while leaving OEMs and end-users scrambling. DigiTimes notes that Transcend expects ""upward momentum"" in the market to persist as companies balance price hikes with limited production capacity.

If you were thinking about upgrading your rig or expanding your data center capacity, it might be time to pull the trigger sooner rather than later. Between SanDisk's NAND flash hikes and ongoing DRAM shortages, prices across SSDs and memory modules are trending only one way, and it's not down. History suggests that when memory makers smell profit, they don't rush to expand supply overnight. With AI still chewing through every spare chip the industry can make, this shortage could stretch well into 2026 — unless the AI bubble abruptly pops, but then our economy will have bigger things to worry about.

Iain Cheeseman and colleagues reveal the underappreciated role of single genes producing multiple proteins in atypical presentations of rare disease, and present case studies of affected patients through a collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital. The findings help to identify genetic mutations that may contribute to rare diseases.

Around 25 million Americans have a rare genetic disease, and many of them struggle with not only a lack of effective treatments, but also a lack of good information about their disease. Clinicians may not know what causes a patients' symptoms, know how their disease will progress, or even have a clear diagnosis. Researchers have looked to the human genome for answers, and many disease-causing genetic mutations have been identified, but as many as 70% of patients still lack a clear genetic explanation.

In a paper published in Molecular Cell on November 7, Whitehead Institute Member Iain Cheeseman, graduate student Jimmy Ly, and colleagues propose that researchers and clinicians may be able to get more information from patients' genomes by looking at them in a different way.

The common wisdom is that each gene codes for one protein. Someone studying whether a patient has a mutation or version of a gene that contributes to their disease will therefore look for mutations that affect the ""known"" protein product of that gene. However, Cheeseman and others are finding that the majority of genes code for more than one protein. That means that a mutation that may seem insignificant because it does not appear to affect the known protein could nonetheless alter a different protein made by the same gene. Now, Cheeseman and Ly have shown that mutations affecting one or multiple proteins from the same gene can contribute differently to disease.

In their paper, the researchers first share what they have learned about how cells make use of the ability to generate different versions of proteins from the same gene. Then, they examine how mutations that affect these proteins contribute to disease. Through a collaboration with co-author Mark Fleming, the pathologist-in-chief at Boston Children's Hospital, they provide two case studies of patients with atypical presentations of a rare anemia linked to mutations that selectively affect only one of two proteins produced by the gene implicated in the disease.

""We hope this work demonstrates the importance of considering whether a gene of interest makes multiple versions of a protein, and what the role of each version is in health and disease,"" Ly says. ""This information could lead to better understanding of the biology of disease, better diagnostics, and perhaps one day to tailored therapies to treat these diseases.""

Cells have several ways to make different versions of a protein, but the variation that Cheeseman and Ly study happens during protein production from genetic code. Cellular machines build each protein according to the instructions within a genetic sequence that begins at a ""start codon"" and ends at a ""stop codon."" However, some genetic sequences contain more than one start codon, many that are hiding in plain sight. If the cellular machinery skips the first start codon and detects a second one, it may build a shorter version of the protein. In other cases, the machinery may detect a section that closely resembles a start codon at a point earlier in the sequence than its typical starting place, and build a longer version of the protein.

These events may sound like mistakes: the cell's machinery accidentally creating the wrong version of the correct protein. To the contrary, protein production from these alternate starting places is an important feature of cell biology that exists across species. When Ly traced when certain genes evolved to produce multiple proteins, he found that this is a common, robust process that has been preserved throughout evolutionary history for millions of years.

Ly shows that one function this serves is to send versions of a protein to different parts of the cell. Many proteins contain zip code-like sequences that tell the cell's machinery where to deliver them so the proteins can do their jobs. Ly found many examples in which longer and shorter versions of the same protein contained different zip codes and ended up in different places within the cell.

In particular, Ly found many cases in which one version of a protein ended up in mitochondria, structures that provide energy to cells, while another version ended up elsewhere. Because of the mitochondria's role in the essential process of energy production, mutations to mitochondrial genes are often implicated in disease.

Ly wondered what would happen when a disease-causing mutation eliminates one version of a protein but leaves the other intact, causing the protein to only reach one of its two intended destinations. He looked through a database containing genetic information from people with rare diseases to see if such cases existed, and found that they did. In fact, there may be tens of thousands of such cases. However, without access to the people, Ly had no way of knowing what the consequences of this were in terms of symptoms and severity of disease.

Meanwhile, Cheeseman had begun working with Boston Children's Hospital to foster collaborations between Whitehead Institute and the hospital's researchers and clinicians to accelerate the pathway from research discovery to clinical application. Through these efforts, Cheeseman and Ly met Fleming.

One group of Fleming's patients have a type of anemia called SIFD-Sideroblastic Anemia with B-Cell Immunodeficiency, Periodic Fevers, and Developmental Delay-that is caused by mutations to the TRNT1 gene. TRNT1 is one of the genes Ly had identified as producing a mitochondrial version of its protein and another version that ends up elsewhere: in the nucleus.

Fleming shared anonymized patient data with Ly, and Ly found two cases of interest in the genetic data. Most of the patients had mutations that impaired both versions of the protein, but one patient had a mutation that eliminated only the mitochondrial version of the protein, while another patient had a mutation that eliminated only the nuclear version.

When Ly shared his results, Fleming revealed that both of those patients had very atypical presentations of SIFD, supporting Ly's hypothesis that mutations affecting different versions of a protein would have different consequences. The patient who only had the mitochondrial version was anemic but developmentally normal. The patient missing the mitochondrial version of the protein did not have developmental delays or chronic anemia but did have other immune symptoms, and was not correctly diagnosed until his fifties. There are likely other factors contributing to each patient's exact presentation of the disease, but Ly's work begins to unravel the mystery of their atypical symptoms.

Cheeseman and Ly want to make more clinicians aware of the prevalence of genes coding for more than one protein, so they know to check for mutations affecting any of the protein versions that could contribute to disease. For example, several TRNT1 mutations that only eliminate the shorter version of the protein are not flagged as disease-causing by current assessment tools. Cheeseman lab researchers including Ly and graduate student Matteo Di Bernardo are now developing a new assessment tool for clinicians, called SwissIsoform, that will identify relevant mutations that affect specific protein versions, including mutations that would otherwise be missed.

""Jimmy and Iain's work will globally support genetic disease variant interpretation and help with connecting genetic differences to variation in disease symptoms,"" Fleming says. ""In fact, we have recently identified two other patients with mutations affecting only the mitochondrial versions of two other proteins, who similarly have milder symptoms than patients with mutations that affect both versions.""

Long term, the researchers hope that their discoveries could aid in understanding the molecular basis of disease and in developing new gene therapies: once researchers understand what has gone wrong within a cell to cause disease, they are better equipped to devise a solution. More immediately, the researchers hope that their work will make a difference by providing better information to clinicians and people with rare diseases.

As a basic researcher who doesn't typically interact with patients, there's something very satisfying about knowing that the work you are doing is helping specific people. As my lab transitions to this new focus, I've heard many stories from people trying to navigate a rare disease and just get answers, and that has been really motivating to us, as we work to provide new insights into the disease biology.""

For the next five years, Qatar will host the Under-17 Men's World Cup on an annual basis. What does this mean for the teenagers playing and for the hosts? 

The U-17 Men's World Cup is usually followed by football scouts and keen fans all searching for the next Lionel Messi — but the 2025 edition has taken on greater significance.

The tournament has become FIFA's testing ground for the 48-team format, the one that will be on show at the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026. It's also the start of an annual cycle of these under-17 tournaments, and the first of five consecutive tournaments to be played in Qatar.

FIFA expert and former player Pascal Zuberbühler says it's the ""beginning of a new global rhythm in football"" and that he can feel ""the pulse of something special about to unfold."" While there is undoubtedly some hyperbole in those comments, it is undeniable that the global football calendar is entering yet another new phase.

As with every change, questions follow. In the case of this tournament, load management of teenagers, some of whom could now play World Cup tournaments annually for a number of years, comes into focus, as does the significance of Qatar now becoming permanent hosts for the next half a decade.

There are many risks to children competing at elite levels, and 17-year-olds are no different.

""Players could potentially play eight matches within about three and a half weeks if they reach the final, roughly one every three to four days. Even as a single event, that represents a demanding schedule for developing players, particularly when recovery opportunities are limited,"" Sean Williams, who works at the University of Bath, England, and specializes in sports injury prevention, load management and growth and maturation, told DW.

There is also the case of managing the wide range of fitness and training levels at this tournament.

""Players from elite football nations such as Germany, England and Italy typically arrive with much higher cumulative loads from year-round academy training, domestic youth leagues and international fixtures. While they benefit from sophisticated strength and conditioning support and experienced medical staff, many may already be carrying accumulated fatigue,"" Williams said, acknowledging some progress had been made here.

However, players from emerging nations, many of whom would not have qualified under the previous 24-team format, will likely arrive with much lower training loads and fewer high-intensity matches in their bodies.

""For them, this tournament represents a sudden spike in demands. Although the relationship between load changes and injury risk remains complex and debated, rapid increases in training or match exposure are generally considered a concern, especially in athletes unaccustomed to such demands,"" Williams said. 

""These teams also tend to have less sophisticated systems for monitoring and managing load, and often limited experience with additional stressors such as long-haul travel and competing in Qatar's heat.""

All of these factors increase injury risk, William said. Regardless of their origin, he believes there are some specific challenges to working with this age group.

""Some apophyseal sites [locations on the skeleton where a growth plate (apophysis) serves as an attachment point for muscles, tendons, and ligaments], particularly around the pelvis, may not yet be fully ossified [turned to bone], leaving them vulnerable during rapid escalations in load.""

Then there's the matter of Qatar hosting permanently for the next five years (Morocco are also hosting the women's U-17 tournamentover the same timeframe).

The Gulf state has a packed recent history of hosting major sports championships, most famously the 2022 World Cup. But it's not just Qatar. With Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund already an official partner of the Club World Cup and the country set to host the 2027 Asian Cup and the 2034 World Cup, the Middle East continues to play a central role in football's evolution. 

Kamilla Swart-Arries is an expert of sport, tourism and event management and a professor at the Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha. For the her, the U-17 World Cup is ""about Qatar positioning themselves as a world-class sporting destination.""

""In the context of where Qatar is now, bidding for 2036 [Olympics] shouldn't be seen in isolation,"" Swart-Arries told DW. ""Their strategy since the 2006 Asian Games, and all the World Championships they've had since, is about building a track record over years. This is about maximizing facilities and building a legacy of creating opportunity and interest for younger people.""

Swart-Arries doesn't believe Qatar's intention with this tournament is to change the narrative that surrounded the 2022 World Cup, which drew widespread criticism for the reported deaths of thousands of migrant workers in the construction of stadiums and the country's poor record on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights.

However, the global criticism is widely accepted as having brought about some changes to labor laws. There is also little doubt that elite sportspeople visiting will leave with a positive perception, said Swart-Arries.

""Given that context, I think [the U-17 footballers] that are here will have an amazing experience, and for those who have different perceptions [about Qatar], just being here would change that,"" she said.

Then there's also the choice of hosting the tournament at the Aspire Academy, Qatar's premier sports academy. Only the final is being held in a stadium.

""It's smaller-scale, and Aspire lends itself to this type of tournament. They can say, 'We can do this and we can do it well, and we can learn from all other events we have hosted, including the 2022 World Cup,'"" said Swart-Arries. ""You get a day pass, and this is also an entertaining event for families. This is also about showing Qatar is a family-friendly tourism destination.""

Novak Djokovic captured his 101st career title in dramatic fashion on Saturday at the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Hellenic Championship in Athens, where he simultaneously ended Lorenzo Musetti's hopes of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals.

The 38-year-old Serbian left it all on the court in a gutsy 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory in the final, which featured 13 break points and five breaks of serve in the deciding set alone. With his 72nd tour-level title on hard courts, Djokovic also cut his tie with Roger Federer for the most in the Open Era.

Lesson 101: How to Conquer Olympus 🏛️@DjokerNole defeats Musetti in Athens for his 101st tour-level title! 🤯#HellenicChampionship pic.twitter.com/wYDdXo6Lvd

“An incredible battle… Three hours of a gruelling match, physically,” Djokovic said after his three-hour win. “It could have been anybody's match, so congrats to Lorenzo for an amazing performance. I'm just very proud of myself to get through this one.”

Musetti needed to capture the title to leapfrog Felix Auger-Aliassime into the final qualification spot for the season-ending finale in Turin. He saved a match point in the sem-finals against Sebastian Korda, but he was unable to build on a promising start against the former World No. 1 Djokovic in the championship match.

Both players were pushed to their physical limits across the match, but particularly during the final set. For Musetti, it was not only the heartbreak of missing out on a debut spot at the season finale on home soil in Turin, but also for his sixth consecutive defeat in an ATP Tour final. He captured his first two titles back in 2022 in Hamburg and Naples.

“Novak, there are not many words to say about you and your career,” said Musetti, who now trails Djokovic 1-9 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “You are proving, still at your age, that you can kick us, like me today. Everytime I share the court with you, I take it as a lesson, so thanks for that.”

Learner Tien won his maiden ATP Tour title after a spectacular finish on Saturday at the Moselle Open in Metz, where he overcame Cameron Norrie 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(6).

The 19-year-old American trailed 1/5 in the deciding-set tie-break, but he swung freely to turn the match on its head and clinch the biggest win of his fledgling career. Tien, who is set to make his debut inside the Top 30 of the PIF ATP Rankings, became the first American teenager to win an ATP Tour title since Andy Roddick, 19, in 2002.

First ATP title: UNLOCKED 🔓Learner Tien tops Norrie 6-3 3-6 7-6 in a thrilling encounter in Metz! 🏆@MoselleOpen | #MoselleOpen pic.twitter.com/MFuDciGLh8

""I never take it for granted, just coming out here and competing. So, holding this trophy just means the world to me. And I'm just really grateful,” Tien said during the trophy ceremony. “I want to thank my team, the ones that are here, the ones that are at home, for all the support, for everything this whole year and always, it means the world to me.

“I always feel the love and support, wherever you guys are. I'm really grateful for each and every one of you. The success I've had really is impossible without all of you, so thank you.""

Norrie, who fell in the Metz final in 2024, seemed poised to avenge last year's heartbreak, but ultimately fell just short. He will close the season with a 34-26 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Following his runner-up finish at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF last year, Tien has burst onto the scene in 2025. The lefty has claimed five wins over Top 10 players this year and reached his first tour-level final at the ATP 500 in Beijing, where he fell to Jannik Sinner. Three tournaments later, the 19-year-old is an ATP Tour champion.

Former World No. 2 Michael Chang joined Tien's coaching team in August and was present courtside in Metz to celebrate his thrilling deciding-set win over Norrie, against whom he improved to 3-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Felix Auger-Aliassime has qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time.

The Canadian earned his place in the season-finale field at the end of a dramatic final week of the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Lorenzo Musetti needed to win the Athens title to pass Auger-Aliassime and make his Turin debut, but the Italian fell one match short, losing to Novak Djokovic in the final.

Auger-Aliassime reached the championship match at the Rolex Paris Masters, the last ATP Masters 1000 event of the season, to move into a qualifying position. The Canadian has won 19 of his past 23 matches entering the Nitto ATP Finals, which he will compete in for the second time (also 2022).

The 25-year-old has lifted three trophies this season, emerging victorious in Adelaide, Montpellier and Brussels. He surged into qualifying contention by making his second major semi-final at the US Open.

During his run to the last four in New York, the Canadian defeated two fellow Nitto ATP Finals competitors: Alexander Zverev and Alex de Minaur. He backed that performance by reaching the Shanghai quarter-finals and making a Masters 1000 final for the second consecutive season.

Auger-Aliassime will play in Bjorn Borg Group in Turin alongside defending champion Jannik Sinner, two-time event winner Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton. The eighth seed will take on Sinner Monday evening at Inalpi Arena.

Note: All matches are local time.

Prize money: Because the singles finalists are coming into this match undefeated, the champion will take home $5.23 million, the largest payout in women's sports history.

The doubles finalists each lost in the round-robin stage, so the champions will make $1.06 million. (An undefeated team would have won $1.13 million.)

The Case for Kudermetova-Mertens: After knocking out top seeded Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in their final round robin match, Kudermetova and Mertens took down No. 2 Siniakova and Townsend -- and last year's runner-up -- to reach the final. Since falling in their group stage opener, they've won three straight matches. 

Their one meeting against Babos-Stefani came in the first round of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. Kudermetova-Mertens cruised to a 6-4, 6-2 win, kickstarting their run to the final.

Like Babos, Kudermetova and Mertens are also previous champions of the crown-jewel event. Three years ago, the duo lifted the trophy in Fort Worth, Texas in an undefeated run to the title. 

Road to the Final:• 1. Loss to Hsieh-Ostapenko 6-1, 5-7, [5-10]• 2. Win over Muhammad-Schuurs 6-4, 6-7 (6), [10-6]• 3. Win over Errani-Paolini 6-3, 6-3• SF: Win over Siniakova-Townsend 4-6, 7-6 (6), [10-6]• Accrued prize money: $543,000

The Case for Babos-Stefani: Since falling in their group stage opener, Babos-Stefani have been on a tear, winning three straight matches. In the semifinals they took down the previously undefeated Hsieh Su-Wei and Jelena Ostapenko, coming back from a break down in each set and needing three match points to secure the victory. 

Babos-Stefani seek to avenge that defeat in Rome in May, but the loss propelled a title run in Strasbourg the following tournament. They defeated Mertens in Stuttgart, though the Belgian was competing with Chan Hao-ching. 

For Babos, this would mark the Hungarian's fourth WTA Finals doubles title and first since capturing three straight from 2017-2019. Stefani, in her maiden WTA Finals appearance, is the first Brazilian to reach the final in the tournament's history. A win on Saturday would secure their fifth title of the season. 

Road to the Final:• 1. Loss to Siniakova-Townsend 6-2, 3-6, [10-6]• 2. Win over Andreeva-Shnaider 7-5, 2-6, [10-7]• 3. Win over Dabrowski-Routliffe 2-6, 7-5, [10-5]• SF: Win over Hsieh-Ostapenko 6-4, 7-6 (5)• Accrued prize money: $543,000

Head to Head: Sabalenka leads 8-5

The Case for Sabalenka: The World No. 1 is just one win away from her first WTA Finals title in her fifth appearance at the event. 

A perfect 4-0 thus far in Riyadh, she's earned her spot in Saturday's final after a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 semifinal thriller against Anisimova, and returns to the final for the first time since 2022. She also ended Anisimova's 13-match win streak in three-set matches.

Standing between Sabalenka and that coveted title is Rybakina, who Sabalenka defeated twice in 2025. She most recently knocked out Rybakina in the quarterfinals in Wuhan, winning 6-3, 6-3 win. She also won in the quarterfinals in Berlin back in June. 

Sabalenka, who won the US Open and reached the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals, is the first player to reach the WTA Finals championship and three Grand Slam singles finals in the same season since Angelique Kerber in 2016. She also defeated each of this year's Grand Slam champions at least once in 2025.

Road to the Final:• 1. Win over Paolini 6-3, 6-1• 2. Win over Pegula 6-4, 2-6, 6-3• 3. Win over Gauff 7-6 (5), 6-2• SF: Win over Anisimova 6-3, 3-6, 6-3• Accrued prize money: $2.695 million

The Case for Rybakina: The 26-year-old is one win away from a perfect 5-0 campaign in Riyadh and closing 2025 on an 11-match winning streak. This would also be her first WTA Finals title. 

Pegula certainly tested Rybakina in the semifinals, taking the first set in a two-hour, five-minute thriller. But Rybakina bounced back, and her 15 total aces, five break points and 36 winners helped her overcome 67 unforced errors. Rybakina's game has been the most complete in Riyadh from the serve to the return to the ability to cover the court, and that will need to be on full display in the final. 

Rybakina's final test is the world's best in Sabalenka. Though she trails the head to head, she did defeat Sabalenka in Cincinnati in August. She also beat Sabalenka 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 in the group stage in Riyadh last year. 

The former Wimbledon champion is seeking her 45th hard-court win of 2025, the most of any player on tour. 

Road to the Final:• 1. Win over Anisimova 6-3, 6-1• 2. Win over Swiatek 3-6, 6-1, 6-0• 3. Win over Alexandrova (playing as an alternate after Keys withdrew) 6-4, 6-4• SF: Win over Pegula 4-6, 6-4, 6-3• Accrued prize money: $2.695 million

It all comes down to Saturday in Riyadh. Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina square off in the singles final, while Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens take on Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani for the doubles crown.

Lando Norris set the quickest lap time during Free Practice 1 at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Lando Norris set the pace during the first and only practice session of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend, the Briton just pipping fellow McLaren racer Oscar Piastri in the final moments to go fastest.

With the Sprint format making its penultimate appearance of the season, the drivers were quick to hit the track when Friday's sole practice hour got underway, leading to a busy session as the field looked to fine-tune their cars.

While Piastri headed the timesheets for much of the session, Norris went quickest as the chequered flag fell on a lap of 1m 09.975s, beating the other McLaren by 0.023s. Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg followed in a eye-catching third, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and home favourite Gabriel Bortoleto.

Yuki Tsunoda, meanwhile, had a bit of a moment early in the session, the Red Bull driver hitting the barriers after spinning off the track, while team mate Max Verstappen did not set a final flying lap down in P17.

Catch up on the highlights from FP1 in Sao Paulo in the video player above before Sprint Qualifying takes place at 1530 local time.

2025 Sao Paulo GP Qualifying: Verstappen knocked out in Q1 at Interlagos

P18 Colapinto thanks his Alpine crew for getting his car fixed in time for Qualifying

Lewis Hamilton's connection with Brazil extends far beyond the racetrack. From idolising Ayrton Senna to earning honorary citizenship, his relationship with the country and its fans is both personal and enduring.

As the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix beckons, the paddock makes its annual pilgrimage to Interlagos – the undulating and unpredictable amphitheatre of passion that has shaped Formula 1 legends ever since it first arrived on the calendar. For many drivers it's another stop on a globe-trotting schedule, but for Lewis Hamilton Brazil is far more than that.

It's a place woven into the fabric of his story – a country that gave him his first hero, some of his defining moments, and, eventually, a second home. The relationship has grown and deepened over time, with the seven-time World Champion also an honorary Brazilian citizen. Here's why Hamilton's love affair with Brazil – and Brazil's with him – is one of F1's great modern romances...

Before the titles and records, and before Lewis Hamilton had even stepped into the cockpit of an F1 car, there was Ayrton Senna. Hamilton has said countless times that the Brazilian icon has always been his guiding star – even from childhood.

What initially drew Hamilton to Senna wasn't just his success, but his spirit. Speaking to Motorsport Magazine about his enduring admiration, Hamilton reflected that Senna was “such a fighter…never one to drive half-heartedly. He was always chasing perfection – a warrior, and that's what I loved about him.”

To the young Briton, Senna wasn't simply a racing idol; he embodied the very ideals Hamilton aspired to, including courage, authenticity, and an almost spiritual pursuit of excellence. It's little wonder, then, that Hamilton grew up emulating his hero whenever possible – adopting the famous yellow and green helmet, the bold racing style, even the sense of moral purpose behind the wheel.

So, when he finally arrived in Brazil as a fully-fledged F1 driver, an invisible thread already tied him to the place. Through Senna's legacy, he'd long fallen in love with the country.

For Hamilton, Brazil's magic has always been about more than motorsport. “The thing I love the most in Brazil is people, energy,” he told Elle Men Brasil in 2024. “When I finally came here, I felt the energy. It's a very diverse country, which I love. I feel at home.”

Every November, when he returns to Sao Paulo, that welcome home feels as genuine as ever, with grandstands alive with colour, flags waving, and an affection that entirely transcends borders. And the love runs both ways. For Brazilian fans, Hamilton represents the values they hold dear; flair, determination, and a refusal to give anything less than everything – something they experienced in abundance from Senna.

Because of this, the fans see in Hamilton a modern echo of Senna's fearlessness – a racer who drives with both soul and precision. That authenticity has earned him both admiration and adoration from thousands of motorsport fans in the country.

Over the years, Hamilton has immersed himself in the country's culture, embracing its music, its people, and its joy. He counts several Brazilian sporting icons among his friends – including football star Neymar Jr and multi-world champion surfer Gabriel Medina – and he often speaks with affection about the friendships he's built there.

Every great sporting relationship needs a stage, and for Hamilton and Brazil that is Interlagos. Few circuits in the sport carry as much emotion as this tight and twisting ribbon as this track on the outskirts of Sao Paulo.

There have been plenty of highlights, including his 2021 drive over an eventful Sprint weekend. It was a performance that has gone down in history as one of his greatest ever weekends of driving.

Hamilton set the fastest time in Qualifying on Friday, only to be disqualified for a technical infringement. Undeterred, he started the Sprint from P20 and surged to fifth in just 24 laps of racing – a charge that left the grandstands in total awe. A further grid penalty dropped him to 10th for Sunday's Grand Prix, but yet again he carved through the field, sweeping past title rival Max Verstappen to win in commanding fashion.

After crossing the line, Hamilton emulated his childhood hero by lifting the Brazilian flag high from the cockpit just as Senna had done after his first home victory in 1991. “I was so proud to hold that flag,” he recalled later. “Growing up I'd always loved Ayrton; I'd watch him when he carried a flag. When I saw a marshal holding one, I had to stop and grab it.”

It was, he said, a way to thank the nation that had inspired him since boyhood, a gesture of love and gratitude: “I was hoping I could lift up the nation in some way, even though I wasn't from Brazil – except now, I am Brazilian.”

Hamilton's special bond with Brazil became immortalised in 2022, when he was made an honorary citizen. In a ceremony at the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia, it's an honour usually reserved for statesmen, artists and national icons. In a way, this was simply a formal acknowledgement of a connection decades in the making for Hamilton, as he declared it to be “the greatest honour for me to be here receiving and accepting this citizenship. I really do feel like now I'm one of you, finally.”

Unsurprisingly, he dedicated the honour to the man that started it all for him – Ayrton Senna. “I really want to dedicate this to Ayrton, his family, his friends and his fans,” he said, acknowledging the inspiration that has shaped his life and career.

“Through his eyes, I was able to see just how passionate Brazilians were, and how deep it goes, the love and passion you have for your country, and how beautiful it is. I'm so excited to spend some more time here.”

It was official confirmation of what fans at Interlagos had already decided years earlier: Lewis Hamilton belongs here.

The connection between Hamilton and Brazil is not strictly about what happens on track and the mutual admiration. It's increasingly about the wider message and legacy of the relationship.

In his citizenship speech, Hamilton said he felt inspired by the resilience in Brazil and by the many people “fighting for the same thing”, whilst stressing a commitment to “push for change and diversity” in the country.

That's a reflection of his growing role as a global voice for diversity, equality and positive change. His alignment with Senna's legacy, his embracing of the Brazilian fan base, and his public commentary all deepen that bond tenfold.

2025 Sao Paulo GP Qualifying: Verstappen knocked out in Q1 at Interlagos

P18 Colapinto thanks his Alpine crew for getting his car fixed in time for Qualifying

Oscar Piastri is readying himself for a comeback in the Sao Paulo Sprint after qualifying behind his McLaren team mate.

Oscar Piastri is prepared to chase down Lando Norris in Sao Paulo after he was forced to settle for third position in Sprint Qualifying, viewing this weekend as a potential turning point after a challenging few rounds.

The Australian was almost neck and neck with his team mate in the sole practice session, finishing just 0.023s adrift of the top spot, but he was unable to maintain the same gap in Sprint Qualifying.

While Norris secured pole position, Piastri found himself 0.185s behind, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli separating the two.

One reason for his drop in pace was the mandatory switch to soft tyres in SQ3, which saw drivers struggle to find consistent grip around the bumpy circuit. At one point, Piastri suffered a snap of oversteer that impacted his lap time, but he ended the session eager to take the lesson into the rest of the weekend.

“The soft was just a bit different to what I expected,” he summarised. “I had a couple of big moments on my first lap which wasn't ideal. That was a bit of a shame, but ultimately I felt much happier today than the last couple of weeks.

“Practice went very well and for Sprint Qualifying I think we changed a few things which took a little bit of getting used to again. Ultimately, I'm pretty happy.

“I would have liked a little bit more but we can definitely fight with what we've got and there are obviously a lot more points on Sunday.”

Although Norris appears to be the more dominant driver this weekend, having topped FP1 and all three segments of Sprint Qualifying, the potential of rain ahead of the Sprint could open the door for Piastri to keep the points battle as close as ever.

With an unwanted streak of four rounds without a podium finish, the 24-year-old is hoping for a return to his previous strong form to stay in the fight for his first championship title.

He said: “It's going to be an interesting day. We'll see what weather we get. I'll try and take whatever opportunities there are.

“I think the pace in the car has been really good today so hopefully that translates to whatever we get.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	After making its debut to the world, the teaser trailer for Michael, soared to 116.2 million views worldwide in its first 24 hours. That's the largest 24-hour trailer launch ever in Lionsgate‘s history and the most viewed trailer for any music biopic or concert movie in motion picture history. 


	The data comes this AM from WaveMetrix. 


	The highly anticipated biopic of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, outstripped the first 24 hour global trailer traffic of Taylor Swift: Eras Tour, which counted 96.1 million views after an Aug. 31, 2023 drop, as well as Bob Marley: One Love (60.1M views with a trailer debut of July 6, 2023), Bohemain Rhapsody (57.6M, May 15, 2018) and Searchlight's Bob Dylan movie A Complete Unknown (47.2M, July 24, 2024).

	The Michael trailer dropped on the morning of Lionsgate's recent earnings day. In its first six hours, it had racked up north of 30 million global views, which was 50% more than the trailer traffic over that same period for John Wick: Chapter 4. Moviegoers can see the Michael teaser trailer next weekend attached to the release of Lionsgate's Now You See: Now You Don't. The Antoine Fuqua directed, Graham King produced biopic hits theaters on April 24, 2026. Jackson nephew, Jaafar Jackson plays his megastar uncle on screen.

	Other castmembers include Nia Long as Katherine Jackson, Coleman Domingo as Joe Jackson, and Miles Teller as John Branca. Three-time Oscar nominee John Logan wrote the screenplay for Michael.  Lionsgate will distribute the film domestically, with Kino Films distributing in Japan and Universal distributing in the rest of the world.

Never let it be said that America's Department Of Homeland Security isn't a multi-tasker: Even as it's been very busy making life extremely difficult for people just trying to get on with their goddamned lives with its various ICE raids, and constantly spewing out propaganda based on the flicking childhood memories of its leaders' aging millennial brains, the DHS has also apparently got time to bicker with pop stars on the internet. To no less august a source than TMZ, to whom a Department spokesperson gave a statement this week attacking musician Olivia Rodrigo for being unhappy that her music was being used in the organization's messaging.

Specifically, Rodrigo was upset that DHS had used her song “All-American Bitch” in one of its social media posts, writing a comment on Instagram in which she demanded “Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda.” Which isn't all that uncommon—the fact that the Trump White House keeps invoking musicians and other artists who actively hate the administration's guts is just sort of understood at this point—but which then got a response from a DHS official. (We resisted the urge to write “clapback” there in reference to the governmental statement, because our basic belief in the integrity of reality is really hanging on by a thread at this point as it is.)

“America is grateful all the time for our federal law enforcement officers who keep us safe,” the statement reads. “We suggest Ms. Rodrigo thank them for their service, not belittle their sacrifice.” Which is, yes, a reference to the lyrics of “All-American Bitch,” which someone involved in crafting that statement presumably thought was clever. (Look: We've all been behind deadline and desperate for something that just has the cadence of a joke to work as a lede, but c'mon.) In any case, Rodrigo's comment on the DHS video has now apparently been deleted, so chalk that up as a win, we guess, for a government being run like a low-tier Reddit commenter that also happens to have a huge army of heavily armed goons at its beck and call.

							By 

	Claire McNear



	How best to explain Patriot? The cult-favorite spy series, which premiered 10 years ago this week on Amazon and ran for two seasons, follows CIA operative John Tavner (Michael Dorman, years before his turn as a lovelorn astronaut on For All Mankind) as he goes undercover at a mundane piping manufacturer in Milwaukee. As the pilot lays out, his mission is, in theory, simple: Get hired at the piping company, join the team on a regularly scheduled work trip to Luxembourg, and make a covert cash handoff there with an Iranian agent who will help secure a more U.S.-friendly regime.


	Tonally, though, beneath the coat of tradecraft and international intrigue, the show is about as far from The Americans as you can get. John's mission goes rapidly awry with a veritable Rube Goldberg machine of oft-absurd speed bumps, including a CIA goof that gives his false Wisconsin identity one too many Social Security Number digits; John's PTSD dating from a previous job gone bad (and the marijuana dependency he developed while recuperating); and a no-nonsense taskmaster boss (played with malicious aplomb by Kurtwood Smith). Patriot is less interested in dead drops than it is in charting John's plodding march into morally gray situations and mounting depression. It's also very, very funny: One way that John copes is by turning up at open mic nights to perform gloomy folk songs with little concern for OPSEC. In what is likely the former Iranian president's only appearance in a singer-songwriter ballad, one lyric has John crooning about the day the United States learned that “Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was fucking around with new centrifuges.” Later in the song, he sings, “I'm showing several signs of increasing mental instability.”

	











	Created by Steven Conrad, best known for writing dreary yet whimsical films like The Pursuit of Happyness and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Patriot never managed to capture an audience during its all-too-short run. But through the power of rewatches it has won a passionate fandom in the years since. Hilarious, bleak, and bizarre, it represents the spirit of Peak TV: the distillation of an auteur's singular vision in a brief moment of if-you-build-it-they-will-come studio optimism.

	“I pitched it to Amazon, and at the time they had an appetite for a show like that,” says Conrad, who admits the concept was a bit of a bait-and-switch from the start. “I think they were banking that the spy genre was going to do a little more legwork than the show that we all privately had in mind.”


	In the decade since its debut, that sneakily idiosyncratic show with oddball plots and winning performances by beloved characters has slowly but surely made its mark. It sports a bustling subreddit and ongoing word-of-mouth recruits to the fandom. And lately, Prime's recommendations algorithm seems to have taken a shine to it — perhaps mistaking it for a sharp spy game as its human predecessors did, or perhaps not. (Prime declined to comment.) For viewers and those who had a hand in making the show, the only regret is that there isn't more Patriot to devour.


	“It was all just a real delight,” says Smith, whose cantankerous piping executive had, what else, a dark past. Of Patriot's 2019 cancellation, he says, “I have not forgiven Amazon for this.”


PATRIOT ARRIVED COURTESY of Prime's short-lived Pilot Season program, then the cornerstone of the streamer's eager investment in original programming. Pilot Season, which launched in 2013, was an attempt to add a viewer-forward sheen to Hollywood's traditional buffet of inaugural episodes. Instead of studio execs making the call on whether to send a given program to series, it was up to viewers, who were offered a full slate of freshman episodes from new shows and asked to share their feedback on what they hoped to see more of. Though the program launched some notable hits — among them The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Transparent, and The Man in the High Castle — it would last just five years.

	But in the lead-up to 2015, the studio was still taking big swings. “Ten years ago, the nature of this business was a little different,” Conrad says. “You could feel that the feature [film] landscape had changed and become primarily IP and superhero movies. TV had a depth then, and an ambition, on the heels of very successful long-term shows like Sopranos and Mad Men. You could just feel that becoming kind of a new art form.”Espionage thrillers were good business, then and now, but some of Patriot's layered complexity is a reflection of the TV of the time. When I asked Terry O'Quinn, who played Tom Tavner — John's father and the senior CIA officer who keeps sending his increasingly battered son into the field — about its initial billing as a spy drama, he told me he'd never thought of the show that way. “It's kind of a family drama,” he says. Indeed, both Tom and John's brother (Michael Chernus) are called in to assist with problems ranging from the meddling of an overqualified Luxembourgish detective to an ill-timed run-in with a puppeteer.


Patriot resists easy characterization chiefly because of Conrad's writing, which gives his characters strange rhythms and, sometimes, even stranger verbiage. (Conrad, who regularly performs in a band around the L.A. area, also wrote the show's soundtrack, including John's brooding folk songs.) “Every week or week and a half when we would get a new script, it was like Christmastime,” Smith says. He remembers getting the script for one early episode from Conrad, who cautioned that Smith's character, Leslie Claret, would be delivering a speech that Conrad wanted to film as a “oner” — a single, long shot, with his character on camera nearly the entire time. No problem, thought Smith. Then he read the script.

	











	As part of a pep talk ahead of an important pitch in Luxembourg, Leslie — who in the Patriot universe wrote a seminal piping textbook called The Integral Principles of the Structural Dynamics of Flow — gathers his team around him. “Keep it simple,” he starts, before diving into a monologue that includes the promise that “using a field of half-seized sprats and brass-fitted nickel slits, our bracketed caps and splay-flexed brace columns vent dampers to dampening hatch depths of one-half meter from the damper crown to the spurv plinth.”


	“I said, ‘Steve, does this mean anything? Where did you get all this?'” Smith says. “And he said, ‘No, it doesn't mean anything. They're all words and expressions that I found in various places having to do with piping. But no, put together it means nothing.'”


	To memorize it, Smith invented meanings for all those nickel slits and spurv plinths to give the speech at least some false cohesion. He then spent a month devoting an hour or two every morning to rehearsing it, with another session later in the day with an assistant. In the end, the scene was filmed in just two attempts — with the second necessary only because of a camera error. When the episode premiered at the Berlin Film Festival, the speech got a standing ovation.


	Still, the overall response to the show was muted. Despite getting picked up for a full season after a favorable response during Pilot Season, reviews were scarce and middling. “Amazon's Patriot is a good example of how ‘peak TV' inspires over-confidence in old ideas,” The Verge declared, before lamenting that “prestige television has gotten sort of out of control.” Comparisons to the work of the Coen brothers were rampant and not always positive.


	The show chugged along nonetheless, gradually attracting fans who adored its stark cinematography and weirdo colloquialisms. (If you watch it, you are unlikely ever to think about the word “cool” the same way again.) “I've had people come up [to me] and they seem to either really love it or they didn't know anything at all about it,” says O'Quinn. The actor is most often recognized for his role as John Locke on Lost, but the fans who know him as Tom Tavner are especially fervent. “The people who were turned on to it seemed to be crazy about it.”

	











PATRIOT WAS RENEWED for a second season, which debuted in 2018. Filming took the cast and crew to Paris for a whopping five months. One day of shooting left Smith and O'Quinn, who had become fast friends, riding the Metro for hours on end. O'Quinn remembers confiding to Smith that if it were up to him, he'd just keep on doing Patriot and then retire. “We're both of a certain age,” O'Quinn recalls saying at the time. “If I could just do this for five or six more years and call it a day, I'd be pretty happy.”


	But Patriot was not to have a long life. Conrad says that he knew the show's days were numbered midway through the Paris shoot, and that John's story should be wrapped up as cleanly as possible: “I could read the writing on the wall. I had every sense that we weren't going to have a Season Three.”


	By the time the show was officially canceled in 2019, Peak TV was already contracting and Prime in particular was going through a period of executive tumult. “There were three different presidents of the studio while we were making that show,” Conrad says. “Even in this business, that's a lot of turnover.” (O'Quinn likens the rotating executives and resulting fallout to “a pride of lions — when a new lion comes in, they kill all the babies.”)


	The changes at Prime meant that Patriot had no champion at the studio level; it got to feeling, Conrad says, like “the show doesn't belong to anybody.” But he believes that the series benefitted from that dynamic in some ways, too, skating through production receiving fewer studio notes than you might expect for a show that often pairs wanton violence with deadpan slapstick. “It was a little more ‘ours' than is ordinary because of all that,” he says.


	Though it hasn't been so long since its cancellation, it's hard to imagine a show with such an eccentric approach getting the green light today, never mind that kind of creative freedom in production. “When we first started, it was, ‘This is the way television should be,'” says Smith. “We're not worrying about ratings and this and that. We're doing something that's good, and hoping that, eventually, people will watch a lot of it. But the idea creatively is to build a good product. And then that changed, just in the time that we were doing this show.”


	“That's the sad commentary on American television, or maybe television in general, because it has to hit the middle of the target,” O'Quinn says. “It can't be on the perimeter. And Steven writes — he lives on the perimeter.”The Patriot creative trust, for its part, is still going strong. Conrad has penned a real-life version of the Structural Dynamics of Flow and written episodes of a surreal podcast voiced by Smith's character, which Smith says he recorded in a closet at home filled with hats for sound dampening. Conrad is a creator who tends to draw from a recurring stable of actors in all his works, and many Patriot cast members have popped up in his more recent projects, like 2019's spiritually similar thriller series Perpetual Grace, LTD and 2021's stop-motion animated series Ultra City Smiths. The upcoming HBO limited series, DTF St. Louis, which Conrad created and directed, will feature his brother, Chris, a memorable piping colleague from Patriot.

	











	I spoke with Conrad, O'Quinn, and Smith at a difficult time for the Patriot team: Last month, Chicago artist Tony Fitzpatrick, who played a delightfully dreadful security guard named Jack Birdbath in Patriot, died. As the news broke, Patriot alumni found themselves calling and texting one another from around the world, sharing memories of Fitzpatrick and their time working with him. “We lost Jack,” Conrad says. “But somehow, knowing that 10 years later, everybody still cares about each other that way, enough so that we all stopped what we were doing and we all found each other — we're all going to find each other again someday on something else.”

	On his birthday last year, Smith sat back and wondered what he should do to celebrate. Then he landed on an idea: He would rewatch Patriot with his wife. He'd seen it before, of course, back when it was newly out, but that was different. “You know exactly what's coming, and you're hoping that this scene works, or that works,” he says. “You've got all those things going on in your head, and you're not just sitting there watching.”


	This time, though? He laughed and laughed. “We watched several episodes, and I was so knocked out by the way things were put together,” he says. “I just thought it was great.”

	A lawyer for Jeremy Renner denied the accusations against the actor brought forth by filmmaker Yi Zhou, who Renner allegedly had a “brief consensual encounter” with. Both Renner and Zhou also revealed Saturday that they have sent each other cease-and-desist letters over the ordeal. 


	Over the last week, in a series of Instagram posts and a Daily Mail interview, Zhou accused the Hawkeye star of sending her unsolicited “intimate” photos and video and then threatening to “call ICE” on her after she “called him out privately” on alleged misconduct.


	Zhou, director of the documentary Chronicles of Disney featuring Renner, claimed that she had a personal and professional relationship with Renner that left her fearing for her safety.


	“Mr. Renner first contacted me directly in June, sending personal and intimate photographs of himself, behavior that, according to public reports, he has exhibited before,” Zhou wrote on Instagram. She claims Renner wooed her over calls and text discussions, saying he wanted a relationship. Zhou alleges they started dating and working together on two projects, including Chronicles of Disney, and that Renner “appears in 80% of the film.”

	However, when the documentary was released last month, Renner “refused to make any public promotion,” despite allegedly having entered into written agreements with her production company. Zhou says she appealed to Renner to help her combat fan accounts falsely claiming the documentary was generated by AI without his consent, but he refused.

	











	“When I called him out privately about his past misconduct and asked him to behave properly, to respect me as a woman and as a filmmaker, he threatened to call immigration/ICE on me, an act that deeply shocked and frightened me,” she wrote. “Such behavior is unacceptable and emblematic of the imbalance of power that continues to harm women in our industry.” A rep for the actor previously told Rolling Stone that the allegations were “totally inaccurate and untrue.”

	In a statement to People on Saturday, Renner's lawyer Marty Singer said Zhou's claims were “false, outrageous and highly defamatory,” adding that Zhou was retaliating against Renner after he “rejected her romantic advances” and did not promote their shared projects on social media.


	Singer admitted that Renner and Zhou had a “brief consensual encounter” that occurred in July 2025. However, Singer claims Renner cut off communication with Zhou after she continually sent him “sexually explicit messages expressing her love,” with the most recent one she allegedly sent on Oct. 24.


	As for Zhou's claim that Renner threatened to call ICE, Singer said the filmmaker “had been relentlessly harassing and threatening my client with hundreds of unsolicited and unwanted messages.” 


	“The true facts are that Ms. Zhou has relentlessly and aggressively harassed and pursued my client for months with no reciprocation on my client's part, other than a single brief encounter on July 12, 2025,” Singer told People. (Zhou did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.)

	TMZ reported Saturday that Renner had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Zhou over the situation; hours later, Zhou responded on social media revealing that she sent Renner a cease-and-desist letter of her own on November 5.


	“I am sharing my official cease and desist letters sent to Jeremy Renner and his representatives,” Zhou wrote Saturday. “These letters were sent after I received unsolicited sexual content in the beginning and throughout the months, misinformation about my professional work, and threats involving ICE. These letters show the struggle are about continued sexual images, fans smear campaign and threats involving ICE, they are not because he did not reciprocate in a [relationship] we have been since June.”

What began as an already unforgettable moment at this year's Wacken Open Air turned legendary when Michael Schenker stunned tens of thousands of fans with a major announcement. Following a blistering My Years With UFO set on Thursday night, the hard rock icon revealed that his new Michael Schenker Group studio album, ‘Don't Sell Your Soul,' is out now via earMUSIC. To top it off, Schenker and his band premiered the album's title track live for the first time, closing their set with a powerful encore that electrified the festival grounds.

Earlier in the night, the Wacken faithful were treated to another surprise as Slash joined Schenker onstage for a searing rendition of the UFO classic “Mother Mary.” Two generations of guitar gods sharing the same stage — it was the kind of moment destined to live forever in metal lore.

‘Don't Sell Your Soul' marks the latest studio album from the Michael Schenker Group and the second part of a trilogy that began with 2024's My Years With UFO. Produced by Schenker and Michael Voss, the album features longtime collaborators Bodo Schopf (drums), Barend Courbois (bass), and Steve Mann (guitar, keys), with Erik Gronwall on lead vocals and guest appearances by Robin McAuley, Dimitri “Lia” Liapakis, and Voss. Available now on CD, LP, and limited transparent red vinyl, the record is a fiery testament to Schenker's unrelenting creative spirit and guitar mastery.

As spending reaches an all-time high this year and anecdotal evidence shows interest in psychic practices spiking this fall, one ex-psychic turned born-again Christian is warning against how easily one can open “demonic doors” into the supernatural.

Jenn Nizza had her first tarot card reading at just 13 years old, when her mom hosted a tarot-card-reading party. It was soon after that Nizza crossed into full-blown divination.

“And that opens the demonic doors up right away,” she said on a recent episode of CBN's “Faith in Culture.” “After that, that was when I started seeking it out myself; I was really intrigued by it.”



Nizza's first foray into divination wasn't the result of an overt desire to engage dark supernatural forces. Instead, she thought it would be “a fun” thing to do that wasn't rooted in any sort of belief system.

“Even though I was raised Catholic, I didn't have any sort of relationship with Lord Jesus,” she said. “So I didn't have a spiritual belief, but my belief about what this was was [it was] just a fun, interesting, intriguing thing that I wanted to be included in.”

You can read more about Nizza's journey into — and out of — divination here.

It wasn't until she was 37 that God finally got a hold of her life and led Nizza away from those dark spiritual practices.

Listen to the latest episode of “Quick Start”



Ultimately, she said, she had an “end-of-myself moment,” overcome by “very heavy demonic oppression” from years of divination — even though she falsely believed she was helping people.

“The multitude of demons that were surrounding me was intense,” Nizza reflected. “And, of course, I didn't know what that was. I didn't know how to make sense of that and, in a moment, I cried out on the name of Jesus Christ — the Jesus I never served, that I never cared about, that I had zero faith in, or relationship [with] … and a peace came over me; it overwhelmed me. And I knew then something had happened, but I wasn't quite sure what it was.”

Over the next 10 months, she said, God drew her to Himself and, at 37 years old, Nizza fully surrendered her life to the lordship of Jesus Christ.

Nizza said now she is grateful God allowed her to remain in divination for as long as He did because it allowed him to “be glorified” through her testimony.

“He brought me into ministry and now He uses all of my knowledge and experience in the darkness to serve His kingdom and to educate, warn, and expose the very practices that I was engaging in — the occult, the New Age, witchcraft.”

“People will see Christ in our miraculous testimonies,” Nizza continued. “Now being in ministry since 2020, God is using every moment. I don't just have head knowledge of the things that I talk about. I was doing that stuff for years, so I have experience in it. God is using that now.”

The administration has gutted enforcement of a corporate tax enacted as part of the  Biden-era Inflation Reducation Act.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

The Trump administration is quietly waging an all-out regulatory war on a Biden-era corporate tax that aimed to prevent large companies from dodging their tax liabilities while reporting huge profits.

The corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) was enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Democratic legislation that former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. The CAMT requires highly profitable US corporations to pay a tax of at least 15% on their so-called book profits, the figures reported to shareholders.

As the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has explained: “Many of the special breaks that corporations use to avoid taxes work by allowing companies to report profits to the IRS that are much smaller than their book profits. Corporate leaders prefer to report low profits to the IRS (to reduce taxes) and high profits to the public (to attract investors).”

But since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued guidance and regulatory proposals designed to gut the CAMT. The effort is a boon to corporate giants and rich private equity investors at a time when the Trump administration is relentlessly attacking programs for low-income Americans, including Medicaid and nutrition assistance.

The New York Times reported Saturday that “with its various tax relief provisions, the administration is now effectively adding hundreds of billions of dollars in new breaks for big businesses and investors” on top of the trillions of dollars in tax cuts included in the Trump-GOP budget law enacted over the summer.

“The Treasury is empowered to write rules to help the IRS carry out tax laws passed by Congress,” the newspaper added. “But the aggressive actions of the Trump administration raise questions about whether it is exceeding its legal authority.”

Why would corporations spend millions on Trump's ballroom or bitcoin?Because they're getting billions in unlegislated tax breaks.We've gone from a system where the rich must pay taxes for public services, to one where they must pay the president for private favors.

The administration's assault on the CAMT has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress.

In a September 8 letter to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a group of Democratic lawmakers and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) warned that the administration's guidance notices “create new loopholes in the corporate alternative minimum tax for the largest and wealthiest corporations.”

“Most troubling, Notice 2025-27, issued this June, allows companies to avoid CAMT if their income — under a simplified accounting method — is below $800 million,” the lawmakers wrote. “The Biden administration previously set the safe harbor threshold precisely at $500 million in its proposed CAMT rule after calculating that a higher safe harbor threshold would risk exempting corporations that should be subject to CAMT under statute.”

“Now, less than nine months later and with zero justification, this new guidance summarily asserts that an $800 million safe harbor will not run that risk,” they continued. “We are seriously concerned that this cursory loosening of CAMT enforcement will simply allow more wealthy corporations to avoid paying their legally owed share.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision not to seek reelection next year could open the floodgates on the race to replace her.
    


            Pelosi, who has served in Congress since 1987, already had two primary challengers ahead of her Thursday announcement: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener.
    


            Chakrabarti launched his bid to unseat Pelosi earlier this year as part of a wave of younger Democratic challengers who argued the party needed candidates with new ideas to reshape it in the wake of Republicans' 2024 electoral wins.
    


            Wiener, who has represented much of the city in the state Senate since 2016, previously said he wouldn't challenge the former House Speaker. But he argued that it was necessary to get in against Chakrabarti, a self-funder who made his millions in the tech industry.
    


            “I never wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi. I have enormous respect for her – I think she walks on water,” Wiener said in an interview. “But there are limits to how long you can wait. At some point, you need to get into the race and start making the case to the voters.”
    


            Other candidates are expected to announce their own bids. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan has been floated as a potential candidate and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed told Politico Friday she is considering running.
    


            Already, the field of prospective and declared candidates has sparked discussions about what kind of leader the district should elect to represent a rare, solidly blue open seat. Pelosi won re-election to the San Francisco seat in 2024 with 81% of the vote.
    


            “We're really seeking authentic and courageous leadership for working families across the country, and San Francisco deserves no less,” Jane Kim, the California director for the Working Families Party, told CNN. “It is a generational chance for a bold new voice in Congress for the city by the bay, and we look forward to a robust endorsement process.”
    


            Here's how the field is shaping up so far:
    


            Chakrabarti launched his campaign to unseat Pelosi in February, arguing that while he respected what she had accomplished during her career, the Democratic Party needed new leaders who could meet the current moment. He helped kick off a wave of young challengers who argued the party needs to be completely overhauled.
    


            He praised Pelosi for deciding not to seek reelection.
    


            “I think it's a continuation of her leadership, to actually step down from power,” he said in an interview. “It's a very rare act of leadership in Washington, DC.”
    


            A software engineer by trade, Chakrabarti made his fortune as a founding engineer at the payment platform Stripe. He went on to work on independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, helped found Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challenges against centrist Democratic incumbents, and managed Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 congressional campaign. As her chief of staff, he helped author the Green New Deal, the left's sweeping climate policy legislation.
    


            Chakrabarti has pointed to that resume as proof of his progressive bona fides after facing criticism from some San Francisco progressives, particularly over his endorsement of a more centrist Board of Supervisors candidate who ousted a Democratic Socialists of America-backed incumbent last year. He said he's been attacked from both the left and the right over the course of the campaign.
    


            “In San Francisco, I guess I'm in the center somewhere, and I hope that means the majority of the city is with me,” he said.
    


            Wiener has focused on housing policy and LGBTQ rights during his nearly 10 years in the state Senate. He's also set up a robust fundraising operation – his campaign announced that it had raised more than $730,000 on the day he launched his bid last month, before Pelosi announced her plans to retire.
    


            Wiener said the presence of a self-funder like Chakrabarti in the race, and a looming filing deadline, spurred him to jump in.
    


            Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist, said that his decision to jump in early was “risky” but proved to be smart.
    


            “People understood that he couldn't wait forever,” he said.
    


            California's congressional filing period doesn't begin until early next year, at which point several Democrats and few Republicans could enter the race.
    


            Chan, who was first elected as a supervisor in 2020 and views Pelosi as a mentor, could garner support from progressives and labor leaders. Pelosi has not endorsed in the race, but political observers have noted the former Speaker and Chan worked together to pass Democrats' redistricting push, Proposition 50.
    


            “This moment is about thanking Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her legendary public service, and honoring her and her family for their extraordinary commitment to San Francisco and to bettering our entire country,” Chan said in a statement.
    


            The latest congressional hopeful to signal interest was Breed. The former mayor led the city from 2018 until 2025, after losing her re-election bid to incumbent Mayor Daniel Lurie.
    


            “It's important that San Franciscans have options,” Breed told Politico. “I want to explore whether I could potentially be one of those options.”
    


            Another open question is whether Pelosi's daughter, lawyer Christine Pelosi, will enter the race. Newman said that, for years, conventional wisdom held that the younger Pelosi would pursue the seat when her mother retired. That certainty has faded, he said.
    


            Whoever Pelosi eventually backs would become a frontrunner.
    


            “If Nancy picked somebody off the street, then that gives them a little bit of instant credibility,” Newman said.

Former President Joe Biden told a Nebraska audience that the Democratic Party is ""back"" after sweeping election wins and accused President Donald Trump of trampling on the Constitution and cutting healthcare funding.

Former President Joe Biden told Nebraska Democrats on Friday that their party ""is back"" after a series of sweeping election wins last week and also accused President Donald Trump of destroying the Constitution and cutting health care and food assistance for millions of Americans.

Biden, 82, speaking at the Nebraska Democratic Party's ""Ben Nelson Gala"" in Omaha, also urged Republicans to end the ongoing government shutdown and said his late son, Beau Biden, should have been president, not himself.

""The Democratic Party is back. That's not hyperbole,"" Biden said. ""Did you see the election results?""

Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., won gubernatorial races in their respective states, while Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani scored a stunning victory to become New York City's next mayor. The wins came a year after former Vice President Kamala Harris suffered a stinging defeat to Trump. 

Harris was propelled to the top of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket after Biden backed out of the race following a blistering debate performance against Trump. 

""Well, the American people are sending a message, a message to Trump and to his crowd,"" Biden said, accusing the president of trampling on democracy and working for the rich.

""I just want you to know you work for us, Mr. President. We don't work for you,"" Biden said. ""You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires. You know, this is democracy. And the fact of the matter is that there are no kings in democracies. None. None. But you act in a way that embarrasses the nation.""

Biden said Trump and the GOP were cutting health care programs and driving up costs, adding that more than 300 rural hospitals in America, including two in Nebraska, are expected to shut down.

BIDEN PRAISES LATE-NIGHT HOSTS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST TRUMP 'KNOWING THEIR CAREERS ARE ON THE LINE'

""Folks, I've never said this my whole career. I think it's immoral. It's un-American. It's flat-out wrong,"" Biden said.

Biden, who had a bandage on his head, referred to his own battle with cancer and praised the health care workers who have been treating him. He was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer earlier this year.

""I know what cancer research means. Cancer. It's every family. It hit my family hard, just as so many of yours,"" Biden said. ""When the love of my life, my oldest son, the attorney general of the state of Delaware, who should have been the president, not me, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, didn't have to, came back with stage four glioblastoma because he lived in a burn pit just like those guys did on 9/11, and he died.""

Biden also took aim at Trump's plans to build a new ballroom at the White House after bulldozing the East Wing, calling it ""the perfect symbol of his presidency.""

""When I left the presidency, President Trump was going to take a wrecking ball to the country, but I had no idea it would be an actual wrecking ball,"" Biden said. ""Anyone see what he's done to the East Wing of the people's house? Trump has taken a wrecking ball not only to the people's house, but to the Constitution, to the rule of law, to our very democracy.""

He also accused Trump of ""deliberately making hunger worse"" and claimed ""one in five children go to bed hungry every night.""

He mocked Trump for holding a ""Great Gatsby"" themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago while cutting food aid for millions, saying it showed ""who he is.""

""On Friday, everyone dressed up like the rich folks they are from the Roaring Twenties and on Saturday he cut assistance to 40 million Americans,"" Biden said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","The race to $1 trillion: Who should win, Elon Musk or Ethereum?","https://cryptoslate.com/will-elon-musk-now-reach-1-trillion-before-ethereum/","Sat, 08 Nov 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

Elon Musk net worth to hit $1 trillion by 2035 surpassing the current market cap of Ethereum, USDT, XRP, and BNB combined.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

When Elon Musk crosses the trillion-dollar threshold, it will mark more than personal success. It will signal a new phase in economic history, where individual influence rivals that of entire states.

As a Bitcoiner, I see Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of decentralized wealth and democratized finance as a blueprint for diffusing power, a way to make value less dependent on singular actors.

Yet as capital, AI, and policy orbit Musk's expanding empire, his rise exposes how far we've strayed from that ethos.

The very idea of “value” may be consolidating again, this time not in governments or banks, but in individuals who wield technology as a form of leverage.

Some would say Bitcoin embodies the purest form of private property: unconfiscable, borderless, self-sovereign.

From that angle, Satoshi might not have viewed a trillionaire as a failure of decentralization but as its logical, perhaps unintended, consequence.

As of today, Tesla shareholders have approved a compensation package that could potentially increase Elon Musk's net worth to $1 trillion if the plan's milestones are met.

More than 75 percent of votes at Tesla's Nov. 6 annual meeting backed a multiyear, option-heavy plan that pays out only if Tesla clears operational and valuation hurdles, including a market capitalization of nearly $8.5 trillion and the deployment of large-scale autonomy and humanoid robotics.

The math embedded in Tesla's plan sets up an unusual comparison: a single individual's equity exposure can plausibly overtake the market cap of the top four altcoins combined.

If all of Musk's tranches vest and are exercised, his effective ownership could move into the mid-20s percent, subject to dilution and financing.

At $8.5 trillion, a 27 percent stake would be approximately $2.295 trillion from Tesla alone. SpaceX is valued at nearly $350 billion in private markets as of mid-2025, with published bull cases reaching the trillions by 2030 in defense and broadband.

xAI funding chatter has circulated in a $75 to $200 billion range. Layered together, the convexity of the option grant ties personal wealth to a small set of binary outcomes, above all, robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Those are policy-gated as much as they are technical. In California, Tesla holds a DMV permit for testing with a safety driver, not the driverless testing and deployment permits that unlock commercial-scale operations. Separate CPUC approvals govern the phases of ride service, according to state records and Reuters coverage.

NHTSA's scrutiny of Full Self Driving features remains a headline risk, as seen in prior probes covered by Ars Technica.

Currently, Elon Musk's net worth exceeds that of any single altcoin network. Only Bitcoin has a higher market cap at over $2 trillion, and I'm bullish enough on BTC to believe it will continue to outperform the portfolio of any private individual.

The next highest, Ethereum, has a market cap that has fluctuated in a $390 to $600 billion range in recent months, currently sitting at around $400 billion, which is around $100 billion below Musk's wealth.

So let's do some basic forward modeling.

Under a conservative scenario where autonomy is delayed and Optimus remains niche, Tesla reaches a valuation of $3 trillion by 2035, yielding approximately $750 billion for Musk's 25 percent stake in Tesla, with SpaceX at $500 billion and xAI at $50 to $100 billion.

That produces approximately $1.3 to $1.35 trillion in gross assets, and after accounting for exercise costs, taxes, and loans, net worth hovers just below, but may not surpass, the $1 trillion mark.

By comparison, if Ethereum were valued at $5,000 with 125 million coins, the market cap would be approximately $625 billion.

In a base case, Tesla reaches $5 trillion, Optimus works first in factories, and energy scales, putting Musk's Tesla stake at around $1.25 to $1.45 trillion, with SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $200 billion.

That configuration makes a trillion-dollar net worth a base outcome, while Ethereum, even at nearly $10,000 and with 120 to 125 million coins, places ETH's value around $1.2 to $1.25 trillion.

In a bull case, Tesla reaches a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion, robotaxis are widely adopted, humanoids are shipped at scale, SpaceX advances toward a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, and xAI surpasses $500 billion. Musk's wealth becomes multi-trillion.

The comparison is not hero versus protocol; it is equity optionality versus network adoption.

So, for Ethereum to surpass Musk within the next decade and reach a $1 trillion valuation first, ETH would need to break above $10,000, assuming Tesla's market cap remains below $3 trillion.

However, I believe that the social framing around these numbers also matters.

Research published through Cambridge University Press shows that admiration for the mega-rich, and related meritocracy or system-justifying beliefs, reduces support for redistribution and progressive taxation, including among lower-income groups.

Long-term research in political science suggests that policy outcomes are more responsive to the preferences of affluent individuals than to those of average citizens, indicating that extreme concentration can lead to enduring political influence.

In parallel, studies in economics have found that exposure to wealthier peers lowers life satisfaction and increases conspicuous consumption and borrowing, with significant effects at the lower end of the distribution, as documented in the Quarterly Journal of Economics and related work.

Polling by the Harris Poll in 2024 shows majorities say billionaires do not do enough for society, and UK polling points to broad concern about the political reach of the very rich.

These are not abstract vibes around celebrity. They are channels through which billionaire glamor and media narratives feed back into budgets, ballots, and debt.

Forbes counted 3,028 billionaires in 2025, a record high, out of a world population of roughly 8.23 billion, which means about one in 2.7 million people.

No trillionaire currently exists. UBS estimates global household wealth at $450 trillion. One trillion dollars is about 0.22 percent of that total. The median adult wealth globally is in the low thousands of dollars, and more than 80 percent of adults have less than $100,000, according to Reuters' summary of UBS data.

A one trillion-dollar personal fortune would equal the entire net worth of approximately 100 to 130 million median adults. The base rate for anyone moving from millionaire to billionaire is vanishingly low. Treating a trillion as an aspirational target for the public is numerically incoherent.

Policy choices are the swing factor around the tail. Status quo rules let top-end fortunes compound, and given the documented tilt in policy responsiveness, affordability issues tend to lag behind.

A targeted 2 percent annual tax on billionaire wealth, as modeled by Zucman and cited by Oxfam and reported by The Washington Post, would raise approximately $250 billion per year, which could fund public goods or cost-of-living relief while modestly trimming the tail.

A cultural shift away from grand man narratives and toward systemic accounts of progress raises support for progressive taxation in experimental settings, creating a softer check on the spillovers of billionaire worship.

None of these measures changes Tesla's valuation math or crypto demand curves on their own. They adjust the environment in which extreme fortunes sit.

There is also a governance angle within Tesla. Shareholders, not just the board, priced the option convexity and approved it, which answers one critique while raising another.

If state permits and safety agencies effectively gate the autonomy cash flows that underpin the plan, then public oversight now sits upstream of private wealth options worth trillions.

According to Reuters and California DMV records, Tesla still requires driverless testing and deployment approvals for the robotaxi scale in key markets, and NHTSA reviews remain active. The calendar for those decisions, not press events, will determine whether the package converts.

We do not need to cheer or boo Musk to see the comparison cleanly.

A monetary network's path to one or two trillion relies on adoption, throughput, and flows. In contrast, a founder's path to one or more trillion relies on a narrow set of technical and regulatory unlocks.

One can admire execution or engineering without celebrating a culture of billionaire worship that blunts support for redistribution and amplifies the sway of elites over policy. The math is plain, the worship is optional.

Ultimately, whether the first to reach $1 trillion is a man or a network, the more important question is what kind of system we want to empower: one built on individual ambition or collective adoption?

1. the title was unneccessarily editorialized,
2. the word gamified is used wrong here, and
3. There was never any good reason to add the word gamified to the title, other than adding a buzzword.The feedback people give is probably a bit harsh, but I find it understandable. If you don't know what a term means, don't use it - especially not if it's completely unnecessary as in this case.

I kind of avoided it too, htop, bmon, iotop and nvidia-smi worked fine as it was. But eventually came across it for the Nth time and finally tried it out, it's basically all of them in one, with some nicer graphs and customization. Do I require it to do my job? No, but with it I need 3-4 tmux panes less to see the same info. Also does most of the stuff I used htop for, sorting by different things, filtering by letters and easy to kill the currently selected process.

There is also Below. Which has a much more htop/btop like interface than dstat. Below records system info over time, and allows time travel! However, it's not as convenient as dstat, not at a glance, as one has to to scrub through time. But it is pretty impressive system monitoring, great for what it is! It's per-process pressure metrics are also utterly unbeatable. The way it rolls up cgroups is also stellar.

Well, this would also ban things like GPS, or hooking up Spotify to your steering wheel media buttons.I think targeting texting + social media is the right approach.

Jon Caramanica records pop music reviews for the New York Times while driving. It's completely asinine.

That's what the hands free laws in most states addressed- using a cellphone while driving became a primary offense, something you could be pulled over for or ticketed for even if you hadn't done anything else wrong.The ultimate goal is to stop people from distracted driving before they cause an accident, but it's not always easy to see who should be stopped and who shouldn't, so a lot of people get away with it anyway.

That is false.  People get pulled over all the time for obvious distractions.  Someone addicted to watching the hundreds of bodycam video channels.Perhaps the cops in your area were told to focus on other things.  The Sheriff in my area are somewhat like that whereas the state troopers will happily pull someone over that looks suspicious or has out of state plates distractions aside.  Enforcement and abuse vary by location.

Sounds like something that could be easily abused for cracking down on filming police or similar. Filming ICE agents arresting someone and posting on tiktok? ""obstruction of justice"", plus they're obviously doing it ""for social media"". Same for whistleblowers or security researchers.

Your last two sentences point in the correct direction: we can't micro-target every behavior that might possibly become a dangerous distraction, because that's just about everything. Driving safely depends on self-regulation, and people incapable of self-regulating (to a minimum standard) shouldn't be granted the privilege of a license.

Mostly the ones I drove were able to tell if I was distracted by checking my instruments or mirrors, or over my shoulder before changing lanes.I came very close to just abandoning the fucking thing in a car park, and getting a train instead.

Someone just needs to put that in a car. We've also got lidar based cruise control systems to maintain distance as well as panic brake systems that can react to something in front of the vehicle faster than a human, which is partially there to account for people texting and driving while flying up on a red light with stopped traffic.We have all the tech needed to make it damn near impossible for a 2 ton mass of steal to just unflinchingly mow someone down, yet we live in a world where it's cheaper to not make those things standard, even knowing without it, more people will die than with it.

‘We will fight' promises Alonso as he targets points in the Sao Paulo GP from P11

‘In Q2 it just slipped away from me' – Stroll reflects on P14 in Sao Paulo Qualifying

Lando Norris, Kimi Antonelli and George Russell report back on the Sprint from Sao Paulo.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes), 3. George Russell (Mercedes)

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)

Q: Lando, you said yesterday after qualifying, “If I could cruise to a victory, that would be beautiful.” It didn't really look like a cruise but just talk to us about how difficult it was to judge the grip in those first few laps.

Lando NORRIS: It was tough. Yeah, it was tough. I mean, it makes the win a little bit more rewarding when you have a race like this. Especially with Kimi here, he was certainly not making my life easy.

But it's one of those ones where you have to push because you know the guy behind is going to try and push a little bit more. But it was sketchy. I had a couple little lifts. Even with the wind, it was tricky. With the degradation on the tyres, it was difficult. So, yeah, definitely not an easy race, but probably the race you expect here in Brazil – always a difficult one.

Q: With the red flag and the tyre change, you were saying that the Softs maybe weren't actually the tyre to be on at the end. Whose decision was that to make the switch during the red?

LN: Who said that? I didn't say that.

Q: You didn't? Oh no. Sorry. Nobody said that. How were the tyres at the end?

LN: Yeah, I mean, it was a struggle. Of course, the Softs at the beginning, I expected them to be better. But the Mercedes were quick and Kimi kept me under pressure the whole race. So I just expected us to be a little bit better and we weren't. I don't know how much is down to the tyres or just that they did a good job and they were quick today. So, we've got some homework to do before quali.

Q: Fair enough. But Mercedes was very quick today. Second, Kimi Antonelli, congratulations. Just how much fun was that out there battling first with George on that restart and then pushing Lando for the win late?

Kimi ANTONELLI: Yeah, it was a very fun race. You know, it was very tricky conditions, especially at the beginning. But we tried to keep the pressure on Lando and, yeah, just came up short. But, you know, tyre deg was quite big and the wind was picking up during the race, so it was a struggle, but it was a fun race.

Q: It was a great result yesterday in qualifying. You said afterwards that if it wasn't for a little mistake, maybe in Turn 10, you could have fought for pole. After this result, knowing what you learned yesterday, how confident are you going into that GP qualifying?

KA: Oh definitely, you know, the confidence is high. But, you know, the field is so tight. At the end, yesterday was really hard to put the lap together and I believe everyone did a few little mistakes.

So we'll see today what we can do, but hopefully we can achieve the same result or even better.

Q: Alright. George, P3. I know it's only Sprint points, but you guys are locked in such a tight battle with Ferrari. With them struggling, both of you guys up here, how critical is it to capitalise on these opportunities for the Constructors'?

George RUSSELL: Yeah, I mean, it was a good race for us both. Kimi did a great job and obviously put Lando under a bit of pressure. And, yeah, P2, P3 was a really good result, but we need to try and do the same again this afternoon. Qualifying is so tight, and it's very difficult to overtake at the moment. So that's going to be key.

Q: Was there a bit of relief that it ended up being dry and not wet so you guys could learn a little bit more for the Grand Prix tomorrow?

GR: No, I mean, it's so different when you're doing the qualifying laps versus the consecutives. There's a lot of tyre degradation there. So at the end it was a bit difficult, and I think Lando was struggling. But no, we feel good. The temperatures are cool and we know that's how we like it. So let's see what we can do later.

Q: Alright. Lando, you said a little bit of homework to do before qualifying this afternoon. But are you confident that you and Oscar can both be fighting for pole?

LN: I'm confident we can do that. I think our quali pace was good, but the wind changed a lot today. The conditions are quite different. So today's different to yesterday. Tomorrow's going to be another day. But they're going to put us under pressure I'm sure. So, yeah, like they said, small gaps and you've got to do some perfect laps.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Lando, perfect start to the weekend for you, and you've extended your lead in the World Championship. Talk us through it. How hard was it to navigate those tricky conditions?

LN: Certainly a lot trickier than I would have liked. I mean, for both reasons. One, because the conditions were tough. The first lap going up the hill, knowing how much to lift, a couple of little moments, and then obviously Turn 1 braking always being pretty difficult and just not wanting to ever take too much of a risk. But, at the second point, just not being quite quick enough. In the second part of the race on the Softs, Kimi was quick. It was always like 1.2s down to 1. I made a bit of a mistake into Turn 4 on one of the laps. So, yeah, just didn't plan for it being quite as difficult as it was today, but we held on. Difficult for many reasons, but that's part of it.

Q: Lando, you held on. Yes, you did. Just talk us through the decision to swap to the soft.

LN: Will said, ""Do you want a soft?"" and I said, ""Yeah."" That was the decision.

Q: But were you concerned at all about the longevity of the tyre?

LN: Difficult because, obviously, we were already eight laps in by that point. So a third of the race was done. The others obviously started on the Soft in slightly wetter conditions, so their expectation was to get to the end of the race. Others, only what, four or five people on the Soft, they were expecting to get to the end of the race. So we thought it would be OK. But even in the first part when Kimi was on the Soft and we were on the Medium, I wasn't pulling away that much. The gap was pretty similar to what it was in the second part. So I think we just weren't quite quick enough, or as quick as what we would have liked. But, yeah, many things change – a bit cooler, the wind changed 180 degrees. So just understanding if the car was maybe not quite in the perfect position.

Q: Alright. Well, Lando, very well done to you. Thank you for that. Kimi, can we just talk through the decision to swap to the Medium tyre, first of all?

KA: Well, it was a bit like Lando. Bono said if I wanted to keep the tyre or not, and I said no, I'm going to switch to the Medium. The decision to go to the Soft at the start of the race was mainly because it was still quite wet. And, you know, despite the surface temp going up during the lap, with the wet part, they will cool down. So we were expecting the Soft to hold on until the end. We were also trying to have a little advantage in the first few laps. But then obviously with the red flag, we decided to go on the Medium because yesterday, to be honest, the Medium felt really good. So we decided to go on the Medium also because the track was basically fully dry and also to be able to give it a big push.

Q: How much did you fancy your chances of getting past Lando in those closing laps?

KA: Well, I tried. Obviously, when he did the mistake in four, I was very close. But it's always a bit hard to follow and especially with the wind changing, traction out of T10 and going down to T11 was very tricky. I couldn't really stay as close as I wanted there, but still, it was a fun race, and now we're focused on qualifying.

Q: The car looks very good here. Are you looking at a pole position car? Do you think you can win this race tomorrow?

KA: I mean, that's a bold statement. Of course, I want to win. That's the goal. The field is just very tight, and we saw yesterday in qualifying that we had a real shot to pole. So I think anything is possible. If we can improve the car even further, I think in quali we can have a good chance to be in top three, and then we can put on a fight in the race.

Q: Alright. Well done. Good luck with that. George, just coming to you, a very solid start to the weekend for Mercedes. How pleased are you with the pace of the car, first of all?

GR: Yeah, it was definitely a strong race. I think we obviously had a good qualifying yesterday, and we seemed to be sort of second best after the McLarens. I think the Medium tyre was the better of the two today. Kimi and I probably struggled a little bit at the beginning, but then it was good after the red flag. So, pretty pleased with that.

Q: If the Medium tyre was the better tyre, why did you start on the soft originally?

GR: Well, originally because it was a little bit damper. Obviously, it could potentially be a race tyre tomorrow as well, with the Medium, and we've only got one new Medium. So you're potentially thinking ahead to tomorrow as well, like, what's your back-up Medium tyre. But we had to swap at the red flag because we only had one Soft tyre, whereas the guys who were on the Medium had a new Soft tyre because they didn't start on the Soft. So it was easier for us to decide to go onto the Medium than it probably was for those starting on the Medium.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Jon Noble – The Race). To Lando and Kimi, and maybe George if he's got anything extra to say. On lap six, Lando, it appears you may have kind of started a sequence of events when you ran wide across the kerb at Turn 3 and pulled some water. How did that corner pan out for you during the race? Was it the first time you'd gone there, and was it a mistake to run across Turn 3? And Kimi, how did you view things from there? I think you said on the team radio that you felt Lando pulled the water back onto the kerb and track.

LN: Yeah, I mean, it's a kerb you always use in quali. We use it a lot. Obviously, when it's wet conditions like this, you kinda want to stay off all the kerbs. So I ran a little bit wide, and I saw the water come onto the track. But, yeah, that was it.
GR: A little bit like Mario Kart when you throw the banana out. Smartest guy on the grid, this guy!

KA: I think I saw Lando going wide and water came up and actually had a lot of water going into my visor. But I was just trying to stay away from kerbs during the whole race because it was very tricky, especially at the beginning. So especially when I saw him lifting water, I tried to take a bit more care just to avoid any spin or moments, because obviously, especially in the beginning the last sector and Sector 1, it was the wettest. And, yeah, it was really crucial to make it tidy in order to make it through as well.

Q: (Jake Boxall-Legge – Autosport) A question for all three, if possible. Obviously it rained overnight, then dried a little bit. Can you tell us a bit about the grip you experienced on the formation lap? And Lando, on that formation lap, you seemed to go quite quickly — you were in a bit of a hurry. Could you just explain that approach as well?

LN: I mean, I did a bit of both. I went quickly in parts because you want to try and get the temperature in. Also you don't want the people behind to get the temperature in. So I tried going pretty slow at the end of the lap, but Kimi went even slower. And he still gave himself some opportunities. In a race like this, it's all about trying to get as much tyre temp as you can, especially because I knew they were on the Softs. My only opportunity to probably stay ahead was to try and do the best job I could to get tyre temperature in. So I didn't think I went that quickly. I just went the speed I thought was correct.

KA: Yeah, I don't think he went that quick to be fair. I even had to pull the clutch at some point because he was stopped, and I wanted him to go away. It's a short track, and especially with the conditions today — it was still damp, especially in the beginning — you try to get as much temperature as possible. So when you stop on the grid, you're more or less in the right window for the start. It's always tricky because the guy in P1 in most cases in these conditions has a bit of a disadvantage, because the others can just take a gap and push a bit more. So, yeah, it's not easy, but you always try to get as much temperature as possible.

Q: (Maria Clara Castro – Car Magazine Brazil). Question to Kimi. Not bad at all for a first time racing here. Which parts of the track did you struggle with, and which parts do you feel good already?

KA: Well, today in the Sprint I was struggling a bit at the end of sector two, out of 10, 11, especially when I was close to Lando, just struggling to stay close. Overall, I felt good in Sector 1. In the Senna ‘S' I was able to be strong on braking. Also first part of Sector 2 I felt in a good place. Obviously today with the wind changing, all the corners are different, so it was all about trying to adapt the best way possible.

‘We will fight' promises Alonso as he targets points in the Sao Paulo GP from P11

‘In Q2 it just slipped away from me' – Stroll reflects on P14 in Sao Paulo Qualifying

F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne looks back at Jenson Button's career, after the 2009 World Champion announced his retirement from professional racing.

Jenson Button's announcement that he will retire from professional motor racing after this weekend's Bahrain 8 Hours brought a smile to my face and a flood of (mainly) happy memories.

We first met in 1998 in David Kennedy's Grand Prix Racewear business near the big roundabout in Chiswick, when my elder son Tom and I were buying some racegear.

Jens was racing in Formula Ford with our mate Keith Sutton's business name emblazoned in orange on the side of his white Haywood Racing Mygale. And, of course, he was shy, just like Martin Brundle and Markie Blundell were when we first met. Yes, I know, hard to believe now.
