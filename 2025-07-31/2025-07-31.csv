            There is a dangerous risk for torrential rainfall and flash flooding in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Thursday for millions along the Interstate 95 corridor. It could be another potentially serious flood event in a summer that's been full of them.
    


            Heavy storms are expected to bubble to life in the afternoon and last through the evening, and some could dump several inches of rain in a few hours, flooding roads and threatening public transit during the busy evening commute.
    


            The Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding rain from Washington, DC, to New York City and the southernmost part of Connecticut. This threat level means numerous flash floods are likely, some of which could threaten life and property in vulnerable urban areas. Philadelphia and Baltimore are also included in this risk area.
    


            A Level 2 of 4 risk of flash flooding is in place for a broader area extending inland from Virginia Beach up through southern New England, including the rest of Connecticut.
    


            New Jersey will be under a state of emergency starting mid-afternoon due to the potential for intense rainfall and flash flooding, according to a news release from acting Gov. Tahesha Way.
    


            “I urge all New Jerseyans to remain alert, follow all safety protocols, and monitor the proper channels for the duration of these storms,” Way said in the release. “Residents should remain off the roads and indoors unless absolutely necessary.”
    


            Travel disruptions could be severe as the heaviest rain may fall during the evening commute. Subways could also see serious flooding, as New York saw earlier this month, when intense rainfall in the span of hours sent water gushing onto platforms and into subway cars.
    


            Some storms are expected to train, or continue moving or redeveloping over the same areas, raising rainfall totals considerably. A few locations could get up to 8 inches of rain in a short amount of time, though exactly where the most intense storms will set up within the Level 3 of 4 area remains uncertain.
    


            The rain is due to a cold front that is breaking a long-lasting, punishing heat dome that has been keeping the East sweltering during the day and simmering at night.
    


            After a summer of frequent rain and flooding, the water simply has no place to go. And even if the region wasn't soaked, extreme rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour could overwhelm areas that typically drain well. Cities often struggle to handle heavy rain as pavement and asphalt keep water from soaking into the ground and instead head for drains that are prone to clogging or simply incapable of handling the volume of water.
    


            “This type of setup carries the potential for very rapid rises on small streams and dangerous flooding in city streets,” the WPC said. “Residents in the mid‑Atlantic should ensure they have reliable ways to receive warnings throughout the day and into Thursday night.”
    


Flash floods are most common in summer, as warmer air can hold more moisture and intense daytime heat helps fuel potent storms. But overwhelming rainfall is becoming more prevalent due to climate change, as rising global temperatures drive weather toward extremes. Hourly rainfall rates have grown heavier in nearly 90% of large US cities since 1970, according to a study from the nonprofit research group Climate Central.
    


            Rainfall across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast has already been above normal this summer — especially in parts of eastern Pennsylvania, central New Jersey, northern Maryland, and the DC suburbs — leaving soils saturated and primed for rapid runoff and flooding even without extreme amounts of rain.
    


            Flood watches are already in effect for the at-risk portion of the I-95 corridor and surrounding areas, including Washington, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City. Most of these watches will remain in place into Friday morning.
    


            Nearly all of New Jersey is in the risk area. The state has been slammed by flooding this summer, including when at least two people were killed two weeks ago. The increased risk also includes parts of Virginia that have flooded multiple times this season.
    


            Flooding can be extremely dangerous at night, when it's harder to see water covering roads. “If you encounter a flooded roadway, turn around and find another route,” the National Weather Service advises. “It only takes six inches of fast‑moving water to knock over an adult and just 12 inches to sweep away most vehicles.”
    


            Less than two weeks ago, on July 19, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency — the highest level of flood alert — for the Washington, DC, area with rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches in 30 minutes raising rivers and sending water over roadways. Dozens of people had to be rescued from floodwaters after heavy rain struck parts of Virginia, Maryland and Washington, DC.
    


            The flood risk shifts south into the Carolinas and part of Georgia on Friday, more states all too familiar with serious flooding this summer. Tropical Storm Chantal's flooding rainfall killed at least one person in North Carolina in early July.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","One of the world's most isolated countries, this former Soviet state is showing signs it's ready for more tourists","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/travel/turkmenistan-tourism-visas-opening","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 09:10:00 GMT","


            When the Turkmenistan government announced new streamlined visa regulations in April, people familiar with traveling to the Central Asian nation were unsure what to make of it.
    


            Not that there are many such experts — along with North Korea and Eritrea, Turkmenistan has long been considered one of the globe's most isolated countries, a legacy that dates to the 1990s when the nation broke away from the disintegrating Soviet Union and turned inward, settling into a sealed-off, independent authoritarianism.
    


            For certain travelers, though, especially those who gravitate toward conflict zones and geopolitical oddities, Turkmenistan's impenetrability has given it an alluring mystique. There's just one problem: getting in.
    


            Scoring a tourist visa is a long and involved process that requires obtaining a Letter of Introduction (LOI) from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after booking your visit with a government-approved tour operator. The vetting — the government decides if you should be allowed to enter — can sometimes take months.
    


How a drab Soviet metropolis became Central Asia's capital of cool



            Word that the regime intended to make things more user-friendly for travelers, then, was startling, says Dylan Lupine, whose UK-based Lupine Travel offers small-group Turkmenistan tours.
    


            “We are still in the dark about it, as are our local partners in Turkmenistan, as there have been no updates since,” Lupine says. “The new visa regulations haven't yet come into place and there's no news of when this will be happening.”
    


            If and when the new process kicks off, visitors would be able to apply online, with officials pledging that it will be much faster and result in fewer rejections. The LOI requirement will reportedly vanish, but visitors will still need a “sponsor” in Turkmenistan, which in most cases means signing up for a guided tour.
    


            “Once it does come into place, I do think it will strongly boost visitor numbers,” Lupine adds.
    


            CNN has reached out to Turkmenistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.
    


            For decades — even before independence from the USSR — Turkmenistan's main attraction has been the Darvaza Gas Crater. Located in the Karakum Desert about a four-hour drive from capital city Ashgabat, the huge fiery pit is a manmade phenomenon, created during the Soviet era when a natural gas exploration rig collapsed into a sinkhole.
    


            After traveling across the desert in 4x4 caravans, visitors check into yurt camps and make their way to the edge of the rim around the “Gates of Hell” after dark to feel the heat and listen to the sizzle of the flames licking up from the bottom.
    


            However, Darvaza is literally running out of gas. In recent years, the flames have noticeably receded, and there are predictions the crater may flame out completely in coming years.
    


Turkmenistan's mysterious, flaming ‘Gates of Hell'



            But that doesn't mean there aren't other reasons to visit. Ancient Silk Road cities with their historic mosques and minarets offer dramatic contrast to Ashgabat with its over-the-top modern architecture and grandiose monuments featuring everything from post-communist leaders and medieval poets to golden horses, the national dog, and a gigantic bull balancing the world on its head.
    


            Given the fact they encounter very few foreign visitors, the Turkmen people are warm and welcoming. If arid landscapes are your thing, around 80% of Turkmenistan is desert. And there's the novelty of exploring a place that few others have visited in modern times.
    


            “Turkmenistan is unlike any country I have visited,” says the Norwegian writer and anthropologist Erika Fatland, author of “Sovietistan” and other books about Central Asia and the former Soviet Union.
    


            “The shining white marble capital of Ashgabat, with its empty lanes, is one of the weirdest capitals I have ever visited.”
    


            Spangled with golden statues and white marble, Ashgabat is both an architectural wonder and Instagram icon. Many of the structures are shaped like their government functions — like a Ministry of Oil & Gas building that resembles a giant lighter. Others were created to capture Guinness World Records — including the world's largest indoor Ferris wheel and a colossal horse head that hovers above the national stadium.
    


            At the city's indoor Russian Bazaar, vendors offer samples of caviar harvested from Turkmenistan's slice of the Caspian Sea, as this writer discovered during a recent visit. A blend of Persian and Central Asian influences, the culinary scene is surprisingly good. Nightlife is rather limited, but you can grab a cold beer at Clever's Irish Pub or the Florida British Pub.
    


            Once in a strategic position along the Silk Road trading route between Asia and Europe, the country has multiple UNESCO World Heritage Sites including the Parthian Fortresses of Nisa near Ashgabat and the sprawling ruins of Merv in eastern Turkmenistan. Even more impressive are the richly decorated grand mosque, tombs and towering minaret at Kunya-Urgench in the far north.
    


            “My most beautiful experiences in Turkmenistan were in the countryside, in the desert, where I encountered the friendliest, most hospitable people I have ever met,” says Fatland. “The only drawback was the fermented camel milk, chal, the de facto national drink, that they kept serving me in generous quantities. Let's just say that it's an acquired taste.”
    


            Ironically, Turkmenistan was easier to visit during the Soviet days, when Intourist expedited travel in the USSR. Created in 1929 by autocratic leader Joseph Stalin, the state travel agency was tasked with earning foreign exchange via tourism and making sure visitors (nearly all of them on closely supervised guided tours) only saw the best side of the Soviet Union.
    


            With offices in London, New York and other foreign cities, Intourist lured travelers with striking posters and newspaper ads. Among the tours they offered in the 1930s was a 16-day Immemorial Cities of Turkestan journey that included a stop in “flourishing Ashkhabad.”
    


            Tourism grew slowly at first. But with the Cold War thawing in the 1980s, the USSR was attracting around four million tourists per year. The unraveling of the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall offered a chance to increase visitation even more. Yet Turkmenistan didn't leap on the bandwagon.
    


            When Moscow offered its 14 socialist republics independence in 1991, Turkmen leader Saparmurat Niyazov initially balked at the notion.
    


            “It's really all down to Niyazov,” says Lupine. “Prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union, his actions demonstrated negativity against perestroika and glasnost. He brought in his own methods after independence, but they were strongly influenced by the Soviet model.”
    


            Or rather the old Soviet model that limited overall tourist numbers and kept them on a tight leash, on guided tours that included only the aspects of Turkmenistan that Niyazov wanted to show the outside world.
    


            Meanwhile, the country's huge gas reserves meant Turkmenistan was able to remain self-reliant and neutral in the post-Soviet era, eliminating the need for any outside international influence. Even after Niyazov's death in 2006, the new leadership continued to keep a tight rein on foreign visitation.
    


            But there are hints that change might be just around the corner.
    


            According to the most recent Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI) report on Turkmenistan, the country has been plagued by economic woes for nearly a decade. Hoping to attract more foreign investment and increase employment, the government has been seeking economic cooperation with other nations, like the natural gas sharing arrangement it recently forged with Turkey and Iran.
    


            Some observers think the move to simplify its visa approvals process and increase tourism is part of this overall strategy, another way to boost its foreign exchange reserves. Tourism is booming in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, two of its Central Asian neighbors.
    


            “When Uzbekistan simplified their visa procedures after (President Islam) Karimov's death, tourism increased manifold, and maybe they are hoping for similar effects in Turkmenistan,” says Fatland.
    


            “The other ‘Stans' have all opened for visa-free entry for many nationalities, so maybe the Turkmen felt the need to loosen up a bit.”

The US has imposed sweeping new sanctions on Iran's international shipping network, accusing it of illegally funneling tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue to Tehran.

The sanctions, announced on Wednesday, target more than 100 individuals, companies, and vessels that the US Treasury described as part of a “vast shipping empire” run by trader Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of Ali Shamkhani, a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The Treasury accused Shamkhani of using his father's influence to build a fleet of tankers and container ships moving billions of dollars' worth of oil and petroleum products from Iran and Russia to buyers worldwide, including China, allegedly illegally and through layers of “front” companies. It accused the network of “evading sanctions, laundering money, and obfuscating paper trails.” The sanctioned include 12 individuals – among them a French, a UK, and an Italian national – as well as 52 vessels and 15 shipping companies, including one based in Switzerland.

“The Shamkhani family's shipping empire highlights how the Iranian regime elites leverage their positions to accrue massive wealth and fund the regime's dangerous behavior,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. “These actions put America first by targeting regime elites that profit while Tehran threatens the safety of the US.”

The sanctions, dubbed the most “massive” Iran-related package since 2018, are part of President Donald Trump's renewed “maximum pressure” strategy to end Iran's uranium enrichment program. They also follow recent US-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.

Tehran denounced the sanctions as unlawful. Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei on Thursday called them a clear sign of “the hostility of American policymakers towards the Iranian people,” claiming their real aim was to cripple Iran's development.

Iran's uranium enrichment activities have long been seen by the West as a secret attempt to develop atomic weapons.

Iran has repeatedly denied this, insisting its nuclear activities are solely for peaceful purposes. It also warned it would not bow to Washington's demands under pressure, denouncing the sanctions as acts of threat and intimidation.

Tehran has condemned the latest US sanctions on its oil shipping network. Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei has accused Washington of trying to cripple Iran's economic development and harm its people.

The US Treasury on Wednesday sanctioned more than 100 individuals, companies, and vessels it claimed are part of a “shipping empire” run by trader Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Washington alleged that Shamkhani and his network have illegally funneled tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue to Tehran.

“The unilateral and illegal US sanctions on Iran are a criminal act that violates the basic principles and norms of international law and human rights,” Baghaei said in a statement on Thursday. “The US government must be held accountable for the gross violations resulting from these illegal sanctions.”

He described the measures as “clear evidence of the hostility of American decision-makers toward Iranians,” citing Washington's “addiction to unilateralism and illegal and coercive means to achieve its illegitimate goals.”

Baghaei accused the US of “mocking the foundations of international law,” saying the sanctions “aim to cripple Iran's economic development and violate the fundamental rights of every Iranian.”

The sanctions are part of US President Donald Trump's renewed campaign to end Iran's uranium enrichment program, which he claims is a covert bid to build nuclear weapons. They follow recent US-Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump has warned of more attacks if the sites are restarted.

Iran has denied that it seeks nuclear weapons, insisting its program is peaceful. Responding to Trump's threat on X, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran will not abandon the program, which has involved “tremendous investment” in peaceful technology, “simply because bullying foreigners demand it.”

Araghchi told the Financial Times on Thursday that future talks with Washington on Iran's nuclear program can only take place if the US compensates Tehran for damages from last month's strikes. He reiterated there cannot be a deal as long as Trump insists on zero enrichment, but added that “a negotiated solution can be found.”

Syria is seeking Russia's support in its efforts to restore unity in the country after continued outbreaks of sectarian violence, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani has said during a visit to Moscow.

The situation in Syria has remained volatile since the ouster of longtime President Bashar Assad by a coalition led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) late last year. Assad, a close ally of Moscow, was replaced by HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. Despite the removal of Assad, who along with his family received political asylum in Moscow, Russia has pledged to continue supporting Syria.

Speaking alongside his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Thursday, al-Shaibani acknowledged Syria is facing “challenges and threats” but described it as “an opportunity to build a united, strong Syria.”

“Relations between the Russian and Syrian peoples are of a historical nature,” he said, as cited by TASS. “Today we are representing a new Syria... We are currently working to ensure the reunification of the people in Syria. And, of course, we are interested in Russia being there with us on this path.”

He added that Damascus is “interested in establishing proper interaction and relations” with Russia “based on cooperation and mutual respect.”

Lavrov said Moscow is closely following Syria's transition and will assist Damascus in stabilizing the country.

“We sincerely wish that the Syrian people, with whom we have long-standing friendship, cope with the challenges and fully normalize the situation,” he stated. He also expressed hope that Syrian President al-Sharaa will attend the upcoming Russia-Arab League summit in October.

Syria remains deeply fractured by sectarian tensions and armed groups. Since Assad's ouster, Islamist factions have reportedly targeted minority communities, including Alawites, Christians, and Druze. Earlier this month, clashes erupted between Druze militias, Bedouin tribes, and government forces in Sweida province. Complicating matters is Israel, self-styled protector of the Druze, which after Assad's fall invaded the buffer zone near the occupied Golan Heights, claiming it was to block hostile actors from its borders. Earlier this month it resumed airstrikes on Syria, including attacks on the Defense Ministry in Damascus.

Moscow has condemned Israel's actions as a violation of Syria's sovereignty and urged regional powers to support the country's territorial integrity.

James Andrew McGann was charged with the murders of Clinton and Cristen Brink at the Devil's Den state park

A 28-year-old Arkansas man was arrested on Wednesday in the killings of a married couple in front of their children at Devil's Den state park over the weekend, officials said.

Arkansas state police arrested James Andrew McGann from Springdale and charged him with two counts of capital murder. Police did not mention a possible motive.

McGann had been hired at Springdale public schools as a teacher candidate for the upcoming year but had not yet come into contact with any of its families or students, the district said in a statement.

A lawyer couldn't be located for him yet as he's just been arrested. It was not immediately clear when his first court appearance was, or where he was being held.

“No news can heal the enormous harm done to the Brink family in last weekend's crime, but this announcement is a comfort and reassurance for our state,” said Arkansas's governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a statement.

“If you commit a violent, senseless act here in our state, our law enforcement will hunt you down and bring you to justice, because that's what the people of Arkansas frankly deserve,” the governor added.

Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, were found dead on Saturday on a walking trail at Devil's Den. Their daughters, who are seven and nine, were not hurt and are being cared for by family members, authorities have said.

Police had released a composite sketch and photo of a person of interest they were searching for in the attack. Along with the drawing, state police released a statement saying the suspect “likely sustained an injury while attacking the couple”. It did not go into further detail.

The state police have released few details, including how the couple was killed. The FBI has said its Little Rock field office is assisting in the investigation. The head of the state police praised the cooperation among law enforcement in catching McGann.

“Because of their hard work and investigative skill, we were able to take a monster off the streets, and bring relief to those two precious girls, and the rest of our citizens,” Col Mike Hagar, the director of the Arkansas state police, said.

The Brinks had just moved from South Dakota to the small city of Prairie Grove in north-west Arkansas.

Clinton Brink had been scheduled to start a job as a milk delivery driver on Monday in the nearby Fayetteville area, according to Hiland Dairy, his employer. Cristen Brink had been licensed as a nurse in Montana and South Dakota before moving to Arkansas.

The Brink family said the couple died as “heroes protecting their little girls”.

Devil's Den is a 2,500-acre state park near West Fork, about 140 miles (220km) north-west of Little Rock, the state capital.

The park's trails, which lead to the surrounding Ozark national forest, remained closed on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former vice-president signals intent to become key force in Democrats' rebuild but leaves open possibility of future run

Following a devastating loss to Donald Trump, Kamala Harris returned home to California in January with a decision to make about her political future: to enter the race for governor, or not.

As she deliberated privately, the Democratic party was grappling publicly with a new political reality – one entirely reshaped by her defeat in last year's presidential election.

Approval ratings for the Democratic party had cratered. Grassroots frustration with their party's status quo swelled. And calls grew louder for Democratic officials to take a more combative – and urgent – stance against what many see as the Trump administration's authoritarian threat.

On Wednesday, when Harris announced that she would not run for governor of California, she also made clear that she had been listening.

“I have extraordinary admiration and respect for those who dedicate their lives to public service – service to their communities and to our nation,” she said. “At the same time, we must recognize that our politics, our government and our institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this moment of crisis.”

Harris continued: “As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change through new methods and fresh thinking – committed to our same values and principles, but not bound by the same playbook.”

It was a striking acknowledgment from the 2024 Democratic flag-bearer, suggesting a willingness to challenge party orthodoxy that critics says cost Democrats in November.

Before leaving the White House, Harris has been in elected office for more than two decades, breaking racial and gender barriers as she ascended from district attorney in San Francisco to attorney general of California before serving as US senator and then the vice-president of the United States.

Polls suggested Harris would have entered the gubernatorial race with an early lead over many of the lesser-known aspirants who have already declared their candidacies. The field is currently dominated by current and past election officials, including Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general of California, who served with Harris in Biden's cabinet as the secretary of health and human services; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles; the state's lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, who is close friends with Harris; former representative Katie Porter; and the California superintendent of public instruction Tony Thurmond.

Harris's decision throws open the race for California's governorship, a post seen as a critical bulwark against Trump's agenda.

It also leaves open the possibility that Harris could run again for political office. She did not rule out another run for the White House, saying only that “for now, my leadership – and public service – will not be in elected office”. A person familiar with her thinking said 2028 was not an overriding factor in her decision.

While Harris, 60, remains one of the most recognizable figures in American politics, with a deep fanbase and a broad fundraising network, she would have to persuade Democrats that, despite her 2024 loss, she was the best choice to lead the party into the post-Trump era.

Many in her party are eager to put the 2024 campaign behind them while some ambitious Democrats are already looking ahead to 2028, among them, Gavin Newsom, the term-limited California governor, and Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor who was Harris's running mate during their 100-plus day campaign last year.

Allies say declining to run for governor creates space for Harris to engage in political and policy debates without the constraints of a formal campaign.

She has explored other options, such as starting a non-profit or leading a policy thinktank, according to the person familiar with her thinking. On Thursday, Harris announced that she would release a memoir about her historic, truncated presidential campaign, titled 107 Days, to be published by Simon & Schuster on 23 September. A book tour will allow Harris to travel and remain in the national conversation.

The California congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, one of the Democrats Harris spoke with in recent months as she weighed a run for governor, said the vice-president would probably “lean hard” into helping Democrats win back seats in next year's congressional midterm elections. Winning back the House is seen as the party's best chance at blunting Trump's agenda and allies say Democrats will be eager to appear alongside Harris on the campaign trail, as they try to reconnect with young voters and communities of color, two blocs the party has struggled to mobilize in recent years.

Kamlager-Dove said Harris was likely to continue working to engage young voters, one of her priorities as vice-president. Days before her announcement, Harris delivered virtual remarks at the Voters of Tomorrow summit, in which she said the US should “invest” in Gen Z the way the US invested in the so-called “greatest generation” after the second world war. Calling Gen Z a generation that has “grown up on the frontlines of so many crises,” she urged them to “keep challenging the status quo”.

Whatever role Harris takes on next, her decision signals an intent to become a more central figure in the effort to rebuild her fractured party. And in embracing the growing consensus among Democrats that the old playbook is no longer fit for purpose, she may find herself uniquely positioned to help shape the next one.

In one of her conversations with Harris, Kamlager-Dove said the vice-president conveyed that this was a moment to “color outside of the line”.

“You will have to be a maverick,” she said, recalling Harris's comments earlier this year. “You may have to be unconventional in some of your approaches, because there are forces out there that are working to make us sicker, make us poorer, make us less safe, and we need as many people on the frontlines as possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Salt Lake City-to-Amsterdam flight landed in Minneapolis and injured passengers were taken to the hospital

At least 25 people were injured in a severe case of turbulence that forced a Delta Air Lines jet flying to Amsterdam into an emergency landing in Minneapolis, the airline said in a statement.

The flight had taken off from Salt Lake City in Utah but landed at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul international airport after “significant turbulence” struck.

“Medical personnel met the flight upon arrival to evaluate customers and crew. Twenty-five of those on board were transported to local hospitals for evaluation and care,” Delta said in a statement.

“We are grateful for the support of all emergency responders involved.”

William Webster, one of the passengers on board the stricken flight, told CNN it was “the craziest turbulence I've ever seen in my life”.

“I felt the centrifugal force. I was off my seat for like 30 seconds with the turbulence,” he said in an interview with the network.

The turbulence hit as a meal was being served, adding to the dangers to those onboard. “I watched a wine cart just get thrown into the air,” Webster added.

Turbulence has long been a problem for air travelers, but experts say the issue is getting worse in an era of climate crisis which produces more extreme atmospheric conditions.

“We can expect a doubling or tripling in the amount of severe turbulence around the world in the next few decades,” Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading, told the BBC.

The BBC reported that National Transportation Safety Board figures show that in the US alone, there have been 207 severe injuries since 2009. Severe injuries are defined as when an individual has been admitted to hospital for more than 48 hours.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A man was arrested in Yilan County early this morning for the murder of his 27-year-old ex-girlfriend last night in Taipei's Xinyi District (信義), police said today.

Emergency responders received a report last night at 8:46pm that a woman had been dragged into the stairwell of a parking lot on Songshou Road and stabbed in the back of her neck and abdomen.

Paramedics provided aid to the victim, surnamed Ku (谷), and rushed her to a hospital, but she did not survive her injuries, police said.

The suspect had already fled the scene, they added.

Reviewing the surveillance footage, they identified Ku's ex-boyfriend, Liu (劉), as a suspect, and arrested him in Yilan County early this morning at about 1am.

Sources have indicated that Ku and Liu were colleagues at a nightclub, although Liu recently quit.

The two allegedly had several long-standing relationship issues, sources added.

Last night, she rode her electric scooter into the parking lot, where Liu allegedly was waiting for her.

Upon her arrival, he allegedly attacked and killed her before fleeing in his own vehicle.

Speaking to the media, Ku's sister said: “There is no death penalty for murder in Taiwan. This is just the beginning and it will get worse, just watch.”

There are many such cases, she added.

Ku's sister said she had accompanied her to the police precinct to press charges against Liu for assault and apply for a restraining order in May.

Two days ago, Ku posted on the social media platform Threads about the case, sharing photographs of the May police report and injury report.

In her posts, Ku said that Liu committed acts of domestic violence, such as slapping and choking her, in addition to stalking her home and workplace.

She had just received confirmation that her restraining order against Liu was approved, she said in a post.

The Taipei Department of Social Welfare said it had assisted Ku in her application for the restraining order and discussed safety plans with her after the case was reported in May.

The department said it would provide legal advisory service and help with funeral arrangements for Ku's family.

Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) today said he had instructed the police to investigate the case and provide an explanation to the public in due time.

The quake struck off the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula at 7:25am (Taiwan time) at a depth of about 19km, the CWA said, citing figures from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose across-the-board import duties of 32 percent on Taiwan-made goods and levy a separate tariff on semiconductors, which Taiwan is hoping to avoid.
The Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology (DSET), a National Science and Technology Council think tank, said that US efforts should focus on containing China's semiconductor rise rather than impairing Taiwan.

The exhibition, which is to run from Aug. 10 to Aug. 20 at the city's Central Public Hall, is part of the “We Taiwan” at Expo 2025 series, highlighting Taiwan's cultural ties with the international community, National Museum of Taiwan Literature director Chen Ying-fang (陳瑩芳) said.
Folklore and literature, among Taiwan's richest cultural heritages, naturally deserve a central place in the global dialogue, Chen said.

Tensions began rising between the Southeast Asian neighbors in May, following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a brief exchange of gunfire, and have steadily escalated since, triggering diplomatic spats and now, armed clashes.
WHERE DOES THE DISPUTE ORIGINATE?
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at various undemarcated points along their 817km land border, which was first mapped by France in 1907 when Cambodia was

If carpooling is what comes to your mind, you might have heard of the travel app “BlaBlaCar.” This platform connects drivers with empty seats in their cars with passengers going the same way, allowing travel costs to be shared.
  BlaBlaCar's origins can be traced back to the Christmas season of 2003, when Frederic Mazzella was traveling from Paris to his family home in the French countryside. __1__ This observation gave rise to the idea of an online platform to connect drivers and                                    



                                                                                Alan Turing, celebrated as the “father of computer science,” was a brilliant mathematician and scientist. Born in London in 1912, Turing showed exceptional talent in mathematics and science from a young age. At 16, he understood Albert Einstein's work without difficulty. This intelligence carried him through studies at Cambridge University and later at Princeton University in the US, where he further explored complex mathematical theories.
In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical device for solving mathematical problems. He described it as having an infinite tape on which symbols could be read, interpreted, and modified. With simple

Once a match is made, the passenger books a seat and contributes to the driver's travel expenses, making the journey more economical for both parties. For safety reasons and ride preferences, both drivers and passengers can view each other's ratings and profiles before sending or accepting a ride request. __3__ The options range from “Bla” (quiet) to “BlaBla” (chatty) and “BlaBlaBla” (very talkative), which is why this app is named BlaBlaCar.

YOKOHAMA — Japan's Kenshiro Teraji was deprived of his world flyweight titles when he was defeated by Ricardo Sandoval of the United States in a split decision on Wednesday night in Yokohama.

The 33-year-old Teraji put his WBC and WBA flyweight belts on the line in the clash at Yokohama Buntai arena, but came up on the short end of two of the three judges cards for just the second loss of his career and first in four years.

Teraji knocked down Sandoval with right in the fifth round, but said later his indecision on whether to go on the attack or use his footwork to evade punches cost him points.

Sandoval particularly landed punches when the two fighters were in close.

“He was strong, and I couldn't finish him off,” said Teraji, who now has a career record of 25-2 with 16 knockouts.

Sandoval improved to 27-2 with 18 KOs.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to include former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's response. 

U.S. President Donald Trump on July 31 warned former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to ""watch his words,"" accusing him of crossing a line with increasingly inflammatory rhetoric.

""Let's keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former president of Russia, who thinks he's still president, to watch his words,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""He's entering very dangerous territory.""

In his post, Trump also dismissed concerns about India's trade with Russia. 

""They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,"" he wrote. ""We have done very little business with India; their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world.""

The remarks follow Medvedev's July 28 statement that Trump's ""ultimatum game"" with Moscow amounts to a threat to Russia and pushes the United States itself closer to war.

""Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,"" said Medvedev, currently deputy chair of Russia's Security Council. ""Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country.""

Medvedev is known for his aggressive, apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent threats of nuclear escalation. His posts regularly echo Kremlin propaganda, portraying Russia as the victim of Western aggression and defending further war escalation as justified.

In response to Trump's remarks, Medvedev said that if his words provoked such a ""nervous reaction,"" it meant ""Russia is right about everything and will continue to go its way.""

Medvedev mocked Trump's comments, referencing The Walking Dead TV show and warning the U.S. president to remember ""how dangerous a non-existent 'Dead Hand' can be"" — a nod to Russia's Cold War-era automated nuclear retaliation system.

Trump said on July 30 that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on Indian imports starting Aug. 1, criticizing New Delhi for buying Russian oil and arms.

The comments follow Trump's warnings of imposing 100% secondary tariffs on Russian oil within 10 days unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a peace deal in Ukraine.

The U.S. strategy seeks to pressure Moscow by curbing its oil income, which accounts for roughly one-third of federal revenue and remains a vital source of funding for its war effort.

Trump, who has promised to broker a peace deal ""within 24 hours"" if re-elected, has grown increasingly impatient with what he described as Russian foot-dragging in peace talks.

Nearly one in five car dealerships in Russia could shut down by the end of the year as the country's auto market struggles from plummeting sales and a worsening economic outlook, the Moscow Times reported.



""President Trump has made clear this must be done by Aug. 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,"" senior American diplomat John Kelley told the United Nations Security Council.

One of the main targets was a radio factory in the western city of Penza, which produces advanced communications systems for the Russian Armed Forces, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

""There is preliminary information that there were rocket-powered Shahed-type drones,"" said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.

If formalized, Nicaragua could become the first country to officially recognize Russia's annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts — territories Moscow declared part of Russia in 2022.

Three police officers and 12 children were among the injured. Thirty people, including five children, remain hospitalized as of 2:40 p.m. local time, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

The bill aims to reverse legislation passed last week that effectively destroyed the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor (SAPO).

""The situation in Chasiv Yar is the same as in recent months. Russia is simply lying again, precisely so that the claim spreads through refutations,"" said Viktor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Khortytsia group of forces, in a comment for the RBK-Ukraine news agency.

Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki emphasized that cooperation must be based on ""mutual respect and genuine partnership,"" according to his spokesperson Rafal Leskiewicz.

The amendment to the 2025 budget raises total defense and security spending to an estimated $50 billion, or 26% of Ukraine's GDP.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 309 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, along with eight Iskander-K cruise missiles, in an overnight assault.

Russian state-run media outlet RIA Novosti on July 30 published a column titled ""There is no other option: no one should be left alive in Ukraine.""

In the piece, columnist Kirill Strelnikov describes Ukrainians as ""happy with their fate"" and claims they are ""ready to die"" for what he derisively calls ""the best army in the world."" 

The article refers to Ukrainian soldiers as ""laboratory rats,"" denies their humanity, and includes a grotesque comment about ""no need for lacy underwear for the dead."" 

Strelnikov repeats Kremlin propaganda lines, including the claim that Ukraine is a ""military training ground"" for the West and that Ukrainians are mere pawns of the U.S. and Europe.

The article dismisses Western military analyses recognizing Ukraine's battlefield gains, naming institutions like the Atlantic Council and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and derides U.S. and U.K. generals for praising Ukraine's military.

The piece marks an escalation in Russia's dehumanizing war propaganda. 

Claims that Ukrainians are ""ready to die"" contradict the lived reality of a population resisting an unprovoked invasion, which Moscow started back in 2014, to defend their homes and sovereignty.

This rhetoric reflects a long-standing Kremlin narrative designed to strip Ukraine of agency and portray its people as expendable. 

Russia's war effort has increasingly relied on genocidal framing, echoing prior statements by state officials and propagandists that deny Ukraine's right to exist as a nation.

RIA Novosti is one of Russia's central state media arms and has consistently served as a platform for war propaganda, disinformation, and anti-Western messaging. 

Strelnikov, the article's author, is a co-founder of the nationalist media project Politrussia and a frequent contributor to other Kremlin-aligned outlets. His previous articles have spread falsehoods about the war, many of which have been debunked by independent media.

Editor's Note: This story is being updated.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law passed by the parliament on July 31 that restores the independence of two principal anti-corruption bodies after a closely-watched vote.

In the first livestreamed vote since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, 331 lawmakers approved the bill in two back-to-back readings, with none voting against it.

The newly signed law was published in the official parliamentary newspaper Holos Ukrainy, which means it will enter into force the next day, on Aug. 1.

The law reverses legislation passed last week that effectively destroyed the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office  (SAPO), two agencies founded as part of the post-EuroMaidan anti-graft reforms.

""I want to thank all the lawmakers for passing my bill, now a law. I have just signed the document, and the text will be published immediately,"" Zelensky said on his Telegram channel.

""There are guarantees for the proper, independent operation of anti-corruption bodies and all law enforcement agencies of our state.""

The initial controversial bill, quickly pushed through by Zelensky's lawmakers and signed by the president on July 22, sparked mass demonstrations across the country and backlash from Ukraine's international partners.

Following the negative response abroad and at home, Zelensky proposed a new bill only two days later to restore the independence of the anti-corruption bodies.

Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC), a watchdog, supported Zelensky's initiative, saying it would ""restore the principles previously dismantled by the Verkhovna Rada.""

European Commission spokesperson for enlargement Guillaume Mercier said that with the vote, the Rada had restored key safeguards ensuring the independence of the anti-corruption bodies.

""In our view, the law addresses the key challenges to NABU and SAPO's independence. We will however need to check the final text,"" Mercier said.

Mercier added that the EU expects Ukraine to ""deliver on those commitments swiftly and take decisive steps on rule of law.""

Last week's law expanded the prosecutor general's authority over cases handled by the SAPO and NABU. It also allowed the prosecutor general to issue binding instructions to NABU, reassign cases outside the agency, and delegate SAPO's authority to other prosecutors.

Anti-corruption activists and opposition lawmakers said the changes dismantled safeguards that protect both bodies from political interference, while the bill's proponents claimed it aimed to combat alleged Russian influence within the agencies.

After the law was passed, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders appealed to Zelensky to stress the importance of anti-corruption infrastructure, a key condition for Ukraine's EU accession efforts.

The Rada corrected last week's damaging vote undermining NABU's & SAPO's independence. Today's law restores key safeguards, but challenges remain. The EU supports 🇺🇦 citizens' demands for reform.Upholding fundamental values & fighting corruption must remain the priority.

The European bloc also issued a private warning to Kyiv, saying that failure to reverse the controversial legislation could result in the suspension of certain funding programs, the Ukrainian media reported.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on foreign aid amid Russia's full-scale war. The EU and its member states have made available $180 billion in economic, military, and humanitarian assistance to the war-torn country since 2022.

The EU has already welcomed the latest bill reversing the reform.

""The (Verkhovna) Rada corrected last week's damaging vote undermining NABU's & SAPO's independence,"" said Marta Kos, the EU's enlargement commissioner.

""Today's law restores key safeguards, but challenges remain.""

Addressing the parliament ahead of the vote on July 31, Dmytro Kostiuk, a lawmaker from Zelensky's Servant of the People parliamentary group, claimed that he and his colleagues were pressured to support last week's bill.

Kostiuk, who voted for the July 22 law, announced that he is leaving Zelensky's parliamentary group in protest.

""There are many questions about the work of NABU and SAPO, but it was the creation of an anti-corruption infrastructure that was the main result of the EuroMaidan Revolution,"" he said.

Earlier, a lawmaker from the Servant of the People party told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity that most party members — without fully understanding the details — thought the July 22 bill came from the president and had been coordinated with U.S. and European partners.‌

Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, opposition lawmaker for the Holos party, said that today's vote is ""only the first step toward restoring the public's trust in the government.""

Talking to the Kyiv Independent after the vote, Yurchyshyn noted that elections are the usual way to ""restore trust"" in democracies, but under martial law imposed due to Russia's war, they cannot be held.

""Public trust in the government would be strengthened by bringing top corruption cases to court and ending pressure on the media and civil society activists, such as in the case of Vitaliy Shabunin,"" Yurchyshyn said.

Shabunin is Ukraine's leading anti-corruption activist and co-founder of AntAC, who faces charges for fraud and military evasion, an accusation his team dismissed as a political vendetta.

""We need unity to defeat Russia. But there can be no true unity between society and the government if the government focuses on closed-door deals instead of defending the public interest,"" Yurchyshyn added.

Protests against the initial bill have lasted several days in Kyiv and other cities. Demonstrators have gathered outside the Mariinskyi Palace, the presidential residence, and the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, for another rally ahead of the crucial vote on July 31.

After the vote's result was announced, protesters welcomed the move but stressed that more work remains.

""After the vote, I felt that our people are a powerful force, that the future is in our hands, and that we have the power to change the course of history. It all depends on us and our determination,"" Larysa Shotenko, a 59-year-old pensioner, told the Kyiv Independent at the rally near the Mariinskyi Palace.

Shotenko said she joined the protests with her granddaughter Mariia ""to defend Ukraine's European path,"" adding: ""I want us to be part of the EU, not a part of Russia. My son gave his life for our independence.""

""We are making progress, but we know how many more steps we need to take to build an independent country,"" said Oleksii Pashchenko, a 23-year-old project manager.

""This bill is crucial — it gives Ukrainians the chance to feel secure about their future. Without institutions like NABU, SAPO, and other anti-corruption agencies, Ukraine cannot be independent, nor can it have a future.""

Pavlo Hots, a 25-year-old musician serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said that further protests may yet be ""inevitable.""

""Maybe the government has gotten a bit complacent. But there are young people who are ready to show up at these rallies,"" he said.

Some protesters suggested that a change is needed within the parliament. The current composition of the legislature has been in place since 2019, before the outbreak of the full-scale war prevented another parliamentary election.

""It is frightening that the only real opposition to the government right now is civil society. This is a step toward authoritarianism,"" Bohdan Prykhodko, a 23-year-old documentary filmmaker, told the Kyiv Independent.

The backlash against the July 22 bill was compounded by other controversies, including charges against Shabunin and other setbacks in anti-corruption reforms.

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko's new cabinet again did not appoint Oleksandr Tsyvinsky as the new head of the economic crimes bureau, despite his backing among a selection committee and a looming deadline by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Reforming the Bureau of Economic Security (BEB) — which was created in 2021 to investigate economic crimes — is a critical component of Ukraine's broader commitments to both the IMF and the European Union.

""Ukraine must proceed with the appointment of the head of the Economic Security Bureau as soon as possible,"" Mercier said, according to European Pravda.

The EU Commission spokesperson also emphasized that progress across all rule-of-law areas is ""a vital step"" for the EU.

The IMF originally set a February 2025 deadline for the appointment, but extended it to the end of July after Kyiv missed the initial benchmark.

The government originally rejected Tsyvinsky's candidacy, citing security concerns after the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) noted his estranged father has Russian citizenship, despite the information having long been known.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to increase tariff rates on imported goods from nearly all U.S. trading partners on Aug. 1.Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press

U.S. appeals court judges sharply questioned on Thursday whether President Donald Trump's tariffs were justified by the president's emergency powers, as lawyers for states and businesses challenging the measures argued he exceeded his authority.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is considering the legality of “reciprocal” tariffs that Trump imposed on a broad range of U.S. trading partners in April, as well as tariffs imposed in February against China, Canada and Mexico. 

In hearing arguments in two cases brought by five small U.S. businesses and 12 Democratic-led U.S. states, judges pressed government lawyer Brett Shumate to explain how the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law historically used for sanctioning enemies or freezing their assets, gave Trump the power to impose tariffs.

Shumate said that the law allows the president to have “extraordinary” authority in an emergency, including the ability to stop imports completely. He said IEEPA authorizes tariffs because it allows a president to “regulate” imports in a crisis.

The judges seemed dubious of this sweeping argument.

Trump says U.S.-Canada trade deal may be difficult after plan to back Palestine statehood

As Trump's latest tariff deadline nears, here are the trade deals the U.S. has announced so far

“IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them,” Judge Jimmie Reyna said. The arguments – one day before Trump plans to increase tariff rates on imported goods from nearly all U.S. trading partners – mark the first test before a U.S. appeals court of the scope of his tariff authority. 

The president has made tariffs a central instrument of his foreign policy, wielding them aggressively in his second term as leverage in trade negotiations and to push back against what he has called unfair practices. The court adjourned after about an hour-and-a-half of oral arguments. 

The judges did not say when they would rule, and the losing side will almost certainly appeal quickly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump, the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, has said the April tariffs were a response to persistent U.S. trade imbalances and declining U.S. manufacturing power.

He said the tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were appropriate because those countries were not doing enough to stop illegal fentanyl from crossing U.S. borders, a claim the countries have denied.

The states and businesses challenging the tariffs argued that they are not permissible under IEEPA and that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, and not the president, authority over tariffs and other taxes.

“No trade law in 200 years has been interpreted to give the president this power,” Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the businesses, said.

Judge Kimberly Moore challenged Benjamin Gutman, representing the state of Oregon, on his argument that the U.S. trade deficit is not an “unusual and extraordinary” threat that would trigger IEEPA's emergency powers, noting that Trump said the trade deficit contributed to compromised military readiness.

“That bothers me – I'm a little concerned about compromised military readiness,” Moore said. “How about you?”

The case is being heard by a panel of all of the court's active judges, eight appointed by Democratic presidents and three appointed by former Republican presidents.

Tariffs are starting to build into a significant revenue source for the federal government, with customs duties in June quadrupling to about $27 billion, a record, and through June have topped $100 billion for the current fiscal year. 

That income could be crucial to offset lost revenue from Trump's tax bill passed into law earlier this month. But economists say the duties threaten to raise prices for U.S. consumers and reduce corporate profits. Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats have roiled financial markets and disrupted U.S. companies' ability to manage supply chains, production, staffing and prices.

On May 28, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade said IEEPA did not authorize tariffs related to longstanding trade deficits. The Federal Circuit has allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the litigation continues. The case will have no impact on tariffs levied under more traditional legal authority, such as duties on steel and aluminum imports. 

Trump's Department of Justice has argued that limiting the president's tariff authority could undermine ongoing trade negotiations, while other Trump officials have said that negotiations have continued with little change after the initial setback in court.

The president recently announced trade deals that set tariff rates on goods from the European Union and Japan, following smaller trade agreements with Britain, Indonesia and Vietnam. Trump has set an August 1 date for higher tariffs on countries that don't negotiate new trade deals.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Thursday that Trump would pause new tariffs set to go into effect on the U.S.'s southern neighbour and a 90-day period to work on a trade deal.

Employees work on the production line at a factory of Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio in Anhui province, China. Canada wants China to lift tariffs on Canadian agricultural and seafood products, which were imposed last fall in response to Canada's 100-per-cent tariff on imported Chinese EVs.Florence Lo/Reuters

Charles Burton is a former diplomat at Canada's embassy in Beijing, a senior fellow at the think tank Sinopsis.cz and member of Doublethink Lab's China in World Global Index Committee.  

There are increasing signs that Mark Carney's cabinet, which is anxiously trying to mend our crumbling alliance with the United States, is quietly pursuing a major policy shift in Canada's relations with China.

Foreign Minister Anita Anand reinforced the notion after meeting with her Asian counterparts in Malaysia in early July. “It is important for us to revisit our policy – not only in the Indo-Pacific but generally speaking – to ensure that we are focusing not only on the values that we have historically adhered to,” she said.

“Foreign policy is an extension of domestic interest and particularly domestic economic interests,” she added. “This is a time when the global economy is under stress.” 

The Asian century is here, but Canada isn't ready

In the 35 years since Chinese tanks crushed the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations – killing some 4,000 citizens in Beijing alone, mostly young, politically idealistic students – the discussion within Canada has become whether we should forget such history and focus on growing trade with superpower China on its terms, downplaying concerns over its threat to Canada's security, sovereignty and democratic values that support rules-based international order.

As federal officials engage in bare-knuckle tariff talks with U.S. negotiators, Canada obviously needs to restructure its trade and security partnerships to build a buffer from Donald Trump, who is manipulating commercial gravity to pull industries to relocate to the States. One aim is to reduce Canada to the status of a toothless neighbour forced to grant more U.S. access to, say, our fresh water and critical minerals. 

Watching this unfold, China is ramping up specious propaganda that it respects fair trade through the World Trade Organization, supports measures that mitigate climate change, and provides loans and aid to developing countries through its Belt and Road program and its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The message is clear: China is a better and more ethical partner for Canada than Trumpian America.

Let's free ourselves of the U.S. and forge closer ties with China

In June, Mr. Carney and Chinese Premier Li Qiang agreed to “regularize” communications between the countries and revive the moribund Canada-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission, which was created when Stephen Harper was Canada's prime minister. 

Canada wants China to lift its punishing tariffs on Canadian agricultural and seafood products, which were imposed last fall in response to Canada's 100-per-cent tariff on imported Chinese EVs. If it becomes obvious that Mr. Trump's abrogation of the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact is inevitable, Ottawa may decide to let China's state-subsidized, inexpensive spy machines on wheels flood our market and devastate Canada's auto industry.

China and the U.S. appear to be equally treacherous options for Canada, and for many countries. 

When Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met recently in Beijing with Xi Jinping, the Chinese Leader made the standard comment that Western nations dealing with China should “seek common ground while setting aside differences.” Mr. Albanese actually concurred, saying, “That approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.”

Canada has an opportunity to reset our relationship with China – and, in a rare twist, on our terms

Unfortunately the “differences” that Mr. Xi talks about result in harms to Canada, not China. For Ottawa, the price of enhanced trade would be dear: Let China mine critical minerals in Canada's North, give open access to Canadian high tech and dual-use military technologies, abandon implementing a foreign influence transparency registry, accept China's incursions in the Canadian Arctic, and cease Canada's modest freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. And those are just for starters.

The Trump administration likewise has a deep agenda and savours capitulation. Mr. Trump wants Canada to beg to become the 51st state, extending U.S. territory all the way to Greenland. Is it even possible to negotiate an economic and defence deal with Washington, salvaging some semblance of benefit to Canada, while paying no mind to Mr. Trump's threats to devastate Canada's economy? 

Caught in a bind between superpowers, it will not likely be long before Mr. Carney follows Mr. Albanese to Beijing. He has been to China and met Mr. Xi before. But getting in bed with the Communist Party of China could make a bad situation for Canada irreversibly worse.

American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up the day after Sweeney, known for her roles in Euphoria and White Lotus, was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator.Scott A Garfitt/The Canadian Press

U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters AEO-N wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons,” the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.

It has. The question now is whether some of the public reaction the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.

Titled “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans,” the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to “woke” American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word “genes” instead of “jeans” when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.”

Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.

Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the criticism for the American Eagle ad could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the “genes” pun.

“You can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,” Collins said. “Either one of the three aren't good.”

Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.

“I love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her ‘good genes,'” former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.

American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.

The discussion continued after eagle-eyed social media users noticed that Dunkin's promotion for its new summer drink features “The Summer I Turned Pretty” co-star Gavin Casalengo attributing his suntan to genetics.

A snapshot of American Eagle

The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.

A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.

Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.

Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, “You want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.” Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.

“It's the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,” Adamson said.

Billboards, Instagram and Snapchat

Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that “Sydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,” and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.

The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.

American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a non-profit crisis counselling service.

In a news release, the company noted “Sweeney's girl next door charm and main character energy – paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously – is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.”

Jeans, genes and their many meanings

In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great genes.” She crosses out “genes” and replaces it with “jeans.”

But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.”

The video appeared on American Eagle's Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the ad campaign.

While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler's plan for an Aryan master race.

Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the “great replacement theory,” a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.

Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's “genes” versus “jeans” because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.

“American Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,” Shankar said.

As for Dunkin's social media video, Casalengo's burnished skin comes up in the context of the doughnut chain's Golden Hour Refresher drink. “This tan? Genetics. I just got my colour analysis back and guess what? Golden summer,” the actor says, referring to the revived trend of wearing clothing that align with one's natural colouring.

A Dunkin' spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.

A cultural shift in advertising

Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.

Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.

The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.

Some marketers say they've observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies.

Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.

“I can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,” Burrell said.

American Eagle's past and future

American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.

Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding “good jeans” will be good for business.

“They were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,” Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. “But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.”

Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.

“If you try to follow all the rules, you'll make lots of people happy, but you'll fail,” Adamson said. “The rocket won't take off. ”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied starvation is happening in Gaza. But aid groups, doctors and UN data point to a deepening hunger crisis.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denies that Gazan are starving. ""There is no starvation in Gaza, no policy of starvation in Gaza,"" Netanyahu saidon Sunday, during an event with Daystar, an evangelical TV network, held in Jerusalem. 

His remarks stand in stark contrast to mounting evidence from aid agencies, humanitarian organizations, and eyewitnesses who describe an escalating food crisis, particularly in the north of the enclave.

A DW Fact check takes a closer look.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global hunger monitoring body, has warnedthat famine thresholds have been surpassed in parts of Gaza — particularly in Gaza City — calling the crisis a ""worst-case scenario"" now unfolding.

According to the World Health Organization, 63 of the 74 malnutrition-related deaths recorded in Gaza this year occurred in July alone — including 24 children under the age of five and 38 adults.

Meanwhile, aid workers on the ground reportthat they themselves are going hungry and Gaza's Health Ministry says dozens of people have died from starvation-related causes over the past three weeks. 

With international pressure rising, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he would officially recognize a State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly in September unless Israel takes ""substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza.""

Israeli officials, however, including Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oren Marmorstein, have rejectedthe malnutrition and starvation figures released by Gaza's health authorities and UN bodies, calling them exaggerated and unreliable.

They argue that the numbers, some provided by Hamas,a group designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the EU, and others, lack credibility. However, a new independent study says they are actually too low.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not alone in denying that Gaza is facing starvation. His comments have been echoed across social media by numerous online personalities and accounts that either downplay the severity of the crisis or claim reports of widespread hunger are fabricated. 

Israel imposed a complete blockade of food, fuel and other supplies in March and numerous politicians — including Netanyahu — have repeatedly said that no food would enter Gaza. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in August 2024 that ""it might be justified and moral"" to let Israel ""cause 2 million civilians to die of hunger"" until the ""hostages are returned.""

""This is the official line repeated by the Prime Minister, his cabinet, and the far-right media,"" Oren Persico of the Israeli independent outlet The Seventh Eye told DW. ""They either deny that starvation is happening, blame Hamas for not surrendering, or even claim it's a good thing—because it supposedly helps pave the way for building Jewish settlements in Gaza.""

Several accounts challenge widely shared photos of severely emaciated children in Gaza, claiming they're misleading or lack context. One image — of Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq — featured in reports by several international news outletshas also circulated widely on social media alongside posts condemning the humanitarian crisis.

Pro-Israel commentators, along with Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, later claimed the boy had a rare genetic muscular disorder and alleged that omitting this detail was an attempt to defame Israel.

While some posts and reports did lack that context, outlets like CNNacknowledged his condition and noted that he had been living a healthier life before the war, thanks to therapy and adequate nutrition, writing: ""He has a muscle disorder that requires physical therapy and specialized nutrition, and he faces life-threatening malnutrition as the humanitarian situation worsens due to ongoing Israeli attacks and the blockade.""

The New York Times also confirmedhe suffered from malnutrition in addition to a pre-existing illness.

Still, a large number of accounts continued to circulate the claim that such photos were being misused to falsely suggest starvation—something they insist does not exist.

One widely shared post (see screenshot below) reads:  ""A boy from Gaza with a rare muscular disease is being exploited to promote the fake campaign of starvation in Gaza."" DW Fact check identified dozens of nearly identical posts circulating the same image and text.

Our team showed the picture shared by these posts to several pediatricians in Germany to verify the claims about the child's muscular disorder. They noted that the exact condition cannot be diagnosed from photos and videos alone.

However, they emphasized that a pre-existing medical condition does not rule out malnutrition, and attributing all signs of emaciation solely to genetic disorders overlooks the broader impact of prolonged nutritional deficiency.

For Oren Persico from The Seventh Eye the accusations from the Israeli government are part of a political strategy. ""One tactic being used is to highlight non-representative examples and present them as proof that human suffering in Gaza isn't happening,"" he explained.

""It's like conspiracy theories who fix on irrelevant details to distort the overall picture. In that sense, I would call it a disinformation campaign — one that cherry-picks fringe facts to deny the overwhelming body of evidence, including eyewitness accounts, data, and reports.""

A similar narrative surfaced around a piece of video published by outlets including the Jerusalem Post which shows a close-up of a vegetable stall in a Gaza market. The footage quickly spread across social media, where it was used by accounts seeking to challenge reports of famine in the territory.

""…This is footage from today at Al-Sahaba market in Gaza City, completely packed with food. So much for starvation. The average Gazan eats better than you!"", writes one account.

DW Fact check spoke with Majdi Fathi, the journalist accredited for the video. He confirmed that the footage is authentic and shows a market inside Gaza, but added that it does not mean food is available for all.

""These vegetables and fruits are very expensive,"" Fathi said. ""The majority of people in Gaza cannot afford them. What Gaza lacks are other food items such as meat, milk, rice and eggs. I did not find anything else to film in the market.""


Other media reports support his view. A BBC investigation found that food packages delivered by local aid groups in Gaza often lack the nutritional variety needed for a healthy diet, leading to deficiencies and long-term health issues even when quantities are adequate.

""Until now, meat, eggs, milk, and other essentials have not entered,"" Fathi said. ""The problem is also the high prices. Since the beginning of the war, many families haven't been able to work and have no income to buy food.""

On his Instagram account, he shared another video showing Gazansat the market complaining about the soaring cost of basic goods.

Israel's recent move to allow more aid deliveries has slightly eased prices in some areas, but the impact remains limited. While the aid is meant for free distribution, some supplies are being stored, diverted, or resold.

With no clear oversight by aid groups, local authorities, or Israeli forces, the extent of diversion is unclear. 

Israeli officials have repeatedly claimed that Hamas is responsible for stealing this aid. However, The New York Times reports that Israeli military officials have confirmed there is no evidence that Hamas systematically looted UN humanitarian aid, including from UN convoys—it instead alleges sporadic theft from smaller actors, not organized diversion by Hamas. 

Between 120 and 200 aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, according to UN estimates, with an additional 260 trucks reportedly awaiting clearance as of Monday. But aid officials have described those efforts as inadequate and, in some cases, dangerous for civilians on the ground to collect them.

The Lithuanian premier Gintautas Paluckas has stepped down following public protests and mounting scrutiny over his business ties, just months after taking office in a coalition government. 

Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas resigned on Thursday amid growing pressure over investigations into his business dealings, which sparked public protests in the capital demanding he step down.

Paluckas, a member of the Social Democratic Party, took office late last year after helping to form a three-party coalition government following October's parliamentary elections. President Gitanas Nauseda announced Paluckas's resignation to the media on Thursday morning, with Paluckas later explaining his reasons.

""I informed the president about an hour ago that I took the decision to resign from my duties as the prime minister,"" Paluckas said in a statement, adding that he would also leave his post as the head of the Social Democratic party. 

""Despite my decision to leave my current duties, I will continue to defend my honor and dignity and I'm waiting for the conclusions of the investigations, which I'm sure will separate the facts from insinuations,"" he said.

Several news outlets published reports in July detailing alleged misconduct linked to both past and current ventures by Paluckas. The revelations prompted anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies to launch formal investigations.

In a major blow to his credibility, it emerged that Paluckas never paid a large part of a €16,500 ($19,039) fine tied to a case known as the ""rat poison scandal.""

He was convicted in 2012 of abusing his position while overseeing Vilnius' rat extermination contract bids. Lithuania's top court found that he had illegally favored the highest bidder. Although sentenced to two years in prison, the term was suspended and he was never jailed.

Paluckas, leader of the Social Democratic Party, has denied wrongdoing in his business affairs and called the scrutiny a ""coordinated attack"" by political rivals.

He resigned before opposition lawmakers could initiate impeachment proceedings.

Earlier on Thursday, Lithuania's Financial Crimes Investigation Service searched the offices of Dankora, a company owned by Paluckas' sister-in-law, local media reported.

Dankora allegedly used EU funds to buy battery systems from Garnis, a company partly owned by Paluckas himself.

The search follows earlier reporting from Lithuanian investigative journalists, who revealed in May that Garnis had also received a subsidized state loan while Paluckas was already serving as prime minister.

Lithuania's entire Cabinet is now expected to step down following Paluckas's resignation, raising concerns of a leadership gap just weeks before Russia begins joint military exercises with Belarus.

Coalition talks to form a new Cabinet are expected to begin shortly.

Despite the shakeup, the country's foreign policy is not expected to shift. President Nauseda, elected independently, remains Lithuania's key voice on the global stage and has been one of Ukraine's strongest backers in its war against Russia.

Qatar is due to supply 2 million tons of liquefied natural gas to Germany from next year. The deal is now under threat from an EU directive on rights and the climate that critics say is too costly and bureaucratic.

In November 2022, as Europe grappled with an escalating energy crisis, Germany sealed a deal with Qatar to import up to 2 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually from the Gulf state.

The agreement, due to start in 2026, was part of Europe's broader strategy to reduce reliance on Russian gas following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Nearly three years later, Qatar has threatened to halt LNG deliveries to Europe in a row over a European Union directive aimed at improving ethical standards in global trade.

German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported last weekend (July 26/27) that Qatari authorities have written to several EU governments urging the EU to revise the directive. 

The letters warned that, without substantial changes, Qatar may redirect LNG exports to markets offering a ""more stable and business-friendly environment.""

The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), adopted last year, orders large European firms to scrutinize their global supply chains — from raw materials to finished products — to spot and fix issues like human rights abuses or environmental harm. 

The directive also mandates that companies develop climate transition plans aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement.

While the CSDDD has been praised by human rights and environmental advocates, it has drawn criticism from industry groups and non-EU suppliers for its high compliance costs, administrative burden and international legal scope.

Qatar has complained that the directive's climate protection rules ""go beyond the objectives and intentions"" of the Paris Agreement, adding that ""high fines, penalties, and civil liability for noncompliance"" pose a risk for state-owned QatarEnergy, the world's largest LNG producer.

The CSDDD conflicts with Qatar's national energy strategy. The Gulf country's economy is deeply tied to LNG, which it sees as a ""green"" transition fuel rather than a climate liability.

Qatar has said it wants to make gradual, measurable progress toward carbon-neutrality, without undermining its energy exports. 

""Qatar and some other oil producers and exporters have not yet put net-zero pathways in place,"" Andreas Goldthau, a public policy professor at the University of Erfurt in Germany, told DW. Goldthau said this puts them at risk of EU penalties for failure to comply with the CSDDD.

Under the directive, firms could face fines of up to 5% of global annual turnover if they don't carry out due diligence checks. For QatarEnergy, which reported $48.6 billion (€42.2 billion) in revenue for 2024, that could translate to a $2.43 billion penalty.

Qatar has supplied 12-14% of Europe's LNG needs since Russia's war began in Ukraine in early 2022, according to data provider Kpler, sending a total of 37.1 million metric tons of the gas to the bloc. The 2022 deal with Germany is expected to further boost Europe's supply.



Analysts warn that any disruption to these volumes, especially during peak winter demand, could tighten supply and trigger a renewed surge in energy prices.

Thierry Bros, a professor at Sciences Po University in Paris, told DW that it was ""unsurprising"" that Qatar was now threatening supplies as ""no company"" wants to be exposed to an ""overly complex and burdensome piece of legislation.""

""Instead of entering protracted negotiations, Qatar has chosen a more assertive approach — acting early and decisively to position itself for a full exemption from the directive,"" he said.

EU states were initially expected to turn the CSDDD into national legislation by next year, initially targeting firms with more than 5,000 employees and annual turnovers of over €1.5 billion. By 2029, smaller firms with head counts of 1,000 or more will be required to comply. 

But faced with growing pushback from the likes of Germany, France and Italy, as well as the finance and energy sectors, the EU has now proposed a two-year delay, until June 2028.

""The EU already relaxed some of those requirements, pushing some back into the second half of the decade,"" said Goldthau.

A key legal question now looms: Can Brussels legitimately impose steep fines on non-EU firms like QatarEnergy? Experts believe practical challenges and trade implications may complicate any enforcement action. If not, the financial burden may shift to its European partners.

""Importers with legal entities within Europe could be asked to withhold payments to QatarEnergy as fines by proxy,"" Goldthau speculated.

Qatar's move may be strategically sound, but its timing has raised eyebrows. Some analysts believe Qatar is leveraging the recent US-EU trade tensions to push for an exemption.

But on July 27, Brussels agreed $750 billion (€650 billion) worth of US LNG purchases as part of the tariff deal with US President Donald Trump, dealing a major blow to the country's approach.

""I'm puzzled why Qatar put this forward right now,"" said Goldthau. After all, he added, Trump has just struck a deal that gives Brussels another excuse to ""pivot to the US.""

But Bros sees it differently, believing Qatar's move is well timed to capitalize on Europe's lingering vulnerability from the post-Ukraine energy crisis.

""The LNG market remains tight and will likely stay that way for another three years, giving Qatar significant leverage at precisely the right moment to exert pressure,"" he said.

With global LNG demand projected to rise to over 600 million tons per year by 2030, Qatar's North Field expansion and long-term contracts help position the emirate as a critical energy supplier to Europe.

But if EU regulations become too burdensome, Qatar may accelerate its pivot to Asia, where demand is booming and compliance costs are much lower.

It was an average Tuesday, nearly four in the afternoon, and I was saturated with sweat. Everybody was. All we could do was corral around a stand-up fan and try cooling off. Even the wall-mounted fans didn't help us stop sweating. Shoot, even the exhaust fan, the one that sounds like a giant vacuum and drowns out our phone calls, didn't help. Nothing did.

Someone yelled for us to turn on the news. We switched the day room TV to ABC's local station, and that's when we saw the report: Eight prisons in Virginia are without air conditioners. One of them is Nottoway Correctional Center. That's where we are.

This is a daily occurrence for us in the summer: sweating. The kind of sweating that has you skipping lotion because your skin's already so tacky with perspiration. Shoot, it's the kind where taking a shower doesn't help either, because when you step out, you're sweating again.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

On the hottest days, I don't go outside at all; I have no desire for a close personal kiss from the sun's rays. Nobody wants to eat, let alone cook. Half the men walk around shirtless, back sweat dripping down their spines.

My bunk gets sweaty when I lay in it. The walls sweat, too — you can see it. My celly and I barely speak as we stew in the cell. When we're locked down for institutional count, we're in an oven. It's too hot.

And there's no relief. After a few days, the fans start blowing dust. The ice machine works overtime. We drink bottles of water to quench our thirst as we sit in front of those dusty fans.

We're all just trying to stay cool.

After seeing the news on the facilities without air conditioners, I approached my friend who knew the law. I asked what we could do to bring attention to our plight. He suggested a class-action lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Corrections. That had me interested, but then I peered around me: young men were acting out, laughing as if oblivious to what we were dealing with. I sighed and thanked him for the advice as he wiped sweat from his face with a washcloth.

I sat with another friend who was in prison for a second time, discussing the mindsets of our comrades. He started going into a monologue about his celly stinking up the cell with his multiple uses of their toilet. I tuned him out. I closed my eyes, licked my parched lips, and dreamt of an unexpected blizzard.

My skin was sticky. Sweat trickled down my face as I rose to my feet and headed for the water fountain. I drank the cold water, quenching my thirst . . . but was still hot. I sighed.

It was June 23. The next day, the temperature was predicted to reach 108 degrees. One hundred and eight degrees. In prison, that meant all of us in this facility would be sweating as we struggled through the heat. The mindset would be down in the dumps as we stewed in a congested day room. One hundred and eight degrees.

There are men, too, who don't own a fan. There are older men who aren't vocal enough to ask the young men to scoop some ice for them. I always tell them to sit down and let me get them ice for their cups. This heat makes everybody aggressive, unable to think about anybody but themselves as they do whatever they can to cool off. I understand, so I place myself in harm's way for older men who could be my father. They thank me when I hand them their cups of ice, then they stagger back into their cells, sweating.

We go to sleep in sweat and wake up in sweat twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, with no respite until the summertime heat departs for the fall season.

Help us. Please. This is cruel and unusual punishment. PETA would remove a dog from an owner who left it chained outside in this heat. What about us? Aren't we more than dogs?

A new report finds that local jails are feeding thousands of people to Trump's deportation machine.

Local jails play an integral role in the Trump administration's efforts to abduct, detain and deport millions of immigrants, according to a new report from the research and advocacy group Prison Policy Initiative (PPI).

PPI says that from January 20 to June 26, almost half of all ICE arrests involved people who were detained at a local jail, typically accused of minor offenses, such as driving without a license. 

“Jails and police departments play a key role in criminalizing immigration by detaining people until ICE agents can make an arrest,” the group says.

The level of cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents greatly varies. Some states or cities prohibit law enforcement from sharing information or coordinating with ICE. However, hundreds of law enforcement agencies are part of the federal 287(g) program which deputizes state and local officers to act as immigration agents. The number of participating agencies has skyrocketed under Trump. As of June 30, 875 law enforcement agencies had joined the program, up from 135 in December of 2024. 

In addition to feeding people into the deportation system, local jails also lease beds to ICE, the U.S. Marshals Service, or both. PPI found that in 25 states, the only bed space available to ICE or the U.S. Marshals Service is in local jails. While sanctuary city policies generally bar cooperation with ICE, they often permit contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service, which, under Trump, plays a critical role in detaining thousands of immigrants. The U.S. Marshals Service has contracts with almost 1,000 jails, according to PPI. 

From January through June, federal prosecutors charged thousands of people with criminal immigration offenses. This led to the pretrial detention of almost 20,000 people.  

“ICE and other federal agencies can refer people for federal prosecution on immigration-related ‘crimes' and thus use contracted local jails in sanctuary cities, counties, and states,” the report says. “In doing so, the Trump administration is transforming what are normally civil immigration matters into more serious federal crimes. This shift hides the true scale of immigrant detention from public view, which is often reported as only those in ICE custody and does not include those facing criminal prosecution.”

According to PPI, people detained pretrial on criminal immigration charges, as well as those held on ICE detainers or in overnight hold rooms, are not included in ICE detention data, which recorded about 57,000 people held on average in June. However, PPI estimates that more than 80,000 people are detained in the “crimmigration system.” 

The group urges local governments to protect community members by refusing to contract with all federal agencies, not just ICE.

“Via their jails, local governments are — intentionally or not — providing the infrastructure for a massive attack on immigrants,” PPI said in a press release announcing the report. “But by resisting cooperation with President Trump's racist deportation machine, counties and states also have the power to contain it.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

The Department of Agriculture under President Donald Trump has charted a new course — the full-scale reduction of federal funding and staffing throughout the agency. A set of the president's early executive orders targeted climate action, environmental justice, and diversity, equity, and inclusion; the USDA has since complied with those by eliminating DEI-focused programs and grants and revoking a longstanding provision that ensured producers confronting historical discrimination have equitable access to federal support. 

So, on June 17, when the USDA announced the end of $148.6 million in funding awarded by prior administrations to projects geared toward DEI, the move appeared in lockstep with the president's priorities. The notice itself, for example, was titled “Secretary Rollins Takes Bold Action to Put American Farmers First, Cuts Millions in Woke DEI Funding.” 

The press release said that “more than 145” awards would be cancelled, and it gave three anonymized examples of such projects. There was a $575,251 project “educating and engaging socially disadvantaged farmers on conservation practices”; a $192,246 project for “creating a new model for urban forestry to lead to environmental justice through more equitably distributed green spaces”; and a $2.5 million award for a project “expanding equitable access to land, capital, and market opportunities for underserved producers in the Bay Area.” 

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

It all seemed like standard fare under the new administration — except that the USDA neither specified what awards it was scrubbing, nor did it follow the news with direct notifications to those affected. 

More than a month later, no one yet seems to know whether, or to what extent, the $148 million in grants has actually been cancelled. The scraps of information provided in the release have since been mined many times over by everyone from grantees to lawmakers. This fiscal year, the USDA had a total budget of $493.9 billion, of which $144.4 billion funded award obligations. That means the $148 million represents roughly 0.001 percent of what the agency planned to spend on awards. And yet, experts say, the missing money mystery indicates a new chapter in the USDA's playbook — and it's harming farmers and ranchers, and those that support them, across the country. 

“I just continue to think that they are motivated by the politics of saying that they cancelled a DEI-related program, and they're not motivated by conducting thoughtful policy changes or updates, and they don't seem to really be concerned about who's on the other end of that policy change, and what the impact would be,” said Michael Amato, who was the USDA Communications Director during the Biden administration.

For those organizations that suspect their projects could be on the chopping block, the move is perplexing. When the team at the California-based organization Agroecology Commons saw the USDA press release, they presumed that the $2.5 million grant had to be theirs. Roughly two years beforehand, they had been awarded that very same amount through the USDA's Increasing Land, Capital, and Market Access Program to identify, purchase, and help develop land for up to ten “BIPOC, LGBTQIA, and landless farmers” in the Bay Area. 

The nonprofit had already come to feel targeted under the new administration. They had confronted the elimination of another USDA award back in March. In June, less than two weeks before the $148 million cancellation news was shared, the organization joined two other plaintiffs in filing a lawsuit against the USDA for what they believe were unlawful grant terminations. And, according to director of partnerships Leah Atwood, they were “put on blast on the Secretary of Ag's Instagram,” when Brooke Rollins announced the end of the group's Community Food Projects grant in a social media video.

“All signs pointed to ‘that's gonna be us,'” said Atwood. The revelation was nonetheless “a big blow” to her team. In response to the USDA's announcement, they started to halt the work they were doing that was supported by the federal funds, in case they wouldn't be able to invoice for reimbursements later. As the days and weeks passed, the team got more and more bewildered when no official termination notice hit their inbox. 

Until last Tuesday, when a cancellation notice finally dropped — just not the one that they were expecting. 

On July 22, more than a month following the agency's initial termination announcement, the team finally received an email from the USDA, shared with Grist, which informed them of the end of their Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program grant, or BFRDP, amounting to nearly $600,000 that they were awarded back in 2021. First authorized by the farm bill more than two decades ago, the program provides grants to organizations in support of education, mentoring, and technical assistance for new agricultural producers. The letter stated that “the Secretary of Agriculture has determined, per the Department's obligations to the Constitution and laws of the United States, that priority includes ensuring that the Department's awards do not support programs that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives, or any other initiatives that discriminate on the basis of immutable characteristics.” 

Though she isn't sure, Atwood believes that Agroecology Commons' BFRDP grant cancellation must be one of the 145 or so that the USDA says it has identified for elimination. She also believes that the notice for the bigger grant is still on the horizon, and has expressed concern over two other USDA grants of theirs that have an explicit DEI-focus. As of the time of this article's publication, the Agroecology Commons team still has not received an official cancellation notice for the $2.5 million from the federal agency. 

“We've been in this constant state of evaluation and reevaluation and downsizing and streamlining and consolidating, and it's impossible to do that in a clear, straightforward way when we don't know what's happening,” she said. “It's just a juggling act of, like, plugging leaks and dodging waves.” 

The USDA has not responded to multiple inquiries from Grist sent over the last month requesting clarity on the full list of awards included in last month's press release, why those affected had not been issued official notices, and the criteria being used in these funding eliminations. What's more, it isn't clear whether the recent rescission of BFRDP grants account for any part of the $148 million, or belong to an entirely new crop of cancellations. 

Grist reporting has revealed that at least three other recipients of BFRDP grants were also issued official USDA termination notices in the last week. They are the only series of DEI-adjacent grants from the USDA that have been confirmed as cancelled since the agency's June announcement. Like Atwood, those other grantees believe the dissolution of their federal support falls within the 145 or so awards that the USDA declared. One such group is the Rhode Island Food Policy Council.

The end of the BFRDP grant didn't come as much of a surprise to its executive director Nessa Richman. In fact, when she saw the USDA's announcement about the $148 million funding pot, Richman had a “sinking feeling” that her group's grant was over. Right before the USDA made the announcement, Richman noticed that their BFRDP money was suddenly unfrozen — an experience that the Food Policy Council went through when the Trump administration pulled another of their grants — before it was terminated.

When it finally arrived, the USDA's letter singled out the Food Policy Council's focus on DEI as the rationale for the cancellation. “Specifically, the project is targeted at beginning farmers and ranchers from Rhode Island communities defined by their immutable characteristics,” the letter said. “The award is therefore inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.” 

But what surprised Richman was the way the USDA presented the news. “Normally, in a USDA announcement like that, when it's about grant awards, in the past there's been a link to a list of all of the grantees,” said Richman. “And it was confusing that there wasn't one.” So she called around to see if anyone in her network had been able to find a list buried on a federal website somewhere. No one had. No one knew what programs were on that list of “more than 145.”

“My guess was that the work had been done internally at USDA to identify the grants, because it was a very specific number, but that they hadn't done the administrative work to move forward and send out notices of termination,” said Richman. “At this point, it probably took them longer than they thought to get all of the administrative pieces in place. Why else would it take them longer?” 

A Grist analysis of a USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture reporting portal shows that since 2009, roughly 13 percent of all BFRDP awards have been DEI-related, and just 21 are active projects. If the USDA terminates all of the BFRDP awards with equity-associated keywords, that leaves at least 124 other grants facing potentially imminent elimination following the agency's effort to cut “Woke DEI Funding.” 

Vanessa García Polanco, government relations director at National Young Farmers Coalition, is worried about the future of the other equity-related awards. “So how are they picking and choosing these grants? Is it just the ones that have equity in the title? Do they have some equity outcomes? Or is it just literally strategic? Is there an equation, an algorithm behind it? We really don't know,” said García Polanco. “Everything feels extremely haphazard and inconsistent.”  

The federal agency's silence has prompted urgent calls for transparency from some members of Congress. Last Tuesday, on the same day that BFRDP letters began landing in inboxes, a cohort of nine Democratic senators sent an official congressional oversight letter to Rollins, urging her to provide the missing information, including “a complete list of awards that USDA intends to terminate, including information about awardees, programs, funding amounts, and locations.” The letter also asked for further details “on why these awards intend to be cancelled, as well as the legal basis for cancelling the awards, and if the funds are being repurposed, for what they will be repurposed.” 

“It's created more uncertainty, in a sea of uncertainty,” said Mike Lavender, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. “I don't know how it wouldn't have a chilling effect.” 

According to a former senior USDA official, who spoke to Grist on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the precedents of how the agency chooses to operate — and communicate — are changing so quickly and radically that it's creating an environment of fear for the nation's farmers and ranchers who could rely on federal government funds before Trump took office.

“People are just scared right now because they keep hearing the threat of these things, and they haven't been notified. So ‘Do I continue to do work? Do I not continue to do work?' The uncertainty is what's getting people right now,” the official said. “You hear that from these grantees, as well as [USDA] employees, it's hard to get people to talk about it, because they don't know, from day to day, whether they're going to be targeted. 

If they say anything, I think most folks are going on record anonymously because they're in fear, because you really don't know what's next. And if you get out there on a limb, it might get sawed off behind you.”

On July 4, U.S. President Donald Trump signed his party's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, among other things, slashed around $500 billion from the clean energy tax credits at the heart of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Along with the Environmental Protection Agency's recent decision to unwind Obama-era climate regulations, the bill's cuts to IRA subsidies further confirmed that the Trump administration has no interest in reining in emissions. In addition to reducing emissions, the IRA helped drive more than $800 billion in committed and pending private investments in clean energy and manufacturing. Public opinion supported the subsidies, and many Republican districts—where 80 percent of the money went—benefited from them. But this was not enough to protect the measures from the hacksaw the Trump administration has taken to the green transition.

Despite this dramatic loss, however, the strategy behind the IRA's climate provisions remains sound. The law emerged from the largest climate coalition the United States has ever witnessed. Environmental groups, scientists, progressives, and green industries have long supported climate-friendly policies, of course. But the IRA brought large new industrial players to the table, including automakers, utilities, and even some energy-intensive manufacturers. These firms joined traditional climate policy advocates to urge policymakers to provide public funds for decarbonization. These industries, notably, were those that have the potential to decarbonize—they might be “brown” today, but with the right investments, they could be green in a decade or two.

Winning the support of these “decarbonizable” industries made the IRA and similar policies in other wealthy countries possible. Even as the United States rolled back some of those gains, industrial lobbying helped block new taxes on renewables and electric vehicles and preserve a meaningful share of the act's green subsidies, including those for investments in geothermal and nuclear power plants, batteries used to store electricity, and clean manufacturing. Still, the United States is an outlier. No other country that has ramped up clean energy spending, such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, and United Kingdom, has slashed that spending in any comparable way, even as domestic political support for climate policies dims. They all recognize the value of green subsidies to help domestic firms compete with leading Chinese ones and capture rapidly growing green markets, and to enable companies and households to comply with net-zero targets.

Global clean energy investment reached $8 trillion between 2019 and 2024, more than double the total from the preceding two decades. Clean energy subsidies such as those in the IRA are key to this increase, pushing companies to pursue economic opportunities in fast-growing green markets rather than cling to the fossil fuel–based business models of the past. The partial repeal of these measures in the United States was a setback. Policymakers in Washington and elsewhere can now learn from it and do better next time, by designing policies to be more resilient and by drawing more industrial players into a broadening climate coalition. A decade ago, simply avoiding civilization-threatening climate change seemed like an unattainable goal; many projections expected global warming near four degrees Celsius by 2100. The most ambitious emission targets remain unachievable, and climate change is already wreaking ecological and humanitarian havoc. But today, with a proven strategy to bring some major industries onside, a plausible path to decarbonization is finally beginning to emerge.

The core obstacle to climate action has never been public attitudes, long-term economic concerns, or a failure of diplomacy. Even when their constituents favor climate action, politicians consistently struggle to deliver meaningful climate policy. Economists have long argued that preventing climate change has aggregate welfare benefits that outweigh the costs. And countries have solved other global environmental problems, such as the ozone hole and acid rain, through international agreements.

The stumbling block has been that decarbonization will create winners and losers—and the losers of the future hold substantial power in countries across the world. Even if the overall economy will benefit from effective climate policy, and green industries in particular will thrive, many firms and industries that depend on fossil fuels for profits will face steep costs and risks. The latter group has been highly effective at blocking change.



In the late 1980s, carbon-intensive industries, from automaking to coal mining to energy-intensive manufacturing, began working together to oppose international climate treaties through a lobbying group brazenly named the Global Climate Coalition. What followed was a decades-long effort to cast doubt on climate science and lobby against measures aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Advocates of climate policy stood little chance against this fossil fuel coalition. Carbon-intensive industries used their deep ties to trade associations, unions, political parties, and regulators to block federal climate legislation in the United States and water down policy efforts across Europe. These industries all feared that commitments to reduce emissions would incur massive costs, threaten jobs, and render meaningless their hard‑fought leads in fossil fuel technologies. Protecting their advantages meant preventing meaningful progress in addressing climate change.

But this strategic calculus shifted in the late 2010s. Starting a decade earlier, China had invested heavily in supply chains for electric vehicle batteries and wind and solar power, betting on a long-term trend of decarbonization. The bet paid off. Chinese investments significantly lowered the costs of clean energy technologies, which made global decarbonization more feasible and gave Chinese firms a first-mover advantage, putting companies such as the electric vehicle maker BYD and the battery manufacturer CATL in a position to dominate a future net-zero global economy. By the end of the 2010s, China had established a technological lead just as organized climate movements were pushing governments to adopt more ambitious emission targets.

This combination of economic and political pressure fractured the longstanding fossil fuel coalition across the wealthy world. Fossil fuel companies continued to resist decarbonization. But industries that could, in principle, decarbonize—including automaking, utilities, and energy-intensive manufacturing—were forced to rethink their strategies. Simply obstructing the green transition would no longer shield them from its costs; they risked declining competitiveness and losses of market share to first movers, many of them Chinese firms, as global demand for low-carbon technologies and goods rose. This created an opening for policymakers. They offered these industries a bargain: invest in clean technologies and adopt green practices in exchange for massive government support that would help them catch up with Chinese companies and comply with tougher emission regulations, higher carbon prices, and new net-zero laws. Many embraced this bargain, fracturing the fossil fuel coalition that for decades had obstructed meaningful climate policies.

It was this recent convergence of interests that produced the IRA's clean energy subsidies. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden adopted an aggressive climate policy, partly in response to the demands of climate activists. But he also made his climate plan a central piece of his strategy to appeal to voters and business interests in manufacturing and industry-heavy Midwestern swing states that Trump won in 2016. He presented his promise to spend $2 trillion on decarbonization as a path to the “revitalization” of Michigan's economy, for instance, and a way for American workers “to dominate the global market” in electric vehicles, sustainable steel production, and wind turbines. When he assumed office, Biden's climate initiatives secured support not only from major environmental groups but also from utility companies, metal manufacturers, and automakers—the broadest coalition behind climate policy in U.S. history.

Yet the final climate spending package in the IRA was less than half of Biden's original $2 trillion promise. The new green industrial coalition was still limited. Large parts corporate interests, including the powerful financial sector, resisted Biden's push to raise taxes to finance green spending, often relying on Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to block such advances. And the fossil fuel sector remained powerful; Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a major coal producing state, resisted key provisions designed to rapidly drive down fossil fuel demand. Passing the law showed that the scales were finally tilting toward climate action, but it was a narrow victory.



Trump's fervor for fossil fuels tipped the balance back, encouraging congressional opponents of the IRA's clean-energy tax credits in the debate over a new tax-and-spending bill. The climate coalition was not gone, however: moderate Republican senators, such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, and some Republicans from states with substantial clean energy investments, such as Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley of wind-rich Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, an emerging electric vehicle hub, helped block the most extreme proposals, including new taxes on renewable energy and electric vehicles and a total erasure of clean-energy spending. Carmakers and utilities that were already invested in clean energy, batteries, and electric vehicles also protested moves to slash the tax credits that their investments depend on. The new green industrial coalition was ultimately too narrow to defend most of the IRA's clean energy provisions. But the fact that a Republican Congress and White House extended as many clean-energy tax credits as they did is a testament to the inroads it has made.

Policies similar to the clean energy subsidies in the IRA have proliferated recently. Within the past few years, the EU adopted the European Green Deal, the Australian government launched its Powering Australia plan, the Canadian government established the Canada Growth Fund, and the German government committed hundreds of billions of euros to a climate fund. Many of these policy packages have included not just green spending but new emission restrictions and higher carbon prices, too. Together, they represent one of the most significant advancements in global climate policy since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where international participants launched the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and agreed to cooperate on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And as in the United States, the latest raft of clean energy policies adopted in Europe and elsewhere was made possible by industries' joining political coalitions to support them.

This strategy is no panacea. Cuts to U.S. clean-energy tax credits have shown the limits of the new coalition's power. These industries are no saviors of the climate, either. Their primary interest is profit, and they resist environmental policies that are bad for their bottom lines. Designing climate policy around them is therefore likely to produce slower decarbonization than ambitious climate targets require. But without at least the conditional support of these sectors, it is hard to imagine any industrialized nation assembling and maintaining the political force necessary to seriously pursue decarbonization.

In the United States, climate advocates and their industrial allies must now learn the right lessons from the rollback of the IRA. The minority of provisions that remain intact is a significant one. Tax incentives for clean manufacturing across a wide range of industries survived the latest cuts, although tax credits for consumer purchases, such as electric vehicles or rooftop solar panels, did not; those will expire in the coming months. Before the passage of the Republican bill, conservative politicians and news outlets had decried consumer tax credits as a government attempt to shape people's behavior. As has been the case in the last half-century of U.S. industrial policies, measures that were technocratic and hidden in the tax code were more difficult to politicize and remove than highly visible consumer incentives or large public grants to individual companies.

Part of the problem with the IRA tax credits was that the constituency that might have wanted them to continue did not have enough time to grow. Rolling out investments and starting construction of new factories proved slow and cumbersome, so the benefits of the policy were only just becoming visible when Biden left office. There is no easy substitute for winning two elections in a row, but future policymakers should try to reduce the delay between passing legislation and delivering on its economic promises by speeding up permit processes, minimizing bureaucratic requirements, and deploying funds more rapidly. Even a Republican Congress might help lower these barriers if they are part of a larger bureaucratic reform package. The effort would pay off the next time the United States introduced clean energy subsidies: faster implementation would spur rapid capital commitments, turning firms and communities into stakeholders and, as the projects matured, into beneficiaries that would be more motivated to defend the policies.

There is some danger of learning the wrong lessons from the IRA rollback, too. Tax credits for wind and solar electricity were cut while incentives to develop emerging technologies such as geothermal power and advanced nuclear fission remained in place—effectively dismantling policies that would more quickly reduce demand for oil and gas while allowing innovation that poses little immediate threat to fossil fuel interests to continue. The takeaway for future policymakers should not be that funding emerging technologies works but funding mature ones does not. At a minimum, wind and solar power must be on an equal playing field with fossil fuels that have been receiving public subsidies for decades, especially given the contributions of clean energy to improved public health, emission reductions, and more resilient electric grids. As expanding artificial intelligence and data infrastructure drive up demand for electricity, the need to boost wind and solar power becomes even more urgent, as facilities for both can be built quickly. Subsidies for these energy sources are among the most powerful tools policymakers have to reap the economic and environmental benefits of clean energy, and they are worth the political capital required to defend them.

The core political strategy that produced the IRA in the United States and similar green spending around the world still holds enormous potential to advance climate policy. The U.S. rollbacks were a disappointing setback for climate advocates and many industries, and they will lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions and weaken the United States' technological and competitive position in clean energy. But the strategy got many things right, most notably its fracture of the traditional fossil fuel coalition by giving major industrial players incentives to align with decarbonization. That foundational principle will remain essential. Climate policy is not just about environmental obligation: it can and should foster investment, jobs, growth, and long-term competitiveness. Seizing this economic opportunity is the way to build a political coalition that stands a chance to sustain the green transition.

Only a decade ago, the United States was the world's leading drone innovator, flying Predators and Reapers to target and kill terrorists in faraway countries. But as Israel, Russia, and Ukraine have recently demonstrated in dramatic campaigns, another drone revolution has begun. Where once drones were expensive and remote-controlled for targeted strikes and strategic surveillance, now they can be procured for as little as a few hundred dollars and perform a wide array of missions, from scouting the battlefield to delivering blood and medicine to injured troops on the frontlines.

Militaries all over the world are experimenting with this new generation of drones in every aspect of combat. Israel and Ukraine, for example, used first-person-view drones to attack inside enemy territory. Russia's volleys of one-way attack drones, missiles, and guided bombs have targeted Ukrainian power and manufacturing facilities. On the frontlines in Ukraine, both Moscow and Kyiv are using small drones as well as loitering munitions to destroy troops, tanks, and support equipment while relying on the same unmanned aerial vehicles to resupply, triage casualties, and identify approaching enemies. These drones are no longer operated from afar but embedded into trenches or smuggled deep into an adversary's territory.

The United States has largely missed this revolution in military technology. Although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has promised to “unleash American drone dominance,” so far the United States' drone arsenal remains dominated by the larger, more expensive systems it pioneered a decade ago. New drone programs such as the air force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft or the army's Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance are still in prototype and far from cheap. The air force's CCA is estimated at $15 million to $20 million per unit; the army's much smaller drone will still cost between $70,000 and $170,000. Even if the military bought more drones than it currently plans to, it is unclear whether U.S. companies could produce anywhere near the approximately 200,000 drones that Ukraine has been using monthly.

To take advantage of the drone revolution, it will not be enough for the United States to focus on building capacity—more funding, more production, faster acquisition. The country's civilian and defense leaders will have to more fundamentally question the ideas that have long shaped the U.S. military and its campaigns. The United States' delay in adopting the new generation of drones is a product of strong convictions that it acquired over the past 60 years of fighting wars: that it could, and should, leverage remotely operated technology to win quick conflicts fought from a distance. The United States believed that it could rely on relatively expensive drone technology to save pilots' lives, deliver real-time intelligence straight to decision-makers, and enable precision targeting.

Now, U.S. leaders are under pressure to adapt to a new way of war already emerging in European and Middle Eastern conflicts. Other countries' use of drones is changing battlefield dynamics, meaning that the kind of low-casualty campaigns for which the U.S. drone force is built may well become less prevalent. Before rushing to invest in a fresh wave of technologies, however, U.S. defense planners will need to review fundamental beliefs and assumptions that guided their acquisitions over the last half century. They will have to reconsider the American public's tolerance for casualties, reevaluate long-standing procurement processes, and wrestle with the different services' tendency to push for bigger, pricier systems. First and foremost, U.S. leaders will need to articulate a new theory of victory that considers how drone technologies can help the United States achieve strategic success.

The modern U.S. military has long sought to develop technology to make wars more precise, more efficient, and less risky—both for American leaders and for the troops they send to war. As early as 1965, President Lyndon Johnson told his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, to find a technological solution for dangerous reconnaissance missions in what was becoming an unpopular war in Vietnam: “I don't think there's any way, Bob, that through your small planes or helicopters . . . you could spot these people and then radio back and let the planes come in and bomb the hell out of them?”

With the advent of the microprocessor in 1971, U.S. drone innovation took off, and the first significant drone capability was integrated into American combat. Lightning Bug and, later, Buffalo Hunter drones flew over 4,000 sorties in Vietnam, performing what the military calls “dull, dangerous, and dirty” missions previously only accomplishable by human pilots. Drones served as bait for air-defense sites, photographed North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles and prison camps, conducted reconnaissance in poor weather, and dropped propaganda leaflets.

Drones did not fundamentally shift the dynamics of the Vietnam War. But they caught the imagination of the U.S. military by demonstrating how unmanned technology could mitigate human risk. This potential became especially important after the military halted the active draft and transitioned to an all-volunteer force in 1973. Ending conscription deterred future presidents from deploying large numbers of troops and required the armed services to design new military strategies that relied on the force they believed they could recruit. Geopolitical shifts also drove a growing interest in new battlefield technologies: by the beginning of the 1980s, the United States faced a quantitatively superior Soviet military. The U.S. military needed to find ways to outmatch the Soviets in quality to make up for its adversary's raw manpower advantage.



U.S. leaders focused on enabling the military to fight with a smaller, better-trained force operating new precision-guided technologies. Frameworks such as the AirLand Battle doctrine, a strategy jointly adopted by the army and the air force that called for long-range strikes complemented by highly maneuverable ground-force operations, drew on new advances in microprocessing to see and target enemies from farther away. Meanwhile, President Ronald Reagan's massive increases to the U.S. defense budget allowed funding to flow into satellites, radars, and new “smart weapons” with better guidance systems—all technologies that would become the foundation of the U.S. drone arsenal.

Washington's quest for drones became more urgent after the 1983 bombing of a marine barracks and the downing of navy pilots in Lebanon. The navy invested about $90 million into an Israeli-proven system and purchased 72 Pioneer unmanned aerial vehicles. U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, meanwhile, released a new military doctrine stating that troops should not be deployed except as a last resort. Strategists had faith that drones, such as the Pioneer, could substitute for risky manned aerial reconnaissance missions. In 1985, Kelly Burke, the air force's research and development chief from 1979 to 1982, explained the logic to The Washington Post: “There may be such a thing as a cheap airplane, but there's no such thing as a cheap American pilot.”

The release of the Weinberger doctrine coincided with the dawn of the information age. The United States had long wished to avoid extended wars of attrition, and rapid advances in digital technology finally seemed to make that goal possible. In the bowels of the Pentagon, a handful of strategists in the Office of Net Assessment focused on how new systems such as drones might more fully revolutionize military strategy by detecting and targeting the enemy from a distance to win wars quickly and with little risk to U.S. troops. In a remarkably prescient report written in 1986, a group of ONA strategists envisioned a battle space pervaded by flying reconnaissance sensors and swarming “aerial mines,” in which artillery and manned aircraft relied on unmanned sensors to automatically select targets.

But these two goals—to mitigate human risk and to optimize battlefield effectiveness—never quite aligned. Since the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. drone strategy has been characterized by a tension between risk aversion and the desire for swift, decisive, technology-enabled victories. During the Gulf War, the United States attempted to balance minimizing risk and maximizing effectiveness by pursuing a hybrid strategy: the air force kicked off the war with a shock-and-awe campaign supported by precision bombs and long-range missiles while ground forces launched a decisive maneuver that devastated the Iraqi military. The war's success suggested a new American way of war that featured quick, decisive, and low-casualty campaigns.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, Congress and the Clinton administration slashed the Defense Department's budget. Branches of the armed services fought to prioritize their favorite existing weapons programs, leading to investments in big manned platforms such as aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and tanks rather than unmanned platforms or smaller munitions. The defense industry consolidated, leaving the remaining firms with a smaller budget and a smaller appetite to dedicate to research and development outside of the Defense Department's stated requirements.

Despite these constraints, over the course of the 1990s, the Clinton administration managed to build an arsenal of stealth aircraft, long-range cruise missiles, and GPS-enabled bombs. These were the air-war years of low-risk, high-technology military interventions. Clinton's Department of Defense saw great potential in drones, even if they were not high on any armed service's priority list. Early in his tenure as deputy secretary of defense, John Deutch established a joint organization, the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office, to encourage the military to adopt drone technology. The office concluded in 1994 that unmanned aerial vehicles were “a viable alternative as the services wrestle with the many challenges of downsizing.” The first Predator drones, invented by an energy company called General Atomics with no clear advocate within the armed services, flew over the former Yugoslavia in the summer of 1995.

That same summer, the F-16 pilot Scott O'Grady was shot down over Bosnian Serb territory. This was an embarrassment for the U.S. military and influenced Air Force Chief of Staff Ronald Fogleman to put the Predator into wider use; he established the air force's first drone unit in July 1995. Congress supported Fogleman's efforts. John Warner, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, explained: “In my judgment, this country will never again permit the armed forces to be engaged in conflicts which inflict the level of casualties we have seen historically.” That meant, he concluded, an inevitable move toward unmanned technologies.

Following the 9/11 attacks, Predator and Reaper drones became a dominant feature of U.S. military strategy. Over the course of two decades, the United States bought over 500 Predators and Reapers (at a cost of tens of billions of dollars) and used them to conduct thousands of drone strikes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, and a host of other countries. Commanders sitting in operations centers were able to track targets in real time 24/7.

But the use of drones remained controversial. The systems weren't cheap; nor were they very maneuverable or resilient. Troops on the ground weren't fully satisfied. The drones suffered from interference in bad weather and data-transmission lags and were operated almost completely by the air force; troops complained that the air force pilots in charge of drone squadrons were not adequately trained for ground support missions. And many questioned the widespread use of drones to replace human fighters altogether. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States was supposedly fighting for locals' hearts and minds, but this goal sometimes seemed at odds with bombing them from an impersonal, safe distance.

The only service that ever really invested in drones during the global “war on terror” was the air force. Although unmanned aircraft potentially threatened pilots' historical role in the service, the air force's desire to control aerial missions caused it to lead the way in adopting drone technology. Rather than being attached to ground-combat units, Predators and Reapers were operated by air force squadrons modeled on fighter units. Often, former fighter pilots piloted the drones and used aircraft tasking processes that mimicked those designed for manned aircraft. It was no surprise that the United States' use of drones closely replicated core airpower missions such as strategic bombing and reconnaissance. The army accepted the air force's monopoly on drones, investing only sparingly in smaller systems, while the navy—which remained focused on big platforms such as aircraft carriers that were core to its identity—showed little interest in the unmanned revolution.

Ultimately, the United States' narrow focus on using advanced technology to limit harm to troops motivated its military to buy and deploy a certain type of drone: one that was controlled remotely, could look at targets for long periods, and could be deployed in dangerous airspaces. That procurement focus arose out of decades of decisions—about how the United States wanted to fight after the Vietnam War, about the lessons that should be drawn from the Gulf War, and about defense investments during a period of U.S. unilateralism. Two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq cemented those choices.

The war in Ukraine has challenged that force posture. As a result, the United States is now hastening to invest in a wider range of drones. It is awarding contracts to new defense firms and war-gaming new drone missions. Defense Secretary Hegseth has recently directed units to buy and experiment with commercially available drones. But these decisions all shoot from the hip, reacting to the way drones are being used on foreign battlefields rather than arising from a strategic plan about the roles they should play in future U.S. wars.

If the United States wants to fight and win wars of attrition—the kind of war in which Ukraine is now using drones to great effect—it will need more low-cost drones attached to combat units that can adapt quickly to counterdrone efforts. But it cannot simply copy the Ukrainian (or Israeli) drone strategies. Before rushing toward procurement, U.S. defense strategists need to articulate a new theory of victory, reviewing the beliefs and assumptions that undergirded the last 50 years of technological acquisitions.

For half a century, the United States built a military based on the belief that the American public would not sacrifice its blood but would be willing to spend its treasure. As the deficit balloons and the U.S. electorate shows an increased appetite to punish presidents for inflation and wasteful government programs, U.S. leaders can no longer simply assume they can throw money at expensive technologies to mitigate their own political risk. At the same time, the belief that dominated the 1980s and 1990s—that unmanned technology would create quicker wars fought from a greater distance—is being challenged. The use of drones in European and Middle Eastern theaters is enabling even closer-range conflict: mines, trench warfare, and civilian targeting. None of these have been at the core of U.S. strategy since Vietnam.

The Trump administration must carefully consider whether the U.S. military should adopt drone technology that enables these kinds of warfare in the context of a broader examination of the United States' military strategy. Only then can it align the U.S. defense budget (and drone investments) toward clear strategic priorities. In the past, secretaries of defense have successfully navigated interservice budget fights by transferring programs out of individual services or taking them over directly, firing services' chiefs of staff, and lobbying Congress to allocate funds for specific programs. Not only does Congress need to make the military acquisition process faster and more efficient; it also needs to enable more bottom-up innovation, allowing combat commanders and smaller units to procure and manage their own drone programs. This will require significant legislative reform on the scale of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act, which made sweeping changes to the Department of Defense. Refreshing U.S. defense strategy may also require tenacious leadership within the armed services, including the appointment of commanders whose tenure is longer than the current norm.

The American military has been seduced by its operational and tactical successes but has fallen short of maintaining the strategic edge it needs to succeed in the conflicts of the twenty-first century. Without reevaluating the American way of war, no amount of new drones will be able to defend the United States against wars it doesn't want to fight.

            For months President Donald Trump has been slapping higher tariffs on practically every country's exports to the United States, citing emergency economic powers. Now, just as he's about to enact a new round of tariffs, a federal appeals court could render them void.
    


            Oral arguments are scheduled Thursday for an appeal in a case alleging Trump overstepped his legal authority to impose many of his sweeping tariffs. Five small business owners and 12 Democratic-led states are arguing that Trump can't use a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to enact those import duties.
    


            The US Court of International Trade sided with those states and businesses in May but the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is taking on the case, allowed Trump's tariffs in question to remain in place while the case is being challenged.
    


            It could take them weeks, or even months, to reach a decision. And the appeal could eventually make it to the Supreme Court as well.
    


            But the federal appeals court's decision could still significantly reshape Trump's trade strategy – even as it won't stop Trump from imposing higher tariffs altogether.
    


            Trump has cited IEEPA to impose country-specific tariffs. That includes the 10% universal tariffs that have been applied to most countries' exports to the United States since April as well as tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada aimed at curbing the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants to the United States.
    


            On Wednesday, he cited the law again to increase tariffs on most Brazilian exports to the US by 40 percentage points to 50%, and he's expected to do so again on Friday, the self-imposed deadline he set for trading partners to make trade agreements or face higher tariffs.
    


            Even trading partners that reached trade agreements with Trump, including the European Union and Japan, are set to face higher tariffs compared to rates since April. The new rates they face are also being backed by Trump's use of IEEPA, which means if the court rules against him, the trade agreements he announced could face an uncertain fate.
    


            The Trump administration likely believes they can find other legal avenues to back those trade agreements, even if they lose the IEEPA fight in court, said Patrick Childress, international trade and disputes attorney at Holland & Knight and former US Trade Representative attorney.
    


            And starting over on trade talks carries risks as well, said Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank that filed an amicus brief siding with the plaintiffs. “I suspect most nations will not want to provoke the administration by reopening negotiations,” he added.
    


            Economists at JPMorgan aren't as convinced.
    


            “If the IEEPA is deemed inadmissible, the legal status of the trade deals themselves could come into question,” they said in a note earlier this week.
    


            Trump has made tariffs a centerpiece of his entire economic policy; don't expect that to stop any time soon.
    


            But Trump hasn't just been using IEEPA to levy tariffs. All the sectoral tariffs Trump has imposed during his second term, most recently a 50% copper tariff, have used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
    


            This gives the president the authority to impose higher tariffs on national security grounds. It can only be used to target specific sectors and requires an investigation to be launched before tariffs can be imposed.
    


            There's also Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the US Trade Representative to investigate countries potentially violating other nations' trade agreements or practices in a way that is “unjustifiable” and “burdens or restricts” US business. Trump used Section 301 during his first term to hike tariffs on several Chinese imports, along with aircraft and other European Union goods.
    


            There are a slew of other levers he can pull to enact higher tariffs, too, which, like Section 232 and 301 tariffs, aren't being legally challenged.

            Andrea Murzello has a doctorate in pharmacy and a stable job at a nonprofit. But she says she can't afford to grow her family — not under the Trump administration's latest student loan policy shift.
    


            She's one of nearly 8 million borrowers who will see their loan balances start increasing again on August 1.
    


            Earlier this month, the Department of Education announced it would resume applying interest to loans held by borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, an income-driven repayment plan introduced under the Biden administration that had helped borrowers struggling to keep up with high interest loans.
    


            Murzello, 34, graduated from pharmacy school in 2016 with over $200,000 in student loan debt. She initially enrolled in a student loan repayment program for public servants, making monthly payments of around $1,000.
    


            In 2023, she switched to SAVE because it cut her monthly payments to about $400. She was even able to stop these payments without adverse consequences last year, when a court injunction put a temporary pause on the SAVE plan.
    


            Before SAVE, Murzello couldn't make a dent in her balance despite making monthly payments because of the rising interest, she said.
    


            “Instead of having any debt going downwards, I was seeing the opposite occur, because I just wasn't able to pay enough to make any impact,” she said. “Entering the SAVE program was very beneficial for me and my family.”
    


            She had hoped SAVE would offer long-term stability. But now, she and her husband are postponing plans for a second child.
    


            “I think the frustration comes from the massive amount of changes that are occurring,” she said.
    


            The SAVE plan launched in August 2023. It aimed to reduce monthly payments based on income and family size, prevent interest from ballooning, and accelerate loan forgiveness for some low-income borrowers.
    


            “These are people or individual families that have low income that were really relying on that that zero dollar for payment, that no longer are going to have that option,” said Roxanne Garza, director of higher education policy at EdTrust, a left-leaning education advocacy group.
    


            But SAVE faced legal challenges from the start.
    


            Last year, two federal judges in Kansas and Missouri blocked key parts of the program, arguing that the Biden administration overstepped its authority by enacting debt relief without Congressional approval.
    


            Following the court decision, SAVE borrowers were placed in no-interest forbearance, with payments paused and balances frozen since last summer.
    


            But starting August 1st, interest will start to accrue again.
    


            Borrowers will still be able to be granted forbearance — meaning putting a delay on their monthly payments — but interest will now be applied each month.
    


            The Department of Education hasn't said when this will end. Calling SAVE an “illegal” plan in a press release, Education Secretary Linda McMahon urged borrowers to switch to a “legally compliant repayment plan” instead.
    


            Student loan experts say this move causes more confusion for borrowers who are already bogged down in trying to navigate the rapidly changing landscape of student loans. Besides the change to SAVE, more extensive shifts to student loans were passed in the Trump administration's domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill.
    


            “Even diligent people grow weary of understanding what their situation is and their options,” said Ken Ruggiero, founder and CEO of private loan provider Ascent.
    


            And Garza, of EdTrust, warned that it could be a long wait before getting clarity from the Department of Education. “I'm not sure how easy it will be to get your questions answered or how long it will take to actually have your application processed to switch into a different plan, especially now that you will likely see like a surge of people acting because of the interest accrual coming back online,” Garza adds.
    


            The Department already has a backlog of roughly 1.5 million applications from borrowers seeking to switch into different income-driven repayment plans, CNN has previously reported.
    


            Experts encourage borrowers who are on the SAVE plan to be as proactive as possible to understand their options and figure if another plan may be better.
    


            The confusion over student loans is creating broader societal issues. Nearly three quarters (71%) of borrowers surveyed in a national poll have said that student loan debt has delayed a major life event, such as buying a home, having children, or getting married, according to the Gallup-Lumina Foundation's Cost of College report released last spring.
    


            And in some important sectors, such as medicine, it is contributing to a looming crisis. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the US is expected to face a deficit of up to 40,400 primary care physicians by 2036 — an expected shortfall the group has attributed in part to the steep cost of medical education.
    


            Bronte Remsik, a 31-year-old medical resident, graduated from Campbell University in May 2024 with close to $300,000 in student loans. She had worked with financial counselors and immediately applied for the SAVE plan.
    


            But her application was never processed. Her loan servicer advised her to “wait it out.” She couldn't apply for a different repayment plan, as it would cancel out her SAVE application. With a growing federal backlog and no clear guidance, she feels stuck in limbo.
    


            “All of the people that I'm reaching out to who are supposed to help me also don't know what to do,” she said. “And now I'm being told that the interest is going to start accruing on my loans when I'm not even able to enroll in a payment program.”
    


            “The financial walls just feel like they're crushing down around me when I thought graduating from medical school was the big win,” she said.

            A US Navy F-35 fighter jet crashed in central California Wednesday near Naval Air Station Lemoore, according to a Navy press statement.
    


            The pilot ejected safely, and the cause of the crash, which occurred around 6:30 pm, is under investigation, the statement said.
    


            Video from CNN affiliate KFSN showed fire and thick black smoke rising from the crash site in flat, open farmland near the air station, around 40 miles (64 kilometers) southwest of the city of Fresno in central California.
    


            A local EMS crew was at the scene helping the pilot, and Cal Fire also responded, a Fresno County sheriff's Office statement said.
    


‘Frankenjet' stealth fighter made from two wrecked warplanes joins US Air Force fleet



            The aircraft was assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron VF-125, known as the “Rough Raiders,” the Navy said. VF-125 is a Fleet Replacement Squadron, responsible for training pilots and aircrew.
    


            The crashed jet was an F-35C, one of three variants of the F-35 Lightning II, designed for use on US aircraft carriers. The US Air Force flies the F-35A while the Marine Corps flies the F-35B, a short takeoff, vertical landing jet.
    


            The crash of the aircraft, priced at around $100 million, was the second of an F-35 this year. An Air Force F-35A crashed at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska in January during a training mission. The pilot also ejected safely in that incident.
    


            The F-35, a fifth-generation fighter jet and one of the world's most advanced warplanes, is a cornerstone of the US military's fleet.
    


            Manufactured by Lockheed Martin, it's lauded for its advanced stealth and combat capabilities.
    


            The Air Force has 246 F-35s in its fleet, the Marines Corps has 122 and the Navy has 41, according to the World Air Forces database on FlightGlobal.com. Worldwide, more than 17 countries are part of the F-35 program, Lockheed Martin says.
    


            But the jet has faced increased scrutiny in recent years over maintenance and readiness issues.
    


            A January 2025 report from the Defense Department's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation shows all variants of the multimillion-dollar jets fail to meet requirements for reliability, maintainability and availability.
    


            “The operational suitability of the F-35 fleet continues to fall short of Service expectations,” the report said.
    


            Meanwhile, an online database of F-35 accidents and mishaps from F-16.net shows 20 incidents involving the aircraft from 2014 to 2024.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil, setting a legal rationale that Brazil's policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro constitute an economic emergency under a 1977 law.

Trump had threatened the tariffs July 9 in a letter to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But the legal basis of that threat was an earlier executive order premised on trade imbalances being a threat to the U.S. economy. But America ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

A statement by the White House said Brazil's judiciary had tried to coerce social media companies and block their users, though it did not name the companies involved, X and Rumble.

Trump appears to identify with Bolsonaro, who attempted to overturn the results of his 2022 loss to Lula. Similarly, Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Lula left an event about animal rights early on Wednesday after Trump's move, saying he needed to defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in light of the measures announced by the President of the United States.”

The order would apply an additional 40% tariff on the baseline 10% tariff already being levied by Trump. But not all goods imported from Brazil would face the 40% tariff: Civil aircraft and parts, aluminum, tin, wood pulp, energy products and fertilizers are among the products being excluded.




The order said the tariffs would go into effect seven days after its signing on Wednesday.

Also Wednesday, Trump's Treasury Department announced sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and Bolsonaro's ongoing trial.

De Moraes oversees the criminal case against Bolsonaro, who is accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 defeat.

On July 18, the State Department announced visa restrictions on Brazilian judicial officials, including de Moraes.

VIENNA (AP) — It was late at night when they came for Dmytro Shabanov, a security assistant in eastern Ukraine at the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

His seizure from his home in the Luhansk region in April 2022 — weeks after Moscow's full-scale invasion — was part of a coordinated operation by pro-Russian forces who detained him and two other Ukrainian OSCE workers. Maksym Petrov, an interpreter, also was seized in the Luhansk region, while Vadym Golda, another security assistant, was detained in neighboring Donetsk.

More than three years later, the three Ukrainian civilians who had worked with the international group's ceasefire monitoring efforts in the eastern regions remain behind bars. They have not been part of recent large-scale prisoner exchanges with Russia.

Their detention has raised alarm among OSCE officials, Western nations and human rights advocates, who demand their immediate release while expressing concern about their health and prison conditions amid allegations of torture.

The Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian mission to the OSCE did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on those allegations or on OSCE personnel having immunity from prosecution as international civil servants.




“He was taken from his home after the curfew took effect,” said Margaryta Shabanova, Shabanov's wife, who lives in Kyiv. “I had a last call with him around 20 minutes before it happened.”

After his arrest, Shabanov disappeared for three months, held incommunicado by Russian separatists and interrogated in a Luhansk prison until he was forced to sign a confession.

That fateful night turned Shabanova's life upside down.

“Every morning, I wake up hoping that today will be different -- that today I will hear that my Dima is free,” she said. “Painfully, days stretch on, and nothing changes. The waiting, the not knowing, the endless hope slowly turning into quiet despair.”

Fighting back tears, Shabanova describes life without her husband.

“The silence at the dinner table, the birthdays and holidays have been missed for over three years. People say to me that I am strong, but they don't see the moments I collapse behind closed doors,” she said.

The Vienna-based OSCE monitors ceasefires, observes elections, and promotes democracy and arms control, and Shabanov “really liked his job” at the international organization, said his wife, especially working with the foreign staff. She said her husband believed that “international service could protect lives and make the world a little more just.”

The OSCE had operated a ceasefire monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists had been fighting Ukrainian government troops since 2014, with about 14,000 killed even before the full-scale invasion. The monitors watched for truce violations, facilitated dialogue and brokered local halts in fighting to enable repairs to critical civilian infrastructure.

But on March 31, 2022, Russia blocked the extension of the OSCE mission, and separatist leaders declared it illegal the following month. 

It remains unclear whether the three detained OSCE staffers had tried to flee eastern Ukraine.

Locally recruited Ukrainians like Shabanov, Petrov and Golda worked in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions to help shut down the OSCE mission. They cleared offices, safeguarded OSCE assets, including armored vehicles, drones and cameras, and oversaw evacuations of their international colleagues. That operation was completed by October 2022.

The three men were arrested despite carrying documents confirming their immunity, the OSCE said.

Shabanov and Petrov were convicted of treason by a Russian-controlled court in Luhansk in September 2022 and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Golda, 57, was convicted of espionage by a court in Donetsk, also under Moscow's control, in July 2024 and sentenced to 14 years.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said in November 2022 it believed the activities of the OSCE monitors “were often not only biased but also illegal.” Without identifying the three Ukrainian OSCE staff by name, the ministry alleged that local residents were recruited by the West to collect information for the Ukrainian military and “several” were detained.

The OSCE condemned the sentences and called for the immediate release of the three men, asserting they were performing their official duties as mandated by all of its 57 member states, including Russia.

Seven months after the invasion, Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, despite not fully controlling them.

On March 27, 2025, Russia transferred Shabanov from a detention facility in the Luhansk region to a high-security penal colony in Russia's Omsk region in Siberia, according to Ievgeniia Kapalkina, a lawyer with the Ukrainian Legal Advisory Group who represents the Shabanov and Petrov families.

Petrov remains at risk of being moved to Russia, she said.

Penal colonies in Siberia are known for harsh conditions, where “prisoners often lose all contact with the outside world, effectively ‘disappearing' within Russia's penal system,” the legal group said in March. “Given their existing health issues, the lack of proper medical care in remote regions could prove fatal,” it added.

Ukrainian human rights activist Maksym Butkevych, who was in the same Luhansk penal colony with Shabanov and Petrov from March 2024 until being released in October 2024, said both men were tortured during interrogation.

Shabanov was “beaten several times during the interrogations until he lost consciousness and was subjected to extreme psychological pressure,” he said.

Butkevych said Shabanov, 38, has problems with his back and legs. “He had to lie down at least for couple of hours every day due to pain,” he added.

Petrov, 45, has “a lot of health issues,” Butkevych said, including allergies worsened by his captivity, “specifically the interrogation period.”

Kapalkina said both men were “subjected to repeated unlawful interrogations during which they suffered severe physical and physiological abuse” and eventually “signed confessions under coercion.”

The allegations of torture could not be independently verified by the AP.

Butkevych suggested the three imprisoned OSCE workers, who are not prisoners of war, are likely “bargaining chips” for Moscow, to be “exchanged for someone or something significantly important for Russia.”

Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen, the current chairperson of the OSCE, said in a statement to AP that imprisoning civilian officials of an international organization “is completely unacceptable.”

“Securing their release is a top priority for the Finnish OSCE Chairpersonship,” she said.

OSCE Secretary General Feridun H. Sinirlioğlu is “very closely and personally engaged on this matter,” a spokesperson said, noting he traveled to Moscow in March and raised the issue with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. 

Yurii Vitrenko, Ukraine's ambassador to International Organizations in Vienna, called for the unconditional release of the three, saying they should “never have been illegally detained” by Russia, should “never have been put on a fake trial,” and should “never have been handed illegal sentences.”

Vitrenko suggested that other states with more influence with Russia should exert more pressure to help secure their release. He did not identify those countries.

Shabanova said she regularly asks “those who have the power” to take action.

“Do not look away,” she said, adding that the OSCE and the international community must ask themselves why their actions have not led to the release of her husband.

Her only wish, she said, is “to see my Dima walk through the door, just to hold his hand again, to look into his eyes and say, ‘You are home now. It's over.'”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's Parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill presented by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that restores the independence of two of the country's key anti-corruption watchdogs, reversing his contentious move last week that curbed their power and brought an outcry.

Last week's measure by Zelenskyy to place the watchdogs under the oversight of the prosecutor-general prompted rebukes from Ukrainians, the European Union and international rights groups. It raised fears that the government could meddle in investigations and potentially shield its supporters from scrutiny.

Fighting entrenched corruption is crucial for Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and maintain access to billions of dollars of vital Western aid in the nearly 3½-year all-out war. It's also an effort that enjoys broad public support.

Zelenskyy said he signed the bill into law less than two hours after its approval — an unusually speedy procedure for legislation.

“It guarantees normal, independent work for anti-corruption bodies and all law enforcement agencies in our state,” Zelenskyy said of the new law. “A truly productive day with real impact for the people.”

Zelenskyy has been the international face of Ukraine's determination to thwart Russia's invasion. The anti-graft changes that he backed last week tarnished his image abroad and put a question mark over his country's efforts to meet standards set by the EU for membership.




“Ukraine's move to restore powers of anti-corruption bodies demonstrates its resolve to quickly get back on course when European democratic values are at stake,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas‬ said on social media.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos, who called last week's legislative changes “a serious step back,” welcomed approval of the bill, saying lawmakers had “corrected last week's damaging vote.”

“Today's law restores key safeguards, but challenges remain,” Kos, who monitors the record of countries that are candidates to join the bloc, wrote on X. “The EU supports (Ukrainian) citizens' demands for reform. Upholding fundamental values & fighting corruption must remain the priority.”

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Ukraine “is committed to reforms and the fight against corruption,” and that Zelenskyy “demonstrated a principled approach.”

“We got it fixed,” he wrote on X.

At the start of a livestream of the parliamentary session, which was the first to be broadcast in real time since the start of the war, two lawmakers could be seen exchanging punches. Although the reason for the scuffle wasn't known, it occurred amid a tense atmosphere in the chamber where the speaker's podium is flanked by Ukrainian and EU flags.

The backlash against Zelenskyy's measures brought street protests across the country, the first major demonstrations since Russia's full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022. Though the protests didn't call for the president's removal, the controversy threatened to undermine public trust in their leaders at a critical time.

Russia's bigger army is accelerating its efforts to pierce Ukraine's front-line defenses and is escalating its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. There is also uncertainty over how much additional weaponry Ukraine's Western partners can provide and how quickly.

The Ukrainian branch of Transparency International also criticized last week's legislation, saying it weakened one of the most significant reforms since what Ukraine calls its Revolution of Dignity in 2014.

Zelenskyy said his goal had been to speed up prolonged investigations, ensure more convictions and remove Russian meddling in investigations, which he didn't detail.

He said he had taken note of the protests and decided to present a new bill to Parliament underscoring that the prosecutor general and his deputies cannot give orders to anti-graft agencies or interfere in their work.

Lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament in Kyiv, approved Zelenskyy's new proposal with 331 votes and nine abstentions on Thursday, official figures showed.

Watch live as the National Transportation Safety Board begins three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January.

Incorrect altitude readings on the Army helicopter that collided with a passenger plane over Washington, D.C., in January contributed to the aircraft getting too close, but air traffic controllers warned about the hazards helicopter traffic presented years before the crash.

Those warnings came even before the 85 near misses near the airport in the three years before the crash. But despite the concerns that were raised about the route the Black Hawk helicopter followed that night, the Federal Aviation Administration didn't make changes to it or warn pilots about it.

The details came out of the first day of National Transportation Safety Board hearings in Washington, where investigators highlighted several of the factors that contributed to the crash between the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and the Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that was the deadliest aviation disaster in America since November 2001.

“It's so bureaucratic,” NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said. “I mean we heard it in the testimony today: ‘Oh you could bring it up in another symposium or another group. or you could take this option or we said no.' But then I asked did you provide an alternative? That's why people are so critical of the federal government because you can't ensure safety.”

Representatives of the Army and Federal Aviation Administration tried to deflect responsibility throughout the hearing. The Army acknowledged that their Black Hawks altimeters might be more than 100 feet (30 meters) off, but they seemed to say that was acceptable because their pilots' goal is to maintain altitude within 100 feet of a limit.




Army officials instead raised concerns about the lack of separation between landing aircraft and helicopters flying on approved FAA routes near the airport. But later in the day, FAA and Army officials both implied that those routes were never supposed to ensure separation. Instead they suggested that it was up to the air traffic controller to keep helicopters from flying on that route anytime planes were taking off or landing from that runway.

Aviation lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing several of the victims' families said there was a lot of “finger pointing” and “no acceptance of responsibility and accountability” during the hearing.

The board's final report won't be released until sometime next year, but it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the crash.

The January nighttime incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.

A video animation showed where the helicopter and airliner were leading up to the collision. It showed how the helicopter flew above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit on the helicopter route along the Potomac River before colliding with the plane. 

Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.

Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the older Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that help provide more accurate altitude readings.

Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn't find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them, although that's not something every Army pilot is trained to do.

Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such separation distances as small as 75 feet between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.

“The fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army's utility helicopters.

But Rosengren said that “if he was king for a day” he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in this crash and replace them with newer versions of the helicopters.

Army officials and the head of a local medevac helicopter company that flies around Washington told the board they believed air traffic controllers would never let them fly the helicopter route involved in the crash anytime a plane was approaching the runway.

Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vetchen said after the crash that he talked to many of his fellow pilots and everyone had the same assumption that controllers would never allow them to fly across the path of the runway the American plane was approaching before the crash. But Homendy said other pilots in the unit told investigators they were allowed to fly underneath landing planes.

Citing the numbers for runways, Van Vetchen said that “100% of the time when I was on route four and 33/15 was active” he would be instructed to hold until after the plane landed or took off from that runway.

During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft on two different frequencies, according to the NTSB's History of Flight Performance Study released Wednesday.

The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.

“All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,” the report stated. “This resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.”

Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision.

Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. Officials on Wednesday also raised the use of night vision goggles, which limit the wearer's field of view, on the helicopter as a factor. 

Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.

On Wednesday, it came out that even if they had been turned on, the ADS-B Out systems on most of the helicopters in the same unit as the one that crashed wouldn't work because they had been installed incorrectly. When the NTSB uncovered that problem, the Army sent out an alert about it and worked to quickly reprogram the units so they would work.

Homendy highlighted that an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.

Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident the FAA transferred managers out of the tower instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.

“What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.' Are you kidding me? 67 people are dead. How do you explain that?”

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, introduced legislation Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.

The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. 

Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he'd like to discuss “a few tweaks,” the legislation is “the right approach.” He also suggested that the previous administration “was asleep at the wheel” amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace.

President Donald Trump launches initiative encouraging Americans to upload personal health data and medical records to apps and systems run by Big Tech. “Today the dream of easily transportable electronic medical records finally becomes a reality,” he said.

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

The Trump administration is launching a new private health tracking system that asks Americans to share their personal health data and medical records with private tech companies.

Officials say the new system will broaden access to health records, provide digital tools to help manage diabetes and other conditions, and make monitoring wellness easier. Meanwhile, experts caution there are a number of ethical and legal concerns. 

The initiative, spearheaded by an administration that has already freely shared highly personal data about Americans in ways that have tested legal bounds, has been met with concern from digital privacy activists.

Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have said patients would need to opt in to share their medical records and data, which will be kept secure.

Other news we're following:








The president has downplayed the influence of Loomer, a right-wing provocateur known for her incendiary social media presence, in his administration's decision-making. 

But the list of administration officials who have drawn Loomer's ire and swiftly thereafter gotten the axe from Trump has been growing.

Loomer, who has publicly encouraged Trump to purge aides she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda, has taken credit for some of the ousters, tearing into some of Trump's allies and advisers and calling out what she calls a “vetting crisis” within the White House. 

Trump, meanwhile, has long praised Loomer while distancing himself at times from her most controversial comments and downplaying her direct impact on his choices.

The president now meets with candidates for promotion to that rank, the White House has acknowledged. He has the meetings because he wants to make sure the military retains its superiority and leaders focus on fighting wars instead of being bureaucrats, a spokesperson said.

The meetings, however, are a departure from past practice, and knowledge of them has raised concerns about politicization of the top ranks. Trump has not always respected the longstanding tradition of walling off the military from partisan politics.

In June he mobilized the National Guard and then the Marines, sending hundreds of them into Los Angeles over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat with whom the president has feuded.

Trump followed up with a campaign-style rally at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where uniformed soldiers cheered as he criticized former President Joe Biden and other Democrats — raising concerns that he was using the military as a political prop.

The clock is ticking closer to the president's latest tariff deadline of Aug 1. And while several more deals — or at least frameworks for them — have been reached since his last tariff deadline of July 9 came and went, talks with many countries are still in flux. 

▶ Read more on what we know about the agreements announced so far, country by country

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva left an event about animal rights early after Trump signed the order. 

Lula said he needed to defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in light of the measures announced by the President of the United States.”

Lee Jae Myung said in a Facebook post that the agreement offers a chance to further strengthen economic cooperation and military alliance with the United States.

Lee said the $350 billion investment fund announced earlier by Trump is meant to solidify a foundation for bilateral cooperation on strategic industries. The fund will support South Korean companies' entry to the U.S. market in areas where they excel, such as shipbuilding, semiconductors, secondary batteries, biotechnology and energy.

Lee also said the deal will remove uncertainty around South Korea's export environment as the U.S. 15% tariff rate on goods from the country is lower or similar to what major trade competitors face.

“The government was only engaged in negotiations by placing a top priority on national interests,” Lee said. “It's important to pull out a mutually beneficial agreement, rather than seeking unilateral benefits.” 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration is committed to protecting Social Security hours after saying that a new children's savings program Trump signed into law “is a back door for privatizing Social Security.” 

Bessent said Wednesday evening that the accounts created under Trump's tax break-and-spending cut law “will supplement the sanctity of Social Security's guaranteed payments.” 

“This is not an either-or question: our Administration is committed to protecting Social Security and to making sure seniors have more money,” Bessent said on the social platform X. 

Bessent's remarks about privatizing Social Security, made at a forum hosted by Breitbart News, were striking after Trump's repeated promises on the campaign trail and in office that he would not touch Social Security. It also reignited an issue that has dogged Republicans for years. 

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday during a visit to the South American nation that the United States will deploy the biometric technologies in partnership with Santiago to control migration and disrupt criminal networks, 

“This arrangement is going to serve as a bridge to help Chile and the United States work towards bringing criminals to justice and knowing who is in our countries perpetuating crimes,” Noem said while signing the preliminary agreement with Chile's security and justice ministers.

The Trump administration is seeking to bolster regional cooperation in its clampdown against transnational criminal groups. 

The agreement allows Chilean officials to identify potentially dangerous people entering or exiting the country and share their biometric data, such as fingerprints and iris scans, with the Department of Homeland Security to prevent their travel to the U.S. 

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth essentially accused the administration of ignoring his orders to restore Voice of America's operations and explain clearly what it is doing with the government-run outlet.

Lamberth gave the administration until Aug. 13 to explain how it will get VOA working again. VOA, which provides news to other countries and dates back to World War, II has been largely dark since March.

The judge said the administration needs to show what it is doing with the $260 million Congress appropriated for VOA's operations this year.

Kari Lake, the adviser appointed by Trump to run government news agencies, said in June that 85% of employees at VOA and its overseers at the U.S. Agency for Global Media had lost their jobs. She called it a “long overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.”

Lamberth said there is a process for eliminating funding that was previously appropriated: Congress must vote on it, as it recently did for NPR and PBS funding. But that did not happen with VOA, he said.

There was no immediate comment from the White House. 

The president said the agreement reached Wednesday would impose a 15% tariff on goods from the Asian nation.

The countries have also agreed for South Korea to buy $100 billion in energy resources from the U.S. and give the U.S. $350 billion for “investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as president,” Trump said.

He also said in a social media post that new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung will visit the White House sometime in August.

Eric Holder, the former attorney general during the administration of President Barack Obama, made the remark Wednesday and said voter turnout will be key.

“We still have power. If people participate in elections, if people are engaged in civic activities, I think we can push back against this power grab,” Holder said at a Democratic forum convened by Senators Alex Padilla of California and Dick Durbin of Illinois to discuss voter suppression.

“Even in the face of a gerrymander that they're proposing, election turnout will ultimately matter,” Holder added. 

Padilla lamented the maps released by the Texas legislature Wednesday, saying “I wish this conversation wasn't as timely as it is.”

Joe Kent was confirmed on a 52-44 vote as Republicans looked past his connections to right-wing extremists and support for conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Democrats strongly opposed his confirmation. 

Kent will oversee an agency tasked with analyzing and detecting terrorist threats. He plans to target Latin American gangs and other criminal groups tied to migration. 

Kent enters the role after two unsuccessful campaigns for Congress in Washington state, a military career that saw him deployed 11 times as a Green Beret and work at the CIA. 

During his 2022 congressional campaign, Kent paid Graham Jorgensen, a member of the far-right military group the Proud Boys, for consulting. He also worked closely with Joey Gibson, founder of the Christian nationalist group Patriot Prayer, and attracted support from a variety of far-right figures.

During his confirmation hearing, Kent refused to distance himself from a conspiracy theory that federal agents somehow instigated the Capitol riot and false claims that Trump won the 2020 election. 

Correction: This post has been updated to correct that the vote tally was 52-44, not 53-44. 



A dozen members of Congress who have been blocked from making oversight visits at immigration detention centers filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking to ensure they are granted entry into the facilities even without prior notice.

The complaint says the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are obstructing Congressional oversight of the centers at a time when there has been an increase in ICE arrests, with reports of raids across the country and people taken into custody at immigration courts.

By law members of Congress are allowed to visit ICE facilities and do not have to give any notice. But increasingly members have been stopped at the door. ICE officials have said a new rule requires a seven-day waiting period and they prohibit entry to field offices. 

The lawsuit asks the court for full and immediate access to all ICE facilities.

The remark came in a social media post following a committee action on Hawley's legislation that would ban members of Congress from trading stocks.

Trump complained that Hawley blocked another proposal from Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., that would have forced a review of stock trades by Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker emerita.

“Why would one ‘Republican,' Senator Josh Hawley from the Great State of Missouri, join with all of the Democrats, to block a Review,” Trump said.

Hawley did not immediately respond to Trump's post.

“We have an opportunity here today to do something that the public has wanted to do for decades,” Hawley told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “And that is to ban members of congress from profiting on information that frankly only members of congress have on the buying and selling of stock.”

“For decades, America's health care networks have been overdue for a high tech upgrade,” the president said in at the White House, where he hosted the event to talk about the administration's effort to streamline medical records. 

“The existing systems are often slow, costly and incompatible with one another, but with today's announcement, we take a major step to bring health care into the digital age.” 

The effort would allow major health care and tech companies to agree on standards for electronic medical records in hopes they will seamlessly transfer between doctors. Trump said the guidelines will also make it simple for patients to access their records.

Trump boasted that health care providers will “finally be able to kill the clipboard,” referring to the physical pieces of paper on clipboards that patients fill out at doctors' offices.

Companies represented in the crowd of about 200 people included Apple, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and Amazon.

The Ivy League school agreed to pay $50 million to workforce development organizations in Rhode Island over 10 years as part of the agreement, along with other concessions in line with the president's political agenda. Brown will adopt the government's definition of “male” and “female,” for example, and must remove any consideration of race from the admissions process.

University President Christina H. Paxson said the deal preserves its academic independence. The terms include a clause saying the government cannot dictate curriculum or the content of academic speech at Brown.

The deal has numerous similarities with one signed last week by Columbia that the government called a roadmap for other universities. Unlike that agreement, however, Brown's does not include an outside monitor.

The agreement includes a pledge from Brown not to “maintain programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts.”

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the deal ensures students will be judged “solely on their merits, not their race or sex.”

The 17 experts who were fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from a government vaccine committee last month say they have little faith in what the panel has become.

Kennedy accused the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He handpicked replacements including several vaccine skeptics.

In a commentary published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former panel members wrote that Kennedy — a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the government's top health official — and his new panel are abandoning rigorous scientific review and open deliberation. That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting.

“That meeting was a travesty, honestly,” said former ACIP member Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Stanford University.

The president's planned announcement of a new private health tracking system that would make it easier for patients to access their health records and monitor their wellness is raising a host of privacy concerns.

The collaboration between the federal government and Big Tech would allow patients to more seamlessly track and share their medical records or data among doctors, hospital systems and health apps, the administration and participating companies say.

More details of the system are expected to be announced during a White House event dubbed “Making Health Technology Great Again” later Wednesday.

The president said the government now has systems in place to enforce his February order closing the “de minimis” loophole, in which goods worth less $800 could enter America duty-free.

Trump signed an order for all goods coming into the U.S. to be inspected and taxed, essentially ending a vehicle that enabled merchants such as Temu and Shein to send cheap products into the country. 

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll has directed the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and fire a newly announced hire who led the nation's cybersecurity agency under President Joe Biden.

The whirlwind directive comes just a day after Army combat veteran and West Point graduate Jen Easterly was announced as a distinguished chair in West Point's social sciences department. As the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency under Biden, Easterly had faced harsh criticism from Republicans who argued that her work to counter misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic veered into censorship.

Easterly denied that her agency censored anyone and has said allegations against CISA are “riddled with factual inaccuracies.”

An Army spokesperson said in a statement that the memo was part of a “deliberate approach” to ensure future officers are prepared for the battlefield going into West Point's new academic year. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell was more blunt on X, saying, “We're not turning cadets into censorship activists.”

Trump said after a Commerce Department investigation that copper imports are a threat to U.S. national security.

The investigation under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act enabled Trump on Wednesday to sign an executive order tariffing copper at 50%, a move that could increase construction costs.

The president has separately tariffed steel and aluminum at 50%, raising costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on the metals as raw materials.

Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil, citing a legal rationale that Brazil's policies and criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro constitute economic emergency under a 1977 law.

Trump had on July 9 threatened the tariffs on Brazil in a letter to its current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

While other federal government agencies are firing employees, one agency is gearing up for a big hiring spree.

The Department of Homeland Security is launching a new campaign to find recruits as it seeks to add 10,000 more staff. Prospective employees looking to assist in Trump's mass deportation agenda could get hiring bonuses of as much as $50,000. DHS is offering other benefits, too, like overtime and student loan forgiveness.

ICE is getting a huge influx of funding after Congress passed Trump's massive spending bill earlier this July.

The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged for the fifth time this year, brushing off repeated calls from Trump for a cut.

The Fed's decision Wednesday leaves its key short-term rate at about 4.3%, where it has stood after the central bank made three cuts last year. Chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed would likely have cut rates already if not for Trump's sweeping tariffs. Powell and other Fed officials say they want to see how Trump's duties on imports will impact inflation and the broader economy. So far the duties have lifted costs of some goods, such as appliances, furniture, and toys, and overall inflation has risen a bit, though less than many economists had expected.

There were some signs of splits in the Fed's ranks: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted to reduce borrowing costs, while 9 officials, including Powell, favored standing pat. It is the first time in more than three decades that two of the seven Washington-based governors have dissented. One official, Governor Adriana Kugler, was absent and didn't vote.

A group tasked by Trump with recommending ways the U.S. could be friendlier to the crypto industry says regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission should move quickly to provide clearer rules governing trading of digital assets.

The White House released a lengthy report Wednesday from a crypto working group. The report makes dozens of recommendations designed to make the U.S. a world leader in cryptocurrencies, Trump administration officials said. They include calling for regulators to make it easier for crypto companies to work with traditional banks and for Congress to pass crypto-friendly tax legislation.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins said his agency will use its existing authority to establish new rules and regulations in line with Trump's vision. Once a skeptic, Trump has recast himself as a crypto enthusiast eager to please an industry that spent heavily to help him win last year's election. Congress is also pushing pro-crypto policies. 

Wednesday's report comes less than two weeks after Trump signed into law new regulations for stablecoins, a rapidly growing form of cryptocurrency.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the higher tariffs imposed by Trump are showing inflation in the “prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen.”

The Fed chair said the tariffs' impact could be a “one-time shift” in prices, but it's also possible that the inflationary impact could be “more persistent.”

The children's savings program included in Trump's sweeping tax breaks and spending cuts law “in a way, it is a backdoor for privatizing Social Security,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said while speaking at a forum hosted by the conservative media group Breitbart on Wednesday. 

The law created a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, allowing accounts to be created for babies born in the U.S. that come with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

Democrats, who have warned for years that Republicans want to privatize Social Security, quickly seized on Bessent's comments as “saying the quiet part out loud.”

“Trump is now coming after American seniors with a ‘backdoor' scam to take away the benefits they earned,” DNC spokesman Tim Hogan said.

The U.S. president told reporters at the White House that he expects to have a “very fair deal with China.”

Trump didn't spell out terms of any trade framework or what U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told him about agreements for ongoing negotiations reached Tuesday in Sweden.

The president has yet to say whether China would pay more than the 30% tariff rate he imposed on them this year.

“We've moving along with China,” Trump said. “I think it's going to work out very well.”

Steve Ricchetti, one of Biden's longest-serving advisors, said in a statement submitted to the House Oversight Committee that Republican inquiries into Biden's alleged cognitive decline advanced “baseless assertions” about his age.

“There was no nefarious conspiracy of any kind among the president's senior staff, and there was certainly no conspiracy to hide the president's mental condition from the American people,” said Ricchetti, who has served as an aide to Biden since 2012.

He said the Republican-led inquiry was “an obvious attempt to deflect from the chaos of this administration's first six months.” He added that he was still willing to answer questions before the House Oversight Committee despite “unprecedented” use of legislative procedure to investigate the Biden White House.

“I believe it is important to forcefully rebut this false narrative about the Biden presidency,” Ricchetti said.

The president brushed off concerns Wednesday that lowering interest rates could ultimately increase inflation.

“Well, if that happens, you just raise them,” Trump said. 

The president made the remarks after he signed a bill that would help veterans at risk of losing their homes. “We're keeping the rates high and it's hurting people from buying houses,” he said.

An estimated 61,000 U.S. veterans are in danger of losing their homes, Trump said.

The bill he signed into law is meant to empower the Veterans Administration to pay loan holders the necessary amount to prevent foreclosures, Trump said.

He said the new law will also help the administration keep its promise to work on ending homelessness among veterans.

A U.S. Senate committee has voted to advance Trump's pick to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which secures elements of the nation's critical infrastructure, including election systems.

If confirmed by the full Republican-led Senate, Sean Plankey will inherit an agency that's been mired in partisan tensions over the role it should play in combating false claims about voting or election fraud.

He would also lead an agency undergoing structural changes, including funding and workforce cuts and the pausing of election security work pending a DHS review.

During his confirmation hearing, Plankey evaded some pointed questions about election security. Asked if the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, he said he had not reviewed its cybersecurity and that his personal opinions weren't relevant. He acknowledged that Biden's win was confirmed by the Electoral College and that he was sworn in.

The sanctions come over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and are linked to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Moraes oversees that case.

“De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions — including against former President Jair Bolsonaro,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.

Wednesday's move comes after Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, set to come into effect on Friday. In his letter on July 9, Trump directly linked the import tax to Bolsonaro's trial, which he called a “witch hunt.”

Bolsonaro has been an ally to Trump. The U.S. president hosted the former Brazilian leader at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.

Hey, Andrew. Thanks for your question. In short: yes, the EPA can do this. But there's a process. To break it down a bit more, we asked AP climate reporter Matthew Daly, who has covered the EPA for years. Here's what he said:

The EPA under Trump has the ability to propose the rule change, but it has to go through the required legal process, including public comment, before the rule in finalized.

Here is where it gets tricky: The 2009 endangerment finding issued by the Obama administration was based on a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, in a case known as Massachusetts vs. EPA, that determined the EPA has legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. 

Opponents of the rule change are virtually certain to challenge the Trump proposal in court. They say EPA is seeking to deny settled science and settled law by creating legal distinctions that have no basis in the law. Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the EPA are “pretending that the pollution causing climate change is not hurting us, even as we suffer more devastating climate disasters every year.”

The Trump EPA said, in arguments it has used on other rule-making, that greenhouse gases — which contribute to global warming — don't pose health dangers to people and, therefore, don't qualify as air pollutants like smog or other known health risks.

There will be a lot of legal — and scientific — give-and-take over whether that is true.

Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee signed a so-called “five-member letter” to the Justice Department demanding the “full and unredacted” files from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday.

Schumer said the letter will invoke a little-known law that forces the Justice Department to release the files, suggesting a potential legal battle if the administration ignores the request. Schumer said they are demanding an answer by Aug. 15.

“We are invoking federal law and using our authority as a check on the executive to compel transparency,” Schumer said at a news conference.

The Trump administration plans to announce a new initiative to encourage millions of Americans to upload their personal health data and medical records to apps and systems run by private tech companies.

Trump is set to make remarks on the initiative at an event dubbed “Making Health Technology Great Again” on Wednesday afternoon in the East Room.

The new system will focus on diabetes and weight management; conversational AI that helps patients; and digital tools, like QR codes and apps, that would register patients for check-ins or track medications.

Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have said patients would need to opt in to share their medical records and data, which will be kept secure. But experts caution there are a number of ethical and legal concerns, and digital privacy activists are skeptical that patients will be able to count on their data being stored securely.

The National Institutes of Health halted the funding to the private university in North Carolina, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Earlier this week, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Education Department sent a joint letter alleging racial preferences in Duke's hiring and admissions. Duke did not immediately comment.

The university is the latest institution to have its federal funding held up as the government investigates allegations of antisemitism and diversity, equity and inclusion policies the administration says are unlawful. It follows others including Harvard, Columbia, and Cornell.

At 1:30 p.m., Trump will sign a bill in the Roosevelt Room.

At 4 p.m., he will deliver remarks on Making Health Technology Great Again.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley says he was “offended” by Trump's social media post that called on him to end a longtime Senate practice that allows home state senators to approve or block some judicial nominees.

In a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump called on Grassley to have the “courage” to stop using the forms known as blue slips that are submitted to the home state senators, regardless of party. Trump said the custom is now allowing only Democrats or “a weak and ineffective Republican” to be successfully nominated.

“Chuck Grassley, who I got re-elected to the U.S. Senate when he was down, by a lot, in the Great State of Iowa, could solve the “Blue Slip” problem,” Trump posted.

Grassley defended the practice Wednesday morning, saying he was “offended by what the president said, and I'm disappointed that it would result in personal insults.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., also defended blue, noting Republicans used them during former President Joe Biden's tenure. “I don't sense any rush to change it,” Thune said.

About 6 in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of the way Trump is handling trade negotiations with other countries, according to an AP-NORC poll from July.

The new polling tracker shows response to Trump's moves on trade has been steady since March, shortly after he took office and began enacting tariffs on U.S. allies. The president's approval rating on trade negotiations is much more positive among Republicans. About 7 in 10 Republicans approve of his approach, compared with about 3 in 10 independents and roughly 1 in 10 Democrats. A recent AP polling analysis found that Trump's loyal supporters help explain why views of the president are so stable, even when he pursues policies that most Americans do not support.

“Everything depends on performance,” said Republican state Rep. Cody Vasut, chair of the Texas House's redistricting committee, on the new maps. “My understanding is that there is a path forward for a Republican to win five more of those seats.”

Vasut and other Republican lawmakers have spent the first few days of this special session fielding scathing criticism from Democrats who have questioned why new maps needed to be redrawn mid-decade. Hundreds of voters have testified at several Republican-led public hearings. Vasut had repeatedly denied the maps would harm Democratic voters.

Republicans, who hold commanding House and Senate majorities, are rushing to pass them in the 30-day session.

In New York, Democrats introduced a proposal this week to allow the state to redraw its congressional map ahead of schedule, like Texas is doing, but the process is convoluted. It would take years before new districts could emerge, underscoring the difficult spot Democrats are in ahead of next year's midterm elections.

To amend the state Constitution, it would have to pass the state Legislature twice in two years and then be approved in a voter referendum, meaning that the soonest New York could have new lines would be in 2028.

“We can't just sit there and watch,” said state Sen. Michael Gianaris, who is sponsoring the proposal. “This is not a battle that's going to be over in a year.”

Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which oversees GOP mapmaking, said the new map creates two new Black-majority seats — one in Dallas and the other in the Houston area — and one new majority Hispanic one. 

“If you go through it, you're going to see that a lot of the communities that were broken up in the previous map were put together in this one,” he said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, won four of the five new GOP-friendly seats in the 2022 election.

Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans hope the new Texas map will strengthen their chances of holding the U.S. House in 2026, and Trump officials have signaled their efforts may expand beyond the state, with similar pushes now underway in Missouri.

Asked by a Democratic lawmaker on Tuesday if all Texas districts would be withdrawn, Republican state Sen. Phil King said the GOP would be “trying to create more Republican districts to add support to the Republican majority in the U.S. Congress so that some of the really good policies that we've seen in the last seven months could continue and be furthered.”

Rep. Greg Casar says merging the 35th and 37th districts in Texas is an illegal gerrymander that will suppress Black and Latino votes.

“By merging our Central Texas districts, Trump wants to commit yet another crime — this time, against Texas voters and against Martin Luther King's Voting Rights Act of 1965,” his statement says.

“If Trump is allowed to rip the Voting Rights Act to shreds here in Central Texas, his ploy will spread like wildfire across the country. Everyone who cares about our democracy must mobilize against this illegal map.”

The Texas Republican introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of a technology known as ADS-B to broadcast their location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. It would require airlines to add more comprehensive ADS-B technology, and revoke an exemption for Department of Defense aircraft.

“There cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,” Cruz said. “We should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.”

NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades as “an immediate and substantial contribution to safety, especially during operations in and around airports.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he'd like to discuss “a few tweaks,” the legislation is “the right approach.”

The NTSB hearing opened Wednesday with a video animation showing the locations of the helicopter and airliner leading up to the collision. It showed how the helicopter flew above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit on the helicopter route before colliding with the plane.

Investigators said Wednesday that the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than what the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.

Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. 

The animation ended with surveillance video showing the helicopter colliding with the plane in a fiery crash.

Watch live as the National Transportation Safety Board begins three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January.

Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January have begun. The aim is to reveal new insights into what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.

The National Transportation Safety Board will question witnesses and investigators about how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and its air traffic controllers and the Army may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001.

The collision between the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport and a Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission was the first in an alarming string of crashes and near misses this year, even as statistics show flying remains the safest form of transportation.

Vance, who also serves as finance chairman for the Republican National Committee, headlined a fundraiser last week on Massachusetts' Nantucket island that raised $3 million.

Texas Republicans proposed a new U.S. House map Wednesday with more winnable GOP seats as Democrat-led states weigh counter measures.

Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats. The new map would raise the total they could win to 30 — all won by Trump in November by at least 10 percentage points — leading to conservative optimism they can hold them, even in what's likely to be a tough midterm environment for the party.

The new map would:

MASERU, Lesotho (AP) — The deafening roar of hundreds of sewing machines has gone silent. Spools of thread in every color are covered in dust. The warehouse is dark and empty.

In the tiny African nation of Lesotho, clothing manufacturer Tzicc's business has dried up in the face of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. A few months ago, work was steady. The factory's 1,300 employees have made and exported sportswear to American stores, including JCPenney, Walmart and Costco. 

But when Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, Lesotho found itself topping the list, with a rate of 50% — higher even than that of China, where the economy is 8,000 times larger. Officials here and economic experts said they were baffled. 




Since then, Trump backed off — temporarily. During a monthslong pause for trade talks, the U.S. has charged a baseline 10% tariff and announced new rates for dozens of countries starting Friday. Lesotho's rate will be set at Trump's whim, with aides suggesting that tariffs charged on goods from smaller African countries could top 10%. 

Many nations have received letters laying out a new tariff. With the pause set to expire Friday, Lesotho officials say they've not received one and they find themselves among the countries where Trump says officials simply don't have time for one-on-one negotiations. Leaders — and the 12,000 people employed by garment factories exporting to the U.S. market — are still waiting. 




The damage has already rippled through Lesotho's economy, where textile manufacturing comprises the largest private industry with more than 30,000 workers in 2024.

For Tzicc and its customers, the threat and apparent singling out of Lesotho were enough. Management decided to rush to deliver preexisting orders before tariffs resumed. But American buyers stopped placing new orders. With no work left, virtually all the factory's employees were sent home — potentially permanently. 

“Well, unfortunately, we finished,” factory compliance manager Rahila Omar said, pointing out the irony of the strategy as she walked among rows of silenced and covered machines. “That is why now we don't have any work.”

Omar is one of a handful of employees left in the eerily quiet factory. A few remain in the accounting department; others empty leftover stock to a warehouse elsewhere.

Officials and workers fear this may be a sign of what's to come for other factories in Lesotho, where poverty is widespread among the population of 2 million and most textile workers single-handedly support their families.

In March, a month before slapping Lesotho with the 50% tariff, Trump described it as a place “nobody has ever heard of,” struggling to pronounce the nation's name in a speech criticizing U.S. foreign aid. 

It's true Lesotho is a “very minuscule economy,” as its own trade minister, Mokhethi Shelile, described it.

But its relationship with Washington dates back decades. The U.S. was the first country to open an embassy in the capital, Maseru, after Lesotho declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The military received U.S. training, and hundreds of millions in U.S. funds were sent to Lesotho to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic via the now defunctUSAID office and the PEPFAR program.

As textiles grew to become Lesotho's main export, some 75% of its product went to the U.S. Lesotho became known as Africa's denim capital. If an American purchased jeans from a U.S. brand such as Wrangler or Levi's, they may have been “Made in Lesotho,” as tags still note.

Lesotho is known as the Kingdom in the Sky – it's the only country in the world where all its territory is more than 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level.

You can ski in Lesotho. It's one of just a few countries in Africa that receive regular snowfall in winter, and it has a ski resort.

Lesotho has vast water reserves in its highland dams and lakes, and it exports hundreds of millions of liters a year to larger neighbor South Africa.

Lesotho has a dinosaur named after it. The Lesothosaurus lived in the region in the Early Jurassic period around 200 million years ago.

According to a 2021 World Health Organization study, Lesotho had the highest suicide rate in the world.




In 2000, the U.S. signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, allowing Lesotho and other African nations to export goods to the U.S. duty free. 

Shelile said he was in the process of negotiating AGOA's September renewal when he was awakened in the middle of the night by texts from aides bearing news of the 50% U.S. tariffs. 

“No, this cannot be real,” Shelile remembers thinking. “What did we do to deserve this?”

According to the Trump administration, Lesotho charges a 99% tariff on U.S. goods. The government here said it doesn't know how the U.S. calculated that.

In theory, the tariff decision was based on trade deficit: Lesotho's exports to the U.S. were around $240 million last year — mainly clothing and diamonds — and imports from the U.S. were only $2.8 million. But in practice, the math is more complicated than that. And in reality, Lesotho simply cannot afford to import more U.S. products. Nearly half the population lives below the poverty line. 

“The trade deficit that exists between Lesotho and the U.S. is a natural trade deficit that can happen when you have these types of disparities between two economies,” Shelile said. “It cannot be breached and certainly cannot be breached by imposing tariffs.”

Last year, Lesotho's overall unemployment rate was about 30%, national data shows. For those 35 and younger, it was nearly 50%. 

The threat of tariffs has exacerbated the national unemployment troubles, prompting the government to declare a state of disaster this month. 

“No matter how we slice it, we've already had a lot of losses,” Shelile said. “People have lost quite a lot money. And to claw back and come back to where we were before this is going to take time.”

Most of the 12,000 people hired by Lesotho's 11 factories exporting to the U.S. are women with children to feed and school fees to pay. 

Of those, 9,000 jobs are directly in the line of fire and an additional 40,000 will suffer indirectly from the U.S.-imposed tariffs, Shelile said. 

“We're talking people in real estate that are leasing some rooms,” he said. “We're talking people in transport, whether it's long-distance haulage to the port, or it is a taxi driver taking people to work in the morning. They are going be affected.” 

Mapontso Mathunya used to work on Tzicc's cutting room floor and is now unemployed. Her husband also is out of a steady job. With two young children, Mathunya was the family's breadwinner. She now tries to sell snacks and cigarettes on the street but finds it a daily struggle to bring home even a few cents. 

“Our financial burden has been heavy,” she said. “Things are bad.”

The future of the Tzicc factory depends on what happens Friday, compliance manager Omar said.

Owned by a Taiwanese national, the factory has been open since mid-1999. In a peak month, it made up to 1.5 million pieces of clothing for JCPenney. 

Key U.S. customers for Tzicc — JCPenney, Walmart and Costco — did not reply to AP to comment. 

Pivoting to the neighboring South African market, one of the solutions proposed by the trade minister and industry consultants, wouldn't be enough to even cover the employees' payroll, Omar said.

And even if American buyers return, it's unlikely the factory could rehire all its 1,300 workers, she added. 

Today, just a few blocks away, former employees try their luck looking for work at other factories that are still operating. Most are turned away. 

“Life is difficult,” former worker Mathunya said. “There is nothing, nothing at all. People don't have money.”

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is hearing oral arguments in a major legal challenge to President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.

A federal appeals court on Thursday will hear arguments over the legality of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan, a high-stakes court fight that comes just hours before Trump's import duties and so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs are slated to take force.

At issue before the Washington-based Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Trump's attempt to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a 1977 emergency law — to enact the steep import fees, and impose additional tariffs on certain trading partners. 

Thursday's hearing comes less than 24 hours before Trump's tariffs are slated to take force. Both sides have signaled they plan to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, if necessary. 

On April 2, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, along with higher, reciprocal tariffs targeting select nations — including China. He said the measures would address trade imbalances, reduce deficits with key trading partners and boost domestic manufacturing and production.

TARIFF FIGHT ESCALATES AS TRUMP APPEALS SECOND COURT LOSS

However, whether emergency tariffs are the appropriate vehicle to accomplish this is an open question and one central to Thursday's oral arguments before the appeals court.

Plaintiffs in V.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump will argue on Thursday that the looming tariffs have already introduced confusion and volatility into markets, threatening the bottom lines of small U.S. businesses and making it extremely difficult for owners to operate under shifting guidance that seems to change on a whim. 

Small businesses in the U.S. have been hit with months of ""complete uncertainty,"" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, one of the groups representing small businesses in court, said in an interview Wednesday.

""That's largely due to the fact that the president asserts the power to impose tariffs on any country he wants, for any reason — and at any rate he wants, at any time he wants,"" Schwab said. 

""So there's no certainty on what the rate is going to be from one week to the next, and that's very difficult to do business with, when things are constantly changing.""

Judges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Trade voted unanimously to block Trump's tariffs from taking force earlier this year, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have ""unbounded authority"" to impose tariffs under the emergency law. 

That ruling was later paused by the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which agreed to consider the administration's request for relief. 

Ahead of Thursday's oral arguments, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed they would continue to defend the president's trade agenda in court.

""This morning, [Justice Department] attorneys are going to court to defend President Trump's tariffs — which are transforming the global economy, protecting our national security, and addressing the consequences of our exploding trade deficit,"" she said. ""We will continue to defend the president.""

Others argue that the tariffs are more a negotiating tool designed to bring trading partners to the table to negotiate new deals. 

JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA

Despite trade adviser Peter Navarro's pledge to strike ""90 trade agreements in 90 days,"" and Trump's assertion to Time magazine that they had struck ""over 200 deals"" this year, the Trump administration has in fact inked just eight such agreements over the last 120 days.

The agreements announced by the U.S. include deals with the European Union's 27-member bloc, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and others. 

The U.S. and China, which threatened each other with escalating reciprocal tariffs that climbed as high as 145%, agreed at a meeting in Geneva in May to lower tariffs through at least mid-August. Talks for a longer-term deal are ongoing.

Some Trump supporters have argued the tariffs are merely a negotiating tactic to get foreign governments to the table — though the administration has repeatedly vowed to use ""all tools"" at their disposal to advance 

They argued in a court filing that the IEEPA is the law that Congress passed in 1977 to allow the president to respond to ""unusual and extraordinary threats"" and in cases where a national emergency has already been declared. 

However, plaintiffs argue that Trump's use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration's own admission, the deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, undermining the claim of an ""unusual and extraordinary"" emergency.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will likely move on the case quickly, with a decision expected in August. No matter the outcome, both sides have vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court, if necessary.

In the interim, economists noted there could be real harm the longer the court process takes.

Schwab, the lawyer helping represent plaintiffs in court Thursday, said small business owners could see ""potentially irreparable harm"" as a result of court inaction. Already, he said Wednesday, his clients are reporting real harm. 

""Some of the harm has already taken place,"" Schwab said in an earlier interview. ""And the longer it goes on, the worse it is.""

Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the 'Gutfeld!' panel discuss a man trying to use an A.I. lawyer in court.

Two U.S. judges in separate federal courts scrapped their rulings last week after lawyers alerted them to filings that contained inaccurate case details or seemingly ""hallucinated"" quotes that misquoted cited cases — the latest in a string of errors that suggest the growing use of artificial intelligence in legal research and submissions.

In New Jersey, U.S. District Judge Julien Neals withdrew his denial of a motion to dismiss a securities fraud case after lawyers revealed the decision relied on filings with ""pervasive and material inaccuracies.""

The filing pointed to ""numerous instances"" of made-up quotes submitted by attorneys, as well as three separate instances when the outcome of lawsuits appeared to have been mistaken, prompting Neals to withdraw his decision.

In Mississippi, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate replaced his original July 20 temporary restraining order that paused enforcement of a state law blocking diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools after lawyers notified the judge of serious errors submitted by the attorney. 

They informed the court that the decision ""relie[d] upon the purported declaration testimony of four individuals whose declarations do not appear in the record for this case."" 

Wingate subsequently issued a new ruling, though lawyers for the state have asked his original order to be placed back on the docket. 

""All parties are entitled to a complete and accurate record of all papers filed and orders entered in this action, for the benefit of the Fifth Circuit's appellate review,"" the state attorney general said in a filing. 

A person familiar with Wingate's temporary order in Mississippi confirmed to Fox News Digital that the erroneous filing submitted to the court had used AI, adding that they had ""never seen anything like this"" in court before.

Neither the judges' office nor the lawyers in question immediately responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on the retracted New Jersey order, first reported by Reuters. It was not immediately clear if AI was the reason for that erroneous court submission in that case.

However, the errors in both cases — which were quickly flagged by attorneys, and prompted the judges to take action to revise or redact their orders — come as the use of generative AI continues to skyrocket in almost every profession, especially among younger workers. 

In at least one of the cases, the errors bear similarities to AI-style inaccuracies, which include the use of ""ghost"" or ""hallucinated"" quotes being used in filings, citing incorrect or even nonexistent cases.

For bar-admitted attorneys, these erroneous court submissions are not taken lightly. Lawyers are responsible for the veracity of all information included in court filings, including if it includes AI-generated materials, according to guidance from the American Bar Association.

In May, a federal judge in California slapped law firms with $31,000 in sanctions for using AI in court filings, saying at the time that ""no reasonably competent attorney should out-source research and writing to this technology — particularly without any attempt to verify the accuracy of that material.""

Last week, a federal judge in Alabama sanctioned three attorneys for submitting erroneous court filings that were later revealed to have been generated by ChatGPT.

Among other things, the filings in question included the use of the AI-generated quote ""hallucinations,"" U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco said in her order, which also referred the lawyers in question to the state bar for further disciplinary proceedings.

""Fabricating legal authority is serious misconduct that demands a serious sanction,"" she said in the filing.

According to a June survey, roughly 34% of U.S. adults say they have used ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot — roughly double the percentage of users who said the same at the same point two years ago, in 2023. 

The share of employed adults who use ChatGPT for work has spiked by a whopping 20 percentage points since June 2023; and among adults under 30, adoption is even more widespread, with a 58% majority saying they have used the chatbot.

Todd Lyons, the acting I.C.E. director, discusses encounters at the southern border under the Trump administration and assaults on federal immigration officers on 'The Big Weekend Show.'

A House Democrat is moving to block the Trump administration from being able to use military-grade drones to surveil protests in the U.S.

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., introduced the bill in response to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly using MQ-9 Reaper drones to monitor the protests in Los Angeles earlier this year.

""The U.S. government should never use military drones to spy on its own people. Not under Trump. Not under anyone,"" Gomez told Fox News Digital in a statement. 

""This bill would stop Trump's abuse of power and get these combat drones out of our neighborhoods.""

The White House said it would not get ahead of President Donald Trump on pending legislation. Fox News Digital also reached out to DHS for comment.

Protests, some of which turned into violent riots, rocked Los Angeles for several days last month.

They began as demonstrations against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) implementing Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants in predominantly Hispanic or Latino neighborhoods in the Southern California city.

Images of cars burning and protesters clashing with police soon went viral across the country, with both Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for escalating tensions.

Like other Democrats at the time, Gomez criticized Trump for sending the National Guard into Los Angeles to take control of the situation, despite objections from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

""What Trump is doing in LA is a dangerous abuse of power. It escalates tensions, puts lives at risk, and violates our constitutional values. We're united — not just as Californians, but as Americans — because if it can happen in LA today, it can happen anywhere in the country,"" Gomez wrote on X at the time.

His district includes significant portions of Los Angeles and is situated entirely inside Los Angeles County.

It's not likely the Republican-controlled House will take up his new bill, which has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

FOX Business host Charles Payne analyzes how President Donald Trump's trade deal with the European Union will directly impact Americans on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

In June, the United States collected $27 billion dollars in tariff revenue on goods imported into the country. That number is expected to increase this month —we will know for sure in a few days. Hold on to those numbers for a bit while considering the context in which they appear. 

President Donald Trump ran and won in November, 2024 on a straightforward platform: Close the southern border. Prioritize the deportation of illegal migrants that are criminals or national security threats. Expand and extend the tax cuts that he initially pushed through in 2017 with the help of GOP majorities in the House and the Senate. Rollback the regulatory burden on American businesses. Rebuild the nation's defenses through much higher defense spending. Protect girls' and women's sports. End the era of ""woke"" by crushing ""DEI"" and ""CRT."" 

President Trump also repeatedly stated from the time he came down the escalator in 2015 that Iran would not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons. His support for Israel has been greater than any previous president. 

LIZ PEEK: TRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY

Trump delivered on all of these promises already. In six months. It's a stunning and unprecedented record of achievements and of promises made and kept by a presidential candidate early in his term.

President Trump also ran on upending the international trading system through the imposition of tariffs on almost every country doing business with the U.S. Skeptics of this set of claims were everywhere. 

The numbers:

June's tariff receipts in the U.S. set a monthly record of $27 billion. 

July's number is expected to increase. 

""[W]e could expect that that could be well over $300 billion by the end of the year,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared earlier in July. (By contrast, total tariff revenue for the U.S. was $77 billion in calendar year 2024.) Bessent added that he estimates tariff revenue to the Treasury to top ""2.8 trillion over 10 years,"" ""which we think is probably low.""

In January, the federal treasury collected approximately $8 billion in tariffs.  That number had more than doubled by April to $16.3 billion. The president has since concluded new tariff and trade deals with the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam and —this week— the European Union. Negotiations with China are ongoing and more deals with more counties are expected as Trump's team on tariff negotiations ranges across the world accomplishing much, much more than most people thought could be accomplished this quickly. 

A decade ago the U.S. collected $35 billion in tariffs annually. That's quite a contrast: $35 billion into the U.S. treasury from tariffs in 2015; $300 billion estimated in 2025.

President Trump made no secret about his intentions on trade. As with all the other campaign promises, he has delivered and indeed redone the vast global trading system. Thus far it has been all gain and very little pain as far as consumers and voters are concerned. Stock markets have soared in the same period with a big dip when the president announced the outlines of his ambitious trade agenda, a dip that was erased as new highs were recorded.

Now the question is: Will the skeptics of Trump's trade policies at least consider that they were wrong?

Like most commentators, trade and tariffs have rarely been a topic for me. I began work in government in President Reagan's administration and since then the GOP has been a ""free trade"" party. Almost every Reaganaut called themselves a devotee of ""the Chicago school"" of economics even if they were not economists. This meant, in a general way, low taxes and low-to-non-existent tariffs, and a belief in free trade around the globe via open oceans patrolled primarily by the United States Navy with help from its allies. This post-World War II international trading system was built on ""GATT."" 

""GATT"" stands for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It was a multilateral agreement established in 1947 to promote international trade by reducing or eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers between participating countries. There were eight ""rounds"" of GATT negotiations between 1947 and 1994, and they culminated in the creation of the World Trade Organization which came into being on January 1, 1995. In the 30 years since then, the ""WTO"" has set the rules and resolved the disputes among international trading partners. 

At home, the Constitution vested the power over tariffs in the Congress, but much of that power has been delegated to the president and his officials via Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Sections 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Some critics of President Trump's big declarations and decisions on tariffs have questioned whether he has enough power under these delegations to so thoroughly transform the rules of international trade.

Suits have been filed and it will be a question of first impression for the Supreme Court if it gets there. We don't know what tariffs will eventually come before the Court if it even agrees to take up the matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments today in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. This is the lead case testing the president's powers under IEEPA. 

All of the countries above that have concluded new agreements with Team Trump seem to accept President Trump's authority, but the case bears watching. 

In the meantime, what are the free traders doing?

Many are issuing dire warnings about the future impacts on consumer prices and overall economic growth. Those fears have not been realized yet. In fact, GDP in Q2 of this year —the first full quarter of Trump's second term— grew an unexpectedly robust 3.0 percent, according to the advance estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Which should mean that critics ought to at least suspend judgment for awhile and perhaps reconsider their absolute commitments to ""free trade,"" allowing for the possibility that while America willingly subsidized the world trading order for 80 years after World War II, it also possesses the power of the world's largest economy and market and can indeed set new rules. 

My perspective has changed to one of cautious approval of what President Trump is trying while remaining open to urging reversal if it doesn't work. My evolving POV is that the U.S. has shouldered the cost of defending the freedom of the seas for eight decades and that this expensive burden will only grow in the years ahead. Tariff revenue can be seen as the trading nations of the world's contribution to the cost of the American military. 

To be specific: The ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" included a much-needed surge of $158 billion in defense spending, much of which is going to the Navy and shipbuilding and repair capacity expansion. Bravo.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

The $300 billion in tariff revenue expected this year will more than cover the increase in defense spending. Bravo again. 

""Free trade"" depends on freedom of navigation of the world's oceans and ultimately on America's military. Perhaps the skeptics of the president's tariff program should begin to at least consider that the era of ""free riders"" on the backs of the United States Navy (and broader military) is over and after 80 years of subsidizing the international trading order via our defense budget, it's time for trading nations to pay a share of that cost.

Protesters deliver a cardboard coffin prop with epitaph to the private home of House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis. (Credit: Source from Janesville, Wis., via Rep. Steil's office)

FIRST ON FOX: More than two dozen protesters were captured on video last week delivering a faux coffin and flowers to the Wisconsin home of House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis.

The unwanted visitors, dressed in black and carrying cowbells, walked up the congressman's private driveway in what appeared to be a mock funeral procession, before dropping a cardboard coffin prop with an epitaph at his front door.

Former Walworth County Democrat Party Chairwoman Ellen Holly was identified in the video footage posted to social media allegedly walking up to Steil's front door, along with several other constituents from previous protests.

AFTER MINNESOTA KILLINGS, CAPITOL HILL REPRESENTATIVES FACE STARK REALITY ABOUT FAMILY SAFETY

Prior to the ""Death of Democracy"" funeral procession, sponsored by the Southern Wisconsin Grassroots Network and Working Families Party, an organizer could be heard on a Facebook Live video saying, ""We're not going to hang out here because we're not going to invite the police to come and ask questions, and say, 'What are you doing here, blah, blah, blah.' We're just going to get out of town.""

Following the demonstration, protesters could be seen walking across Steil's front yard, forgoing the sidewalk, and commenting on photo opportunities in front of the home.

A photo of the coffin and epitaph at the front door was later posted to Facebook by another group involved. One commentator asked for the lawmaker's home address.

This incident has been reported to U.S. Capitol Police (USCP). It is unclear if any of the protesters are facing criminal charges.

""It's disappointing that Democrat leadership and the radical left resort to these type of tactics,"" Steil told Fox News Digital. ""I remain committed to my work to get this country back on track and will not be deterred by their threats.""

Ravi Mangla, National Press Secretary for Working Families Power, told Fox News Digital the incident was less concerning than Steil's policies.

""17 million Americans are going to lose life-saving medical care because of Bryan Steil's vote,"" Mangla wrote in a statement. ""Frankly, that's a far scarier thing than a group of seniors holding some taped together cardboard.""

Congressional offices have seen a 93.8% increase in threats reported to USCP compared to last year.

Steil oversees the Committee on House Administration, which has been working with leadership on both sides of the aisle to address increased threats to congressional members and their staff. 

Due to an increase in threats, Congress recently authorized an increase in funding for the Member Security Allotment, from $10,000 to $20,000 for life, and an increase in the Monitoring and Maintenance Allotment from $150 to $5,000 per month for fiscal year 2025.

More than seven months into President Donald Trump's second term, his administration has yet to see a single United States attorney nominee confirmed by the Senate.

Of the 94 districts that require a top federal prosecutor, only a dozen nominees have cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, and none have reached the floor for a vote. Faced with this confirmation logjam, the Trump administration has increasingly leaned on interim and acting appointments allowed by federal law.

With Democratic senators blocking nominees via the century-old blue slip tradition, which involves consulting with home-state senators over who to nominate, and with some courts reluctant to extend interim terms, the Justice Department is keeping its candidates in place through tools such as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

“We're not in a time where senators all get along and work together. Washington is broken,” David Gelman, a defense attorney practicing in New Jersey federal courts, told the Washington Examiner.

“The president has a mandate, and that means getting his people in place to do the job,” he added.

The stalemate largely stems from the blue slip process, which has empowered senators to block prosecutors' confirmations in their home states. States with two Democratic senators have refused to return slips for nominees such as Alina Habba to the U.S. District of New Jersey and Bill Essayli to the Central District of California, effectively freezing nominations.

Trump repeatedly called on Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) this week to end the tradition, calling it outdated and undemocratic. Grassley, a key ally of Trump in the Senate, indicated his support for efforts to cancel the Senate's August recess to clear the backlog but pushed back on Trump's urgency to end the blue slip tradition.

Gelman backed Trump's position, saying the president's view “is exactly right” given that senators such as Cory Booker and Andy Kim won't support Habba, “no matter her qualifications.”

He bluntly added: “That's not a reason to deny a president's choice, it's just obstruction.”

In New Jersey, after Habba's 120-day term expired and judges selected Desiree Grace last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi removed Grace and reinstalled Habba as acting U.S. attorney under the Vacancies Act.

Analogous moves occurred in New York, where John A. Sarcone III continued in office, and in California, where Essayli's interim term was converted into acting status.

Now, in Nevada, a parallel scenario is unfolding. 

On Tuesday, the DOJ extended Republican National Committeewoman Sigal Chattah's interim term and designated her as acting U.S. Attorney to preempt the federal court from appointing someone else after her 120 days expired. More than 100 retired judges opposed her permanent appointment due to inflammatory political rhetoric.

In each of these cases, the DOJ has justified the maneuver as necessary to prevent court encroachment on executive appointment powers. The law permits the attorney general to make such extensions under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, provided the nominee is eligible and a formal nomination is submitted within a set time frame.

Temporary acting appointments under the Vacancies Reform Act carry a 300-day limit from Inauguration Day, after which Trump must have submitted a nomination or lose that authority.

However, legal fellow Thomas Berry told the Washington Examiner that a workaround exists, noting that administrations can subdelegate official duties to the same individual even after the time limit ends.

“They subdelegate all the powers of the office to the officer,” he said, calling it “the single biggest loophole … because there's no teeth.”

University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell supported this interpretation in a recent Volokh Conspiracy op-ed, writing, “it seems that Congress left the door open for successive appointments of an interim U.S. Attorney, even appointments of the same person.”

Cassell emphasized that courts have traditionally allowed the executive branch to retain continuity during political gridlock, and Habba's and Chattah's extensions fall within those guardrails.

Defense attorneys have filed motions in New Jersey challenging Habba's legitimacy, arguing that the courts' refusal to reappoint her nullifies her authority.

But Gelman dismissed this as a “cheap tactic,” noting Habba doesn't prosecute the cases directly, and other attorneys and out-of-district judges oversee most to prevent conflict.

Berry added that while the legal theory may seem novel, courts are unlikely to entertain it, saying, “I just don't think either of those arguments are really likely to win.”

Although some Trump supporters suggest using recess appointments, Berry said that route is blocked under current Senate procedures, citing the Noel Canning precedent.

“The Senate always gavels in and gavels out for a pro forma session every three days … and it doesn't look like they're going to budge on that,” he explained.

Gelman agreed that it may become the only route if Senate gridlock continues. “If Congress is stifling the president's agenda,” he said, “I don't know what other choice he's going to have.”

Other Senate Republicans beyond Grassley warn that dismantling norms like blue slip deference or expanding subdelegation risks institutional harm later. 

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) cautioned that these trends “could be problematic for future Judiciary Committees.”

Still, other Trump allies, such as Gelman, emphasize practical necessity. 

“You've got 90-something openings, and he's appointed them. Let them do the job, ” Gelman argued. “If we take care of the present, the future will look very good.”

Still, due to the sheer number of loopholes under the Vacancy Reform Act, a less drastic measure could be to wait until mid-November, when the president can allow his acting appointees to become subdelegated 300 days after inauguration.

Berry said anyone who has yet to be confirmed by that deadline could find that “all their website titles will change overnight from ‘acting officer' to ‘performing the functions and duties of the office,' because what they do is a workaround. There's no meaningful restrictions on subdelegation.”

GRASSLEY DISMISSES TRUMP'S ‘PERSONAL INSULTS' OVER SENATE BLUE SLIPS

While the loophole Berry mentioned may ease some of the stakes for Trump cementing his nominees, his latest piece for the Cato Institute lamented the gaps in the statute that allow presidents to run out the clock.

“Presidents will continue to use it as a convenient replacement for the Senate confirmation process that the Framers designed,” Berry wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Democrats are so singularly focused on abortion that the party is now arguing that the First Amendment dictates that Planned Parenthood must be given taxpayer funding.

Democratic attorneys general from 23 states are suing the Trump administration over defunding Planned Parenthood, emboldened by a liberal activist judge who has ordered that funding continue. California Attorney General and candidate for governor Rob Bonta characterized it as follows: “We need to just call it what it is: punishment for Planned Parenthood's constitutionally protected advocacy for abortion. The hypocrisy is really hard to ignore: a party that claims to be defenders of free speech only seem to care about it when it aligns with their own agenda.”

To be clear on what actually happened, Congress voted to defund Planned Parenthood for one measly year. This is a rare example of Congress doing its job rather than relying on the president to usurp its powers through an executive order because passing laws is too difficult. Congress exercised its constitutional powers to decide to stop funding Planned Parenthood (for just a single year), passed a law, and sent it to Trump's desk for a signature.

What Democrats are arguing is that this violates the First Amendment, because the Republicans who control Congress defunded Planned Parenthood because it is an unofficial Democratic campaign organ. The abortion mill funnels tens of millions of dollars to Democratic campaigns and causes. As Bonta argued, Democrats view this as retaliation against Planned Parenthood.

JUDGE BLOCKS PLANNED PARENTHOOD DEFUNDING PROVISION OF ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT

This argument is deranged, an attack on the very fabric that holds our political system together. If Democrats have their way, they can funnel funds to any and all left-wing organizations they want, but Republicans removing those funds even temporarily would be “retaliating” against the speech of those left-wing groups and therefore be blocked from doing so. The argument posits that there is no legitimate way that a Republican-run Congress could cut funding for any group, and that only a Democratic majority in Congress would be able to exercise the branch's power of the purse.

Planned Parenthood does not have a First Amendment right to taxpayer funding. It is not a First Amendment violation for a Republican-run Congress to choose not to fund an abortion mill. Democrats again want to light the Constitution on fire so that they can get everything they want and prevent Republicans from ever legitimately exercising any form of power. Once again, the “threat to democracy” is coming from the Democratic Party itself.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A majority of Senate Democrats voted to restrict military aid to Israel in a legislative push that was overwhelmingly defeated on Wednesday night.

In a 27-70 vote, the Senate rejected a resolution of disapproval from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) that would have blocked the sale of assault rifles to the Israeli government, which has faced growing criticism over reports of starvation in Gaza. Twenty-seven Democrats supported the resolution, marking a dramatic shift in party support as generally pro-Israel senators joined with the left wing of the caucus.

A second resolution blocking an estimated $676 million in bombs and related military assistance failed in a 24-73 vote.

The resolutions reflect a legislative turning point for Senate Democrats as the war in Gaza nears 22 months. The votes were to discharge the resolutions from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but they effectively served as a test of support for the Israeli government.

19 Democratic-caucusing senators voted for a similar measure in November and 15 did the same in April, making Wednesday's vote a sign of eroding confidence.

Notably, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the top Foreign Relations Democrat, voted for the resolutions, citing the humanitarian crisis in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denies there is starvation in Gaza as images emerge of emaciated Palestinians.

“I will continue to stand up for the existence of Israel and the safety of its citizens. I will also continue to support Israel's right to defend itself,” Shaheen said in a statement. “But I cannot in good conscience vote in support of weapons until the human anguish in Gaza comes to an end. That is why I support these resolutions.”

Other Democratic “yes” votes include Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the No. 3 Senate Democrat.

Three Democrats who supported the first resolution opposed the second: Sens. Reed, Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Jon Ossoff (D-GA). Ossoff, who is running for reelection in purple Georgia, quickly faced GOP criticism for the vote.

On the Republican side, lawmakers have expressed concern over the flow of food into Gaza, which has been a war zone since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, but none joined the Democratic protest vote.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump has made several recent decisions that have polarized voters. These include his tariff-heavy trade strategy and his handling of both the Ukraine war negotiations and the Israel-Iran conflict. This week, however, Trump spared some time for a concern that should unite most Americans.

Wind turbines.

One of Trump's Day One executive orders struck a blow to the heavily subsidized wind energy industry, halting the construction of new offshore and onshore wind turbines in federal waters and on public lands. It also ordered a review of existing leases. The Trump administration removed wind energy from the list of “critical” resources and is phasing out the tax credits that fund new wind and solar projects by 2027. Now, Trump is using the bully pulpit to get his message across: “We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They're killing us. They're killing the beauty of our scenery … It's the most expensive form of energy. It's no good,” Trump said in Scotland on Sunday.

The main problem with wind power is its inefficiency. Despite record investments in wind and solar power under the Biden administration and decades of propaganda demonizing the fossil fuel industry, wind and solar make up less than 17% of domestic energy production in 2024. The Trump administration is correct that wind and solar are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of the emerging artificial intelligence industry and the increasing demand for electric vehicles. Goldman Sachs projects a 165% increase in energy demand for AI data centers by 2030, and BloombergNEF projects that the demand from data centers will reach nearly 9% of all domestic energy consumption by 2035, up from roughly 3.5%.  

The Trump administration understands that a better path forward is needed on energy production. A series of May executive orders is primed to expand America's nuclear energy production. According to most experts, nuclear power is the only energy source capable of supporting the nation's fast-growing AI and EV industries. “Nuclear power plants are 93% reliable throughout the year, produce near-zero emissions, and only occupy small tracts of lands compared to utility-scale solar and wind. Dispatchable, reliable baseload power like nuclear energy is required to meet rising electricity demand and to help lower energy prices,” notes Gabriella Hoffman of Independent Women's Forum.

ISRAEL HAS ONLY BAD OPTIONS IN GAZA

The path forward is clear: ditch the near-useless renewables and build more nuclear reactors. 

The Trump administration has hit the nail on the head on one of the most important problems facing our country over the coming decades.

America's run as the premiere techno-superpower may be over.

Roald Sagdeev has already watched one scientific empire rot from the inside. When Sagdeev began his career, in 1955, science in the Soviet Union was nearing its apex. At the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, he studied the thermonuclear reactions that occur inside of stars. A few lab tables away, Andrei Sakharov was developing the hydrogen bomb. The Soviet space program would soon astonish the world by lofting the first satellite, and then the first human being, into orbit. Sagdeev can still remember the screaming crowds that greeted returning cosmonauts in Red Square. But even during those years of triumph, he could see corruption working its way through Soviet science like a slow-moving poison.

The danger had been present from the U.S.S.R.'s founding. The Bolsheviks who took power in 1917 wanted scientists sent to Arctic labor camps. (Vladimir Lenin intervened on their behalf.) When Joseph Stalin took power, he funded some research generously, but insisted that it conform to his ideology. Sagdeev said that his school books described Stalin as the father of all fields of knowledge, and credited the Soviets with every technological invention that had ever been invented. Later, at scientific conferences, Sagdeev heard physicists criticize the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics on the grounds that it conflicted with Marxism.

By 1973, when Sagdeev was made director of the Soviet Space Research Institute, the nation's top center for space science, the Soviets had ceded leadership in orbit to NASA. American astronauts had flown around the moon and left a thousand bootprints on its surface. Sagdeev's institute was short on money. Many people who worked there had the right Communist Party connections, but no scientific training. Eventually, he himself had to join the party. “It was the only way to secure stable funding,” he told me when we spoke in June.

In 1985, Sagdeev briefly gained the ear of power. Mikhail Gorbachev had just become general secretary at 54, young for the Soviet gerontocracy. He promised broad reforms and appointed Sagdeev as an adviser. The two traveled to Geneva together for Gorbachev's first arms talks with Ronald Reagan. But Sagdeev's view of Gorbachev began to dim when the premier filled important scientific positions with men whom Sagdeev saw as cronies.

In 1988, Sagdeev wrote a letter to Gorbachev to warn him that the leaders of the Soviet supercomputer program had deceived him. They claimed to be keeping pace with the United States, but had in fact fallen far behind, and would soon be surpassed by the Chinese. Gorbachev never replied. Sagdeev got a hint as to how his letter had been received when his invitation to join a state visit to Poland was abruptly withdrawn. “I was excommunicated,” he told me.

Sagdeev took stock of his situation. The future of Soviet science was looking grim. Within a few years, government funding would crater further. Sagdeev's most talented colleagues were starting to slip out of the country. One by one, he watched them start new lives elsewhere. Many of them went to the U.S. At the time, America was the most compelling destination for scientific talent in the world. It would remain so until earlier this year.

I thought of Sagdeev on a recent visit to MIT. A scientist there, much celebrated in her field, told me that since Donald Trump's second inauguration she has watched in horror as his administration has performed a controlled demolition on American science. Like many other researchers in the U.S., she's not sure that she wants to stick around to dodge falling debris, and so she is starting to think about taking her lab abroad. (She declined to be named in this story so that she could speak openly about her potential plans.)

The very best scientists are like elite basketball players: They come to America from all over the world so that they can spend their prime years working alongside top talent. “It's very hard to find a leading scientist who has not done at least some research in the U.S. as an undergraduate or graduate student or postdoc or faculty,” Michael Gordin, a historian of science and the dean of Princeton University's undergraduate academics, told me. That may no longer be the case a generation from now.

Foreign researchers have recently been made to feel unwelcome in the U.S. They have been surveilled and harassed. The Trump administration has made it more difficult for research institutions to enroll them. Top universities have been placed under federal investigation. Their accreditation and tax-exempt status have been threatened. The Trump administration has proposed severe budget cuts at the agencies that fund American science—the NSF, the NIH, and NASA, among others—and laid off staffers in large numbers. Existing research grants have been canceled or suspended en masse. Committees of expert scientists that once advised the government have been disbanded. In May, the president ordered that all federally funded research meet higher standards for rigor and reproducibility—or else be subject to correction by political appointees.

Not since the Red Scare, when researchers at the University of California had to sign loyalty oaths, and those at the University of Washington and MIT were disciplined or fired for being suspected Communists, has American science been so beholden to political ideology. At least during the McCarthy era, scientists could console themselves that despite this interference, federal spending on science was surging. Today, it's drying up.

Three-fourths of American scientists who responded to a recent poll by the journal Nature said they are considering leaving the country. They don't lack for suitors. China is aggressively recruiting them, and the European Union has set aside a €500 million slush fund to do the same. National governments in Norway, Denmark, and France—nice places to live, all—have green-lighted spending sprees on disillusioned American scientists. The Max Planck Society, Germany's elite research organization, recently launched a poaching campaign in the U.S., and last month, France's Aix-Marseille University held a press conference announcing the arrival of eight American “science refugees.”

The MIT scientist who is thinking about leaving the U.S. told me that the Swiss scientific powerhouse ETH Zurich had already reached out about relocating her lab to its picturesque campus with a view of the Alps. A top Canadian university had also been in touch. These institutions are salivating over American talent, and so are others. Not since Sagdeev and other elite Soviet researchers were looking to get out of Moscow has there been a mass-recruiting opportunity like this.

Every scientific empire falls, but not at the same speed, or for the same reasons. In ancient Sumer, a proto-scientific civilization bloomed in the great cities of Ur and Uruk. Sumerians invented wheels that carried the king's war chariots swiftly across the Mesopotamian plains. Their priest astronomers stood atop ziggurats watching the sky. But the Sumerians appear to have over-irrigated their farmland—a technical misstep, perhaps—and afterwards, their weakened cities were invaded, and the kingdom broke apart. They could no longer operate at the scientific vanguard.

Science in ancient Egypt and Greece followed a similar pattern: It thrived during good times and fell off in periods of plague, chaos, and impoverishment. But not every case of scientific decline has played out this way. Some civilizations have willfully squandered their scientific advantage.

Spanish science, for example, suffered grievously during the Inquisition. Scientists feared for their lives. They retreated from pursuits and associations that had a secular tinge and thought twice before corresponding with suspected heretics. The exchange of ideas slowed in Spain, and its research excellence declined relative to the rest of Europe. In the 17th century, the Spanish made almost no contribution to the ongoing Scientific Revolution.

The Soviets sabotaged their own success in biomedicine. In the 1920s, the U.S.S.R. had one of the most advanced genetics programs in the world, but that was before Stalin empowered Trofim Lysenko, a political appointee who didn't believe in Mendelian inheritance. Lysenko would eventually purge thousands of apostate biologists from their jobs, and ban the study of genetics outright. Some of the scientists were tossed into the Gulag; others starved or faced firing squads. As a consequence of all this, the Soviets played no role in the discovery of DNA's double-helix structure. When the ban on “anti-Marxist” genetics was finally lifted, Gordin told me, the U.S.S.R. was a generation behind in molecular biology and couldn't catch up.

But it was Adolf Hitler who possessed the greatest talent for scientific self-harm. Germany had been a great scientific power going back to the late 19th century. Germans had pioneered the modern research university by requiring that professors not only transmit knowledge but advance it, too. During the early 20th century, German scientists racked up Nobel Prizes. Physicists from greater Europe and the U.S. converged on Berlin, Göttingen, and Munich to hear about the strange new quantum universe from Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, and Albert Einstein.

When the Nazis took over in 1933, Hitler purged Germany's universities of Jewish professors and others who opposed his rule. Many scientists were murdered. Others fled the country. Quite a few settled in America. That's how Einstein got to Princeton. After Hans Bethe was dismissed from his professorship in Tübingen, he landed at Cornell. Then he went to MIT to work on the radar technology that would reveal German U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. Some historians have argued that radar was more important to Allied victory than the Manhattan Project. But of course, that, too, was staffed with European scientific refugees, including Leo Szilard, a Jewish physicist who fled Berlin the year that Hitler took power; Edward Teller, who went on to build the first hydrogen bomb; and John von Neumann, who invented the architecture of the modern computer.

In a very short time, the center of gravity for science just up and moved across the Atlantic Ocean. After the war, it was American scientists who most regularly journeyed to Stockholm to receive medals. It was American scientists who built on von Neumann's work to take an early lead in the Information Age that the U.S. has still not relinquished. And it was American scientists who developed the vaccines for polio and measles.

During the postwar period, Vannevar Bush, head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development under FDR, sought to make America's advantage in the sciences permanent. Bush hadn't liked the way that the U.S. had to scramble to staff up the radar and atomic-bomb projects. He wanted a robust supply of scientists on hand at American universities in case the Cold War turned hot. He argued for the creation of the National Science Foundation to fund basic research, and promised that its efforts would improve both the economy and national defense.

Funding for American science has fluctuated in the decades since. It spiked after Sputnik and dipped at the end of the Cold War. But until Trump took power for the second time and began his multipronged assault on America's research institutions, broad support for science was a given under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Trump's interference in the sciences is something new. It shares features with the science-damaging policies of Stalin and Hitler, says David Wootton, a historian of science at the University of York. But in the English-speaking world, it has no precedent, he told me: “This is an unparalleled destruction from within.”

I reached out to the office of Michael Kratsios, the president's science and technology adviser, several times while reporting this story. I asked whether Kratsios, who holds the role that once belonged to Vannevar Bush, had any response to the claim that the Trump administration's attack on science was unprecedented. I asked about the possibility that its policies will drive away American researchers, and will deter foreigners from working in American labs. I was hoping to find out how the man responsible for maintaining U.S. scientific dominance was engaging with this apparent slide into mediocrity. I did not receive a reply.

All is not yet lost for American science. Lawmakers have already made clear that they do not intend to approve Trump's full requested cuts at the NIH, NSF, and NASA. Those agencies will still have access to tens of billions of dollars in federal funds next year—and blue-state attorneys general have won back some of this year's canceled grants in court. Research institutions still have some fight left in them; some are suing the administration for executive overreach. Universities in red states are hoping that their governors will soon summon the courage to take a stand on their behalf. “Politically speaking, it's one thing to shut down research at Harvard,” Steven Shapin, a science historian at the school, told me. “It's another thing to shut down the University of Arkansas.”

The U.S. government doesn't bankroll all of American scientific research. Philanthropists and private companies support some of it, and will continue to. The U.S. shouldn't face the kind of rapid collapse that occurred in the Soviet Union, where no robust private sector existed to absorb scientists. But even corporations with large R&D budgets don't typically fund open-ended inquiry into fundamental scientific questions. With the possible exception of Bell Labs in its heyday, they focus on projects that have immediate commercial promise. Their shareholders would riot if they dumped $10 billion into a space telescope or particle collider that takes decades to build and generates little revenue.

A privatized system of American science will be distorted toward short-term work, and people who want to run longer-term experiments with more expensive facilities will go elsewhere. “American science could lose a whole generation,” Shapin said. “Young people are already starting to get the message that science isn't as valued as it once was.”

If the U.S. is no longer the world's technoscientific superpower, it will almost certainly suffer for the change. America's technology sector might lose its creativity. But science itself, in the global sense, will be fine. The deep human curiosities that drive it do not belong to any nation-state. An American abdication will only hurt America, Shapin said. Science might further decentralize into a multipolar order like the one that held during the 19th century, when the British, French, and Germans vied for technical supremacy.

Or maybe, by the midway point of the 21st century, China will be the world's dominant scientific power, as it was, arguably, a millennium ago. The Chinese have recovered from Mao Zedong's own squandering of expertise during the Cultural Revolution. They have rebuilt their research institutions, and Xi Jinping's government keeps them well funded. China's universities now rank among the world's best, and their scientists routinely publish in Science, Nature, and other top journals. Elite researchers who were born in China and then spent years or even decades in U.S. labs have started to return. What the country can't yet do well is recruit elite foreign scientists, who by dint of their vocation tend to value freedom of speech.

Whatever happens next, existing knowledge is unlikely to be lost, at least not en masse. Humans are better at preserving it now, even amid the rise and fall of civilizations. Things used to be more touch-and-go: The Greek model of the cosmos might have been forgotten, and the Copernican revolution greatly delayed, had Islamic scribes not secured it in Baghdad's House of Wisdom. But books and journals are now stored in a network of libraries and data centers that stretches across all seven continents, and machine translation has made them understandable by any scientist, anywhere. Nature's secrets will continue to be uncovered, even if Americans aren't the ones who see them first.

In 1990, Roald Sagdeev moved to America. He found leaving the Soviet Union difficult. His two brothers lived not far from his house in Moscow, and when he said goodbye to them, he worried that it would be for the last time. Sagdeev thought about going to Europe, but the U.S. seemed more promising. He'd met many Americans on diplomatic visits there, including his future wife. He'd befriended others while helping to run the Soviet half of the Apollo-Soyuz missions. When Carl Sagan visited the Soviet Space Research Institute in Moscow, Sagdeev had shown him around, and the two remained close.

To avoid arousing the suspicions of the Soviet authorities, Sagdeev flew to Hungary first, and only once he was safely there did he book a ticket to the U.S. He accepted a professorship at the University of Maryland and settled in Washington, D.C. It took him years to ride out the culture shock. He still remembers being pulled over for a traffic infraction, and mistakenly presenting his Soviet ID card.

American science is what ultimately won Sagdeev over to his new home. He was awestruck by the ambition of the U.S. research agenda, and he liked that it was backed by real money. He appreciated that scientists could move freely between institutions, and didn't have to grovel before party leaders to get funding. But when I last spoke with Sagdeev, on July 4, he was feeling melancholy about the state of American science. Once again, he is watching a great scientific power in decline. He has read about the proposed funding cuts in the newspaper. He has heard about a group of researchers who are planning to leave the country. Sagdeev is 92 years old, and has no plans to join them. But as an American, it pains him to see them go.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The siblings of one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent accusers wonder what the president knows.

Updated at 9:55 p.m. ET on July 30, 2025

When Donald Trump told reporters yesterday that Jeffrey Epstein “stole” a young woman named Virginia Roberts Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago, her surviving siblings were shocked—not just because the president had described their late sister as he would an object, but because his comment raised the possibility that Trump might know more about his onetime friend's behavior than he has previously acknowledged.

“It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions, especially given his statement two years later that his good friend Jeffrey ‘likes women on the younger side … no doubt about it,'” Giuffre's two brothers and her sisters-in-law told The Atlantic in an exclusive statement, their first public response to the president. “We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this.”

Giuffre died by suicide at her home in Australia in late April. In civil litigation and information provided to law enforcement, Giuffre alleged that she had been recruited by Maxwell while working at Mar-a-Lago as a high schooler and had then been sexually abused from around 1999 to 2002 by Epstein, Maxwell, and others. Giuffre also alleged that Epstein had trafficked her to other prominent men. Epstein died in jail in June 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.

Giuffre's family told me that Virginia's work at Mar-a-Lago was meant to be a fun summertime job but instead led to her being sex trafficked.

Trump has previously denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt noted to me that Trump was directly responding to a question posed by a reporter and did not bring Giuffre up on his own. “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,” she said.

The Epstein case has been a subject of intense public interest for more than a decade, amid speculation that prominent public figures who were part of Epstein's social circle may have also been involved in or had knowledge of his sex-trafficking network. In recent years, conspiracy theorists have claimed without evidence that Epstein did not die by suicide and was instead killed to prevent prominent names—known as “the client list”—from becoming public.

Thousands of files related to the Epstein case have been made public over the years, either by law enforcement or through extensive civil litigation. Some files have been redacted or remain under seal to protect victim identities and other personally identifying information, as required by law.

During the 2024 presidential campaign and in the early months of the Trump administration, many on the right advocated for the release of the so-called Epstein files. Attorney General Pam Bondi is facing increasing criticism for the Justice Department's response—she first overhyped the release of thousands of pages of already-public material and then alleged that the FBI was withholding Epstein documents, only to state in recent weeks that no more information would be released, that no evidence existed to support a crime by anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, and that Epstein had killed himself in custody.

Trump and Epstein were chummy friends for years—photos and videos of the two have looped on cable news in recent weeks—but Trump has said that he severed ties with Epstein years before the latter was first arrested and convicted on prostitution-related charges. The president said yesterday that he did so because Epstein was poaching his employees at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Palm Beach.

When asked by reporters on Air Force One if one of those young women was Giuffre, the president responded: “I think so. I think that was one of the people,” adding that Epstein “stole her.”

“And by the way, she had no complaints about us whatsoever,” he added, without elaborating.

“I told him, I said, Listen, we don't want you taking our people, whether it's spa or not spa … And he was fine,” Trump said. “And not too long after, he did it again. And I said, Outta here.”

It is unclear who the additional Mar-a-Lago employee hired by Epstein was or how many employees Epstein poached.

Jonathan Chait: Trump's desperate move to quiet the Epstein scandal

Giuffre alleged that Epstein and Maxwell had trafficked her to multiple men in Epstein's orbit, including Prince Andrew and the French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. Both men have denied wrongdoing. Prince Andrew reached a settlement with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount in 2022. Giuffre later provided crucial information to law enforcement in the United States and France that contributed to investigations into Maxwell, Brunel, and other alleged Epstein co-conspirators. Brunel died by suicide in 2022 while in French custody; at the time, he was being investigated for charges related to the rape and sex-trafficking of minors.

Giuffre's family—Sky and Amanda Roberts, and Danny and Lanette Wilson—described themselves as still “reeling” from Giuffre's suicide a few months ago, and said they are speaking out in part because they are alarmed by Maxwell's recent offer to testify before Congress in exchange for immunity. (A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said yesterday that it would not grant Maxwell such a deal.) Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein's sex-trafficking scheme, and last week met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for questioning as the Department of Justice scrambles to answer calls for more transparency.

“If our sister could speak today, she would be most angered by the fact that the government is listening to a known perjurer, a woman who repeatedly lied under oath and will continue to do so as long as it benefits her position,” Giuffre's family wrote, referring to Maxwell.

Maxwell's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The government and the President should never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency,” Giuffre's family wrote. “Maxwell destroyed many young lives, and she was convicted for only a fraction of the crimes she actually committed.”

A senior administration official told me that “no leniency is being given or discussed” and that Trump “himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time.”

Giuffre relatives said that they hope the Trump administration will follow through on its stated promises of transparency and accountability.

“Virginia cooperated with the authorities,” they wrote. “She endured death threats, threats against the lives of her children and family, financial ruin, and her physical and mental well-being were destroyed. She never backed down; she hoped that her strength would inspire other survivors to find the courage to come forward.”

The president wants the war to end and thinks Benjamin Netanyahu is standing in his way.

A few weeks ago, President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu each gave the other something of great symbolic value. Trump excoriated the “out-of-control” prosecutors responsible for the Israeli prime minister's corruption trial, and Netanyahu nominated the American president for the Nobel Peace Prize he has long coveted.

But whatever goodwill was generated by these gestures quickly dissipated, and was not enough to overcome deeper sources of conflict between the two men: starvation in the Gaza Strip, air strikes in Syria, and the lack of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Trump in recent days has publicly and repeatedly broken with Netanyahu, dismissing his on-again, off-again ally's attempts to downplay the famine in Gaza, which has drawn international condemnation. Upset by images of dying children, Trump dispatched his diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region partly to pressure Israel to ease the hunger crisis. Meanwhile, the president and his senior aides were blindsided by recent Israeli strikes on Syria and a missile attack that hit Gaza's only Catholic Church.

Trump, two administration officials told us, has come to believe what many in Washington have thought for months: that Netanyahu is looking to prolong the conflict in Gaza, in open defiance of Trump's wish for the war to end. The president and some of his aides think that Israel's military objectives in Gaza were achieved long ago, and that Netanyahu has continued Israel's assault, which has claimed tens of thousands of civilian lives, to maintain his own political power. The White House also believes that Netanyahu is taking steps that interfere with a potential cease-fire deal.

But the two officials said they did not anticipate that Trump would hold Netanyahu accountable in any meaningful sense. (Like others, they spoke with us on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.) Even as Trump has felt disrespected by Netanyahu, his anger hasn't translated into any significant shift in U.S. policy. The president blamed Hamas for the most recent breakdown of cease-fire talks. He resisted joining France and the United Kingdom in their vows this week to recognize a Palestinian state if Israel does not improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza and commit to a peace process. A White House official insisted to us that “there is no significant rupture” between Trump and Netanyahu and that “allies can sometimes disagree, even in a very real way.” This morning, seemingly trying to set aside his differences with Netanyahu, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!”

Netanyahu has a long history of frustrating U.S. presidents. Joe Biden went from wrapping the prime minister in a bear hug in the days after the October 7, 2023, attacks to yelling at him over his prosecution of the war. Trump and Netanyahu were close during the president's first term, until Trump grew angry at his Israeli counterpart for recognizing Biden's 2020 victory. Their relationship has proceeded in fits and starts since then. Trump has hosted Netanyahu at the White House three times in the past six months, including a visit earlier this month, when they exchanged warm words. But Trump did not make a stop in Israel on his recent Middle East trip.

The hunger crisis in Gaza has put a new strain on their relationship. In March, Israel enforced a blockade of the Strip, which is densely populated, preventing food and supplies from reaching Gazans after more than 20 months of war. Human-rights organizations warned this month about widespread famine, particularly among children. Under intense international pressure, Netanyahu has allowed some food aid into the region in recent days, but he has also insisted that there is “no starvation” in Gaza. Before a meeting with United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland on Monday, Trump was asked by reporters whether he agreed with Netanyahu's assessment. “Based on television, I would say not particularly, because those children look very hungry,” Trump said. Later, he added: “That's real starvation stuff. I see it, and you can't fake that.”

This is not the first time that Trump has responded to gruesome photos. In 2017, he ordered missile strikes on a Syrian air base after he was shown what he said were “horrific” images of children killed by chemical weapons days before. Earlier this year, he unleashed some rare tough rhetoric on Vladimir Putin after being shown photos of Ukrainian children killed by a Russian air strike. And this week, the two administration officials told us, Trump was bothered by images of a Russian strike on a nursing home in Kyiv.

Hussein Ibish: Food aid in Gaza has become a horror

Trump's frustration with the ongoing war in Russia has colored his response to what he is now seeing in Gaza, one of the officials and a close outside adviser to the president told us. During the 2024 campaign, Trump frequently boasted that he had kept the world free of conflict during his first term, and he returned to the Oval Office this year pledging to bring the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to a quick close. Instead, both have escalated, to Trump's humiliation. Putin has repeatedly defied Trump's wishes for a cease-fire, causing the president, who so often views foreign policy through a personal lens, to consider finally standing up to the Russian leader. (This week, Trump announced that he was giving Putin 10 days to stop the war in Ukraine or he would green-light a series of sanctions.) Similarly, Netanyahu's recent strikes in Syria and his rejection of claims about the Gaza famine have angered Trump. The president is eager to stabilize the Middle East—and expand the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Gulf states in his first term—in order to foster business and trade relationships in the region.

Two additional U.S. officials told us that Trump's willingness to contradict Netanyahu reflects less a new breach between the two men than the president's “America First” approach—that Washington's foreign policy won't be dictated by Israel or any other foreign country. Trump is disinclined to accept Netanyahu's version of events, whether about conditions on the ground in Gaza or about the new government in Syria. When he visits Israel today, Witkoff, the president's envoy, has been tasked with developing his own assessment of the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the viability of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an American nonprofit established earlier this year to distribute food in the Strip, these two U.S. officials told us. Aides have discussed pushing Israel to dramatically increase the amount of food and supplies it allows into Gaza—so that even if some were stolen by Hamas, as Israel alleges has happened before, enough would find its way into the hands of civilians—while also pressuring the Israeli military to stop firing on civilians.

As Netanyahu faces criticism for prolonging the war, members of his cabinet are trying to make the case that Israel is an asset to Trump's foreign policy. Ron Dermer, Israel's minister of strategic affairs and a former ambassador to Washington, argued in a podcast interview last week with David Friedman, the American ambassador to Israel during Trump's first term, that Israel's importance to American national security is “going to go higher and higher and higher and higher” as Washington seeks to reduce its presence in the Middle East and focus on competition with China.

Robert F. Worth: The dispute behind the violence in Syria

One of the U.S. officials told us that the president's patience is wearing thin mainly with Hamas, not with the Israeli prime minister. Trump continues to blame the terror group for starting the conflict with Israel, and has largely sided with Israel's view of the war (including by promoting a postwar plan for Gaza as a “Riviera of the Middle East”). When asked this week about British plans to recognize a Palestinian state, Trump rejected the idea as “rewarding Hamas.” And just last week, Trump, after a call with Netanyahu, told reporters that Israel needed to “finish the job” and “get rid of Hamas” because the group didn't want to strike a deal to release the remaining hostages.

A White House spokesperson declined to comment for this article. A spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister did not respond to our request for comment.

Ultimately, Trump wants the war to end. He is aware of the growing anger toward Israel from noninterventionists in MAGA world, who don't want the U.S. involved in a conflict on the other side of the globe, one of the administration officials and the outside adviser told us. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a staunch Trump supporter, on Monday became the first Republican in Congress to declare the situation in Gaza a “genocide.” Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson have also sharply criticized Israel. Trump and those close to him are wary of further upsetting some of his most die-hard supporters who have already expressed outrage over his administration's strike on Iran in June and its recent handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Trump was taken aback when several lawmakers and influencers refused to accept his directive to stop fueling the Epstein controversy that has enveloped his White House. And now Netanyahu's defiance has caused an additional rupture in Trump's base—and frustrated the president by creating yet another news cycle he can't control.

“He just really wants these stories to stop being on TV,” the outside adviser told us.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","ICE's Mind-Bogglingly Massive Blank Check","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/ice-budget-immigration-enforcement/683678/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Congress has appropriated billions with few strings attached, creating a likely windfall for well-connected firms.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The more than $175 billion that Congress handed to the nation's immigration enforcers when it passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is larger than the annual military budget of every country in the world except the United States and China. Immigration and Customs Enforcement—just one component of the Department of Homeland Security—is getting more money than any other law-enforcement agency in America. All of this cash will be used to fund the next three and a half years of a deportation campaign that the public is already starting to question, at a time when the southern border is all but deserted.

But as striking as the overall amount of money is how little we know about why it was necessary or how the funds will be spent. The bill placed few guardrails on ICE or Customs and Border Protection—both of which have a history of financial mismanagement—and dedicated no money to oversight. What we do know from the agencies' public statements and contracts that are already in the works is that the money will be used to expand detention and surveillance systems, and that it will enrich some of the administration's closest friends.

When Donald Trump was inaugurated, top executives at the two largest private-prison companies that contract with the federal government to detain immigrants reacted with glee. In an earnings call with investors, Damon Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic, called this “truly one of the most exciting periods” in his 32-year career with the company. CoreCivic's stock price rose by more than 80 percent in the week after Trump's reelection, while that of its top competitor, the GEO Group, doubled in less than a month. GEO's CEO, J. David Donahue, told investors that “we believe the scale of the opportunity before our company is unlike any we've previously experienced.” GEO's executive chairman and founder, George Zoley, estimated that the company could make $1 billion in additional revenue. (Whereas some in the private-prison industry might have become jittery when Trump started talking about detaining immigrants in Guantánamo Bay or countries such as El Salvador, instead of the United States, Hininger assured his investors that there would be enough detained immigrants to go around. “I want to be very clear on this: We don't see that as an either/or. We actually see it as a both,” he said.)

Read: Trump loves ICE. Its workforce has never been so miserable.

GEO invested $70 million preparing to expand its detention capacity before Trump even took office; CoreCivic spent $40 million doing the same before a single new contract was signed. Just three years earlier, President Joe Biden had signed an executive order directing the Justice Department not to renew its contracts with private-prison companies, saying that they amounted to “profit-based incentives to incarcerate” in a system that “imposes significant costs and hardships on our society and communities and does not make us safer.” JPMorgan Chase said it would stop working with the industry. But now, with Trump, the companies' leaders had good reason to feel confident: His election meant the elevation of figures such as Pam Bondi, who worked as a lobbyist for GEO as recently as 2019 and became attorney general in February, and Tom Homan, the president's border czar, who was a GEO consultant during the Biden administration. The website for Homan's consulting firm touted a “proven track record of opening doors and bringing successful relationships to our clients, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts to private companies.” Homan has said he is recusing himself from contract negotiations now that he is back working for the government.

For years, high-level officials at ICE have retired from the agency into plum roles at both companies. Daniel Bible, who oversaw ICE's detention system, is an executive vice president at GEO, and Matt Albence and Dan Ragsdale, ICE's former acting director and deputy director, are senior vice presidents. CoreCivic has taken on at least two former ICE field-office directors and ICE's former head of budgeting. David Venturella has ping-ponged between the two: After 22 years at ICE, he rose through the executive ranks at GEO to become the company's head of client relations. Then, after Trump took office, he returned to ICE as a senior adviser.

This revolving door of hiring effectively puts private-prison-company executives at the negotiating table across from their former underlings, who may also hope to cash out in the private sector when they leave their government jobs. These conditions are not exactly conducive to making sure that the government's top negotiators don't agree to overpay for what they are purchasing, or that they hold contractors to account. DHS officials didn't respond to my request for a comment. Ryan Gustin, a spokesman for CoreCivic, told me the company follows rules set by the government for how former employees may interact with their previous agencies, and that “there's no basis for the claim that hiring former ICE officials results in higher costs or reduced accountability.”

The confidence expressed by GEO and CoreCivic executives has paid off. Trump's spending bill provides $45 billion to ICE to expand the nation's detention system. It also dedicates $3.33 billion to immigration courts, but caps the number of judges who can be hired at 800–one of the few limits the bill contains. At the same time, the administration has actually been firing immigration judges, who have the power to hand down deportation orders and without which a person can't be removed from the United States. Hiring more will take months or years, and in the meantime, having fewer of them around now will only lead to more people being detained. “They're not really serious about getting rid of as many people as they can. They're serious about causing human pain and suffering,” a former high-level ICE official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told me. “Putting someone into detention isn't a removal, it's a punishment.”

Allies of the administration are also in for a windfall in the technology sector. Palantir—whose co-founder and board chairman, Peter Thiel, is a strong supporter of Vice President J. D. Vance and has a hot-and-cold-but-mostly-hot relationship with Trump—has already secured $30 million to help ICE identify immigrants and track their locations. Palantir's stock price has soared by 200 percent since Trump was reelected, helped by the growth of its government contracts under both Democratic and Republican administrations and its work in AI.

Several former Palantir employees have gone to work for DOGE, which is reportedly creating a “master database” of immigrants by leveraging data from across the federal government. How the administration will use its stockpile of data, which almost certainly includes information on unsuspecting American citizens too, remains unclear. For a decade after 9/11, DHS spent millions surveilling people from predominantly Muslim countries as part of a program that the government later acknowledged “provided no discernible public benefit.”

ICE has also expanded into phone tracking, and posted a request for contracts to help it monitor up to 1 million people using their social-media accounts, financial records, and the dark web, among other information sources. In April, CBP posted a request for information from vendors on how to expand the use of facial-recognition technology at the border. Trump's big spending bill provides the agencies nearly $6 billion to fund these technological advancements.

This kind of spyware might make sense if precision were a priority in the administration's approach to deportations, but the opposite appears to be true. On the streets and in immigration courts, it's become clear, as ICE strives to conduct 3,000 arrests a day, that anyone whose legal status is in doubt is fair game, including people with no criminal history—even children.  Undocumented immigrants aren't at all hard to find in the United States: They're on farms and dairies and in restaurant kitchens and at construction sites. They're delivering groceries and warm meals to front doors across the country, cleaning and landscaping homes, and caring for elders. An efficient way of deporting 1 million people a year would involve ICE simply raiding those workplaces one by one. But the administration has already learned that the political blowback from doing so would be untenable, because businesses would fail and communities would revolt. Instead of paring back its goals, the White House has continued spending indiscriminately. “They want a lot of toys because it's fun, but a lot of those toys are not necessary or probably all that helpful at the end of the day in terms of actually making the arrests,” the former ICE official told me.

For years, Congress has criticized CBP and ICE for mismanaging their budgets, while also increasing those budgets at a remarkable pace. Since at least 2012, the United States has spent more money on immigration enforcement than on all other federal-law-enforcement endeavors combined. CBP's budget went from $5.9 billion in 2003 to $13.6 in 2016; ICE's increased by 50 percent over the same stretch of time, reaching $6.3 billion in 2016, according to The Deportation Machine, a book by the University of Illinois historian Adam Goodman. The next year, when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress, House appropriators called out ICE for a “lack of fiscal discipline and cavalier management of funding for detention operations.” In 2018, appropriators scolded the agency again for its “inability to manage detention resources.”

Read: Trump's deportations aren't what they seem

Congress has specifically faulted ICE for its inability to estimate how much money it will need to carry out its mission, and just this year, legislators raised alarms about the agency's “especially egregious” overspending. But when it came time to draft Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, its authors seem to have accepted the agency's requests without question. In a year that has already been one of the deadliest on record in immigration-detention facilities, the bill seems to leave health and safety standards up to the discretion of the secretary, potentially dispensing with years of bipartisan work to establish baseline requirements. Homan has indicated that he believes immigrant-detention standards are too high, and DOGE gutted the two offices that oversaw them: the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. But an ICE spokesperson told reporters that the agency continues to uphold the rules without any changes to its oversight procedures.

The growth that the immigration-detention system is about to undergo may be difficult, if not impossible, to undo. The facilities tend to become economic engines in the communities that surround them, many of which are rural and poor. Once they open, closing them can become a political problem in its own right. Nancy Hiemstra, a professor at Stony Brook University who co-wrote the book Immigration Detention Inc., told me that since the system was established, its funding has almost never decreased. Instead, the spending is reinforced by all of the people and organizations whose financial interest is geared toward growth, including the subcontractors that operate within detention centers, providing services such as medical care and food. The same will be true of state and local agencies vying for a portion of at least $10 billion in reimbursement funds that Trump's bill created for those that help the administration with immigration enforcement. “Right now they're saying, ‘We need more space, we're overcrowded,' creating this idea of chaos and overcrowding to use more funds,” she told me. “Then, once the money is out there, there are many people who are dependent on it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

﻿And if you can't help but love the baby-eyed figurines, that's the point too.

Some creatures only come out at night: vampires, werewolves, and now the latest member of the after-hours club: hopeful Labubu collectors.

If you're not already in the know, that last group might feel as mysterious as mythical creatures. It only adds to the toys' mystique that the window when you can officially purchase the mega-popular trinkets — sold in limited drops, like fashion collabs and sneakers — only opens for a brief time on seemingly random nights (usually at 10 pm Eastern). Enthusiasts say that successfully getting your hands on one of the approximately half-foot tall plastic-and-vinyl bunny-eared ghouls with a rictus grin feels like doing the impossible, or at least something more impossible than spending $27.99.

With their faces illuminated by the glow of their smartphones, credit card numbers locked in, fingers at the ready to click and add to cart, for Labubu hunters, there is no duty, no bedtime, sometimes no supper — only Labubu.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

According to lore, Labubus are a tribe of mythical female elves called The Monsters that live in Nordic forests. According to Pop Mart, the toy and design company that produces the dolls, Labubus are a character-driven franchise, largely consisting of plushies, figurines, and accessories, that brings in over $400 million in revenue. And according to their most fervent fans — the people who have made Labubu a success in the hundreds of millions of dollars — Labubus are pure joy…if you somehow manage to get your hands on one.

If only the other things we spend roughly $30 on could bring us such glee.

Yet, many others do not find any delight in that idea. Some assert that the Labubus craze represents capitalism in its latest stage, thanks to a perfect storm of technical uselessness, jacked-up reseller prices, celebrity endorsement, and forced scarcity. Others think the little goblins are aesthetically ominous, even ugly.

But that division — and the strong feelings on both sides — might just be exactly how Labubus became such big business. Understanding why some people can't get enough of the toys (and the chase), gives us a window into bigger questions about what makes us happy, what makes us feel in-the-know, and what someone's really buying when they purchase a monster of their own.

When people talk about Labubus, they're likely referring to the mega-popular “pendant” versions that come with a sewn-on ring that's designed to clip onto bags and belt loops. These sell out in minutes. But if you do get your hands on a Labubu — from one of Pop Mart's limited drops or on the secondhand market at a serious markup — you'll find their bodies are soft, and small enough to fit in a fist. They come in a variety of colors, and often sell as sets.

Other pieces in the Labubu line include bigger dolls (retailing for $299), accessories like phone charms, and all types of figurines and plushes. No matter the size or brand collaboration, all Labubu products have one thing in common: They exist to be seen and displayed. Labubus don't actually do anything, which may add to some of the general perplexity surrounding them.

“I've always been drawn to creatures that live in the space between fantasy and reality — characters that feel both familiar and mysterious,” Kasing Lung, the original artist who created Labubu, tells Vox. Growing up in the Netherlands and around Nordic and European folklore, Lung wanted to reflect those inspirations — mischievous, endearing, strange — in Labubu.

“She's not overly detailed or complicated, she has a big smile, wide eyes, and a little bit of mischief in her expression,” Lungs says of his original design. “Labubu is playful but not perfect — she has sharp teeth, messy fur, and a bit of wild energy. She's cute but also a little weird, a little unpredictable.”

The duality of Labubu has turned the playful imp into a bit of a Rorschach test; humans are wired to have a strong reaction when they see a Labubu.

Some people feel intense love. Its big eyes and big head are reminiscent of what researchers call “baby schema,” traits that appear in infants and toddlers that trigger parental synapses, and euphoria in our brains.

But no matter how much baby schema Labubu employs and whatever brain receptors they set off, some may still find Labubu unappealing. They have mouths that almost stretch from one end of their faces to the other, which give the toys a sinister edge. They have prominent, protruding brow bones, tiny claws, and sometimes bare their jagged teeth. In combination, these slightly alarming characteristics may explain why some people find them to harbor dark energy.

“They're so cute-ugly,” says Tyler Renner, a man in possession of two Labubus, living in California. Renner, 34, was initially drawn to Labubus, but for a while kept his desire for them a secret. They're divisive, he reasoned. Not everyone understands how something so menacing could come back around to being so adorable. But the more Renner posted his dolls, showing off their custom-made clothes and freaky little faces, the more support he got. He received secretive DMs from closet Labubu-lovers, wanting to know how they could procure their own.

Elizabeth Mitchell, a mom from the Washington, DC, area, echoes Renner's so-ugly-it's-cute horseshoe theory and clandestine love affair. “It's goth meets Hello Kitty,” says Mitchell, who sees her devotion in terms both anthropological and biochemical. “Either you have the ‘Tribe Labubu' brain parasite or you don't.”

According to a Pop Mart spokesperson, Labubu tends to be most popular with women between the ages of 18–30. During the current popularity boom, though, Labubu's fan demographic has aged up and its gender appeal has broadened. While children certainly enjoy Labubu and want them, they are probably not the ones logged into Pop Mart's app with credit card security codes at the ready. And because one doesn't really “play” with Labubus aside from displaying them, possibly in festive outfits, toy designers consider Labubus as much an object of design than a traditional kids' toy.

Still though, there are people who might be able to better resist baby schema, who don't succumb to brain parasites, who find them not “cute-ugly,” but just plain ugly. On TikTok, a corner of the internet brimming with Labubus, Labubu lovers, and Labubu haters, their creepiness is often a popular subject (a sore one for fans).

Being so intensely polarizing is what makes Labubus so successful, says Vincent Scala, a toy designer and illustration professor at the School of Visual Arts. If Labubus themselves were ignorable, if the reactions they elicited were simply lukewarm, they wouldn't command such a deep yearning.

Some may not care one way or another about the way the dolls look, but simply hate the idea of an unavoidable mania brought on by cute junk. Scala and other experts I spoke with pointed out that Labubus may remind a lot of people (especially millennials and Gen Xers of a certain age) of Tickle Me Elmos, Furbys, and Beanie Babies; toy fads that burned hot and bright and died out just as fast because people got bored with them. These core viral toy memories — coupled with millennials historically preferring experiences over material objects — might elicit an ennui or confusion about the Labubu obsession, if not an outright hostility.

“Furby, I think, is probably the closest — as so many people loved it, just as many people hated it,” Scala says, noting that “the amount of hatred just sort of feeds into the craze” and that all the attention “makes people want it more.”

One would think that producing something everyone generally wants would be better for business than creating something only some people want. But that misses something important about human desire.

Jared Watson, a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business who studies the extensive subject of consumer behavior, attributes part of Labubu's success and its virality to its volatility.

If everyone wanted and had a Labubu, the average person would have some kind of idea of its value. But fans and experts say that when buyers push past uncertainties about worth or childishness, they are rewarded with social status, or at least belonging. When complete strangers compliment the Labubu on the street, owners experience a unique kind of joy.

“You don't get the same sort of rush when everyone is in on the secret,” Watson says, comparing it to the euphoria of sharing a love for a new movie, an undersung TV series, or an emerging musician that the general public hasn't hopped on yet. “But once everybody's there, it's not as exciting anymore.”

That mass adoption isn't a problem for Labubus though: Pop Mart has set up the market so they're not so easy to get your hands on.

Buying a Labubu requires either a lot of time or a bunch of money. If you're willing to pay more than its retail asking price, you can find $27.99 Pop Mart Labubus on resale sites like Stock X or eBay going for $60, $120, even $280. If you want to purchase them from the parent company, it requires strategy and luck.

Pop Mart's checkout process is something of an obstacle course. Go too slow and faster clickers will gobble up the stock. Go too fast and Pop Mart's system might flag you as a reseller bot, like the kind that scoop up all the best concert seats on Ticketmaster.

If you make it through the digital gauntlet, you obtain what's known as a blind box — there's a Labubu inside, but you don't know which one is yours until you open it. Those individual blind boxes usually belong to Pop Mart's three main Labubu pendant collections — Sweet Macaron (Labubus are named after desserts and drinks), Have a Seat (Labubus are all in sitting poses), and Big Into Energy (Labubus are named after emotions) — each collection has six different Labubus, and each one has a rare, secret Labubu that appears in 1/72 boxes. That makes for 21 regular attachable Labubu characters in circulation, not counting special series and collaborations (Pop Mart's entire Labubu line is expansive, if not overwhelming).

For first-time buyers, this means any box will contain a fun, random surprise, but for collectors, the more Labubus you buy, the more likely you are to end up with duplicates. If you're lucky, though, there's a small chance of scoring the special “secret,” the plush equivalent of Willy Wonka's golden ticket without any chance of dying at the hands of a maniacal candy tycoon. Some fans will purchase box after box chasing the secret.

Carmin Newman believed herself to be one of these lucky people; and indeed she has procured over 30 Labubus since committing herself to the cause.

To get the first of her Labubus, Newman researched when new stock would drop. She recruited “a little team” to converge on the app. Her squad had their clicking fingers ready in the seconds right before Pop Mart's replenishment, and scored a complete set of six, then another, then one more.

Yet Newman says she doesn't like any of the Labubus she's obtained.

Labubus are a hit with kids in Newman's neighborhood, and those kids' parents were ready to pay resellers double or more for the little ghouls. That waste activated her. No one was going to spend more than $30 for a Labubu on Newman's watch.

“It's totally a game now,” Newmans tells me, explaining that scoring Labubus feels like winning. The rush of getting one retail and not paying a reseller is, in her eyes, better than actually owning one. She swears her goal is one more set, from one more drop. “Then I'll be done,” Newman promises, before admitting with a laugh that she might need “Labubus Anonymous.”

Ginger Pennington, a professor at Northwestern University who studies consumer psychology and human motivation, points out that Labubus tap into many of the same psychological and emotional mechanisms that gambling does, from the company-induced scarcity, to the randomness of the blind box, to the instant gratification or disappointment of acquisition.

She explains that the drop process and blind boxes actually take advantage of the dopamine hit with a negative outcome.

“Even though it's super, super disappointing,” to not get a Labubu, or to get one you already have, “it actually doesn't dampen your motivation,” Pennington says. “It just makes you want to go and try again.” Instead of dwelling on the disappointment — or giving up — collectors focus on the part that felt good.

For nearly a decade, we've heard about how millennials have driven an economy that values “experiences” over “stuff,” and that doesn't seem to be changing. Perhaps the fact that millennials (and Zoomers) are loving Labubus isn't a contradiction; maybe it's the high of the chase that makes these dolls so desirable.

Or maybe it's all about those big baby eyes, the unnerving smile underneath them, and the satisfaction in knowing some people just don't get it.

One thing is for sure, Labubus are not for everyone. Pop Mart, to massive profit, is making sure it stays that way.

The dark side of Fairlife — and America's protein craze.

You don't need me to tell you that the US is in the midst of an obsession with protein. By now, you've probably seen extra protein in foods and beverages it once didn't belong: ice cream, popcorn, iced tea — even water. Google searches for “protein” have surged in recent years, and the macronutrient seems to be on the tip of every fitness influencers' tongue.

But the impact of the protein craze goes beyond snacks and social media. It helped the meat industry achieve record sales in 2024, and it likely contributed to a surprising change in American eating habits: Last year, for the first time in 15 years, consumers increased their cow's milk consumption.

Perhaps no company has both benefited from and accelerated these converging trends more than Fairlife, the Coca-Cola-owned milk brand that contains zero lactose and boasts 50 percent more protein and 50 percent less sugar than regular milk. That unique nutritional profile, achieved through a patented “ultra-filtration” process, has helped turn Fairlife into a billion-dollar business in under a decade, ranking second in name-brand refrigerated milk sales last year.

“There's this obsession with protein [among] young men right now that's just been blockbuster to” Fairlife, agriculture researcher Austin Frerick, author of Barons: Money, Power, and the Corruption of America's Food Industry, told me. The company's success has been a godsend for Coca-Cola, which became Fairlife's sole owner in 2020; it's now the beverage giant's fastest-growing US brand.

Fairlife has distinguished itself not just with its high protein content, but also by claiming that its milk is higher quality than its competitors, its cows are treated humanely, and its farms are environmentally sustainable. “Believe in better,” reads one of the company's taglines.

That feel-good story has earned Fairlife's husband-and-wife co-founders Mike and Sue McCloskey glowing profiles in Food & Wine, NPR, and Fortune, along with invitations to speak at conferences held by South by Southwest, Yale, Fast Company, and TEDx.

But it's a story that has, in recent years, increasingly collided with reality. In 2019, an undercover investigation by the nonprofit Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) at the McCloskeys' flagship farm in Indiana, a supplier to Fairlife at the time, revealed horrific animal abuse: employees kicking calves in the head, hitting them with steel rods, and slamming them to the ground, among many other cruelties.

Soon after, the McCloskeys apologized. But since then, ARM has released several additional stomach-wrenching investigations into dairy farms that belong to Select Milk Producers — a cooperative, also co-founded by the McCloskeys, of some 100 dairy farms that helped launch Fairlife and supply milk to it.

The latest investigation, released in late June, recorded workers at a New Mexico dairy hitting cows in the head with a metal pipe, kicking them in the face and body, dragging newborn calves and adult cows in the dirt with a tractor, and numerous other instances of abuse.

Fairlife told Vox it hasn't sourced milk from that farm since 2023, but ARM's investigator shared evidence to the contrary. Additionally, in a class action lawsuit filed earlier this year against Fairlife, Coca-Cola, the McCloskeys, and Select Milk Producers, a group of consumers accuse Fairlife of deceiving customers with claims of humane animal treatment, and allege that the New Mexico dairy farm did supply Fairlife at the time of the investigation.

Fairlife is far from alone. Farmed animals are largely exempt from federal and state animal cruelty laws, so industry welfare standards are incredibly low, and dairy producers are effectively left to police themselves. Past investigations alleging horrific abuse are legion across the dairy industry, including at dairy farms that have supplied to Burger King, Domino's, Land O'Lakes, Nestlé, Cabot Creamery, and other leading food brands.

Between the early 2000s and the mid 2010s, many of these investigations became high-profile news stories. The livestock industry reacted by advocating for laws not to criminalize animal abuse, but to criminalize the investigators who videotaped the abuse. The McCloskeys had a different strategy: They capitalized on this era of heightened concern around animal cruelty by promising transparency and humane treatment of their animals.

ARM's slate of investigations have consistently undermined that narrative. But Fairlife has thrived in spite of it all, revealing the consequences of consumers' willingness to believe a good story — or ignore a bad one — in the pursuit of ever-more protein.

Last Christmas Eve, a man who had worked on dairy farms for 17 years started his first shift at a large industrial dairy operation, called Woodcrest Dairy, in the New Mexico desert. But there was something that set him apart from his coworkers: He was wearing a hidden camera.

Years prior, he had been a worker at a Fairlife supplier farm that ARM investigated for alleged animal abuse. Disturbed by their findings, the worker reached out to the organization and eventually became an ARM investigator himself.

While employed at Woodcrest Dairy for 10 weeks, through early March of this year, he caught dozens of acts of animal abuse on camera, including workers:

In an interview with Vox conducted via a translator, the investigator, who requested anonymity due to the covert nature of undercover investigations, described the treatment of cows at Woodcrest Dairy as “terrifying” and said that the owner and managers witnessed it. “They only care about the money,” he said. “There's no care about the animals.”

“The actions observed in the video are cruel and reprehensible,” Jim Reynolds, a veterinarian and professor emeritus of large animal medicine and welfare at Western University of Health Sciences, told me in an email. “The abusive and cruel actions seen in the video represent serious problems in management of the dairy.”

Beyond the most blatant cruelty, the investigator documented other animal welfare problems, like “downer” cows — cows unable to stand or walk on their own, often due to disease, metabolic issues, or post-birth pain. Some were lifted with a hip clamp that was placed on their bodies and attached to a tractor; one cow was dragged through the dirt while attached to the tractor. Another cow had a band wrapped around her hind legs to keep them from splaying.

Because cows, like all mammals, need to give birth to produce milk, dairy farms revolve around continual pregnancies and births, which is immensely taxing on their bodies. The investigator documented numerous instances of workers doing something during the birthing process he had never seen: tying a chain to the legs of baby calves while they were still in their mothers' birth canals, and then jumping on it to pop the calf out. In one scene, the cow bellows in pain and the calf is partly covered in blood.

“The cow and calf both definitely suffered from this mistreatment,” Reynolds wrote to me about this part of the investigation. “The actions seen tell us the employees are not trained appropriately for delivering calves, they have not been provided appropriate equipment, and they are not managed appropriately.”

Fairlife declined an interview request for this story. In an email to Vox, the company said it stopped sourcing milk from Woodcrest Dairy in 2023. However, ARM's investigator, in a videotaped conversation shared with Vox, asked a truck driver transporting milk from the farm in January if he was taking the milk to a nearby Fairlife plant. The driver answered yes, specifying that they bring milk to the Fairlife plant three times a day.

The livestock industry — not just Fairlife — has long portrayed dairy as an essential, wholesome product from cows who just happen to be producing milk on quaint, green pastures. But cows on dairy farms, even when they're not overtly abused like those seen in undercover investigations into Fairlife, still face severe welfare issues because of the very nature of dairy production.

Today's cows have been bred to produce far more milk than they naturally would, which greatly taxes their bodies. They're (artificially) impregnated each year — another physical stressor — to induce milk production. After they give birth, their calves are quickly taken away so that humans can take their mothers' milk.

Newborn calves are then confined alone in tiny hutches. Females go on to become dairy cows once they're sexually mature, while the male calves are dehorned and castrated — often without pain relief — and sold off to become veal or beef.

Most dairy cows have little to no access to pasture and spend their lives confined indoors or on dirt feedlots. Naturally, they might live to 15 to 20 years of age, but by 5 or 6 years old, when bodies give out and their milk yield wanes, they're sent off to slaughter.Many of these practices have become standard on dairy farms of all sizes — not just on mega dairies. It's a reality far different from what consumers often see in advertisements and on milk bottles.

Woodcrest Dairy has since closed down and couldn't be reached for comment. Select Milk Producers, the cooperative that Woodcrest belonged to, told Vox in an email that “animal care is a core value” at the cooperative, and that it investigates “any report of inappropriate animal care.” (Select Milk confirmed to me that Woodcrest has shut down.)

As recently as this March, Select Milk Producers' website stated that the “highly nutritious milk products of fairlife come from the 99 family owned dairies of Select Milk Producers.” That web page has since been taken down.

The Woodcrest Dairy findings were the latest in a string of similar recent investigations. Earlier this year, after ARM released disturbing videos showing animal cruelty at two Arizona dairy farms that supplied Fairlife, the company said it had immediately suspended ties with the farms. But weeks later, investigators from the group Consumer Protection Foundation, separate from ARM, followed milk being trucked from the Arizona farms to a processing plant run by United Dairymen of Arizona (a cooperative that Fairlife sources some of its Arizona milk from), and then to a Fairlife plant. Fairlife told Vox in an email that it did not resume sourcing milk from these farms.

And in 2023, ARM released a shocking investigation into an Indiana dairy operation that ARM says belongs to the Select Milk Producers cooperative (SMP didn't reply to a question about whether the farm is currently a cooperative member, and the farm couldn't be reached for comment).

Videos from the investigation show workers hitting cows with screwdrivers, knives, and sawed-off golf clubs, and in one scene, a worker takes a rod with a huge flame at the end and brushes it against cows' legs as they're being milked. At one point in the video, the ARM investigator asks a manager about a dairy cow he had just shot: “Do you feel remorse for killing her?” The manager replies, “No! It's why I live in this country, so I can kill these asshole cows.”

Fairlife denied sourcing milk from the operation. Soon after, ARM followed milk trucks from the facility to a Fairlife processing plant in Michigan. ARM also recorded a conversation with a milk truck driver who said he took milk from the farm to the Fairlife processing plant. Fairlife stated that it had been considering bringing on the farm as a supplier and that the milk shipment ARM observed was simply a test run that was subsequently dumped and never entered Fairlife's supply chain.

The class action lawsuit filed earlier this year accuses Fairlife of lying about its relationship with the Arizona, Indiana, and New Mexico farms. “This conduct constitutes bad faith, collusion, deception, and fraud,” the lawsuit states.

ARM has asked the US Department of Agriculture and state agriculture departments to take a deeper look into Fairlife's supply chain and the pattern of animal cruelty, but no such inquiry has ever been taken up, according to Richard Couto, ARM's founder and CEO.

Federal and state agriculture agencies are “out to protect industry and dollars,” Couto told me. “They're not out to protect the animal.”

Animal Recovery Mission's first investigation into a Fairlife supplier, released in 2019, has since been viewed over 19 million times — more than perhaps any other farm animal cruelty video in history. It garnered widespread news coverage, and several Midwest grocery chains temporarily pulled Fairlife bottles from their shelves. Fans posted videos of themselves pouring Fairlife down the drain, vowing to never buy the product again.

By 2022, Coca-Cola, the McCloskeys, their farm business, and Select Milk Producers settled a $21 million class action lawsuit (separate from the one filed earlier this year) alleging the companies had falsely advertised their milk as coming from humanely treated cows.

That wasn't how it was all supposed to turn out.

In the early 1990s, the McCloskeys — who at the time owned a large dairy farm in New Mexico — launched the cooperative Select Milk Producers, differentiated by a promise of increased transparency and higher standards that led to healthier cows and cleaner milk.

A few years later, they moved to Indiana and opened Fair Oaks Farms, which is now one of the country's largest dairy operations, with an eye-popping 36,000 cows — what's considered a mega dairy. At the time, industrial animal agriculture was under increasing scrutiny as investigations into factory farms by animal rights groups gained media attention. Rather than hunker down and ignore Big Ag's negative publicity, the McCloskeys saw a business opportunity in transparency — or at least their version of it.

In 2004, the McCloskeys expanded Fair Oaks Farms to become what's been called an agricultural Disneyland — a farm-meets-theme park tourist attraction that draws more than 100,000 visitors annually.

“The farm was founded out of necessity to counter the very loud, very well-funded, and often, very misleading voices against modern farming and animal agriculture,” Sue McCloskey told Food & Wine in 2018.

Today, visitors can take a sanitized tour of Fair Oaks's dairy and pig operations. The programming “attempts to make the public comfortable with the factory farm,” Jan Dutkiewicz, a Vox contributor and assistant professor of political science at the Pratt Institute who went on the tour, wrote in 2018. Fair Oaks, he added, deploys a “selective transparency that seems to perform radical revelation — even as it hides overt and structural forms of violence against animals.”

There are also interactive dairy, pork, and crop museums, a 25-foot tall rock climbing wall in the shape of a milk bottle called “Udder Heights,” and a “Legen-Dairy Drop MegaSlide,” two on-site restaurants, and a Marriott hotel.

Throughout their time at Fair Oaks Farms, visitors are inundated with messages that modern animal agriculture is sustainable and humane. “At Fair Oaks, Mike is essentially able to create a new reality,” Frerick, the ag researcher and author, said in The Price of Milk, a new documentary series on the dairy industry. “They built one of the most popular tourist attractions in the state of Indiana, full of propaganda, to refute claims that industrial animal operations (CAFOs) were cruel,” he told me in an email.

Yet the McCloskeys' claims about what separates their farms and businesses from typical dairy factory farms have always been scant on specifics.

For example, Mike McCloskey has told NPR that the fact that he's fluent in Spanish has enabled him to better communicate with his largely Spanish-speaking workforce, which has resulted in better care for animals. Select Milk Producers's website mentions its adherence to voluntary animal welfare guidelines that were developed by dairy industry groups, which largely mirror standard industry practices.

Fair Oaks Farms did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.

“This is just the one classic textbook example of why self-policing just fails. How can you even take the company at their word now to do better?”

After Fair Oaks Farms came Fairlife. In 2012, the McCloskeys, through Select Milk Producers, developed a partnership with Coca-Cola to distribute Core Power, a milk-based protein shake made using their ultra-filtration process to enhance the drink's protein content. Two years later, Select Milk Producers and Coca-Cola launched the Fairlife brand.

Their timing was perfect. The protein craze was gaining steam, while cruelty investigations into factory farms had become a frequent news story. Fairlife promised consumers everything: a low-sugar, lactose-free, high-protein milk beverage with a humane and sustainable sheen. Coca-Cola's market dominance helped get Fairlife drinks into 76,000 US retail outlets by 2017.

The company took off, and the McCloskeys became a positive story in an otherwise struggling industry: Over the last 80 years per capita fluid milk consumption in the US has declined dramatically, and hundreds of thousands of small- and mid-sized dairies went under. Large dairy producers like the McCloskeys were well-positioned to benefit from the industry's structural problems.

In the years that followed, Mike McCloskey landed on President Donald Trump's short list for agriculture secretary. Sue, meanwhile, was busy on the conference and media circuit, where she frequently, and lovingly, referred to the couple's cows as “our girls.”

“There's a degree of business brilliance to them that you have to admire,” Frerick said. Neither of the McCloskeys came from a big farm family, yet their business savvy, political connections, and marketing prowess, he said, has made them “unquestionably the most powerful dairy farmers in America in a lifetime.”

It wasn't long before Animal Recovery Mission's first investigation revealed how the “girls” were treated in the McCloskeys' dairy empire.

Following ARM's first investigation in 2019, Mike McCloskey released an apology video, saying that Fairlife doesn't tolerate animal abuse and would clean up its supply chain. Yet ever since, Animal Recovery Mission continued to release new investigations into Fairlife suppliers and Select Milk Producers members at a regular clip, each with similarly disturbing findings.

Along the way, Fairlife removed humane care claims from its bottles, and earlier this year, it took down a lengthy yet vague web page about its animal welfare commitments.

Of course, no one at the top of these companies actively wants animals to be abused, but the continued investigations reflect a structural reality of animal agriculture: Mass producing cheap animal products is all but impossible to do humanely. Dozens of investigations into the US meat, milk, and egg industries have revealed that the constantly growing demand for cheap animal products — combined with virtually zero legal protections for farmed animals and captured regulatory agencies — means that efficiency and profit are almost always prioritized over animal welfare.

“This is just the one classic textbook example of why self-policing just fails,” Frerick said. “How can you even take the company at their word now to do better?” The story here, he added, “is the failure of regulators.”

Through it all, Select Milk Producers and the McCloskeys have continued to prosper. All told, Coca-Cola spent $7.4 billion to acquire Fairlife, Bloomberg reported earlier this year.

And the public shock and disgust that followed the first investigation into Fairlife six years ago has since largely faded into the background, while the brand just gets more and more popular.

“The scariest thing from all these animal abuse scandals is it feels like that, with each additional scandal, the tension goes down,” Frerick said. “This abuse is becoming seemingly a fact of life. I think that's kind of an unsaid strategy of Fairlife — it's just to ride it out so [people] become numb to it.”

Fairlife, after all, has always managed to effectively foresee and meet the cultural moment. It's now reaping the financial rewards of a protein fad that it anticipated long before its competitors. And although the McCloskeys once promised that a bottle of Fairlife came from humanely raised cows at a time when animal welfare concerns were particularly salient, the company has appeared just as happy to quietly shed its commitments to animal welfare when they were no longer convenient.

But Couto said Animal Recovery Mission isn't going away. “ARM is such a thorn in Coca-Cola's side,” he told me, “because we're never going to stop investigating.”

What MAHA gets wrong about kids' health.

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

One of the central claims that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made as secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and de facto leader of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement is that American kids are getting sicker.

According to experts, that claim happens to be largely correct.

A study published earlier this month in JAMA found that an American child was 15 to 20 percent more likely to have a chronic health condition in 2023 than in 2011. Americans are now more likely to die in childhood than Europeans, and their lives are increasingly marked by illness: rates of asthma, diabetes, sleep apnea, and even eye problems and hearing loss, are all on the rise.

Kids are also living with more distress than in years past. They're experiencing more depression, anxiety, and loneliness, as well as more physical pain and fatigue, Christopher Forrest, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and one of the authors of the study, told me.

“There's a major crisis in children's health in this country that has been under-recognized and not addressed for decades,” Forrest said.

Some experts have applauded Kennedy for at least talking about children's health in the MAHA report, released in May with a follow-up reportedly planned for later this year. However, the crisis identified by researchers with decades of experience in epidemiology and pediatrics is very different from the one that the MAHA commission — led by Kennedy and staffed by Trump administration appointees — describes.

The MAHA report “serves a critical purpose: exposing a disturbing reality unfolding across the nation—the scale of the chronic disease epidemic and the institutional failures that allowed it to grow unchecked for decades,” an HHS spokesperson told me in an email.

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

But the report breaks from scientific consensus in its discussion of the causes of kids' illness, the solutions, and even what a childhood disease is. The result, experts say, is a document that highlights the very real problem of kids' health while also pushing misleading ideas that could hurt or kill American kids. (The initial version of the report was criticized for citing studies that did not exist, possibly the result of using AI to compile it.)

“They get some things right, but then they embed those correct assertions in a toxic stew of misinformation,” said Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and the director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good at Boston College.

Meanwhile, rather than tackling major drivers of kids' illness like pollution and poverty, Kennedy has so far focused on smaller issues like food dyes, experts say. At the same time, his health department exists within an administration that's working against kids' health on multiple fronts, from cutting Medicaid to relaxing environmental regulations.

“The attention that we're finally getting paid to this issue is great,” said Lauren Wisk, a health services researcher at UCLA who studies pediatric chronic disease. But “I will be much more enthusiastic about this administration if they would actually make a good-faith effort to address the issue.”

The MAHA commission and a broad swath of scientists agree that children's health in America is a problem that urgently needs attention. But they don't agree on what the problem is.

In a chapter titled “The Chronic Disease Crisis: A Generation at Risk,” the report cites rising rates of diabetes, childhood cancers, allergies, autoimmune diseases — and autism. Kennedy has focused special attention on autism for years, falsely linking it with vaccines and, more recently, pledging to find the cause of the supposed “autism epidemic” by September.

But “I don't think we've ever considered autism an illness or a disease,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, an emerita professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University who has studied autism for decades.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition and can be a disability, but it's not a disease like cancer or diabetes, and it's not helpful to conflate it with chronic illnesses that affect children, experts say.

In this way, the MAHA report is “a real blast from the past,” Zoe Gross, director of advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, told me. Fifteen years ago, it was very common “to rhetorically compare autism to pediatric cancer or pediatric HIV — things which harm the body, which can be deadly,” she said. “It's meant to inspire fear, to stigmatize autism by associating it with these diseases that are harmful and can hurt and kill people.” Kennedy has been accused of stigmatizing autism in the past, saying the diagnosis “destroys” families, and that “these are kids who will never pay taxes,” have a job, or “play baseball,” comments that inspired outrage from many autistic people and their families.

It's also not clear that rates of autism are rising in the way that rates of some chronic diseases are. Autism diagnoses have been increasing since the 1960s, but in that time “there's been an enormous and highly successful effort to bring autism to the awareness and understanding of the general population,” resulting in more diagnoses that might have been missed in the past, Tager-Flusberg said. Though factors like rising paternal age may play a role, much of the increase in autism likely comes from improved screening and awareness, experts say.

Kennedy, however, has often maintained that there must be an environmental cause of autism — if not vaccines, then perhaps a toxin introduced in the late 1980s. Much of the MAHA report focuses on environmental factors — chemicals in foods and the environment that could be making kids sick.

“Data on autism, ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, and the overmedicalization of children has gone largely unnoticed and the Trump administration is bringing this crisis to light,” the HHS spokesperson told me.

Many pediatricians, epidemiologists, and other experts agree that chemicals in kids' environment could be harming them. “The increase in rates of a whole series of chronic diseases parallel increases in chemical production and in dissemination of chemicals into the environment,” Landrigan, the Boston College public health scholar, told me.

For example, phthalates, substances used in plastic packaging, can harm the development of the brain and reproductive organs, Landrigan said. Bisphenol A, a compound once used in packaging and receipts, has been linked to diabetes and heart disease. Air pollution, both outdoor and indoor, plays a role in childhood asthma, said Frederick Rivara, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who co-wrote a recent JAMA editorial on children's health.

In its discussion of possible causes of kids' chronic illness, the MAHA report includes phthalates, bisphenols, and other substances that scientists are concerned about. But it also includes substances that scientists aren't concerned about, like vaccines. The report cites the “growth of the childhood vaccine schedule” and parental concerns about vaccines' “role in the growing childhood chronic disease crisis.”

There is no evidence that the childhood vaccine schedule is harmful to kids, however, and skipping vaccines can leave them vulnerable to diseases like measles, which has sickened more than 1,000 people this year and killed two children.

“There is no single public health intervention that has saved more human lives than vaccines,” Landrigan said, and casting doubt on vaccination “is going to lead to unnecessary deaths in American children.”

The MAHA report is not necessarily intended to offer policy solutions. “This report is a diagnosis,” the HHS spokesperson told me. “The second policy report will be a prescription for America.”

However, the Trump administration's policies are often at odds with what experts say would improve kids' health. For example, the first step in protecting children from potential environmental harms would be mandatory toxicological testing of chemicals before they come to market, as well as compounds that are already on the market, Landrigan said.

But the Environmental Protection Agency and Republicans in Congress are trying to weaken, not strengthen, regulations around chemicals in the air and water — even pollutants like lead and mercury that have been recognized as harmful for decades. As Vox's Dylan Scott reported, Kennedy has yet to speak up around these efforts, despite pressure from some in his MAHA coalition.

Chemicals are not the only threat to kids' health. One of the main reasons for the difference in childhood mortality between the United States and other wealthy countries is our higher rate of premature birth, Forrest, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatrics professor, told me.

“Women are entering pregnancy less healthy,” with conditions like hypertension that can be managed with proper prenatal care, Forrest said — but that care is often unavailable. “The crisis in infant health is really a crisis in women's health.”

Improving kids' health and fighting chronic disease will be a multipronged endeavor, Forrest said. But an important first step would be universal prenatal care, as well as primary care for women so that they're healthy when they become pregnant. If we could combine those supports with paid parental leave and high-quality child care, “we would be a long way towards improving the health of kids,” Forrest said.

However, the Medicaid cuts in Trump's “big, beautiful bill” will threaten Americans' access to health care, Rivara said. The cuts could close rural hospitals, making it even harder for pregnant people to find adequate care.

Improved access to fruits, vegetables, and other fresh foods would also improve kids' health, experts and advocates say. “Many people do lack access to fresh produce because of food deserts and because of poverty,” Gross said. “Giving people more access to things like SNAP benefits would be a great way to fight that. Of course, this administration has just cut SNAP benefits pretty enormously in their budget bill.”

It's possible that the second MAHA report will include more policy recommendations in line with what experts have suggested, or that Kennedy will decide to take on the EPA and others in the Trump administration who seek to weaken environmental regulation. But for now, he has largely concentrated on issues like food dyes that experts say are likely to have minimal impact on kids' health.

Democratic voters sympathize much more with Palestinians than Israelis, but you wouldn't know that from looking at the party establishment.

Since former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election, the Democratic Party has been in a panic over how it can win back more voters. Ideas have so far included Democratic officials going on podcasts, finding their own Joe Rogan, and growing facial hair.

But when it comes to actual issues Democratic voters care about, the party doesn't seem so eager to experiment. And there's one topic in particular that is showing just how big the divide is between the Democratic establishment and Democratic-leaning voters: the United States' support for Israel.

Israel's destruction of Gaza — which many scholars and experts consider to be an ongoing genocide — has prompted a dramatic shift in how Americans view Israel and its relationship with the US. That change is especially pronounced among Democratic voters. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that only 12 percent of Democratic voters say they sympathize more with Israelis, while 60 percent say they are more sympathetic toward Palestinians.

Compare that to just eight years ago, when Quinnipiac asked voters the same question. In 2017, 42 percent of Democratic respondents said they sympathized more with Israelis, while only 23 percent sided more with the Palestinians.

“All of a sudden, it's the pro-Palestinian position that actually reigns supreme in Democratic politics, not the Israeli position,” Harry Enten, CNN's chief data analyst, said in a recent broadcast breaking down why Zohran Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel, performed so well in the New York City mayoral primaries. “I rarely ever see shifts like this.”

Over the last week, news and images of more and more Palestinian children dying of hunger have finally compelled American politicians to push back on Israel's war crimes in Gaza. A growing number of Democrats have called out Israel's use of starvation as a weapon of war in recent days because of just how dire the situation has become, though Israel has been weaponizing humanitarian aid since the start of its war. It seems that nearly two years into Israel's assault on Gaza, more and more Democrats are starting to shift their tone.

But by and large, the Democratic establishment has remained out of step with its voters on Israel — because Democrats' actions and policies tell a far different story than their recent rhetoric does. Democratic leaders in Congress, for example, recently met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has a warrant out for his arrest — issued by the International Criminal Court — for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the crime of starvation as a method of warfare. High-ranking Democratic officials from New York, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, have also held out on endorsing Mamdani, despite him being their party's nominee for New York City mayor. One issue that they keep citing is how Mamdani talks about Israel, presumably out of fear of alienating some of their own voters.

If Democrats really wanted to act on their criticisms of Netanyahu's government, they could have, over the past two years, tried to suspend military aid to Israel — including defensive weapons — until it complies with international law. But when members of Congress made those kinds of proposals — like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's resolution to withhold billions in military aid to Israel — they consistently failed to gain any real traction within the Democratic Party, let alone on the Republican side of the aisle.

Instead, under the Biden administration, congressional Democrats helped approve over $17 billion in military aid to Israel, even after Israel stood accused of committing genocide in front of the International Court of Justice. And earlier this month, only four House Democrats voted in favor of an amendment in the defense budget bill that would have stripped Israel of $500 million in military aid. Even some of the party's progressive leaders, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), voted against the amendment, arguing that the aid was for defensive, not offensive, weapons.

Given how far Democratic voters have moved on support for Israel — a more than 60-point swing in the last decade — why has their party's establishment been so slow to respond?

Even before the war in Gaza, public opinion in the US, especially among Democrats, was already shifting on Israel. Gallup polls have shown the same trend as the Quinnipiac polls. In 2013, only 19 percent of Democratic voters sympathized more with Palestinians than with Israelis. By 2022 — a year before Hamas's October 7 attacks — that number had doubled to 38 percent. Israel's destruction of Gaza has only accelerated the shift, and by 2025, 59 percent of Democratic voters sympathized more with Palestinians, while only 21 percent sympathized more with Israelis.

That sea-change is not just limited to Democrats. In 2013, 63 percent of independents sympathized more with Israelis, while only 11 percent said they were more sympathetic toward Palestinians, according to Gallup. By 2025, those numbers were 42 percent and 34 percent, respectively — marking a 44-point swing. Republican voters, on the other hand, have remained relatively steady and staunchly pro-Israel.

So what accounts for the Democratic reticence to shift on Israel? One major factor is the Israel lobby. Political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have argued that the strength of this lobby — and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in particular — is largely responsible for the strong US-Israel relationship.

In a 2006 article for the London Review of Books, which they later spun into a book, they wrote, “The thrust of US policy in the region derives almost entirely from domestic politics, and especially the activities of the ‘Israel Lobby.' Other special-interest groups have managed to skew foreign policy, but no lobby has managed to divert it as far from what the national interest would suggest, while simultaneously convincing Americans that US interests and those of the other country — in this case, Israel — are essentially identical.”

While others have pushed back on that claim, it's hard to argue that AIPAC — a hard-line pro-Israel group that has lobbied both political parties for decades, helping organize donors' campaign contributions to pro-Israel candidates — does not have a major role in US politics and foreign policy.

Though it's impossible to put a precise figure on AIPAC's economic impact — in part because its operations also help its donor network and other pro-Israel PACs know where to direct their resources — it's one of the best-funded and most powerful organizations in American politics. Even among lobbying groups, its influence is astounding, especially given how relatively niche their cause is. In the 2024 cycle, AIPAC, which reportedly boasted a $100 million war chest to target progressive candidates, was among the biggest election spenders. (AIPAC has often been insulated from the kind of criticism other major lobbying groups get because people who point out AIPAC's outsize role in elections tend to get accused of engaging in antisemitic tropes.)

“Members of both parties worried about crossing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful bipartisan lobbying organization dedicated to ensuring unwavering U.S. support for Israel,” former President Barack Obama wrote in his memoir, A Promised Land. “Those who criticized Israeli policy too loudly risked being tagged as ‘anti-Israel' (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election.”

AIPAC is just one part of a whole lobbying ecosystem that includes other pro-Israel groups, think tanks, and wealthy individuals who try to influence US policy to support Israel. This is a reflection of the way money in politics works in general: that deep-pocketed donors have way more sway over party leaders than average voters. That's why wealthy individuals and corporations, for example, keep avoiding significant tax hikes despite the fact that higher taxes on millionaires are extremely popular among Americans.

AIPAC seems keenly aware that Democratic voters' views on Israel are shifting fast, so much so that it has become even more aggressive in recent election cycles. In 2024, the group targeted Democratic members of Congress critical of Israel, spending millions to help unseat them. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri both lost their primaries to challengers backed by AIPAC. And as a result of AIPAC's spending, those two races became the most expensive House primaries in US history. (Notably, AIPAC funneled its money on those races through its new super PAC, the vaguely named “United Democracy Project,” which is perhaps a sign that even AIPAC is aware of how toxic its brand has become in Democratic politics.) The millions of dollars AIPAC poured into these primaries were a desperate attempt — amid the quickly changing politics around Israel — to send Democrats a warning: Criticize Israel and you'll still face a well-funded opponent.

Of course, AIPAC's influence has its limits. Despite spending record amounts of money to unseat Bowman and Bush, other representatives who have drawn AIPAC's ire — including Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Summer Lee — won reelection comfortably. In some cases, AIPAC didn't even bother trying, knowing the incumbents were too strong.

That doesn't mean that AIPAC is going away. The group remains a top donor to some major Democratic figures, including Gillibrand and Jeffries. And even Democrats who reject money from pro-Israel groups can still feel boxed in by the Israel lobby. Ocasio-Cortez, for example, specifically turned AIPAC down when they approached her after she won her first primary in 2018. But it's clear why even she is wary of being too outspoken against Israel. Take, for example, her vote for an amendment that would have stripped Israel of military aid. If she has any ambitions for statewide office, it's not difficult to imagine the attack ads against her, calling her out — potentially calling her antisemitic — for voting to strip Israel of money for defensive weapons. And it's easy to see why that prospect would spook her, especially given that her state is home to the largest Jewish population in the US.

Another obstacle to Democrats shifting on Israel is that groups like the Anti-Defamation League have conflated anti-Zionism with antisemitism, making it all the more toxic for politicians to talk more openly about Israel's abysmal human rights record, let alone in support of Palestinian liberation.

There's also a longstanding bias against Palestinians in American politics and culture. Politicians can get away with repeating Israeli talking points that dehumanize Palestinians, including by (as mentioned above) conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism or decrying symbols like the keffiyeh as hateful, without getting as much pushback as they would if they were talking about other ethnic groups. As a result, anti-Palestinian racism is seldom called out as its own form of discrimination and often flies under the radar. That makes it easier to defend Israel because Palestinians are too often treated as an afterthought in US politics, not people who face life or death consequences as a direct result of US policy.

Finally, there's the problem of political inertia. Many establishment politicians who have been around for some time are accustomed to a different political era when support for Israel was unshakeable. They are also part of an older generation whose views on Israel are vastly different from younger Americans. The stark generational divide is even evident among Jewish voters: A recent poll in the New York City mayor's race showed that 67 percent of Jewish voters under the age of 45 support Mamdani, while only 25 percent of Jewish voters over 45 do.

That all helps explain why so many establishment Democrats — used to a kind of politics where Israel enjoyed broad support from voters in both parties — might be reluctant to embrace the new political reality.

But at some point, if Democrats truly want to improve their standing among the public — especially now that their approval ratings have record lows — it might be wise to start actually listening to their voters.

The Democratic Party has many hardline pro-Israel officials, some of whom have gone to great lengths to defend Israel's indefensible actions in Gaza. In 2023, some Democrats even joined their Republican colleagues in censuring Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in the House, over her criticisms of Israel. And while Democrats have had an easier time condemning obvious targets, like Netanyahu's right-wing government or settler violence, they still have trouble criticizing Israel's routine international law violations more broadly.

However, there are signs that Democrats could start changing their posture. In recent years, more and more Democratic members of Congress have become loud critics of Israel and its occupation of Palestine. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who is not exactly a firebrand leftist, has been consistently critical of Israel's war and has even called out the Biden administration's involvement.

These voices are a minority, but they show there is a potential opening for change. The fracture within the party could mean that the Biden administration's record on Gaza will be a topic of fierce debate in the 2028 Democratic primaries, given how Biden enabled one of the bloodiest military assaults this century — one that many Democratic voters, especially young people, view as a genocide. And that could further embolden progressive-leaning Democrats to be more outspoken about their opposition to Israel.

As Mamdani's race in New York City showed last month, that might catch some of the more old-school, establishment Democrats by surprise, since being pro-Palestinian is no longer the third rail in American politics that it was long thought to be.

After all, if Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel, was able to win the Democratic nomination for mayor of the city with the largest Jewish voting bloc in the country, then that kind of politics could have success elsewhere, no matter how hard lobbying groups try to stop it.

AI wants to fix your money problems. What could go wrong?

Recently, as an experiment, I gave a bunch of my financial information to an AI chatbot. I know what you're thinking — it sure doesn't sound like the wisest move. While the large language models that power such bots are good at many things, math is not historically one of them. Still, a growing number of startups are training generative AI tools to work like financial coaches. Some of them are pretty good, too.

Cleo, which bills itself as “the world's first AI financial assistant,” got a big update that uses OpenAI's sophisticated o3 reasoning model to help users break down complex financial decisions. The app also now has the ability to remember your financial history and goals. You can even talk to the app with a new two-way voice feature. At some point, Cleo might ask you if you want to take out a loan.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

I'd been using the previous version of Cleo for a few weeks without any big breakthroughs. But when I linked my bank accounts (securely!) to Cleo 3.0, the latest version of the artificially intelligent financial assistant, I was stunned by how handy it was to ask detailed questions about my spending habits, savings goals, and retirement planning in plain English and get useful answers. The app is built on top of ChatGPT and is specifically trained to handle those kinds of questions. It's also equipped with tools to do the math correctly.

 In the past, only the very wealthy have been able to map out their financial futures like this. In the very near future, anyone could do it for free.

There's something revolutionary about this concept. And that's not just Cleo's executives talking. A number of experts have told me that tools built on top of large language models like ChatGPT stand to transform the world of financial advice and planning. They have the ability to ingest vast amounts of your financial data, they're trained on the same materials a human financial planner might use, and they can answer an endless number of questions based on that knowledge and expertise. In the past, only the very wealthy have been able to map out their financial futures like this. In the very near future, anyone could do it for free.

“We're on the cusp of a pretty significant change in how [people] are able to use AI to help manage their finances,” said Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “I don't think these apps are all ready for primetime, but nonetheless, there is a sea change between today's AI finance applications and what existed even two years ago.”

Such a sea change comes with its own challenges. The arithmetic issue is one of them, although there are ways to build these apps in order to curb hallucinations. Another is ensuring the right guidance is tailored to the right user — what's called “suitability” in the finance world. But, Lo explained, “probably the most important and most difficult challenge is trust and ethics.” How do you ensure an AI fulfills its fiduciary duty to give you the best advice? Licensed financial advisers, who work in a highly regulated industry, can face civil or even criminal charges for failing their clients. An AI currently cannot.

That means you definitely should not let an app talk you into pouring your retirement savings into meme stocks. But you might consider letting a chatbot take a peek at what you're spending on streaming services. Did you know, for instance, that canceling Apple TV+ and putting that $10 a month into an IRA could add up to over $12,000 saved in 30 years? That's a fact I learned from Cleo.

My first brush with algorithmic financial advice was a decade ago, when I downloaded an app called Digit. The proposition was simple: You connect your bank account to Digit, which would analyze your spending and strategically slide a few dollars or cents into a savings account. I ended up saving thousands of dollars using Digit without really noticing, which was precisely the point.

There's a lightness to the Digit experience. Contrast that with Mint, the now-defunct app and website that let you connect to your bank accounts and used machine learning to categorize your spending. Mint was heavy, because it required a lot of time to set up; you had to make sure all the automation was working correctly and then had to keep the settings updated as your financial situation changed. An array of finance and budgeting apps have swept in to replace Mint after its 2024 closure: YNAB, Monarch Money, Origin, to name a few. They're heavy, too, although they're increasingly incorporating AI to make things run more smoothly.

Most of these apps use a service called Plaid in order to keep your financial data secure. Plaid, which is used by companies like Venmo, Robinhood, and Chime, gives the apps real-time, read-only access to your accounts so the apps never have direct access to your money. There's always the risk of a data breach, which is not unheard of in the fintech world.

While Plaid has made it easier for apps to see all your balances and transactions, what people actually need from a fintech app varies widely.

“If the product can help you make a complex financial decision confidently and competently in minutes, instead of hours with a bunch of pain and stress and mental suffering, more people will use it.”

“Personal finance is incredibly niche, because each person, on a set of dimensions, is a unique snowflake financially,” Ethan Bloch, the founder of Digit, told me. Bloch sold Digit to the financial technology, or fintech, company Oportun in 2021 and is currently working on a new AI-powered financial tool called Hiro, which promises to “turn your financial data into personalized advice” through a chatbot. Bloch said that large language models have made this possible and that, like Digit, the experience can be incredibly light and feel effortless.

“If the product can help you make a complex financial decision confidently and competently in minutes, instead of hours with a bunch of pain and stress and mental suffering, more people will use it,” he said.

Of course, this is assuming the AI never gets anything wrong.

Fintech apps are not banks — which means that even though they might handle your money or your financial data, an app like Cleo is not as heavily regulated as a chartered bank, like Chase or Bank of America. Fintech apps might require licenses to take part in certain activities, like moving money between accounts or holding balances. If an app gives investment advice, it might face scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state regulators. For the most part, though, there is no regulatory oversight when it comes to financial coaching, which is what Cleo does.

Making sure AI-powered fintech apps don't dupe Americans was a job for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but it's unclear how much power the agency has under the Trump administration. For example, the CFPB passed a rule last year that established a set of personal financial data rights around what happens when you connect your bank account to an app like Cleo, YNAB, or Monarch Money. That rule is now being rewritten under the Trump administration, as congressional Republicans attempt to defund the CFPB altogether.

“The vision that came out of the financial crisis was that we would have a strong regulator putting consumers first, because for too long, the regulators had put banks first,” said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at Brookings, “and that vision has been destroyed by the Trump administration.”

It almost goes without saying these days that generative AI is a new technology, and the apps using large language models for financial advice are even newer. There is not a lot of oversight of this space — there's not none — but you should be careful when entrusting your financial fate to a chatbot.

The proposition is still intriguing. We've already seen AI chatbots streamline the tax-filing process, and it's increasingly clear that AI can make you better at your job, as long as it's not stealing it. It seems very possible that in the near future, AI will make it easier to make a budget and stick to it. It might help you plan better for your retirement. I am not yet asking an AI chatbot for investment advice — there is just too much downside when it comes to sensitive decisions involving large sums of money. But talking through ideas for how I might get more out of my money and then fact-checking everything the bot tells me? That makes sense. At the end of the day, I still want to talk to living, breathing experts about my big financial decisions.

But for the smaller stuff, this technology could help a lot of people. It could democratize financial advice, in a sense.

“On the bright side, I think that a large number of individuals, who are currently not getting any financial advice and badly need it — they will have access to pretty good financial advice at no cost,” said Lo, the MIT professor. “That's the promise of AI over the course of the next few months, not to mention years.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meta Q2 earnings recap: Stock surges 12% after hours on strong results as AI talent costs heat up","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-earnings-call-report-stock-live-updates-2025-7","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 04:10:00 GMT","

Meta's strong earnings sent its stock soaring after hours as CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company's all-in approach to the AI race.

The company also made it clear that competing in the AI talent war comes with a hefty price tag.

Meta's second-quarter results handily beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share. Revenue was $47.52 billion, compared to expectations of $44.83 billion. Earnings per share were $7.14, compared to estimates of $5.89.

Meta shares were up over 12% in after-hours trading during the analyst call, hitting $780, which would represent an all-time high for the stock.

In a reference to Meta's recent AI hiring spree, the company cited employee compensation for ""technical talent in priority areas"" as its second-largest driver in cost growth, behind infrastructure expenses.

Zuckerberg took a bit of a victory lap after the launch of his new Superintelligence Lab, which is run by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang — a hiring made possible by Meta's eye-watering $15 billion investment in the startup.

""We're building an elite, talent-dense team,"" he said. ""I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter."" He referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, now chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

The Meta CEO is clearly bullish on the idea of leaner AI divisions, praising ""the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research.""

The company also gave updates on its hit AI Ray-Bans, sales of which are ""accelerating"" and helped drive a revenue increase of nearly 5% for the Reality Labs division.

Zuckerberg said that glasses will be ""the ideal form factor for AI,"" echoing his vision he outlined in a letter earlier in the day about ""personal superintelligence.""

On the advertising front, Meta CFO Susan Li said that nearly 2 million advertisers have used the company's AI video generation and image tools.

Scroll on for the highlights from Meta's analyst call:

Analysts are pleased with Meta's results.

William Blair analysts titled their post-earnings note ""Massive Quarter Fueled by AI Advancements"" and shared key reasons for their optimism.

""The company is demonstrating that it can profitably scale the business while making massive capital investments,"" they wrote. ""We continue to be positive on its AI adoption and benefits to advertisers and believe Meta will be a long-term AI leader.

RBC analysts called Meta's performance a ""Strong Q2"" and highlighted how the company delivered 22% revenue growth at the ""high-end of guidance and expectations.""

And Wedbush's tech analyst Dan Ives, a perennial tech bull, expressed his approval in a post on X.

""We have been talking about the AI Revolution for years but tonight was a night the tech world and the Street will remember for a long time,"" he wrote.

""The jaw dropping numbers from Redmond and Meta speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of hyper growth,"" he added, referring to Microsoft and Meta results.

""I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you'd probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people,"" Zuckerberg says.

Glasses will be the ""ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together,"" he predicts, mentioning the metaverse.

(Note: This appears to be the only mention of the ""metaverse"" in the earnings call; many people will remember when the metaverse was a big buzzword in Meta's earnings. Looks like that's ""superintelligence"" now.)

Meta's stock is trading up 12% to $778 after hours, a record level for the company.

Zuckerberg talks about the smaller size of Meta's new Superintelligence Labs team.

It's an echo of what he's said about building lean teams focused on efficiency. He praises ""the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research.""

It breaks from how the company operates in other divisions, he notes.

""If you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or 1000s of people basically working on improving those systems,"" he says. ""But I think for this, for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head.""

Zuckerberg says he doesn't believe his thinking on open-source has particularly changed.

Zuckerberg expects to continue to ship open-source products, though there are some challenging considerations with open-sourcing at this scale, he says.

""We're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that,"" he says.

The bottom line, Zuckerberg says, is he expects to continue to ship open-source products, but not every product will be — which he says is a continuation of Meta's approach to open-source.

""There's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now,"" Zuckerberg notes. ""The more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen.""

The stock price hits $771 as questions with Wall Street analysts begin.

Li says the company continues to focus on head count growth in its ""highest priority areas.""

""We've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives,"" she says.

Turning to AI-related infrastructure costs, Meta also expects to ""ramp our investments significantly in 2026"" for infrastructure.

""Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation, and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features,"" CFO Susan Li says.

In the second quarter, the company started testing AI-powered translations to 10 different languages, she adds.

Meta says Reality Labs revenue, its segment that includes its AI hardware as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets, is up nearly 5% — thanks to sales of its AI Ray-Bans.

Zuckerberg says that he thinks AI glasses will be ""the main way"" that the company integrates personal superintelligence into people's daily lives.

The Meta CEO says the company has built an ""elite"" team of AI researchers and engineers, highlighting the hire of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who leads the new lab.

""We're building an elite, talent-dense team,"" he said. ""I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter."" He also referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

The company has noted in its earnings release that employee compensation for adding technical talent in ""priority areas"" (read AI) is its second-greatest driver of cost growth.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on the call, along with CFO Susan Li.

""Meta's blowout earnings and raised guidance highlight how AI is becoming a real revenue driver, not just hype,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""From ad targeting to content discovery, Meta is showing how to deploy AI at scale — and Wall Street is rewarding it. The company's continued heavy investment in AI infrastructure signals it's playing the long game and betting big on foundational models and compute power.""

Minda Smiley, senior analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said the company's strong quarter shows it ""not only weathered but perhaps even benefitted from economic instability in recent months"" and that the digital ads market more broadly ""might not yet feel the pain from tariffs, though that could change.""

And while Meta continues pouring money into its AI ambitions, ""Meta's exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns,"" Smiley said.

The company revised its ranges on total expenses and capital expenditures it forecasts for 2025, narrowing its estimates.

Its total expense outlook, previously $113 to $118 billion, is now $114 to $118 billion for the year. (That's growth of 20 to 24% year-over-year.)

Meta also narrowed its capex range, from $64 to $72 billion previously to $66 to $72 billion for the year. It says it also expects ""another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026.""

Those AI talent wars you've been reading about? They're real — and expensive — Meta says.

Not in those words, exactly. But that's clearly what the company is getting at in today's note to investors, where it acknowledged that all that spending is indeed going to show up on its financial statements.

""While we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate,"" Meta said. ""The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet.""

""Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas,"" Meta added.

That said, Meta says its overall organization got smaller in the last quarter. It currently employs 75,945 people, down about 1% from the 76,834 it reported in Q1.

Meta's hardware sales could be key to watch in light of some new developments since the company's last earnings call.

In June, Zuckerberg unveiled new Oakley Meta glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses but branded as ""performance AI glasses"" geared toward athletes. Earlier this week, EssilorLuxottica, which makes Ray-Ban and Oakley, said revenue from sales of Meta's Ray-Bans more than tripled year-over-year.

Wall Street was impressed with Meta's demo of its Orion augmented reality glasses prototype in September, though the glasses aren't expected to launch to consumers before 2027. Any update on the expected timeline for the more advanced AI smart glasses, which included integrated displays in the lenses, would be of interest to investors.

Meta stock edged 0.6% lower Wednesday afternoon as investors prepared to parse the company's quarterly results.

Shares of the tech giant are up 19% year-to-date.

You can expect AI to be a heavy focus on this earnings call. (What else is new?) The company is allocating billions in capital expenditures toward infrastructure, talent, and other costs to support its AI ambitions.

Meta has been in an all-out talent war for the biggest names in AI, poaching some competitors from rival firms with million-dollar bonuses.

The company in June announced a new AI division called Superintelligence Labs. The company took a 49% stake in Scale AI for nearly $15 billion to make Scale founder Alexandr Wang Meta's new chief AI officer.

— Sarah Jackson

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote this month that investors will likely be most interested in three things heading into Meta's earnings call:

Still, Zino said he expects Meta to meet its expected revenue targets for the second and third quarters, largely due to increased stability in the digital ad market.

CFRA reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $800 from $750, implying 12% upside from current levels.

Zuckerberg kicked off the company's earnings day by sharing his vision on superintelligence, which he believes is ""now in sight."" His memo Wednesday outlined his hope for a future where everyone has ""a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals.""

""Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful,"" he wrote. ""Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices."" (Of course, it's worth noting that Meta sells various smart glasses.)

— Sarah Jackson

Meta could lift its capital expenditures even higher as it ploughs more money into AI and superintelligence projects, analysts at Citizens wrote.

""With Meta making material investments in its superintelligence team, including researchers and compute, we believe the company is going through a significant investment cycle and we expect 2026 CapEx to surprise the Street as Meta builds multiple 1GQ or greater data centers,"" they said, estimating capex could come in around $91 billion next year.

Stocks typically don't benefit when a company is going through an investment cycle, analysts said, but the situation could be different for Meta, as AI can enhance the ad experience for users.

The firm reiterated its ""Market Outperform"" rating and $750 price target on the stock, implying 5% upside from current levels.

Needham had a mixed view of Meta headed into its second-quarter earnings.

On the one hand, the firm's analysts upgraded their rating for the stock from ""Underperform"" to ""Hold,"" citing two positive catalysts:

Still, the firm sees a few risks ahead that held it back from rating the stock a ""buy.""

Those include pressure on Meta's margins and free-cash flow, potentially higher-than-expected total labor costs due to stock-based compensation, and Meta's use of several strategies in its business, which ""wastes capital and adds risks,"" analysts said.

Oppenheimer said it sees a handful of risks looming for Meta stock.

Oppenheimer reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $775 a share, implying 9% upside from current levels.

Bank of America called Meta a ""Top Online ad stock"" for 2025 in a note this month.

That's because the company looks best-positioned to reap the benefits from AI-driven advertising, analysts wrote, which they believe could support a higher valuation for the stock.

In a separate note, analysts said they expected Meta to beat consensus estimates for second-quarter earnings, pointing to positive checks the bank conducted on Meta's advertising business. Revenue could come in around $45.5 billion, they estimated, at the higher end of Meta's guidance for the quarter.

The bank reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on Meta. Earlier this month, it lifted its price target for the stock to $775 from $765, which implies 9% upside from current levels.

Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said on Wednesday that the Trump administration's tariff policy would saddle the automaker with a $2 billion bill while benefiting its Japanese rivals.

""Our tariff bill is $2 billion, and that's a net number,"" Farley said in an earnings call. The company had projected a tariff hit of $1.5 billion in its last quarter.

Farley told analysts he expected automakers to adopt a regional rather than globalized approach toward their businesses. In addition to tariffs, Farley said the change was being driven by the rise of electric vehicles and new carbon regulations.

""We increasingly see Europe, North America, and Asia becoming kind of regional businesses with tariff rates that are aligned for those three or four regions,"" Farley said.

""This is quite a fundamental change,"" he added.

Representatives for Ford and the White House didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg on the same day that the Trump administration's reduced tariffs on Japan would give its Asian rivals a ""meaningful"" cost advantage. Last week, President Donald Trump said the US would lower its tariffs on Japan to 15% from 25%.

The reduced tariffs, lower labour costs, and favorable exchange rates ""really advantage their export,"" Farley said.

A Kentucky-built Ford Escape could cost $5,000 more than a Japanese-made Toyota Rav4, while a Michigan-made Ford Bronco might be undercut by a Toyota 4Runner to the tune of $10,000, Farley added.

Farley told Bloomberg that Ford was working with the Trump administration to ""minimize our tariff expense so that we can get more competitive.""

""But the bottom line is our plan at Ford is not to compete in those commodity segments,"" he continued.

This isn't the first time Farley has talked about the challenges Ford faces in the face of a new slate of tariffs. Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year that Trump's 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico was a ""windfall for South Korean and Japanese companies.""

""In our guidance, we can handle a couple of weeks of tariffs. If it goes beyond that, obviously, it will be billions and billions of incremental profit headwinds for the company,"" Farley told the outlet in February.

On Wednesday, Ford's shares fell by nearly 1.6% in after-hours trading. The company's shares are up by 9.8% year to date.

Your college might be on President Donald Trump's watch list.

Last week, the Department of Education released new data on student-loan borrowers' nonpayment rates, or the percentage of borrowers who have entered repayment since January 2020 with student loans that were more than 90 days past due when the data was collected in May 2025.

The data was a warning sign for for-profit schools: It found that 30% of borrowers who attended for-profit institutions were behind on their payments, compared to 16% of borrowers at public schools and 14% of borrowers at private schools. If nonpayment rates do not improve by next year, schools on that list risk losing federal student aid, including student loans and Pell Grants.

Cosmetology and barber schools were high on the nonpayment list: Networks Barber College in Illinois and Washington Barber College in Arkansas had 67% nonpayment rates, and Foster's Cosmetology and Barber College in Mississippi had a 64% rate.

It's not just for-profit colleges: Independence Community College, a public Kansas school, has a 49% nonpayment rate, and Carolina Christian College, a private North Carolina school, has a 61% rate.

Have a story to share about college or student debt? Reach out to this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.

Since 2020, the department has not been collecting data on the number of graduates who are in delinquency or default on their student loans because of an ongoing pandemic pause on collections. It also meant that the department was not penalizing colleges for high default rates by cutting off their access to federal student aid, a practice that was in place prior to the pandemic.

However, Trump's administration restarted collections on defaulted student loans in May, meaning that the tracking is back on. Colleges could lose aid if they exceed 30% of the cohort default rate — the percentage of borrowers who default on their debt — for three consecutive years, or 40% for one year.

Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, said that with collections having resumed on defaulted student loans, he said that the rate will likely continue to surge.

""The cohort default rate has been essentially a non-factor for the last five years,"" Cooper said. ""But now it's entirely possible that it's going to come back with a vengeance.""

Cooper said it could take at least a year for schools on the list to actually lose federal student aid because it takes time for defaults to reflect in the data the department collects, and schools can also attempt to appeal. However, that time can go by quickly, and he said that it's in schools' best interests to start helping borrowers with repayment before it's too late.

""Schools do have quite a bit of runway here,"" Cooper said. ""I do think that they cannot plead ignorance. They have plenty of lead time to come up with a plan to avoid the worst consequences of triggering the cohort default rates. And if they don't, I would say that's on them.""

Before the latest nonpayment data was released, the Department of Education in May urged all colleges that receive federal aid to remind students of their options to repay their student loans.

""For too long, insufficient transparency and accountability structures have allowed U.S. universities to saddle students with enormous debt loads without paying enough attention to whether their own graduates are truly prepared to succeed in the labor market,"" Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said in a statement.

Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the progressive think tank The Century Foundation, told BI that enforcing accountability will be difficult. The Department of Education estimated that 10 million borrowers could default this summer after the collections restart, and ongoing efforts to dismantle the department and fire staff mean that borrowers will have limited resources to get help determining their repayment options.

Gutting the department also means that oversight over for-profit schools, many of which have shut down or faced litigation over the past years over accusations of predatory behavior that loaded students up with unaffordable debt, will be minimal.

""There are a lot of programs out there that are getting a lot of federal money, that are just not doing a good job for students,"" Fast said.

The nonpayment data doesn't mean that every school on the list will lose federal aid. Fast said that schools will likely bolster outreach to students to mitigate the problem by reestablishing contact with graduates and informing them of existing repayment plans.

Trump's latest spending law eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two, less generous options that will go into effect in July 2026. This means that borrowers will have to navigate a changing repayment system while working to avoid default.

""It's just a flag that these are institutions who have very, very high rates of student loan delinquencies, and that is an indicator that they could have a serious problem down the road,"" Fast said.

In this article

Microsoft has abandoned a decades-long tradition of calling out the names of its rivals in regulatory documents.

When the 50-year-old technology company released its annual report Wednesday, the 101-page document contained zero references to longtime foes Apple and IBM. Nor did it mention privately held challengers such as Anthropic or Databricks. 

Last year's Microsoft annual report officially designated over 25 companies as competitors. The names of Microsoft's enemies have appeared in its annual reports at least since 1994.

The omission means Microsoft is breaking from a common industry practice. Apple, Meta and Nvidia all namedrop the companies they go up against.

It's not universally followed, though. Amazon has not identified competitors in annual reports since 1999. Tesla last did it in 2020, and Alphabet halted after 2022.

Now, Microsoft just says it faces competition in a wide variety of markets, including productivity software, PC operating systems and cloud infrastructure.

The more specific disclosures helped to show where companies stood with the biggest name in software. In 2024, Microsoft started referring to key partner OpenAI as a competitor, after the artificial intelligence startup introduced a web search feature.

A Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC that the company updated the competition portion of the annual report to address larger categories. The new format reflects the fast-moving nature of the markets in which the company operates, the spokesperson said.

That's not to say Microsoft executives have stopped tracking developments at other technology companies. 

CEO Satya Nadella referred to Amazon on Microsoft's earnings call on Wednesday. 

Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group, said at a conference in May that ""there are some cloud providers, like AWS, that still haven't launched a GB200 offering."" 

Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 systems include 72 interconnected graphics processing units.

Microsoft shares climbed Thursday, a day after the company issued quarterly results and guidance that came in better than expected. The stock move sent the company's market capitalization past the $4 trillion mark.

Shares of Meta soared 12% and Microsoft popped 5% on Thursday, after the companies reported better-than-expected earnings that beat on top and bottom lines.

Microsoft topped the $4 trillion market cap benchmark with the move, joining Nvidia in the club.

Both Meta and Microsoft have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure in recent years, and the companies said they expect to continue to shell out billions in capital expenditures.

Meta said capital expenditures will range between $66 billion and $72 billion for the full year, raising the low end of the company's previous estimate of between $64 billion and $72 billion. Microsoft sees over $30 billion in fiscal first quarter capital expenditures and assets acquired through finance leases, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected $24.23 billion.

Analysts at Citi said the companies' increased capital expenditures will likely be a boon for chipmakers. Microsoft makes up roughly 8% of Advanced Micro Devices' sales, while Meta makes up about 2% of Broadcom's sales, the analysts said.

""We believe AVGO and AMD will be the primary beneficiaries of Microsoft's and Meta's increased capex,"" they wrote in a Thursday note.

In addition to increased capital expenditures, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been on an AI hiring blitz, highlighted by a $14.3 billion investment into the data-labeling startup Scale AI and the launch of its new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit.

Morgan Stanley analysts said they ""applaud the effort"" and are pleased with the state of Meta's core business, but they remain a little wary of Zuckerberg's AI spending.

""On one hand, the core business is so strong that it's paying for all the new AI talent and infra several times over, but on the other hand the cavalier nature by which Zuckerberg is throwing money around is a bit unnerving, especially if things don't come together as planned with the new superintelligence team,"" the analysts wrote.

Barclays analysts said Microsoft's generative AI scaling is still playing out, but the strong demand for its data center infrastructure continues to point to ongoing momentum for the quarters ahead. They maintained their overweight rating on the stock.

""With its strong Q4 FY25 results, MSFT confirmed its unique status in the software space and will likely continue to be one of the core holdings by investors,"" they wrote in a note Wednesday.

Microsoft reported $76.44 billion in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 18% year over year. The company said net income increased to $27.23 billion, or $3.65 per share, from $22.04 billion a year ago.

Meta reported $47.52 billion in revenue for its second quarter, up 22% year over year. Its net income rose 36% year over year to $18.34 billion, or $7.14 per share.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday expressed confidence that the U.S. and China are on the way to a trade pact as a key tariff deadline nears.

""I believe that we have the makings of a deal,"" Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's still a few technical details to be worked out on the Chinese side between us. I'm confident that it will be done, but it's not 100% done.""

Bessent did not provide any details on what a final deal with China would look like.

However, he stressed that he hasn't discussed the issue yet with President Donald Trump, noting that the two sides negotiated in Stockholm for two days in talks he characterized as ""tough."" Trump has said he would need to sign off personally on any deal with China.

""The Chinese are tough negotiators. We're tough, too,"" he said.

The two sides currently are in truce over tariffs after launching aggressive duties on each other previously. They have until Aug. 12 to come to an agreement. The U.S. had implemented 145% duties on Chinese imports, while China had countered with a 125% rate.

Since then, the U.S. lowered its rate to 30% while China cut to 10%.

The U.S. has expressed concern about China purchasing Iranian oil and supplying Russia with technology that could be used on the battlefield.

In this article

Moderna on Thursday said it plans to slash roughly 10% of its global workforce by the end of the year, as Covid shot sales continue to dwindle and the company grapples with uncertainty in the vaccine market. 

In a memo to employees, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the company expects to have fewer than 5,000 workers by the end of the year. Moderna had approximately 5,800 full-time employees in 18 countries as of Dec. 31, 2024, according to its 2024 annual report. 

Shares of Moderna have dropped more than 20% this year. In May, the company reported first-quarter vaccine sales that missed Wall Street's estimates. Moderna is also navigating policy hurdles under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has taken steps to change vaccine guidelines and potentially threaten access to shots in the U.S.

Also in May, Moderna said it will reduce annual operating expenses by about $1.5 billion by 2027. That target adds to cuts that the company previously announced.

Moderna will provide another update on its business when it posts quarterly results Friday morning.

In the memo, Bancel said Moderna has made significant progress toward cuts by scaling down research and development, especially as it concludes trials on respiratory products, renegotiates supplier agreements and reduces manufacturing costs. 

""Every effort was made to avoid affecting jobs,"" he said. ""But today, reshaping our operating structure and aligning our cost structure to the realities of our business are essential to remain focused and financially disciplined, while continuing to invest in our science on the path to 2027.""

He said the ""future of Moderna is bright,"" noting that it now has three approved products and the potential for up to eight more in the next three years. In May, the Food and Drug Administration approved Moderna's third-ever product, a next-generation Covid shot.

But Bancel said ""this decision was not made lightly.""

""It impacts teammates and friends who have dedicated themselves to our mission and who have helped build Moderna,"" he said. ""I want to express, on behalf of the entire Executive Committee and on behalf of patients you have served, our deepest thanks for everything you have contributed.""

For every high schooler, the college admissions process is incredibly daunting. Thankfully, for me, the years of hard work all paid off.

I recently graduated from PCTI STEM Academy in Wayne, New Jersey. This spring, I was accepted into 10 of the top 25 universities in the U.S., including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania. This fall, I'll be attending Harvard University.

Among my acceptances, I was offered a merit-based full-ride from Washington University as a Langsdorf Scholar and a direct phone call from their Dean of Engineering, along with a Likely Scholar Designation through Columbia University's C.P. Davis Scholar program.

What made all the difference? It started long before high school, with the way my parents raised me. We couldn't afford college consultants or expensive enrichment programs, so they focused on simple, consistent routines that laid the foundation for my success.

Research consistently shows that good sleep and proper nutrition lead to better academic performance. My parents took this seriously.

To make sure I got enough rest, my dad would wake up early so that he could drive me to school every morning before heading into work. Not having to catch the bus gave me an extra hour of sleep. My mom would similarly get up before sunrise, sometimes as early as 4:30 a.m., so that she could make me a nutritious breakfast — usually a couple of eggs, some protein, and garlic toast.

My parents also arranged their schedules so that I'd never come home to an empty house. As soon as I was done with school, they'd be home from work.

In Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" he talks about how success requires not just talent and hard work, but also finding opportunities to develop our own interests. That really stuck with me.

At the start of high school, I was too focused on academics. Yet, my parents encouraged me to join clubs. If I didn't like it, I didn't have to commit. Growing up, my immigrant parents didn't have access to extracurricular activities. I was reminded of how lucky I am.

I became one of the most involved students in my district, and surprisingly ended up having a lot of fun. I participated in Robotics, Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), and SkillsUSA. I even worked on real-world engineering projects, like optimizing math models for school-based initiatives.

My proudest accomplishment? Leading a NASA HUNCH team that designed a lunar rover built to survive the moon's harsh terrain. We were invited to present our design at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, directly to NASA engineers and astronauts.

My parents taught me that you can become talented through skill development, but you need opportunities to put that talent to good use.

My parents, who immigrated to the U.S. without a formal American education, taught me that success means more than grades. It's also about character.

They instilled in me values rooted in our Islamic faith: curiosity about the world, honesty, gratitude, and perseverance. Our faith also encourages us to observe and appreciate the beauty of the world, which is initially what got me interested in science!

Those values shaped how I approached everything, from academics to relationships with teachers and classmates. When it came time for recommendation letters, my teachers didn't just write about my grades. They spoke about who I am as a person, and that came from how my parents raised me.

What matters most to me is giving back — to my parents, my community, and everyone who helped me along the way. I believe that's how I'll truly make the most out of my Harvard education.

Hebba Youssef recognizes that the world of work is changing rapidly.

Youssef is the chief people officer at Workweek, a professional networking startup. She's also the creator of ""I Hate It Here,"" a biweekly newsletter about HR and recruiting, which is hosted by Workweek.

In the past few years alone, American workers have weathered major shifts like the growth of remote and hybrid work and the rise of AI technology, she says.

For that reason, the top qualities she looks for in job candidates today are curiosity and adaptability.

""In a world that's rapidly changing, if you're curious about the problem the company is trying to solve, its positioning in the world, and how this role is going to contribute to the company's success, I think those are giant green flags,"" she says.

With AI gaining traction in the workplace, employers will want to see that prospective hires are able to quickly adjust to new technology, she says.

Youssef points to a quote from Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang: ""You're not going to lose your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.""

That's why she believes it's crucial to highlight your AI skills during the job process.

A candidate who is thinking about how to apply AI to the role ""would really stand out"" in an interview — it gives them a ""killer edge,"" Youssef says.

She's always impressed by interviewees who present strategies to make the job ""better and easier and more efficient.""

Before the interview, Youssef recommends doing your research to determine which AI tools align with the position's main duties. For instance, a candidate interviewing for a marketing role could look into AI tools that make it easier to analyze the outcomes of ad campaigns.

The role may not require that employees use AI just yet, but it's beneficial for candidates to demonstrate that they have ""a basic comprehension of what AI is and what its capabilities are,"" she says.

Eventually, ""we'll see more and more job descriptions have AI literacy as a job requirement,"" Youssef says, ""so it'll be important for you to upskill yourself.""

At the same time, Youssef acknowledges that AI technology is constantly evolving, which makes it difficult to stay abreast of the latest advancements.

Today's top AI skills could become obsolete in just a few months, she says, which is a ""genuinely scary"" prospect.

Still, she maintains that having a basic understanding of AI demonstrates to employers that you're capable of keeping pace with new developments.

AI is going to disrupt ""every single industry,"" Youssef says. ""There is nothing it's not going to touch.""

In this article

Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said Thursday that artificial intelligence doesn't pose a serious threat to the future of the design software company, which is on the verge of debuting on the public markets.

""We're in this moment where you might, if you're singularity-pilled, go, 'Hey, superintelligence is coming and it'll be able to do things that no human can do,'"" Field told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""I have a harder time believing that we're going to approach that really quickly right now, but that doesn't mean it's out of the picture.""

Figma is slated to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""FIG"" on Thursday. Last week, the company estimated that it would price shares in the range of $25 to $28, and on Wednesday it priced above that range at $33 a share.

The offering values Figma, which ranked No. 45 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, at $19.3 billion.

The company was supposed to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal was scrapped in December 2023 after regulators objected.

So-called superintelligence, a type of artificial intelligence that would be more powerful than the human brain, has recently become a growing focus among technology companies.

Field told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin that the company's ""complex"" graphics engine and other aspects of its technology make it difficult to be replaced by superintelligence.

""I think that's not stuff that you can learn from looking at code and sort of various places on the internet,"" Field said. ""It's not part of the pretraining data mix. I believe that doing that at scale — it's quite difficult.""

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been especially vocal about the potential for superintelligence, declaring in a Wednesday memo that the technology will serve as a tool for ""individual empowerment"" over automation and efficiency.

Meta recently created a lab to pursue superintelligence, and Zuckerberg has poured billions of dollars into building a roster of top AI talent.

Shares of AB InBev plunged as much as 11% Thursday after the world's largest brewer posted a worse-than-feared decline in second-quarter volumes, even as revenues and profits surged ahead.

The Budweiser maker said volumes declined 1.9% year-on-year over the three-month period, well ahead of the 0.3% dip forecast by analysts on the back of weaker demand for its beer products.

Shares had pared down their losses and were last seen down 9.1% at 10:27 a.m. London time (5:27 a.m. ET).

The drop was led by China, where volumes were down 7.4% and where the company said it was ""underperforming the industry."" The weakness was also driven by Brazil, where AB InBev cited high comparisons and adverse weather as prompting a 6.5% decline in the second quarter.

Despite the volume falls, quarterly operating profit jumped 6.5% year-on-year, well above the 5.7% that analysts expected, as consumers have coughed up more cash for beers. It comes off the back of a bumper profit jump in the first quarter.

Revenues rose 3% on an organic basis to $15 billion, as sales picked up in the U.S. — one of its core markets — following a first-quarter drop.

AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the results pointed to the ""resilience of the beer category"" and the continued momentum of the company's ""megabrands,"" which also include Stella Artois and Corona.

Analysts nevertheless said the size of the volumes miss was likely to weigh on the stock, which was up around 19% year-to-date as of the market close Wednesday.

""The scale of the volume miss in China and Brazil, as well as the weaker than expected performance in Middle Americas and EMEA is likely to overshadow another strong quarter of EBITDA growth, UBS analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

It comes as divergence has emerged within the drinks sector, with brewers expected to emerge as a relative winner from U.S. tariffs, given their localized production — compared with wines and spirits, which rely on provenance.

Wines and spirit producers are now hoping for a tariff carve-out under the EU and U.S.'s framework trade deal. A decision on that is expected in the coming weeks, with the broad 15% rate expected to apply to EU exports to the U.S. in the interim, according to Reuters. CNBC has reached out to the European Commission for comment. 

The beer industry, meanwhile, is facing 50% tariffs on aluminum, which are expected to drive up the cost of beer cans produced in the U.S. AB InBev said in May that 98% of its cans are produced locally.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields were lower on Thursday as investors parsed the personal consumption expenditures index for June — the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.

The 10-year Treasury yield dipped 3 basis point to 4.348%. The 2-year yield was little changed at 3.937%, and the 30-year bond yield shed 3.2 basis points to 4.881%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors were closely parsing the Fed's favored inflation print, the personal consumption expenditures price index, on Thursday. Headline PCE advanced 2.6% on a 12-month basis, above the forecast 2.5% from economists polled by Dow Jones.

That comes after the Fed held rates steady at a range of between 4.25% and 4.5%, in a widely expected move on Wednesday. However, not all Fed members were happy with the decision. Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller disagreed with the move to keep the interest rate unchanged.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said policymakers will wait to make sure the tariffs don't turn into ""serious inflation"" at his press conference after the meeting.

""We have made no decisions about September,"" Powell said regarding the next rate decision. ""We don't do that in advance.""

He added: ""We'll be taking that information into consideration and all the other information we get as we make our decision.""

On the tariff front, investors are watching as the Aug. 1 deadline approaches, which is when President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff pause will end. The U.S. has only made eight deals in 120 days.

""I think the inflation numbers that need watching will be coming out in the August reports which will reflect June data.  People forget that the numbers we talk about are all seasonally adjusted and are not taking into account the non-seasonality of tariff changes, which is to be expected,"" said Arthur Laffer, president of Laffer Tengler Investments. ""My concern in the short run is that goods price increases may finally show up in the August reports for CPI."" 

Weekly jobless claims are also due on Thursday.

OpenAI on Thursday said it is launching a Stargate-branded AI data center in Norway, marking its first foray into Europe with such a project.

British firm Nscale will design and build the site as part of a 50-50 joint venture with Norwegian energy infrastructure firm Aker.

OpenAI will be a so-called ""off-taker"" in the project, meaning it will effectively buy capacity from the data center.

""Part of the purpose of this project is to partner with OpenAI and leverage European sovereign compute to release additional services and features to the European continent,"" Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale, told CNBC in an interview on Thursday.

The site aims to deliver 100,000 NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPU) by the end of 2026, ""with the intention to expand significantly in the years ahead,"" OpenAI said in a press release. The companies said the data center will run entirely on renewable power and have 230 megawatts of capacity, making it one of the biggest in Europe.

Nvidia's GPUs have become the de facto choice of chips for data centers because of their ability to handle large AI workloads.

For the Norway project, Nscale and Aker have each committed around $1 billion to the initial 20MW phase of the project. The site will be located in Kvandal, just outside Narvik in northern Norway. The companies said the region is characterized by ""abundant hydropower, low local electricity demand, and limited transmission capacity.""

Payne declined to comment on how Nscale would fund this project or the financial benefits of the project to the company. The CEO said there were no plans for additional Stargate data centers but that Nscale has its own ""robust European expansion plan.""

Stargate was initially launched this year in the U.S. as an infrastructure project between OpenAI, Oracle, Japan's SoftBank, and the UAE's MGX. The project aims to invest $500 billion over the next four years, building out AI infrastructure.

OpenAI has looked to take this initiative globally. In June, the company and its partners announced plans to build a Stargate campus in the UAE.

Europe has meanwhile been pushing the concept of ""sovereign AI,"" requiring data centers and AI workloads to be located and processed on European soil.

Payne said Europe has two ""problems"" — the first is that it does not have enough computing capacity, and the second it is ""very fragmented.""

""What the continent needs is large AI infrastructure projects deploying compute [power]. The ecosystem can consume from the project to build AI products, to generate productivity growth and economic benefit,"" Payne said.

Companies like Nvidia and OpenAI have also been touting their ability to deliver sovereign AI as they look to expand their businesses.

In a trip to Europe this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urged the continent to build more AI infrastructure. French AI company Mistral announced plans to use Nvidia's GPUs in a new data center planned for France.

Blue-collar jobs have a new sheen to them as desk workers become increasingly vulnerable to being replaced by artificial intelligence.

Microsoft examined the link between how much certain workers rely on AI tools and the potential impact to their professions, in a new report titled ""Occupational Implications of Generative AI.""

The tech giant's researchers analyzed data from 200,000 anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations in the U.S. between users and the tech giant's AI chatbot companion, Microsoft Bing Copilot, gathered over nine months between January and September 2024.

The analysis, published last week, focused on users seeking assistance from Copilot to complete a task, defined as the ""user goal"" by researchers. Meanwhile, AI performing a task within the conversation was labelled ""AI action."" This determined which work activities generative AI was completing. In some cases, the AI was providing instructions on how to perform a task.

""To illustrate the distinction, if the user is trying to figure out how to print a document, the user goal is to operate office equipment, while the AI action is to train others to use equipment,"" the report said.

The researchers found that users were most actively seeking help from AI for ""information gathering, writing, and communicating with others,"" and these actions were also the most successfully completed tasks by AI.

""On the AI action side, we see that AI often acts in a service role to the human as a coach, advisor, or teacher that gathers information and explains it to the user.""

This has put occupations like interpreters, translators, historians, writers, and sales representatives at the highest risk of AI adoption and impact.

However, blue-collar professionals, many of whom do physical work either with people or machines, were the least likely to be seeking help from AI, and were therefore classified as the occupations least impacted by AI.

This includes roles like dishwashers, massage therapists, roofers, maids, and housekeeping cleaners.

A recent Gallup report showed that it's mainly white-collar workers increasing AI-use with 27% frequently using AI at work, up 12% since 2024. Industries with the most prolific AI users were tech (50%), professional services (34%), and finance (32%.)

Meanwhile, frequent use of AI by production and frontline workers was flat for two years, from 11% in 2023 to 9% in 2025, per Gallup.

Microsoft's researchers did note that their measurements were purely focused on large language models (LLMs), and other applications of AI could affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.

""AI has really transformed white collar work and the skills premiums are shrinking dramatically,"" future of work expert Ravin Jesuthasan told CNBC Make It in an interview. ""People need to upskill and reskill at real scale and speed.""

He added: ""If I'm a plumber, we're a long, long way from a machine being able to replace me as a plumber, because the set of plumbing fixtures I have in my house look completely different from yours and so the ability of a robot to sort of be able to do that [is small.] So there is a lot more stability.""

Jesuthasan explained that blue-collar roles have evolved in the past few decades and have become more attractive career paths for young people, and with the low risk of AI exposure, blue-collar jobs will only become more popular.

""Two things: One is they [blue-collar jobs] are growing in demand, they're a lot more stable. But also they are increasingly requiring a lot more technological knowledge, so people who have gotten those skills are saying, 'It's not like I'm working on the shop floor, lifting and carrying stuff. I'm actually operating some really complex equipment here.'

""The manufacturing job that in the past was grimy and dirty and grungy is now actually one that pays incredibly well because it's a much more technical role.""

Britain's Shell on Thursday reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit and maintained the pace of its shareholder returns, despite the impact of lower global oil and gas prices.

The energy giant posted adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the three months through June, beating analyst expectations of $3.87 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.

A separate, company-provided analyst forecast had expected Shell's second-quarter profit to come in at $3.74 billion.

Shell reported adjusted earnings of $6.29 billion over the same period last year and $5.58 billion in the first three months of 2025.

The results come shortly after the London-listed firm flagged weaker trading results at its integrated gas division and losses at its chemicals and products arm.

Shell also announced another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months, keeping the pace of its shareholder returns. It marks the 15th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks.

""The backdrop of the macro has been challenging, and what I would say is we continue on the momentum that we have in transforming Shell,"" CEO Wael Sawan told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

""On all measures, [I'm] pleased with that performance. And on the trading side, indeed, despite difficult macro, pleased with how the team has performed,"" Sawan said.

Shares of Shell were up 0.9% at around 12:14 p.m. London time (7:14 a.m. ET).

In March, Shell announced plans to prioritize shareholder returns, ramp up the cost of savings and double down on its liquified natural gas (LNG) push. The strategic update was designed to bolster its commitment to value creation, while maintaining focus on ""performance, discipline and simplification.""

The plan appears to have been well received by investors. Shell's share price has outperformed many of its European and U.S. rivals so far this year, notching gains of 8%. By comparison, Britain's BP is up 3%, France's TotalEnergies is down 2% and Exxon Mobil is up 4% over the same period.

Notably, Shell recently dismissed speculation about a possible takeover bid for BP, saying in late June that it had ""no intention"" of making an offer for its struggling domestic rival.

Asked about the prospect of acquisitions and whether the current state of play means bigger is better for oil companies, Sawan replied: ""I don't buy bigger is better. I think you have to drive it from a value perspective.""

Shell's CEO said scale is not of concern for the world's largest trader of liquified natural gas (LNG).

""It is how do we leverage that scale by focusing on the areas where we have competitive strengths and the areas where can create value,"" he addd.

Shell on Thursday said that it achieved structural cost reductions of $800 million through the first six months of 2025, bringing cumulative reductions since 2022 to $3.9 billion. Earlier in the year, the company set a cost reduction target of $5-7 billion by the end of 2028.  

The company's net debt, meanwhile, came in at $43.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $41.5 billion on a quarterly basis.

Shell's Sawan repeated his comments from earlier in the year when asked about the prospect of the company moving its listing from London to New York, saying it is not a live discussion.

""Part of the reason is actually we have been outperforming. We have been able to just stick to our own story, just deliver on what we say we're going to do. At Capital Markets Day we used the old tag line: 'You can be sure of Shell,'"" Sawan said.

""On the back of that, we feel more and more confident that our message is getting through to those pools of capital that want to invest in this differentiated investment thesis that we have,"" he added.

Early into Donald Trump's second term as US president, the CEO of energy infrastructure company Hut 8, Asher Genoot, and Hut 8 chief strategy officer Michael Ho shared thin-crust pizza with Trump's son Eric at the Trump golf club in Jupiter, Florida. They talked for hours, says Genoot, and tabled a business venture that greatly interested Trump: a bitcoin mining alliance.

They first met through mutual friends in late 2024: Genoot says he'd shown Eric photos of their “beautiful, liquid cool data center” in Amarillo, Texas. Genoot says Eric was intrigued and told Genoot stories of growing up with his dad on construction sites. The pizza night invite evolved, per Genoot, into almost daily meetings. The result? A company called American Bitcoin, which launched on April 1. Hut 8, which reports having “1,020 megawatts of energy capacity under management across 15 sites in the US and Canada,” owns 80 percent of the company, while Trump, his brother Donald Jr., and legacy shareholders of their former data center business, American Data Centers, own the other 20 percent. Eric is a cofounder and chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin.

American Bitcoin CEO Matt Prusak (who is also the former CEO of Hut 8-affiliated bitcoin mining company Ionic Digital) says the Trump brothers brought “two things to the table.” One was access to capital markets, through the Trumps' international business connections, while the second and arguably more compelling value add was, per Prusak, “narrative”—the one that comes with the Trump family name.

Though Prusak says Eric is “one phone call away from a wide variety of people with whom we can collaborate,” he and Genoot both insist Eric's position on the team doesn't give them a direct line to the president. Rather, they emphasize Eric's connections to large family offices and institutions. “Institutions in Europe, Canada, now increasingly the Middle East, are all interested in the strategic alignment with American Bitcoin,” Prusak says.

In March, crypto exchange Binance announced a $2 billion investment from a fund backed by Abu Dhabi's government. Two months later, the Trump family's World Liberty Financial's stablecoin, USD1, was chosen for the transaction. On July 18, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins, into law. The House passed legislation laying out rules for the crypto market the day prior, which the president has requested land on his desk by August.

“We're able to tap into the American energy story,” Prusak says, noting Eric and Donald Jr.'s large and increasingly bitcoin-interested audiences. Sean Glennan, Hut 8's chief financial officer, who previously worked at Citi, calls his current industry “mimetic”—having a public-facing executive from one of the world's most meme-able families doesn't hurt.

“American Bitcoin is uniquely positioned to scale faster and operate leaner than anyone in the space,” Eric said in a written statement to WIRED, citing Hut 8's track record, infrastructure, and energy expertise as “unmatched.”

Will Foxley, cofounder of the bitcoin mining-focused Blockspace Media, puts it more bluntly. In the crowded mining industry, he says, “there's only a few ways to stand out—one of those ways can be getting the president's son to help found the company.”

Having mined 215 bitcoin between its April launch and May 31, American Bitcoin rounds out the Trump family's crypto business portfolio. As of July 1, it had raised $220 million from investors, which it plans to put toward buying bitcoin and mining equipment. Together with the Trumps' past crypto plays—which include a memecoin, stablecoin, and $2.5 billion bitcoin treasury investment for Trump Media & Technology Group, which includes Truth Social—American Bitcoin is helping further consolidate the family's influence over this growing, and increasingly institution- and government-tied, financial ecosystem.

The Trumps' crypto activities had reportedly contributed around $2.9 billion to the family's wealth as of mid-March. American Bitcoin could add via its primary objective—accumulating bitcoin. First, it's mining to generate bitcoin below market cost (since miners get rewarded for their work, they get bitcoin at a better value than those buying on exchanges). Then it will buy more bitcoin to create its own strategic reserve.

As of June 18, Prusak told WIRED he “can't disclose” when the company will start buying nor through what exchange, but Coinbase Prime currently serves as the company's “primary market.” (Its CEO, Brian Armstrong, has reportedly met with President Trump to help shape US crypto policy.)

When Hut 8 announced its joining with the Trump brothers to create American Bitcoin, others in the crypto mining industry were “caught off guard,” says Foxley. While memecoins like Trump Coin constitute flashy, headline-generating cash grabs, bitcoin mining is what Foxley deems the “backwater of crypto”—unsexy, and underreported on, save articles lambasting its extensive energy use.

But with the Trump administration pushing an “energy-first approach for the US,” Foxley adds, it makes sense. The president met with some of the US's biggest miners while campaigning at Mar-a-Lago in June 2024, where they discussed how the US should be “number one” in bitcoin mining, an agenda Trump echoed the following month at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

The crypto industry poured $135 million into 2024 elections, and it maintained political influence by lobbying Congress and gaining the president's ear. President Trump has made sure to personally benefit from the profits while working to tie the industry's success to the US government, encouraging crypto-friendly legislation and planning a federal strategic bitcoin reserve.

While President Trump's proposed tariffs on Chinese mining equipment were bad news for the crypto mining industry in the US, they have so far not come into play. On May 12, American Bitcoin announced its plan to go public through a merger with the Nasdaq-traded Gryphon Digital Mining, which per its Securities and Exchange Commission filing “operates approximately 5,880 bitcoin mining computers” at a third-party's mining center in Pennsylvania. The computers come from Chinese company Bitmain.

After American Bitcoin accumulates ample bitcoin through mining and buying, the company's ultimate goal, per American Bitcoin's SEC filing, is to “lead the ecosystem,” which could include supporting bitcoin developments and encouraging its adoption.

Like everything done under the Trump family name, American Bitcoin has “the goal to be the biggest,” Eric said in a May interview at blockchain conference Consensus. The company's planned merger with Gryphon, per the latter's SEC filing, will create a public entity “focused on building the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner.” After the merger, the company's five directors will be Ho and three non-employees—FabFitFun cofounder Michael Broukhim, Tinder cofounder Justin Mateen, and Genoot.

“Going public is a game-changer,” Eric Trump said. “It unlocks capital and institutional access that will fuel our mission to build the largest, most investable platform for long-term Bitcoin accumulation.”

Hut 8, however, is providing the infrastructure. American Bitcoin pays Hut 8 for energy, operations, and shared services, which include “accounting … HR support, payroll, benefits, IT support,” and legal services, per its SEC filing. While Hut 8 provides American Bitcoin's mining facilities—currently in Niagara Falls, New York; Medicine Hat, Alberta; and Orla, Texas—it can use the company to raise and deploy “massive capital,” says Prusak, that won't “strain Hut 8's balance sheet.” With American Bitcoin taking care of mining, Hut 8 can focus on supporting growing technologies like AI and going after the business of “hyperscalers,” says Foxley—companies like Meta and Google that need massive data centers for their energy-heavy operations.

Since Hut 8 is bankrolling the data centers, American Bitcoin just needs to buy its mining machines. It inherited an agreement from Hut 8 subsidiary Zephyr to buy around 17,280 Bitmain U3S21EXPH miners for a maximum of $320 million. As of May 31, American Bitcoin reported owning more than 60,000 bitcoin miners, made up mostly of Bitmain Antminer S21+ series miners (Glennan calls the miners “Cadillac … not the Ferrari”) and China-based MicroBt M5X and M6X series machines.

While the US boasts between 30 and 40 percent of the world's bitcoin mining, 90 percent of mining hardware comes from China. “Bitcoin is becoming more and more central to the US financial ecosystem,” says Sanjay Gupta, chief strategy officer at Auradine, a US-based rival to Chinese bitcoin mining suppliers. As President Trump works to further cement bitcoin's role in that ecosystem, experts caution that security risks could arise from connecting Chinese hardware to critical US power infrastructure. Bitmain, for instance, is a privately listed company with links to the AI company Sophgo, which the US government blacklisted for security reasons. (Bitmain, which shares a cofounder with Sophgo, has not been added to the Entity List.)

Bitcoin mining businesses must navigate deteriorating economics: They rely on a volatile asset, and rewards for miners halve roughly every four years, as more than 19 million of the total 21 million bitcoin have been mined.

Glennan says maintaining minimal debt and hedging through bitcoin's derivative market will help American Bitcoin “survive the ups and downs.” American Bitcoin also aims to increase its computational power to mine more profitably. That could mean replacing older equipment with newer, more efficient models and acquiring other bitcoin mining companies.

This takes capital, which the company hopes the Trumps' name will attract. As much as Hut 8 and American Bitcoin representatives claim separation between their business and the Trumps' political connections, the company couldn't help but flaunt these ties during the May 2025 Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas. There, American Bitcoin threw an event attended by the Winklevoss twins, who each donated $1 million to Trump pre-election, and chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald Brandon Lutnick, son of Trump's secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick.

On a stage that had hosted Vice President JD Vance hours earlier, during a panel with Prusak, Ho, and his brother, Donald Jr. told the conservative-leaning crowd, “My father made a lot of promises to the … bitcoin community … [Eric and I] show our true level of commitment when you look at all the things we're doing in this space.” He named American Bitcoin first.

Update 7/31/25 12:00 pm EDT: This story has been updated to reflect that Matt Prusak is not on American Bitcoin's board of directors.

Eric Trump's stake in a four-month-old Bitcoin mining venture could be worth as much as $367 million when the company goes public in the coming weeks. Trump holds a large stake in the closely held American Bitcoin Corp., which he co-founded in March. The company is merging with Gryphon Digital Mining Inc., which is listed on the Nasdaq, and the combined company will be called American Bitcoin. As part of the deal, Trump's interest in American Bitcoin will be converted to 367 million new shares of Gryphon, which traded at about $1 per share on Thursday, according to a securities filing. A recent private sale of existing American Bitcoin stock suggested the new shares would be worth $0.25 each, which would put the value of Trump's shares at “just” $92 million. Trump is the company's chief strategy officer. The disclosures coincided with President Donald Trump's vow to usher in a “golden age of crypto.”

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

The Ether Machine announced Wednesday that it bought 15,000 ETH as part of its long-term crypto accumulation strategy.

According to its release, the crypto-focused investment company bought the batch of ETH at $3,809 per coin, for a total of $56.9 million. The purchase was made with cash proceeds from its previously announced private placement.

The latest purchase brought the company's total holdings to 334,757 ETH, with up to $407 million remaining funds earmarked for future acquisitions.

This effectively put The Ether Machine's holdings above that of the Ethereum Foundation, which owns around 234,000 ETH according to StrategicETHReserve data. Tom Lee's Bitmine and Joe Lubin-led SharpLink Gaming are the two largest corporate holders of Ethereum.



Moreover, the company noted that its latest purchase announcement coincides with Ethereum's tenth anniversary.

""We couldn't imagine a better way to commemorate Ethereum's 10th birthday than by deepening our commitment to ether,"" said The Ether Machine Co-Founder Andrew Keys. ""Our mandate is to accumulate, compound, and support ETH for the long term – not just as a financial asset, but as the backbone of a new internet economy.""

The Ether Machine was formed earlier this year through an ongoing business combination between The Ether Reserve and Nasdaq-listed Dynamix Corp, which is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Following the deal's close, it plans to go public on the Nasdaq under the symbol ETHM, with an expected $1.6 billion raise.

Meanwhile, ETH price rose 1.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3,862 as of 12:40 a.m. on Thursday, according to The Block's Ethereum price page.

Oops, something went wrong

The Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) network has celebrated its tenth birthday, with on-chain analytics platform Santiment highlighting that key metrics reflect rising demand and activity.

What Happened: In a post on July 30 on X, Santiment data shoeds Ethereum's daily active addresses hitting their second-highest level of 2025 on July 27, with 680,670 wallets conducting transactions.

Mean Value to Realized Value (MVRV) data show traders sitting on notable unrealized gains: +38% for annual active wallets, +15% for monthly.

Whale activity surged, with 14,628 transactions over $100,000 — the fourth-highest spike this year.

Wallets holding between 10,000–100,000 ETH accumulated 1.55 million ETH in three weeks, signaling aggressive buying behavior.

Development remains active, too — Ethereum ranks 10th in daily GitHub events, with 157 major updates over the past month.

Narratives around Ethereum have spanned everything from ETF momentum and price predictions to debates about tariff impacts and institutional adoption.

What's Next: Trader Lucky noted that Ethereum closed July with a 54.83% monthly gain, its best July since inception.

This surge came alongside 19 consecutive days of ETF inflows, pointing to increasing institutional conviction.

With that backdrop, Lucky predicts a potentially explosive Q3 rally.

Michael van de Poppe sees a short-term top near $4,000, as volatility dries up. He anticipates a brief correction to follow, but expects broader altcoin markets to enter a strong 12–24 month bull phase.



Glassnode data observes a surprising twist: despite ETH approaching its March 2024 highs, unrealized profits remain modest.

In March, ETH hit +2σ (standard deviations) on the Relative Unrealized Profit metric at $3,980. Today, it's barely at +1σ, suggesting less euphoria and room to run.

If Ethereum returns to +2σ conditions now, it could imply a price closer to $4,900, hinting that the current rally may still be in its early to mid-stages.

 Despite strong ETF inflows, ETH traders remain cautious as competitive pressures and weak network activity persist. 

Key takeaways:

Derivatives data shows traders remain wary despite the recent ETH price gains and strong ETF inflows.

Ethereum faces competitive pressure from Solana and BNB Chain amid stagnant network activity growth.

Ether (ETH) price has surged 56.5% over the past 30 days, yet ETH derivatives metrics suggest traders remain cautious. 

This sentiment may reflect anxiety, since Ether has repeatedly failed to break the $4,000 psychological threshold since March 2024. Persistent weakness in Ethereum onchain metrics adds to investors' frustration.

The annualized funding rate for Ether perpetual futures fell to 9% on Thursday, indicating lower demand for leveraged bullish positions. In contrast, the 19% funding rate from Friday to Monday showed moderate excitement. Currently, the funding rate has returned to its level from July 7, when ETH traded near $2,600. This is unexpected since ETH has gained 46% since then.

Part of traders' disappointment stems from an 11% decrease in network deposits. The total value locked (TVL) in the Ethereum ecosystem fell to a five-month low of 23.4 million ETH on Wednesday, down from 26.4 million ETH thirty days earlier. 

By comparison, TVL on Solana dropped just 4% in SOL terms, while BNB Chain deposits grew by 15% in BNB terms.

Ethereum has also lost its top spot in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, with $81.4 billion in activity over 30 days, according to DefiLlama. In comparison, Solana handled $82.9 billion, while BNB Chain led the market with a remarkable $189.2 billion in volume during the same period.

Network activity is crucial because, ultimately, transaction fees are necessary to pay validators and encourage other decentralized applications (DApps) to build on the network. 

Therefore, even if Ethereum maintains its lead in TVL and active developers, these advantages mean little if network activity stalls compared to rivals.

To gauge whether ETH whales and market makers have adopted a more cautious approach, it's important to analyze the ETH monthly futures market. Under typical conditions, those contracts should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium, compensating for the longer settlement period.

Currently, the ETH futures annualized premium sits at 6%, down from 8% on Tuesday, maintaining a neutral range for the last three weeks. 

More notably, this dip in bullish leverage demand occurred as spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net inflows for nearly three weeks straight. 

Related: Corporate crypto treasury holdings top $100B as Ether buying accelerates

The lack of enthusiasm at the $3,800 ETH price mark may stem from fears that competitors Solana and BNB Chain are more user-friendly thanks to their higher capacity at the base layer. 

Additionally, there are concerns about the lasting impact of Ether reserves held by corporations, the rise of which has played a significant role in Ethereum's recent price surge.

Nine publicly listed companies have accumulated at least 2,000 ETH each, including Bitmine Immersion Tech (BMNR), SharpLink Gaming (SBET), and The Ether Machine (DYNX), according to data resource Strategicreserve.xyz. 

If corporate reserve buying activity continues, ETH could march to $5,000. However, for now, traders remain skeptical and are not giving the benefit of the doubt that $4,000 is within striking distance.

Expectations for an altcoin season have ramped up once again after the latest decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This decline is notable because the last time the dominance saw a similar decline, the altcoin market skyrocketed, leading to the current green phase. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader has also pointed out a major development on the altcoin market cap chart, flashing a similar signal that led to the altcoin market rally back in 2024.

In an X post, the crypto analyst identified the emergence of a major MACD crossover that had preceded previous altcoin seasons. This MACD crossover was seen back in 2017 before the altcoin market took off. Then again, the MACD crossover appeared back in 2020, right before the altcoin market began its legendary rally that led into the 2021 bull season.

The most recent iterations of this major MACD crossover that led to an altcoin season were back at the beginning of 2024. When this metric crossed over from the negative into the positive, it signaled that the altcoin market was ready to take off, triggering an Ethereum price rally and then pushing the altcoin market altogether.

Once again, there has been a bullish crossover on the MACD, moving from the negative into the positive territory in the month of July. If historical performance is anything to go by, then this could mean the start of another ‘vertical expansion'. In this case, the altcoin market could balloon quickly and begin a fresh new bull rally.

Merlijn outlines in the chart shared that every market bottom has hit the trendline, which has now been completed. In the same vein, every breakout has begun with the MACD crossover, and this time is expected to be the same.

As things like the trendline marking the bottom and the MACD crossover take hold, there is also the bullish development that is the Bitcoin dominance crashing again toward 60%. The dominance has remained above 60% for five months straight, suggesting that this is the level to beat for the altcoin season to begin.

In the month of July, altcoin bulls have tried to retest this level twice now without success. However, if the current trend continues, then it could see the Bitcoin dominance break below 60% for the first time since February 2025.

The Altcoin Season Index has also been on the rise, moving up to 44, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This means that 44 of the top 100 altcoins are now outperforming the Bitcoin price in the last 90 days. If this index is able to rise to 75, then it would mean that the altcoin season has officially begun.

A closely watched technical analyst says the outlook for altcoins will remain precarious until Bitcoin breaks through a well-defined ceiling between $120,000 and $123,000, arguing that the weekly chart still commands caution while momentum lags.

Why Altcoins Are Still In The Danger Zone

Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) framed the current setup bluntly: “This weekly BTC chart remains the most important chart out there for us to examine. While below the 120–123K zone and the weekly downtrending resistance on the weekly RSI I have to remain cautious.” He added that he would be “the most bullish person on the timeline” once those levels are cleared, but “until then we treat it for what it is and that is major resistance.”

Kevin's read ties the altcoin path directly to Bitcoin's ability to punch higher. In a follow-up post, he warned that sentiment had flipped at precisely the wrong places: “Most of the #Crypto timeline got max bullish at 4 year historical resistance and was max bearish at major support back in April and even June.”

The implication, he suggested, is to avoid chasing optimism under resistance and to “air on the side of caution while #BTC and Total 2/#ETH remain under these major levels.” By referencing Total2—the market capitalization of crypto excluding Bitcoin—and Ethereum, Kevin effectively argued that the broader risk-on impulse for altcoins is unlikely to sustain without a decisive Bitcoin breakout.

Macro conditions are a swing factor in his framework, but not yet a catalyst. “The July FOMC was always going to be lack luster with not much stake,” he wrote, noting that two more rounds of data arrive before the September meeting and that “projections are roughly 50/50.” He pointed traders to Core PCE as the next waypoint, while reiterating that he'll “be the most bullish” only if price and momentum confirm above the highlighted band. Until then, he plans to “manage risk properly and sit back and watch the show unfold.”

Market structure and volatility may force the timeline. “#BTC getting ready to make a move soon after volatility has dropped off a cliff over the last week,” Kevin observed, underscoring that compressed ranges typically precede directional expansion.

In his view, that expansion must come with a break of both price resistance and the “downtrending resistance on the weekly RSI” to unlock the stronger bullish case. Without that confluence, he sees the set-up as a classic trap for altcoins, which historically underperform when Bitcoin is capped and dominance grinds higher within ranges.

Kevin's stance, delivered across posts on July 30–31, amounts to conditional optimism: the structural bull case for the asset class remains intact only if Bitcoin proves it by clearing the $120,000–$123,000 zone and reversing its weekly momentum profile. “Just be careful who you follow folks,” he cautioned. “There is some good ones but a lot of bad ones.”

For now, he remains explicitly cautious on altcoins while Bitcoin and the major breadth gauges sit beneath those levels, with the next decisive tests likely to be driven by the data cadence into September and a volatility breakout that finally chooses a side.

At press time, the total altcoin market cap (TOTAL2) stood at $1.48 trillion.

The US central bank left the rates unchaged for a fifth consecutive time.

Bitcoin's price actions went through some volatility yesterday, especially after the conclusion of the latest FOMC meeting, but the asset has managed to recover the losses.

Most altcoins are also in the green today, with ETH climbing back toward $3,900 and ENA exploding by double digits once more.

After the correction at the end of the previous business week, which drove BTC to a 14-day low of under $114,500, the primary cryptocurrency managed to recover most losses and even headed toward $120,000 at the beginning of the current one.

However, the resistance at that level turned out to be too strong for bitcoin's current momentum, and the asset returned to around $118,000 yesterday ahead of the latest FOMC meeting for the year.

All eyes turned to the US central bank, especially after the country's GDP report for Q2 was significantly higher than expected. However, the Fed refused to change the interest rates, which resulted in some volatility for BTC.

Perhaps also driven by the lack of any mention of a strategic bitcoin reserve in the White House's digital asset report, which went live yesterday as well, the cryptocurrency dropped by several grand to below $116,000.

Nevertheless, it has recovered most losses and challenged $119,000 earlier today. As of now, it remains about $500 away from that level, while its market cap has risen to $2.360 trillion. Its dominance over the alts stands at 59.4% on CG.

Most altcoins have turned green today after yesterday's correction. Ethereum has risen past $3,850 after a 1.5% daily jump, while XRP is back above $3.15 following a similar increase. BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE, and XLM are also in the green.

SUI has recovered over 4%, LINK is up by 3%, while HBAR has added 5.7% of value since yesterday. ENA has emerged as the top performer once again, having surged by over 16% to $0.675.

The total crypto market cap has added $30 billion overnight and is up to $3.970 trillion on CG.

                            Is Altcoin Season Underway? | Credit: Veronica Cestari                        


Key Takeaways

Bitcoin's market dominance shows signs of weakness, marking a turning point in the crypto cycle.

After a bullish trend that lasted for three years, the BTCD chart has turned bearish.

As dominance falters, signs point toward a major altcoin resurgence already underway.

The long-term BTC dominance chart shows that the upward trend in September 2022 ended after 1,015 days.

The Bitcoin dominance created four successive bearish candlesticks, falling by more than five percentage points.

BTCD temporarily stopped its decline with a bullish candlestick last week, but barely managed to create a bullish close.

If the descent continues, the primary support levels are at 55.70% and 52.70%, respectively, at the 0.328 and 0.5 Fibonacci retracement support levels.

The decline in Bitcoin dominance was preceded by bearish divergences (orange) in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD).

Since then, the RSI has fallen below 50 while the MACD has made a bearish cross. Discounting a false signal in December 2024, this has not happened since the bull run started.

The weekly Bitcoin dominance graph suggests that altcoin season has begun and Bitcoin's dominance will wane for the rest of the year.

The short-term six-hour chart confirms this, suggesting BTCD is in wave four of a five-wave downward movement (red), which has developed into a symmetrical triangle.

Once the triangle breaks down, Bitcoin's dominance could fall to 59.15% before a temporary bounce.

One extremely bullish chart is the crypto market cap, excluding the top 10 altcoins.

This graph, which contains the price movement of medium—and small-cap altcoins, shows extremely bullish price action and wave count readings.

Small altcoins are far from their cycle and all-time highs, but that could change soon.

The chart shows a reclaim and retest of the $285 million support area, where the altcoin cap has created a double bottom pattern.

The RSI and MACD have generated hidden bullish divergences, a sign that trend continuation will follow.

The Bitcoin Dominance charts show a decline, creating conditions favorable for an altcoin rally. 

Medium and small-cap altcoins are creating strong bullish patterns.

If the trend continues, the next few months could be the most profitable ones this year for trading altcoins.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Tether-Focused Blockchain Stable Raises $28M to Power Stablecoin Payments","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/31/tether-focused-blockchain-stable-raises-usd28m-to-power-stablecoin-payments","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:01:15 GMT","

Stable, developer of a new blockchain built around Tether's USDT, said it raised $28 million in a seed round led by Bitfinex and Hack VC.

Other backers include Franklin Templeton, Castle Island Ventures and KuCoin Ventures, alongside angel investors like Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and Braintree founder Bryan Johnson.

The Stable blockchain, described as a “stablechain,” aims to turn USDT into the foundation for digital payments around the world by offering fast settlement, low fees and a stable unit of account in one package.

The raise follows the GENIUS Act, which sets up a regulatory framework for stablecoins like USDT, being signed into law.

“Payments infrastructure around the world needs an overhaul, and traditional methods have failed to achieve fast, reliable and secure digital payments despite massive demand from consumers across the globe,” Stable CEO Joshua Harding said in a statement. “Stable was developed to take advantage of the potential behind stablecoins like USDT to offer instant and seamless payments, directly addressing problems with current payment rails.”

Stable's roadmap unfolds in three phases this year. Phase one makes USDT the gas token and implements sub-second block times. Phase two will introduce blockspace guarantees for enterprise-grade payments, and phase three will focus on developer tools and performance upgrades, according to the release.

The project isn't alone in focusing on stablecoins. Just this week, stablecoin-focused network Plasma raised $373 million in an oversubscribed token sale. The network offers fee-free stablecoin transfers.

The pharmaceutical supply chain has a critical component, the Drug Traceability System, which tracks drugs from manufacturers for further processing and distribution. The integration of blockchain technology yields a secure solution for monitoring drugs throughout the supply chain management process. The paper proposes a novel Blockchain-enabled Secured Vertical Aggregation Algorithm (BSVA) by leveraging the Hyperledger model. The proposed model minimizes the requirement for a centralized authority to ensure privacy while also enhancing scalability to reduce response time in the process of managing transactions on the Blockchain. The Certificate Authority is used to maintain a secure data-sharing process. The robust aggregation is used for the local models to process the chain code, ensuring the successful execution of the secured transaction. The smart contract is deployed into a blockchain model as the block is stored and linked to the distributed Ledger. The decentralized framework is used by chain code, which guarantees that transactions are highly transparency. The performance parameters demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model by enhancing the overall performance of the drug traceability system, as the proposed algorithm ensures the integrity of pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain.

Drug traceability is the process of identifying the origin of drugs through stakeholders in the supply chain management to track transactions executed within the system1. The development of a successful traceability framework is a significant component of regulatory authorities worldwide, enabling the tracking of the traceability of specified drugs. The healthcare industry2 deficiency in the implementation of the framework has the solution to the drug traceability-related problem, including the secured network to analyze the authentication process into the stakeholders of the supply chain management. The tracking and authentication of drugs within the transportation into the distribution networks need a specific electronic system as several techniques have been implemented like mobile environment-enabled solutions, Machine learning computational solutions, serialization process, RFID tags, bar codes with serial numbers for the verification process of the drugs into the specific views3. The drug-based tracking system4 is involved in maintaining transactions in the pharmaceutical industry through the drug transaction process, which consists of providing authentication for product purchase management systems. Moreover, the solutions haven't been interoperable and didn't produce a particular influence on avoiding fake drugs to protect the lives of the patients.

The blockchain framework provides a solution for supply chain management systems, resulting in significant advancements and an increasingly transparent approach to managing transactions among stakeholders5. Blockchain combines every possible solution to create a distributed data management system that supports drug-related actions, enabling the identification of fake drugs through a transparent and accountable process6. The blockchain-enabled solution minimizes the use of trusted centralized techniques, resulting in a decentralized solution for various pharmaceutical management applications. It helps reduce impairments in the supply chain to facilitate collaboration among commonly untrusted stakeholders, thereby enabling the decentralized traceability framework7. Blockchain confirms that the drugs have been delivered to an authorized stakeholder by making a validated Medledger8 of the entire transaction available in the system. Third-party service providers cannot be directly involved in the digital transfer process, as the blockchain-based solution is used to provide robust management for identifying fake drugs by utilizing the information gathered during transaction management to record it securely in the shared Ledger9.

Blockchain-based supply chain management has provided reliability by establishing trust among stakeholders, replacing third-party service providers with tracking functionality that enables the transparent sharing of transaction details, thereby facilitating the implementation of the process. This is because every stakeholder in the traceability system must be able to track the products10. The primary motivation within the system is to facilitate the workflow among multiple stakeholders through the Hyperledger model, which enables the deployment of a permissioned network. This is achieved by enrolling trusted stakeholders into a specific service. The chain-code11 within the supply chain enables stakeholders to share transaction data, empowering them to retrieve sensitive information from multiple integrated stakeholders in the supply chain management system, thereby building confidence among industry stakeholders. Cryptography utilizes connections within number theory to construct higher security than conventional public key encryption functionality while also employing authentication-based access control processes12.

The drug traceability system has the potential to transform the pharmaceutical industry by providing a secure and efficient way to track products throughout the supply chain. The proposed model is designed to provide benefits such as enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency. The utilization of the blockchain chain model guarantees that entire transactions are tamper and transparent, minimizing counterfeiting and ensuring the safety of patients. The decentralized framework enables successful transactions, making reliable and resilient communication possible. The pharmaceutical products have authenticity and integrity, which enhance their performance, as the executor has confirmed that the chain code is executed securely.

The proposed BSVA model has been constructed to provide a secure and scalable solution for data sharing with enhanced traceability. The proposed algorithm offers an improved contribution to pharmaceutical supply chain management. The Blockchain technique is incorporated to ensure the integrity of transactions by eliminating the need for a centralised authority. The transparent tracking process is facilitated efficiently through the authentication procedure. The robust design of the proposed framework has yielded improper performance in metric transactions, such as assessing time. The proposed model is designed to address issues related to large-scale deployment in the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the proposed BSVA algorithm ensures the integrity of pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain, thereby minimizing counterfeiting and improving efficiency.

The main contribution of the paper is:

The chain code authorizes transactions to be validated, minimizing the risk of disputes and errors.

The proposed algorithm demonstrates improved performance metrics, including a minimised transaction process time and increased transactions per second, making it well-suited for large-scale deployment.

The pharmaceutical supply chain comprises several stakeholders, including manufacturers, authorities, distributors, and patients, who are all involved in the supply chain process. The complexity of these transactions necessitates an efficient system for addressing the present issues13. The traceability process must prioritize regulatory matters to ensure the security of the particular product. In contrast, blockchain-enabled traceability offers a solution for managing a distributed platform as a transparent system14. Hyperledger Besu15 addresses the crucial needs for drug traceability, including security, authorization, and transparency, while also providing scalability, which helps solve the challenges faced by the pharmaceutical industry. The Ethereum technique16 is implemented to combine with smart contracts, enabling the decentralization of off-chain storage and producing effective traceability in the healthcare system. This is achieved by making the data origin transparent, thereby reducing the need for intermediate providers to secure transactions for every stakeholder.

A decentralized Hyperledger framework17 features a confidentiality process that enables off-chain storage for rapid transactions through smart contracts, facilitating data transmission by enhancing security through data encryption. The Blockchain-based Traceability of Counterfeited Drugs (BBTCD) technique18 has been developed to track counterfeit drugs through the Ethereum blockchain, providing transparency at an effective cost. The SecureMeds19 methodology has been implemented to prevent drug counterfeiting throughout the supply chain system, which has led to major disasters. Meanwhile, the decentralization technique has ensured transparency in the medicine supply chain, thereby overcoming security-related traceability issues. Every product has authenticated certificates that are verified through the authority of the drug management to enhance the product's reliability. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)20 have been developed with the blockchain concept like smart contracts for improving integrity and traceability in supply chain management. NFT transferability has been examined to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the system by providing solutions to the specific issues addressed in supply chain management.

Blockchain-enabled drug traceability21 provides a solution to enhance several key drug traceability functions, ensuring specific identification in the pharmaceutical industry and maintaining supply chain integrity to address complex issues. Blockchain-based IoT22 has been involved in mitigating the extensive losses incurred by the pharmaceutical industry by enhancing the verification process through medicine authentication, which enables the monitoring of ineffective medicines. This improvement enhances security, traceability, and visibility in supply chain management. The blockchain framework23 utilizes a distributed Ledger to strengthen authentication and transparency in traceability, thereby increasing transparency and trust in multi-chain integration. A game-theoretic approach24 has been proposed as a solution for achieving drug traceability, thereby addressing the trade-off complexities associated with sensitive drug consumption. A fully decentralized blockchain-enabled framework, NFT-IoT Pharma Chain25, has been integrated with IoT devices into the chain code to enhance traceability by providing data integrity through blockchain non-fungible tokens, thereby securely implementing the validation process.

.

The PHTrack technique4 has been implemented to overcome scalability problems in drug supply chain management, providing a developed approach that integrates the procedure with secure off-chain transmission to ensure reliable drug supply chain traceability functionality. The cyberattacks have been identified through the combined Use of Blockchain with Machine Learning functionality26 to demonstrate several key characteristics, including security, integrity, and accountability, in drug chain management. The regulatory authority must issue certificates based on the ownership contribution recorded in the blockchain ledger, which stores metadata in off-chain storage using chain-code to establish end-to-end security.

BDLT-IoMT technique27 has been implemented to provide a robust data process using a blockchain model for ensuring the communication within nodes to resolve the issues of resource management and scalability. The BAIoT-EMS method28 has been designed to enhance security in Enterprise Management Systems by utilizing smart contracts to optimize device management using available resources. The blockchain framework29 has been constructed to provide enhanced energy management by ensuring data privacy. The decentralized, adaptive blockchain framework30 has been used to develop intelligent transport systems for addressing real-time monitoring issues. The successful distributed transaction has been executed through the Blockchain-enabled multithreading functionality31 to ensure lightweight consensus methodology for private blockchain network. Advanced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) Algorithm has been implemented for ensuring scalability in Internet of Medical Things by enabling efficient integration of several healthcare stakeholders. The hybrid cryptographic technique of Threshold Proxy Re-Encryption has been used to enhance the security in IoMT32.

While several blockchain-enabled techniques have been involved for drug traceability system, the Hyperledger model could need substantial computational resources. Ethereum has the scalability issue according to the consensus functionality to reduce the transaction processing time. Decentralized Hyperledger functionality has the complexity for implementing the transaction and need substantial expertise in blockchain model. The Counterfeited Drugs traceability model could need substantial modifications in the supply chain model that could be time-consuming. Non-fungible tokens could be exposed to counterfeit and the utilization in drug traceability systems. Moreover, the architectures having the utilization of blockchain model in pharmaceutical supply chain could produce uncertainty and challenges.

The proposed technique features an enhanced traceability framework that is utilised to improve the pharmaceutical supply chain management system, facilitating the tracing and validation of transactions. The Hyperledger framework with the Blockchain technique utilizes the need for a common authority for providing privacy, efficiency, and scalability through the traceability of information and generally minimizing the response time for the storage and sharing of the transaction in the blockchain framework. The trusted atmosphere is created within the users, the Hyperledger supplies the uniqueness management process which utilizes the user and improves the authentication process for every user in the network. It maintains the membership process which integrates the rules by several supply chain management people to produce the validation, authentication and verification. The Access control could be utilised for providing the extra process of permission as the particular user Id must be permitted to process the Chain code framework but not permitted to deploy it. The membership process is the innovative framework which process resource management, minimizing the attack in the participated users in the health care management process.

The complexity of Pharmaceutical Supply Chain has produced the significant challenges to ensure the integrity of drugs. The improved efficient transactions management into the drug traceability framework as the transparency related issues is the critical aspect of these challenges to make it hard to verify the drug movement from the manufactures into the users. This kind of problem will lead to the proliferation of counterfeit drugs to create major health risks to consumers and distrust in the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the capability of discovering counterfeit products to ensure public health and safety. The lack of interoperable systems in supply chain management could make it hard to achieve seamless traceability. To address the issues, the requirement for an integrated transaction management framework that can effectively track drug transactions throughout the entire supply chain, the proposed model should incorporate a robust blockchain model to ensure public health. The current supply chain models lack the transparency required for efficient tracking of drugs throughout the supply chain. The accuracy of the secured transaction data is essential for preventing errors. The interoperability of several stakeholders is critical for providing an efficient traceability process. The proposed BSVA algorithm is used for providing the enhanced performance in the Hyperledger framework to implement traceability in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The BSVA algorithm leverages the Hyperledger framework for creating a secured system to manage transactions and tracking products in the supply chain. The utilization of blockchain technology provides the integrity of the data as the Vertical Aggregation methodology provides the secured data sharing within the stakeholders. The BSVA algorithm illustrates a unique model for enhancing the transaction and traceability in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The utilisation of blockchain-enabled vertical aggregation demonstrates a secure and transparent solution to minimise counterfeit product risks, thereby providing greater patient safety.

The Drug Traceability system is a blockchain-based model that confirms the integrity of pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain. The system saves data in a decentralized storage to maintain through a network node for validating the transactions. The ordering service is used to order transactions by building blocks and validates them through peer nodes. After validation, they will be included in the Blockchain. The peer nodes are connected to the user to maintain the ledger with details about the transaction history. The executor functionality demonstrates the chain-code that ensures the secured execution model. The Ledger affords a transaction of tamper-proof record as the validated transactions are recorded in a reliable way and it is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Drug traceability system.

The Hyperledger framework is designed to manage the configuration of resources using previously defined procedures. The information has been stored in several ways; the consensus technique could be utilized to enhance the security features of healthcare record maintenance.

The proposed technique has been used to manage the private blockchain framework of several untrusted used assets in the supply chain management system. Users are involved through the validation of certificates, and the authentication process is used to provide the highest confidentiality and privacy. Every participating user is involved in a common root certificate which binds particular components within the organization through assigning the specific Certificate Authority, a distinctive network while the user can utilise the Authority as the communication within the Hyperledger framework could be generated through the private key and public key of Certificate authority, they are having the responsibility for the revocation and the renewal of several certification types issued into the users of the particular organization.

It could be the Blockchain framework channels that update the ledger, which contains the Transaction log, while the various peers in the blockchain coordinate with each other inevitably. A peer can utilise the commit node as part of the transaction process, which is delivered to the network to produce the updated policies.

The service utilizes the transaction process which is endorsed by the Peers on the Blockchain blocks. The transaction has the signatures of each node which are delivered to the service while the service is committed into the Ledger. It communicates the blocks to the peers on the blockchain framework for validating the consensus in the endorsement process. The executor determines the consensus within the transaction process while the blocks have been validated and committed into the Ledger using the services of the Ledger.

The capability to protect the private data of stakeholders is the primary feature of the proposed model. Stakeholders can connect to the blockchain through applications that provide a secure interface for interacting within the network. The model ensures that sensitive data is encrypted to protect it from unauthorised access, allowing stakeholders to participate in the blockchain network and benefit from its transparency features. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed framework, which includes the Orderer, peers, and executors for the users, while the third party maintains private information that connects to the blockchain through the applications. Multiple channels are involved in providing the prediction to the inference channel for security purposes. The smart contracts have data collection capabilities that facilitate the transaction flow for the aggregation process in a secure manner.

Blockchain-based model.

The proposed technique's improvement incorporates a traceability framework that enhances supply chain traceability and validates transactions. The Hyperledger blockchain technique necessitates an authority to achieve enhanced privacy and scalability through access control, specifically minimising response times for transactions within the blockchain network. The trusted framework is segregated from the untrusted participants, while Hyperledger is used to manage authentication services for every participant in the network. It involves the membership process, which maintains the regulations of the supply chain management. Several supply chain management providers are involved in managing the resource utilisation process with an improved authentication process. The membership process is an innovation design that manages the entire healthcare management process. The list of Access controls is used to provide an extra permission procedure, in which the particular user ID is permitted to invoke the blockchain technique before deployment.

The transaction model in the blockchain network is constructed through the complex parameters with different components. The request from the user is delivered through the peer nodes to simulate the transaction and validity verification process. The peer nodes utilise a policy for demonstrating that a valid transaction is to be committed to the Blockchain. The ordering service is responsible for processing transactions in a specific sequence, ensuring a successful transaction. The validation process is completed through the blocks whenever the transaction is completed. The policy verification process ensures the validity of blockchain transactions in the network. The blockchain state is verified to reflect the latest transactions by ensuring that every node in the network maintains a consistent view of the blockchain model. The transaction model offers several benefits, including consistency, transparency, and security, through the decentralised network, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

Transaction model.

The network manager manages access control to maintain the Hyperledger, which enables the configuration of resource utilisation through provided policy management. The shared data is stored in several ways; the consensus technique can provide secure transmission using consensus management to enable safe and reliable transmission within a set of untrusted managers. The permission to enter the Blockchain network is demonstrated through consensus among participants, while the framework utilises consensus management to enable and execute ledger transactions. The effectiveness of the framework is compared with the public Blockchain, as it processes 3,550 transactions in one second. The standard features of the ledger technique are:

It provides private permission and an enhanced framework for executing multiple transactions within the Blockchain framework.

The flexibility model leverages consensus among users within the network.

It involves an improved framework that utilises transaction integrity among the channels.

It permits the creation of channels within the segregate member management for transmitting and accomplishing the privacy.

It enables specific improvements in Blockchain coding.

The processing of transactions is minimal in terms of latency, compared to related Blockchain frameworks.

It has several query types, including range queries and chain queries.

The development and distribution procedure for delivering products has been identified as a complex process, as the traceability from origin within manufacturers and the provision of services to large-scale healthcare systems could be enhanced using the blockchain technique to create a traceability system for sourcing data, delivery processes, and manufacturer information. The proposed system should ensure that log details regarding the storage system, from chain coding to tracking, are maintained for every transaction executed by stakeholders at different levels, thereby facilitating the supply chain process. The supply chain process demonstrates several stakeholders.

Supplier: The supplier is the primary stakeholder in the supply chain process, providing materials to another manufacturer. The details of the supply chain system are recorded, including the name, code, supplied quantity, date, and other related information so that stakeholders can identify the material source.

Manufacturer: The purchase of materials from suppliers is facilitated through traceability, and this process is integrated into the manufacturing of components to produce the expected values. These developed materials can then be distributed to stakeholders. The owner of the traceability system is accountable for the encoding procedure through the monitoring experts. Whenever the encoding procedure is completed, the manufacturer delivers the products into the blockchain ledger where every packaged unit must consist of the product code to enable the dynamic tracking process within the supply chain management. The manufacturer has the accountability for monitoring and maintaining the product-related information on drugs and stores the relevant data in a decentralized file management system with a high level of integrity.

Wholesale distributor: The responsibility for ensuring effective and reliable transactions with stakeholders in the supply chain management system includes various services, such as distribution, packaging, and order fulfilment.

Retailers: The purchase of materials from wholesale distributors has been delivered to users through the traceability system, which categorises criteria and distributes services to consumers.

Governing authority: The Authority has a specific role in maintaining the quality and safety of distributing and storing basic information that manages products utilising storage management and maintains the products for delivery to the market.

The traceability has the functionality of categorising the backwards process of trace, while the dynamic supplier and the user develop transaction-related data. The position of the materials utilises the forwarding process, as the exact position of the supply chain-related data within the transaction flow has some limitations for the end-user. The chain code is a mutual agreement between the active nodes in the network, as the deployment framework determines the participation of stakeholders in the connected channels, enabling the flow of transactions into the cyber parameters of the entire network. The transaction flow is categorised into the physical flow of relevant data through the entire supply chain framework, from one user to the remaining users. The chain code has been deployed within stakeholders, ensuring the integrity and quality of the process and allowing them to monitor transaction records at any time.

The stakeholders of the supply chain management have been initialised and regulated through the authority of a communication-based blockchain network. The registration process is implemented through the chain code, as the regulation authority manages the network. The permission-enabled network creates an additional security layer to communicate with the system using the virtual private network. The data includes users' addresses, contact details, and related information regarding stakeholders and suppliers. The authority will verify the data and maintain the chain-code data as the process finishes, and the stakeholders complete the process in the network. The register process involves transactions that need to be delivered to the nodes for effectively finalising the contract policy. The registration process includes metrics such as supplier details, chain-code ID, and random values to maintain the transaction process. The functionality of transactions could be validated through the authority policy within the nodes and enrolled into the blockchain network.

The mathematical representation of the Blockchain-enabled Vertical Aggregation Model for Drug Traceability System illustrates the Aggregation function, including the encryption and decryption processes. The nodes in the blockchain network demonstrate a stakeholder in the pharmaceutical supply chain, where every node has a data point that must be vertically aggregated to ensure effective data sharing. The procedure for vertical aggregation is computed in Eq. (1).

Where N is the number of nodes, \(\:D{p}_{i}\) demonstrates Data points at every node, \(\:A{D}_{i}\) is the Aggregated data at every node, \(\:Fn\) denotes the Aggregation function, \(\:En\) illustrates the Encryption function, \(\:D{p}_{ij}\) is the Data Point j at node \(\:i\). The secured data sharing has every node could encrypt the data points with a public-key encryption in Eq. (2).

Where pk denotes the public key, \(\:De\) denotes the Decryption function, the aggregated data at every node is computed in Eq. (3) through encrypted data points.

The Blockchain-enabled Aggregation Function is computed in Eq. (4).

Where \(\:{w}_{i}\:\)is assigned weight of every data point, \(\:sk\) demonstrates the private key value.

The registration procedure has been enabled through the specific number of peer nodes from the endorsement process, as the output is encrypted and saved with the signatures of cryptographic procedures within the peer nodes. The output value is known as the endorsement. It contains the values of the necessary data, called metadata, which includes the ID and the signature of the user, along with the response, in the saved transaction policy. The supplier node will be helpful in gathering endorsements while it completes the policy and the transaction is committed, as the entire security policy is completed within the specified period. Whenever the transaction procedure is validated, it must be delivered to perform the ordering process. The endorsement state of the proposed work involves the manufacturer node gathering responses from the peer nodes. The ordering process involves broadcasting the transaction payload, gathering metadata, and developing a set of agreements. The ordering process employs a consensus methodology to determine and establish the execution order for every completed transaction in the system. Additionally, the transaction has the hash value of blocks with the endorsed transactions, enabling the services of ordering. The consignment state within the blocks is used to enhance the entire throughput and deliver the transaction-based cycle in the network, which is known as the execution state.

The local model \(\:\left(lm\right)\) is computed in Eq. (5).

Where \(\:tr\) denotes the local training round, \(\:\beta\:\) is the node id. The global model \(\:\left(gm\right)\) is computed in Eq. (6).

Where \(\:gr\) is the global round value, \(\:\gamma\:\) denotes the ID of the aggregation node, it demonstrates the comprehensive structure of the gathered data into the network by combining the data characteristics of every participant. The Aggregation node \(\:\left(Ag\right)\) is computed in Eq. (7).

The Local training node (Lo) has the responsibility for training the local model, which is then delivered to the aggregation nodes of the global model, as computed in Eq. (8).

A blockchain node in the network provides a ledger through an aggregation mechanism involving a large number of nodes to enhance blockchain security. The proposed technique implements the aggregation functionality by initiating random successive blocks, which are sampled from several blockchain techniques, while the total blocks of every blockchain process have been initialised through Eq. (9).

The Secured Vertical Aggregation (SVA) provides robust aggregation of local models into the user, which are enrolled in specific peers for processing the chain code. This is achieved by delivering private data into a transient field to save updates to the local models. The policy determines which peers communicate the private information, as the count is initialised to zero, preventing the distribution process, while the maximum count is used to distribute the private information to minimise redundancy. The main concept is that the authorized peers have to be permitted for the process of reading and writing while the endorsement peers of the authorized executors do the partition of the local updates whenever the attributes and objects have been involved to perform the local model updates from the gathered information. The separate private data collections have to do the vertical partitioning of training data while the peer gathers private information of the training channel from the entire private data connections that every peer has to access the distributed models for validating the distributions to aggregate the process.

The proposed Secured Vertical Aggregation algorithm assigns the Euclidean weights for completing the local model updates which executes each peer to hold the distributions, the cosine score is used to compute the cosine weights in each sparse distribution by assigning the outlier score to zero and the updated coordinate weight to perform the average weight while the peer aggregates the channel distribution accessible to the remaining peers in the channel. The final global model updates have achieved the robust, secured aggregation from the present participants, the partitioned model to remove the biased updates.

The smart contracts have the chain-code to ensure the successful execution of the entire rules to be included in the decentralized trust, the secured prediction functionality is used to perform the secured query processing of the global model for protecting the querying information. The real-time data is gathered through several sensors to maintain the services from the produced results through aggregated nodes. The preset conditions with the responses have been used for process automation to confirm the transaction integrity. The leveraging of the blockchain model with smart contracts ensures a secure way for executing contracts to adhere to the rules. The deployment process ensures transparency whenever the preset conditions are satisfied; the agreement is implemented automatically as the outcome is saved into the Blockchain. The power utilisation in real-time applications on local devices is reduced, allowing for data processing with minimal power consumption. The required energy and power utilisation are demonstrated through offloading data for further processing in cloud computing, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

Smart Contract.

In the proposed framework, the large training data is segregated into several parts, which require maximum power utilisation, time, and cost. The inference channel is enrolled into a proposal by endorsing peers for invoking the chain-code, the querying peer gathers the prediction values from the private information to produce the inference result, and the proposed technique produces secure prediction into the query model which is demonstrated in the Algorithm.

The performance of the proposed Blockchain-enabled Secured Vertical Aggregation Algorithm for Drug Traceability Framework is evaluated by conducting repeated experiments in a simulated environment with the performance metrics like the Transaction Processing Time as the time required for processing a transaction which includes the time required to perform the aggregation process, the transactions per second which could be processed the total transactions. The Intel Core i7 processor is used to complete the performance evaluation with 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD storage, the network bandwidth of 100.0 Mbps, the Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS operating system is involved at the Docker version of 24.0.7, the highest transaction per block is 500, the pool capacity for transaction is 20,000 with the 1s block interval and 2 MB of block size. The experimental analysis is performed into the main parts of communication cost, time, and blockchain performance analysis that the blockchain analysis performs the processing abilities and effectiveness whenever managing huge transactions, the time performance and the communication cost has the solution of data transmission overhead within the transaction process. The throughput is the total number of transactions processed within the unit time; the latency is the delay within the transaction by confirming the successful transmission. The Hyperledger fabric platform is used into the Blockchain transaction with the transmission rate of 1000 transactions per second from the Blockchain nodes. The algorithm demonstrated excellent scalability, with the ability to handle an increasing number of transactions and nodes without significant degradation in performance. The proposed BSVA technique is compared with the relevant techniques of BBTCD18, SecureMeds19, NFT-IoT Pharma Chain25, PHTrack4.

The proposed Blockchain-enabled Secured Vertical Aggregation Algorithm for Drug Traceability Framework demonstrated excellent performance in terms of transaction processing time, transactions per second, throughput, latency, and scalability. The algorithm's ability to handle a large number of transactions and nodes makes it suitable for large-scale drug traceability frameworks. The relationship within transaction processing time with the total blockchain nodes that have been analysed of various transaction loads, the node coordination enabled transmission overload has the impact of minimal processing time difference up to the transaction volumes and the results are changed for the proposed technique compared to the relevant techniques due to the processing efficiency, the node scaling functionality is used to handle huge amount of authentication request in spite of any communication overload. The results proved that the proposed technique can successfully enhance the node scaling functionality in a large volume of IoT authentication-related scenarios under the present network configuration in Fig. 5.

While increasing the node size, the horizontal scaling approach has indicated the efficiency of the authentication process, the stabilized throughout into the maximum transaction volume managed through the expected processing capacity that is bounded with the consensus internal metrics and the block size, the transaction per second for the various techniques as the proposed work achieves a remarkable throughput of 250 transactions per second (TPS), surpassing existing techniques. The proposed model has produced the highest throughput from the aggregation model to establish the effective processing with the blockchain framework to provide efficient data management and the comparison of the proposed model with the relevant techniques is illustrated in Fig. 6.

Throughput.

The proposed model produces a reduced latency through the effective vertical aggregation algorithm to enable data aggregation with the utilization of blockchain technique for secured data storage and verification. The decentralized framework permits for distributed data processing with minimized latency to contribute the enhanced performance as the proposed model has the advantages of security and efficiency into the pharmaceutical industry. The capability of the proposed model is to afford real-time visibility for tracking the drug traceability process by minimizing counterfeiting to enhance the safety of the patient. Moreover, the proposed model provides a reasonable latency reduction compared with the relevant technique which is illustrated in Fig. 7.

Latency.

The decentralized framework for the proposed model is used to permit the distributed data to be processed with minimized communication overload to contribute to improved performance. The minimized communication cost for the proposed model through the novel vertical aggregation algorithm to enable effective data aggregation process with the usage of blockchain technique and the comparison of the proposed technique with the relevant techniques is illustrated in Fig. 8.

Communication cost.

The proposed BSVA algorithm has been deployed in a pharmaceutical supply chain to enhance traceability and transaction management. This is because distributors are responsible for transporting products to the companies, which can store them for distribution. The Retailers are involved into the Pharmacies and Hospitals to dispense medicines. The Regularity Bodies as the Government agencies to monitor the pharmaceutical industry. Table 1 demonstrates the benefits of utilizing Blockchain-enabled technique in the supply chain model to include the improved traceability, efficiency and regularity compliances. The Experimental result proved that the proposed model has the improved performance than the relevant techniques.

The computational complexity of the proposed model is the main component for considering the performance analysis with the related techniques, which leverage the blockchain model to ensure a secured data aggregation model to efficiently manage data. The proposed model maintains a balance between scalability and efficiency, its linear computational complexity is suitable for large-scale applications to ensure secured data aggregation and its vertical aggregation element increases the efficiency by minimizing the quality of data required to be transmitted and the comparison of computational complexity is demonstrated in Table 2.

The proposed Blockchain-enabled Secured Vertical Aggregation Algorithm provides a robust solution for authentication-related issues of pharmaceutical products through supply chain management. The centralised authority utilises the Hyperledger model to leverage the blockchain model, ensuring privacy and scalability while reducing response time for storing and sharing blockchain transactions. The utilisation of Centralised authority, Peers, Executors, and Orderer techniques ensures secure data sharing to reduce the tampering and counterfeiting process through the blockchain framework. The proposed BSVA algorithm is used to achieve the secured, robust and traceability through several key steps. Initially, the proposed algorithm uses a decentralized network for validating the transactions by ensuring the tamper-proof. The blockchain model provides a secure and robust framework for data management, enabling the creation of immutable records. The proposed algorithm has the advanced encryption model for protecting sensitive data. The smart contract is used to automate the verification process by ensuring the consistent and accurate data. The Vertical Aggregation functionality permits the effective analysis of data from the sources to provide the complete view of the supply chain. The successful implementation of the proposed algorithm has been utilised in the pharmaceutical industry to regulate both consumers and manufacturers by enabling real-time tracking, ensuring the overall efficiency of the supply chain management system. In the future, emerging technologies like AI and IoT will enhance the proposed model's capability to conduct pilot studies and collaborate with industry stakeholders for validating the efficiency of the proposed solution in real-time environments.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched a public consultation on its draft guidance for consumer Internet of Things (IoT) products and services, alongside a draft impact assessment. The consultation opened on 16 June 2025 and runs until 7 September 2025.

The draft guidance aims to clarify how UK data protection law applies to the design, development, and deployment of consumer IoT products and services. These include smart home devices, wearables, and connected appliances that collect and process personal data. The ICO emphasises the importance of transparency, data minimisation, and user control, particularly in environments where users may not be fully aware of the data being collected or how it is used.

What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a digitally connected network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data over the internet. The ""smart home"" is a good example of IoT; smart doorbells, security alarms, home appliances and entertainment systems among other things can create a network where data is shared between the different devices, which users can control remotely from an app or website. In the consumer context, IoT products are designed to enhance convenience, efficiency, and personalisation in everyday life. However, their data-driven nature also introduces significant privacy and security challenges; rather than actively inputting data into an app or device, data is now being constantly collected from and about us in a way we may not be conscious of or informed about. It also represents a large increase in the volume of data being collected about us as these devices are running almost constantly and consistently collect data about us.  

Scope of the Draft Guidance

The guidance provides practical advice for organisations who process personal data via IoT products on complying with the UK GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended) (PECR). Such organisations are likely to include manufacturers, app developers, AI service providers, software developers, and cloud providers, among others. Key areas covered include:

The guidance also addresses the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and similar identifiers, in IoT ecosystems, reinforcing the need for valid consent and clear user interfaces. For example, the ICO gives an example of a smart TV using automatic content recognition (ACR) technology on their smart TVs to serve their users personalised ads. This technology periodically captures what is shown on the TV and matches it against a content library to serve the user ads they will be interested in; because the technology is storing and accessing information on the user's TV, the company needs to obtain valid consent under PECR to use it for advertising. 

As in their other recent guidance, the ICO splits out the obligations under this advice into must, should, and could categories, to help organisations in scope plan their compliance matrix according to risk appetite. 

Draft Impact Assessment

The accompanying draft impact assessment evaluates the potential effects of the guidance on organisations and individuals. It outlines anticipated benefits such as improved consumer trust, reduced risk of data breaches, and enhanced compliance clarity. The ICO acknowledges potential costs for businesses, particularly SMEs, in adapting to the new expectations, but argues these are proportionate to the privacy risks posed by IoT technologies.

The assessment is not yet finalised; the ICO will provide a more holistic assessment based on the finalised guidance and the feedback received from the consultation. 

Further, as the guidance is based on the UK GDPR, the DPA 2018 and PECR, the draft guidance and draft impact assessment are likely to be updated as the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 provisions amending this legislation is brought into force. This will ensure the final guidance is in line with the updated obligations under the new Act. 

Next Steps

Stakeholders are encouraged to respond to the consultation via the ICO's Citizen Space platform. Feedback will inform the final version of the guidance, which is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the UK's regulatory landscape for consumer IoT.","{'href': 'https://www.lewissilkin.com', 'title': 'Lewis Silkin'}","cryptocurrency"

As cryptocurrencies reshape the global financial balance, the Trump administration reveals its strategic response. A highly anticipated report from the President's Working Group on Digital Assets lays the foundations for a confident pro-crypto framework : encouraged innovation, reinforced oversight. This ambitious plan aims to propel the United States to the forefront of the technological race while asserting its economic sovereignty in the face of rising rival players.

While the Genius Act was published a few days ago, a new report released this Wednesday by the Trump administration's crypto working group outlines the major points of a future regulatory framework for the American crypto ecosystem. Its primary goal is to clarify the respective competencies of federal authorities in order to effectively regulate the market while fostering innovation.

“Jurisdictional oversight of cryptocurrencies should be shared between the CFTC and the SEC”, the report states, specifying that “the CFTC would have authority over the crypto spot market”. In other words, the report proposes a segmentation of responsibilities based on the nature of assets, with a clear division of prerogatives.

Here are the main regulatory points detailed in the report:

This vision of a bilateral regulatory framework aligns with the desire to preserve American leadership in the sector. The SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, praises this positioning : “the best way to catalyze American innovation, protect investors against fraud, and maintain the attractiveness of our capital markets is a rational regulatory framework for digital assets”.

By proposing a coherent and structured interpretation of legal obligations, this report aims to create an environment conducive to the growth of crypto businesses while reinforcing legal security for participants.

The document goes beyond market regulation. It also addresses future financial infrastructures and crypto taxation. One of the most striking focuses is explicit support for stablecoins.

According to the report's authors, these assets can serve as a bulwark against the hegemony of the U.S. dollar. They even state that stablecoin issuers can collaborate with authorities to freeze and seize assets in cases of illicit use, highlighting their compatibility with homeland security standards.

The report also encourages banking regulators to simplify obtaining licenses to allow banks to offer crypto-related services, including custody.

Contrary to many initiatives in other major economies, the report openly calls to prohibit the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States.

It supports the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, a legislative proposal aiming to ban all federal funding or research on a potential digital dollar. This marked opposition is explained by fears of state surveillance and loss of individual freedom.

At the same time, the report proposes tax reform adapted to the specificities of cryptocurrencies, calling on Congress to legislate to recognize cryptocurrencies as a new asset class benefiting from hybrid tax rules, midway between securities and commodities.

These proposals outline a very particular vision for the future monetary and financial landscape of the United States: that of a decentralized system but under regulatory control as evidenced by the laws passed by the United States, excluding any form of programmable public currency. While this report does not constitute law itself, it nonetheless marks a clear and potentially lasting political direction.

The companies are currently evaluating regulatory frameworks for tokenization, with specific structures and timelines yet to be determined. PowerBank will transition from Coinbase to Intellistake for digital currency custody services.

PowerBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) ha annunciato una partnership strategica con Intellistake Technologies (CSE: ISTK) incentrata su iniziative legate agli asset digitali e alla tokenizzazione. La collaborazione si articola in tre aree principali: un Programma di Tesoreria di Asset Digitali in cui PowerBank accumulerà Bitcoin mentre Intellistake si concentrerà su valute digitali legate all'IA, servizi di Gestione della Tesoreria Bitcoin forniti da Intellistake, e la possibile tokenizzazione degli asset di energia pulita di PowerBank.

La partnership mira a collegare le infrastrutture energetiche tradizionali con le esigenze dell'economia digitale, con analisti che prevedono che il mercato degli asset reali tokenizzati (RWA) potrebbe raggiungere i 30 trilioni di dollari entro il 2034. Le aziende stanno attualmente valutando i quadri normativi per la tokenizzazione, con strutture specifiche e tempistiche ancora da definire. PowerBank passerà da Coinbase a Intellistake per i servizi di custodia delle valute digitali.

PowerBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) ha anunciado una asociación estratégica con Intellistake Technologies (CSE: ISTK) enfocada en activos digitales e iniciativas de tokenización.

La asociación busca conectar la infraestructura energética tradicional con las demandas de la economía digital, con analistas que pronostican que el mercado de activos del mundo real tokenizados (RWA) podría alcanzar 30 billones de dólares para 2034. Las compañías están evaluando actualmente los marcos regulatorios para la tokenización, con estructuras y cronogramas específicos aún por determinar. PowerBank realizará la transición de Coinbase a Intellistake para los servicios de custodia de monedas digitales.

PowerBank (NASDAQ: SUUN)는 Intellistake Technologies (CSE: ISTK)와 디지털 자산 및 토큰화 이니셔티브에 중점을 둔 전략적 파트너십을 발표했습니다. 이번 협력은 세 가지 주요 분야를 포함합니다: PowerBank가 비트코인을 축적하는 디지털 자산 재무 프로그램, Intellistake가 AI 관련 디지털 통화에 집중하는 부분, Intellistake가 제공하는 비트코인 재무 관리 서비스, 그리고 PowerBank의 청정 에너지 자산 토큰화 가능성입니다.

이 파트너십은 전통적인 에너지 인프라와 디지털 경제 수요를 연결하는 것을 목표로 하며, 분석가들은 토큰화된 실물 자산(RWA) 시장이 2034년까지 30조 달러에 이를 것으로 전망합니다. 양사는 현재 토큰화에 대한 규제 프레임워크를 검토 중이며, 구체적인 구조와 일정은 아직 결정되지 않았습니다. PowerBank는 디지털 통화 보관 서비스를 위해 Coinbase에서 Intellistake로 전환할 예정입니다.

PowerBank (NASDAQ : SUUN) a annoncé un partenariat stratégique avec Intellistake Technologies (CSE : ISTK) axé sur les actifs numériques et les initiatives de tokenisation. Cette collaboration couvre trois domaines clés : un programme de trésorerie d'actifs numériques où PowerBank accumulera du Bitcoin tandis qu'Intellistake se concentrera sur les monnaies numériques liées à l'IA, des services de gestion de trésorerie Bitcoin fournis par Intellistake, et la potentielle tokenisation des actifs d'énergie propre de PowerBank.

Le partenariat vise à relier l'infrastructure énergétique traditionnelle aux exigences de l'économie numérique, avec des analystes prévoyant que le marché des actifs réels tokenisés (RWA) pourrait atteindre 30 000 milliards de dollars d'ici 2034. Les entreprises évaluent actuellement les cadres réglementaires pour la tokenisation, avec des structures et des calendriers spécifiques encore à définir. PowerBank passera de Coinbase à Intellistake pour les services de garde des monnaies numériques.

PowerBank (NASDAQ: SUUN) hat eine strategische Partnerschaft mit Intellistake Technologies (CSE: ISTK) angekündigt, die sich auf digitale Vermögenswerte und Tokenisierungsinitiativen konzentriert. Die Zusammenarbeit umfasst drei Hauptbereiche: ein Digitales Asset Treasury Programm, bei dem PowerBank Bitcoin ansammelt, während Intellistake sich auf KI-bezogene digitale Währungen konzentriert, Bitcoin Treasury Management-Dienste, die von Intellistake bereitgestellt werden, sowie die mögliche Tokenisierung von PowerBanks sauberen Energieanlagen.

Die Partnerschaft zielt darauf ab, traditionelle Energieinfrastruktur mit den Anforderungen der digitalen Wirtschaft zu verbinden. Analysten prognostizieren, dass der Markt für tokenisierte reale Vermögenswerte (RWA) bis 2034 30 Billionen US-Dollar erreichen könnte. Die Unternehmen prüfen derzeit regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen für die Tokenisierung, wobei spezifische Strukturen und Zeitpläne noch festgelegt werden müssen. PowerBank wird für die Verwahrung digitaler Währungen von Coinbase zu Intellistake wechseln.

PowerBank's partnership with Intellistake represents a significant strategic pivot toward digital asset adoption and tokenization, though execution details remain undefined.

PowerBank and Intellistake's announced partnership represents a strategic pivot into the digital asset ecosystem through three core initiatives: Bitcoin treasury reserve accumulation, digital asset management infrastructure, and potential tokenization of energy assets. This positions PowerBank among the growing number of publicly-traded companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve strategy, following the path pioneered by MicroStrategy.

The partnership's most concrete element is PowerBank's intention to accumulate Bitcoin on its balance sheet, with Intellistake providing custody and treasury management services—notably replacing previously mentioned Coinbase services. However, the announcement lacks specific allocation targets, timelines, or percentage of treasury commitments, which makes evaluating the financial impact impossible at this stage.

The most innovative aspect of this partnership is the exploration of tokenizing PowerBank's solar and energy storage infrastructure as real-world assets (RWAs). This approach could potentially unlock new financing mechanisms and liquidity for capital-intensive energy assets. The release references a $30 trillion market cap projection for tokenized RWAs by 2034, contextualizing the strategic rationale, though such projections should be viewed cautiously.

Critically, the announcement contains substantial hedging language regarding the tokenization initiative, noting regulatory frameworks are still being evaluated and that ""no Bitcoin purchases have been made"" as of the release date. This partnership announcement appears more directional than operational at this stage, with significant execution questions remaining unanswered.

Highlights of the Partnership:

VANCOUVER, BC, July 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - POWERBANK CORPORATION (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (""PowerBank"" or the ""Company"") – announces a transaction with Intellistake Technologies Corp. (""Intellistake"") that involves the intersection of digital assets, energy, and tokenized finance. Intellistake (CSE: ISTK) is a technology company bridging traditional capital markets with decentralized AI and blockchain infrastructure, and PowerBank (formerly SolarBank), is a leader in clean energy infrastructure.







Together, these two high-growth companies will pursue three seminal initiatives:

""Tokenization is no longer a concept—it's an inevitability,"" said Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake. ""By combining our expertise in capital markets and digital asset custody with PowerBank's scalable, real-world energy platform, we're unlocking a new opportunity..""

As institutions and sovereign funds increasingly embrace tokenized securities and decentralized asset strategies, the Intellistake–PowerBank partnership centres on transforming legacy energy systems into a tokenized product.

According to a recent report by CryptoSlate, analysts forecast that the market cap for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could reach $30 trillion by 2034(1)—driven by advances in blockchain, AI, and investor demand for transparent, real-time asset ownership and settlement.

""This partnership is about more than collaboration—it's about setting the pace for a shift in how companies manage capital and assets,"" said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank. ""As the world accelerates toward AI, automation, and clean energy, Bitcoin and tokenization are presenting new opportunities. PowerBank and Intellistake are here to take part in that transformation, to bridge traditional energy infrastructure with the demand of the digital economy.""

Intellistake and PowerBank are presently evaluating the regulatory framework for tokenization. Any tokenization will be subject to it being completed in compliance with applicable law, regulatory requirements and terms of any underlying agreements associated with PowerBank assets. The actual structure of such tokenization, the assets that would be subject to tokenization, and the associated timeline, have not yet been determined. Intellistake and PowerBank will provide further updates as material developments related to this tokenization strategy occur.

The actual timing and value of Bitcoin purchases, under the allocation strategy will be determined by management. Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and the anticipated cash needs of Intellistake or PowerBank. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason. Intellistake will support PowerBank's establishment of custody for its digital currency purchases and PowerBank no longer intends to utilize Coinbase for this service. As of the date of this press release, no Bitcoin purchases have been made.

TACEO, a software development company based in Austria, has completed a $5.5 million seed funding round led by Archetype VC, with participation from a16z CSX, Cyber.Fund, A.Capital Ventures, Polymorphic Capital, and several angel investors. The company plans to use the funds to expand its team and scale its technology beyond cryptocurrency and decentralized finance, exploring areas such as identity verification, financial services, and artificial intelligence [1].

TACEO was established in 2022 by a team of developers from Graz University of Technology. The company is best known for its Poseidon hash function and its development of a “Private Shared State” technology, which employs coSNARKs—combining Multiparty Computation and Zero-Knowledge Proofs—to protect data during computation while proving outcomes. In 2023, the firm partnered with Sam Altman's World (WLD) to develop an iris-matching verification service for access to the World network [1].

However, the iris-scanning verification system raised significant privacy concerns and faced public backlash. Governments in Indonesia, Brazil, and China Hong Kong have taken actions against the project, citing concerns over the collection and storage of biometric data such as facial and iris scans. Despite these challenges, TACEO asserts that its solution fully encrypts the biometric data of over 14 million users, making it inaccessible even to the World team. It claims to maintain the largest Multiparty Computation-secured dataset on public record [1].

The company has previously demonstrated its capability to handle sensitive data through its pandemic-era project, which tracked the spread of infections without exposing underlying information. TACEO's focus remains on enabling secure, privacy-preserving collaboration across multiple parties without the need for centralized trust [1].

Its long-term goal is to leverage its cryptographic tools to serve industries beyond crypto, emphasizing secure data handling and identity verification in an increasingly data-sensitive world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","XRP, Bitcoin, Ether, Solana Price Prediction: BTC Faces Golden Fibonacci Hurdle at $122K, XRP Holds Support at $3","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/31/btc-faces-golden-fibonacci-hurdle-at-usd122k-xrp-holds-support-at-usd3","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:16:28 GMT","

This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

As bitcoin BTC$117,799.66 continues to trade flat in the $116,000-$120,000 range, the monthly chart shows $122,056 as key resistance that needs to be breached to confirm continuation of the bull run.

That level represents the 1.618% Fibonacci extension, originating from the December 2018 lows, the December 2022 lows, and the 2021 high.The 1.618% extension is highly important because it's derived from the ""Golden Ratio,"" a revered mathematical constant in finance. The level is widely found in nature and art, which is why many believe it also influences human psychology and market movements.

After a market breaks above its previous record high in a strong uptrend, as BTC did in November by moving above $70,000, the 1.618% extension is seen as a powerful target area where bulls tend to take profits and bears initiate new positions.

It is, therefore, no coincidence that momentum appears to have stalled right around $122,056. A firm move above this level would be an indication that buying pressure remains strong enough to absorb profit-taking and bearish resurgence at key levels, shifting the focus to the 2.618% extension at $187,929.

Conversely, continued uptrend exhaustion around the 1.618% level could embolden bears, potentially leading to a top in the bull market.

Since last Thursday, the pullback in the payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$3.0906 has stalled, with bears repeatedly failing to establish a foothold below $2.995, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the June-July rally. The price action, when viewed on the hourly chart, suggests a double bottom formation at $2.995, with the neckline resistance at $3.33 (the July 28 high).

A move above $3.33 would confirm the breakout and open the door to a retest of the recent high of $3.65. That said, as of the time of writing, the negative daily chart MACD and downward-sloping hourly chart averages suggest otherwise. Traders, therefore, need to keep an eye out for a move below $2.995, which will likely yield a deeper decline.

Ether is trading indecisively in a wedge-like pattern marked by converging trendlines. However, prospects of a notable pullback are improving, as the daily chart MACD histogram, a trend-following indicator, has flipped negative. The 50-, 100-, and 200-hour SMAs are now flat-lined, indicating a loss of upward momentum. A move below the July 25 low of $3,510 would imply a short-term trend reversal, shifting the focus to $3,000. On the higher side, a FOMO rally may unfold once the $4,000-$4,100 range – the strong resistance zone from 2024 - is crossed. 

SOL's price is at risk of diving out of the bullish trendline drawn from higher lows established since June 22. Such a move would confirm a bearish shift in trend, potentially leading to a test of the 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMAs, which are coiled at around $160-$162. The lower high of $195 established on July 28 is the level to beat for the bulls.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Whale Activity Surges as Bitcoin Builds Momentum Toward New Highs","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/31/whale-activity-surges-as-bitcoin-builds-momentum-toward-new-highs","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:41:15 GMT","

Bitcoin BTC$117,799.66 is witnessing a notable resurgence in accumulation activity across all investor cohorts, with whale wallets leading the charge. 

According to recent data from Glassnode, the number of unique whale entities, defined as those holding at least 1,000 BTC, has risen from 1,392 to 1,417 over the past week. This marks one of the highest whale counts recorded in 2025, signaling a resurgence in institutional or large-scale investor confidence.

Glassnode identifies entities as clusters of addresses controlled by the same user or organization. 

In addition, the Accumulation Trend Score, a key on-chain metric, reveals that not only are whales accumulating aggressively, but so are the smallest holders, known as shrimps, who own less than 1 BTC. This buying pressure highlights a rare moment of alignment between retail and institutional investors.

The metric breaks down accumulation strength by wallet size and recent acquisition behavior over a 15-day period. A score closer to 1 suggests strong accumulation, while a value near 0 indicates distribution. Entities such as exchanges and miners are excluded to focus on genuine investor sentiment. 

Importantly, this level of sustained accumulation across all cohorts has not been seen since November 2024, during President Trump's re-election. That period marked a sharp uptick in bullish sentiment and price momentum that saw bitcoin claim $100,000. 

Given the broad-based accumulation and the psychological boost of renewed whale interest, market observers could be increasingly confident that bitcoin is poised to challenge and potentially surpass its all-time high in the near future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Spot Ether ETF staking could ‘dramatically reshape the market'","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-etf-staking-approval-institutional-demand","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 05:37:58 GMT","

 Hank Huang, CEO of  Kronos Research, said Ether ETFs offering yield through staking “flips the switch on demand,” boosting liquidity and greater onchain participation. 

Staking approval for US-listed Ether spot exchange-traded funds will bring huge inflows of institutional money into Ethereum, possibly giving Bitcoin ETFs a run for their money, analysts say.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, 10x Research's head of research, Markus Thielen, said staking for Ethereum ETFs would increase the yield and could “dramatically reshape the market.”

US ETF issuers are still waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year.NovaDius Wealth Management president and ETF analyst Nate Geraci said in an X post on Wednesday that, given the SEC has recently acknowledged the Nasdaq's application to add staking to BlackRock's iShares Ethereum ETF, Ethereum ETF staking could be next on the agencies' “hit list.” 

Thielen predicted that the increased yield would likely result in demand for spot Ether ETFs surging alongside increased activity in Ethereum options markets.

The basis trade between spot Ether ETFs and Ethereum futures, already offering around a 7% annualized return, would suddenly become far more attractive, with staking adding an additional 3% yield, according to Thielen.

“That brings the total return potential to 10% unleveraged. With 2–3x leverage, institutional investors could target 20–30% annualized returns from this arbitrage strategy,” he said.

Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer of Australian crypto investment manager Merkle Tree Capital, told Cointelegraph that yield is a massive consideration for institutional investors before they pile into an investment.

The main reason is that institutions, like pension funds, prioritize steady and predictable income over uncertain capital gains; the yield is also perceived to reduce volatility, according to McMillin. 

“Ether ETFs will now provide both diversification away from Bitcoin, as digital gold, to ETH as ‘stablecoin infrastructure' but equally important, a yield which is not applicable for Bitcoin,” McMillin said.

Hank Huang, CEO of  Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that staking approval in spot Ether ETFs changes the game for institutions waiting for a compliant way to earn yield onchain without touching private keys.

“Ether ETFs offering yield plus asset growth flips the switch on demand, boosting liquidity and sparking greater appetite for onchain participation,” he said.

Huang predicts an ETF that blends staking rewards with smooth, flexible exits will raise the bar, setting a “new gold standard” for bringing crypto into mainstream finance.

 Coinbase's satirical video takes aim at Britain's struggling economy as data shows almost half of UK adults are financially vulnerable. 

Coinbase has taken aim at the United Kingdom's financial system in a darkly satirical video, which comes as data reveals an increase in financial hardship across the country.

Titled “Everything is fine,” the video uses a musical tone and lyrics to brag about the UK's strong finances while showing grim scenes of inflation, poverty, debt and financial struggle, a hint at the gap between what people are told and what they actually face.

“We ain't got no troubles. No reason to complain,” the video starts, as damaged homes and cash-strapped individuals fill the screen. “The streets can't get no cleaner. Nor the rat meat any leaner. No. Life is just as great,” it claims, as dirty streets flash across the screen.

The video also touches on the issue of soaring prices. “These fish fingers are a steal. Price is up a smidge, just 100 pounds a meal,” it says before joking that things “could be worse.”

The Coinbase video comes as 20.3 million people in the UK, 44% of all adults, are living in financially vulnerable conditions, up 16% since 2022, according to a recent report by Fair4All Finance. The increase is driven by unstable incomes, limited savings, ill health and job loss.

The report noted a 59% increase in people with average incomes carrying high debt loads, now totaling 3.5 million. Another 1.9 million younger adults, up 45%, are also struggling, often relying on “buy now, pay later” services and stuck in zero-hour contracts.

Food insecurity has worsened, with food bank use rising to 15% from 11%. Half of those in financially vulnerable situations say they can't afford a healthy diet. Many are turning to payday loans and short-term credit to cover basic needs.

Two groups have seen the fastest growth. Low-income families with no savings have risen by 5% to 3.8 million, while those in a crisis state, surviving entirely on credit, have increased by 12% to 3.9 million.

The UK has also been under fire for its crypto policy. Last month, analysts at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), an independent think tank, argued that the UK has wasted its early-mover advantage in distributed ledger finance.

They said that the UK, once expected to set a post-Brexit gold standard for crypto regulation, continues to “talk un-specifically about regulation in the future,” citing “policy procrastination” as a key reason the country is falling behind both the European Union and the US.

515-Mile-Long Lightning Megaflash Sets New World Record

A lighting flash that spanned from East Texas to an area near Kansas City in 2017 is officially the longest lightning strike ever measured, according to the World Meteorological Organization

Guinness World Records may be the go-to organization for measuring the extent of (sometimes dubious) human achievement, but for natural phenomena, the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO's) Committee on Weather and Climate Extremes sets the bar. Recently the committee certified a new record: the longest lightning strike ever measured. The bolt, which materialized on a stormy day in October 2017, spanned a total of 515 miles from East Texas to an area near Kansas City.

When a potentially record-breaking weather event occurs, it gets passed to the committee, where a panel of scientists and other experts assesses whether the event truly represents a new record. If the panel votes to approve it, the record is entered into the WMO's World Weather and Climate Extremes Archive. Michael Peterson, an atmospheric scientist at the Severe Storms Research Center at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, flagged the new record-holder last year while reanalyzing 2017 satellite data. Recording such extreme weather events can help us develop new tools to predict severe storms and understand their behavior, he says.

The previous record-holder, a bolt of lightning measuring 477 miles that struck during a storm in 2020, also originated in Texas. This is no coincidence, Peterson says. The south-central Great Plains in the U.S. represent one of few hotspots in the world for the giant complexes of thunderstorms in which these superlong “megaflashes” are most likely to occur. These complexes arise when many smaller storms coalesce into one large system⁠. The 2017 complex spanned all the way from Texas to Minnesota.

Megaflashes often produce cloud-to-ground offshoots along their length. In fact, Peterson says, the 2017 flash produced more than 116 subsidiary strikes during the seven seconds it lasted, from start to finish. A typical lightning strike is visible for about half a second; the record-holder for the longest-lasting strike clocked in at more than 17 seconds. Strikes are measured using a combination of satellite technology and ground-based lightning mapping arrays—networks of sensors that record the radio signals produced by lightning.

This map of the record lightning strike shows its development over time. The circles represent cloud-to-ground strikes and are colored by polarity.

With increasingly powerful and accurate technology, Peterson and his colleagues are beginning to get better data about these storms to understand exactly what makes them tick. For instance, Peterson says, the researchers are investigating unusual, especially powerful forms of lightning and ones whose charge lasts particularly long (that is, a few hundred milliseconds) in the ground after they strike. “It is a very exciting time to be in lightning science,” he says.

A new technology known as Geochemical Energy Storage (GES) could provide months-long storage for renewable energy, increasing grid reliability.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The Earth is overflowing with renewable energy. Powerful waves beat coastlines, rushing winds ripple over expansive plains, the planet's internal heat roils beneath our feet, and the Sun's light shines on us all. During the past several decades, scientists and engineers have drastically improved our ability to transform these energy sources into usable electrons. But that's only the first step—the next one is finding a way to store it. 

Luckily, we have options, and chief among them is the lithium-ion battery. Although these batteries have impressive round-trip efficiency—which describes how efficient the technology is at storing and then dispersing energy—lithium-ion is only useful for covering short, day-long hiccups that could impact the grid. For our renewable future to supply us with reliable energy, the grid also needs technologies that can store energy for months at a time. 

To pull off this long-term storage, green energy engineers have relied on a decades-old technology known as pumped hydropower. Put simply, this process uses electric motors to pump water uphill when energy is plentiful, and when energy is needed, it flows downhill past a turbine that generates electricity. It's a simple, elegant system, and according to CleanTechnica, it represents 95 percent of long-duration storage in the U.S. However, pumped storage isn't perfect—it requires significant upfront costs, it can use up a lot of water, and it can be geographically limited. 

The Texas-based company Quidnet takes the idea of pumped storage and flips it on its head—literally. Called “geochemical energy storage,” this process pumps water into impermeable rock within the Earth and stores it there under pressure. When released, the water flows upward, powering a turbine and releasing energy. 

“The water in a GES system, minus what is lost on evaporation, is reused over and over in a closed-loop system,” Quidnet states on its website. “Due to the higher operating pressure, and thus energy density of the GES process, the volume of water cycled in the GES process is a fraction of the water cycled in a conventional pumped hydro storage facility.”

In 2019, Quidnet earned funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop GES technologies for commercial use. They also received $10 million in 2024 from the oil and gas company Hunt Energy Network, in part because Quidnet uses “the same supply chain and same work force” for creating GES systems, just with different rock layers. In February of 2025, the company announced that it had successfully tested and demonstrated the technology at a megawatt-hour scale, and four months later, they announced that they had stored energy for six months without any losses. 

This doesn't mean that GES's round-trip efficiency is 100 percent (not even lithium-ion batteries can achieve such a feat). Speaking with MIT Technology Review, Quidnet CEO Joe Zhou estimated that the new system could reach a maximum efficiency of 65 percent, while the current system likely clocks in at around 50 percent. However, long-term storage is a different commercial regime than short-term storage, which relies on lithium-ion and (increasingly) iron-air batteries, so lower efficiencies are still useful.

With a wider adoption of long-term energy storage, a renewable energy grid will be more resilient in the face of various climate calamities, which are only increasing (in both frequency and severity) thanks to anthropogenic climate change. Quidnet hopes to have a GES project with a Texas utility up and running by next year.

Because pigs are remarkably similar to humans, knowing the signs of their decomposition can help identify hidden burials.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Knowing what signs to look for helps both forensic scientists and the families of the deceased in the ongoing search for missing cartel victims.

Jalisco, Mexico, is renowned for its mariachi music, rodeos, top-shelf tequila and historic capital city of Guadalajara, but beneath this colorful facade lurks a dark underbelly of crime. The Jalisco Nueva Generación cartel is behind the murder and disappearance of thousands of victims who are often never found. 

Over one hundred thousand people have disappeared under mysterious circumstances linked to the crime syndicate since 2006—About 15,500 were reported missing in March of this year alone. Efforts to find the remains of loved ones have often been futile. Members of the Guerreros Buscadores collective, who tirelessly try to locate the missing, have found hundreds of items of clothing on the property, along with charred human remains that were almost impossible to identify. 

While a mapping project headed by the federal research institute CentroGeo keeps testing new techniques and equipment, such as laser scanners and thermal drones, that could lead to breakthroughs in unearthing clandestine graves, technology is not enough. This is why the Jalisco Search Commission is trying to learn more about identifying hidden bodies by dressing up pig cadavers in human clothes and burying them.

While humans may not look anything like pigs, Homo sapiens have 98% of their DNA in common with the hoofed mammals. Too few humans donate their bodies to taphonomic facilities (often called “body farms”). Most donors are also elderly and die of natural causes, while cartel victims are usually adults whose lives are lost in violence. Swine models are ideal analogs for humans due to size and fat distribution. The structure and thickness of skin are incredibly similar, which makes the ideal for studying postmortem insect colonization and other decomposition processes.

Forensic scientists in Jalisco have learned to pick up on some telltale signs of a grave. After the burial of pig carcasses in one area of the Search Commission's facility, scientists led by mapping project coordinator José Luis Silván noticed yellow flowers blooming from the phosphorus leaching into the soil from bodily fluids. Another group of researchers who ran their own experiments with pigs were able to connect levels of phosphorus in the soil with decomposition. Phosphorus encourages flowering in plants, which is why the sight of yellow flowers guides those in search of graves. 

Other elements released as pig cadavers decompose, such as nitrogen and potassium, are detected by drones with hyperspectral cameras that measure light signatures from substances in the ground. Nitrogen contained in the tissues of organisms is in its organic form. When fungi and microbes start to decompose dead tissue, inorganic nitrogen is then returned to the soil as ammonia. Potassium can release during the early stages of decomposition because it is not bound to carbon in an organic form, which is why its presence could possibly identify the body of someone recently reported as missing.

Silván and his fellow researchers also use graves behind a transparent acrylic pane to study cadavers decomposing in real time. They also analyze soil samples from the pig graves and compare the to those from human graves. Both are especially important in terms of insect activity, since some species, such as blowflies, colonize soon, and others appear later. The growth phases of larvae when a body is discovered can possibly give away how much time has elapsed since death.

Victims of cartel murders also tend to be found in certain places, as the commission has learned from information given by family members who have found clandestine graves. Many of these graves are found under trees with vertical roots because grave diggers prefer to stay in the shade when the scorching Mexican sun is beating down. Other graves have been identified by the placement of soil and plants that, when compared to the surrounding environment, seem unnatural. 

“In the context of this terrible tragedy, Amnesty International urges the Mexican state to engage in dialogue with the searchers, to listen to their needs and to recognize the experience they have gained through many years of work in the field,” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, Executive Director of Amnesty International  Mexico. “[They should also be guaranteed] their right to search without fear.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Max-dose statins save lives—here's why doctors are starting strong","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250730030356.htm","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 04:03:22 GMT","

There is broad consensus that the overall body of evidence shows lowering LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol provides both statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits in treating and preventing cardiovascular disease. Often referred to as the ""bad"" cholesterol, elevated levels of LDL can clog arteries and significantly increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

In an invited editorial published in the current issue of Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine urge practicing cardiologists to achieve lower LDL cholesterol levels beginning with the highest doses of the most potent statins, namely rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. The authors emphasize that high-potency statins should be the primary pharmacologic in the treatment of cardiovascular disease as adjuncts to therapeutic lifestyle changes.

The researchers emphasize that therapeutic lifestyle changes will be effective in the absence and presence of adjunctive therapies in treating and preventing cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle changes of proven benefit include avoidance or cessation of cigarette smoking, achieving and maintaining healthy body weight and blood pressure, regular physical activity, and restricting alcohol consumption.

Despite the proven effectiveness of therapeutic lifestyle changes, approximately 40% of adults in the United States have metabolic syndrome, a constellation of risk factors including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. These individuals have a cardiovascular risk equivalent to those with prior heart attacks or strokes, yet many are underdiagnosed and undertreated.

The authors also underscore that only about 21% of Americans meet the minimum daily requirement for physical activity, and that meaningful increases in physical activity are possible at any age, including among older adults.

Based on the robust totality of randomized trial data and their meta-analyses, the authors conclude that statins - particularly rosuvastatin and atorvastatin - have the strongest and most consistent body of evidence supporting their prescription in treatment and prevention in both men and women including older adults.

Because most patients tend to stay on their initially prescribed statin dose, the authors recommend that cardiologists consider starting therapy with the highest dose of these agents and titrating down if necessary. They also highlight that the benefits of statins and aspirin are at least additive and potentially synergistic. Most secondary prevention patients should be prescribed aspirin. In primary prevention, however, individual clinical judgments are necessary, and aspirin should be considered after statins - and if the residual risk of occlusion exceeds that of major bleeding, predominantly gastrointestinal.

""Practicing cardiologists may wish to consider that all adjunctive drug therapies to therapeutic lifestyle changes should be added only after achieving maximal doses of statins. Further, statins have the largest and most persuasive body of evidence of any pharmacological adjunctive therapy in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease,"" said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D, FACC, senior and corresponding author and the first Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and interim chair, Department of Population Health, Schmidt College of Medicine.

The researchers offer cautious views of adjunctive therapies such as ezetimibe and evolocumab, which tend to be used more widely than optimal. For example, in the IMPROVE-IT trial, the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin showed only a minor benefit, while the FOURIER trial demonstrated evolocumab's efficacy in secondary prevention only in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia already on maximal statin doses. While FOURIER was a completed trial of secondary prevention, ILLUMINATE is an ongoing trial in high-risk primary prevention patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

""These findings suggest that such therapies may be more appropriately reserved for select high-risk patients who have not achieved LDL goals with statins alone,"" said Hennekens.

The authors also discuss the role of omega-3 fatty acids, noting that earlier trials were positive but later tended to show no net benefit. The authors opine that this may have been due to widespread statin use. They note that in REDUCE-IT, a large-scale randomized trial, icosapent ethyl was the only omega-3 fatty acid to demonstrate significant added benefits when added to evidence-based doses of high potency statins. Patients assigned at random to icosapent ethyl, a purified form of eicosapentanoic acid, experienced a significant 25% reduction in major cardiovascular events, with a number needed to treat of just 21.

Hennekens also reflected on the enduring relevance of Benjamin Franklin's 1736 observation that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""

Researchers at the University of Michigan have illuminated a complete sensory pathway showing how the skin communicates the temperature of its surroundings to the brain.

This discovery, believed to be the first of its kind, reveals that cool temperatures get their own pathway, indicating that evolution has created different circuits for hot and cold temperatures. This creates an elegant solution for ensuring precise thermal perception and appropriate behavioral responses to environmental changes, said Bo Duan, senior author of the new study.

""The skin is the body's largest organ. It helps us detect our environment and separate, distinguish different stimuli,"" said Duan, a U-M associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. ""There are still many interesting questions about how it does this, but we now have one pathway for how it senses cool temperatures. This is the first neural circuit for temperature sensation in which the full pathway from the skin to the brain has been clearly identified.""

This work deepens our understanding of fundamental biology and brings us closer to an explanation for how we evolved to inhabit safe temperatures and avoid dangerous extremes, Duan said. But it also has medical implications that can be explored to help improve the quality of life for people in the future.

For example, more than 70% of people who have undergone chemotherapy experience pain caused by cool temperatures, Duan said. The new study found that the neural circuit responsible for sensing innocuous cool does not mediate this type of cold pain. But, in understanding how the cool-sensing circuitry works when it's functioning properly under normal conditions, researchers now have a better chance of discovering what goes wrong in disease or injury. It could also help develop targeted therapies that restore healthy sensation without impairing normal temperature perception.

This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and performed in collaboration with Shawn Xu and his research team in the U-M Life Sciences Institute.

A cool amplifier discovery

In their study, published in the journal Nature Communications, Duan and his team used sophisticated imaging techniques and electrophysiology to observe how mice transmitted the sensation of cool temperatures from their skin to the brain.

It's an approach the team has applied to other sensations in the past. Headed by postdoctoral research fellow Hankyu Lee and doctoral students Chia Chun Hor and Lorraine Horwitz, the team turned its focus to temperature in this work.

""These tools have allowed us to identify the neural pathways for chemical itch and mechanical itch previously,"" Duan said. ""Working together, the team identified this very interesting, very dedicated pathway for cool sensation.""

The cool signal starts at the skin, which is home to molecule sensors that can detect a specific range of temperatures between about 15 and 25 degrees Celsius -- equivalent to 59 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. When those sensors engage, they excite primary sensory neurons, which send the cool signal to the spinal cord. Here, the team found that the signal is amplified by specialized interneurons, which then activate projection neurons that connect to the brain.

Researchers had previously known about the skin's molecular thermometers -- they, in part, earned researchers in California the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine -- but the spinal cord's amplifier was an unknown key ingredient. With the amplifier disabled, the cool signal becomes lost in the noise, the team found.

Although the study was performed in mice, each component of the circuit has been shown to be in humans through genetic sequencing, Duan said. So it's likely that we have the same pathway to thank for the refreshing sensation of stepping into an air-conditioned room on a hot summer day.

Moving forward, the team is looking to identify the pathway or pathways involved in acute cold pain.

""I think the painful sensations are going to be more complicated,"" Duan said. ""When we're in riskier situations, there could be multiple pathways involved.""

His team is also interested in how the brain processes these various skin signals and how we've evolved not only to differentiate between them, but also connect emotions with them to help protect ourselves. In fact, it's the curiosity around those sorts of questions that originally motivated Duan's work, which he is perpetually reminded of working in Michigan.

""In summer, I love walking along Lake Michigan and having a gentle breeze hit my face. I feel very cool, very comfortable,"" Duan said. ""But the winter is really terrible for me.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Reversing Alzheimer's damage: Two cancer drugs demonstrate surprising power","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250730030402.htm","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 11:46:02 GMT","

Scientists at UC San Francisco and Gladstone Institutes have identified cancer drugs that promise to reverse the changes that occur in the brain during Alzheimer's, potentially slowing or even reversing its symptoms.

The study first analyzed how Alzheimer's disease altered gene expression in single cells in the human brain. Then, researchers looked for existing drugs that were already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cause the opposite changes to gene expression.

They were looking specifically for drugs that would reverse the gene expression changes in neurons and in other types of brain cells called glia, all of which are damaged or altered in Alzheimer's disease.

Next, the researchers analyzed millions of electronic medical records to show that patients who took some of these drugs as part of their treatment for other conditions were less likely to get Alzheimer's disease.

When they tested a combination of the two top drugs -- both of which are cancer medications -- in a mouse model of Alzheimer's, it reduced brain degeneration in the mice, and even restored their ability to remember.

""Alzheimer's disease comes with complex changes to the brain, which has made it tough to study and treat, but our computational tools opened up the possibility of tackling the complexity directly,"" said Marina Sirota, PhD, the interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, professor of pediatrics, and co-senior author of the paper. ""We're excited that our computational approach led us to a potential combination therapy for Alzheimer's based on existing FDA-approved medications.""

The findings appeared in Cell on July 21. The research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.

Big data from patients and cells points to a new Alzheimer's therapy 

Alzheimer's disease affects 7 million people in the U.S. and causes a relentless decline in cognition, learning, and memory. Yet decades of research have only produced two FDA-approved drugs, neither of which can meaningfully slow this decline.

""Alzheimer's is likely the result of numerous alterations in many genes and proteins that, together, disrupt brain health,"" said Yadong Huang, MD, PhD, senior investigator and director of the Center for Translational Advancement at Gladstone, professor of neurology and pathology at UCSF, and co-senior author of the paper. ""This makes it very challenging for drug development -- which traditionally produces one drug for a single gene or protein that drives disease.""

The team took publicly available data from three studies of the Alzheimer's brain that measured single-cell gene expression in brain cells from deceased donors with or without Alzheimer's disease. They used this data to produce gene expression signatures for Alzheimer's disease in neurons and glia.

The researchers compared these signatures with those found in the Connectivity Map, a database of results from testing the effects of thousands of drugs on gene expression in human cells.

Out of 1,300 drugs, 86 reversed the Alzheimer's disease gene expression signature in one cell type, and 25 reversed the signature in several cell types in the brain. But just 10 had already been approved by the FDA for use in humans.

Poring through records housed in the UC Health Data Warehouse, which includes anonymized health information on 1.4 million people over the age of 65, the group found that several of these drugs seemed to have reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease over time.

""Thanks to all these existing data sources, we went from 1,300 drugs, to 86, to 10, to just 5,"" said Yaqiao Li, PhD, a former UCSF graduate student in Sirota's lab who is now a postdoctoral scholar in Huang's lab at Gladstone and the lead author of the paper. ""In particular, the rich data collected by all the UC health centers pointed us straight to the most promising drugs. It's kind of like a mock clinical trial.""

A combination therapy poised for primetime 

Li, Huang, and Sirota chose 2 cancer drugs out of the top 5 drug candidates for laboratory testing. They predicted one drug, letrozole, would remedy Alzheimer's in neurons; and another, irinotecan, would help glia. Letrozole is usually used to treat breast cancer; irinotecan is usually used to treat colon and lung cancer.

The team used a mouse model of aggressive Alzheimer's disease with multiple disease-related mutations. As the mice aged, symptoms resembling Alzheimer's emerged, and they were treated with one or both drugs.

The combination of the two cancer drugs reversed multiple aspects of Alzheimer's in the animal model. It undid the gene expression signatures in neurons and glia that had emerged as the disease progressed. It reduced both the formation of toxic clumps of proteins and brain degeneration. And, importantly, it restored memory.

""It's so exciting to see the validation of the computational data in a widely used Alzheimer's mouse model,"" Huang said. He expects the research to advance soon to a clinical trial so the team can directly test the combination therapy in Alzheimer's patients.

""If completely independent data sources, such as single-cell expression data and clinical records, guide us to the same pathways and the same drugs, and then resolve Alzheimer's in a genetic model, then maybe we're onto something,"" Sirota said. ""We're hopeful this can be swiftly translated into a real solution for millions of patients with Alzheimer's.""

Pore-forming proteins in allergens make the body cough and sneeze.Credit: Wavebreak Media ltd/Alamy

The sneezing, itchy eyes and coughing elicited by some allergens are caused by proteins creating holes in airway cells, reports a study published this week in Nature1.

The findings challenge scientists' understanding of how allergies are triggered, says Feargal Ryan, who studies host–microbe interactions at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Before this, the mechanism that triggers immune responses to allergens was not really understood. Researchers focused mostly on how a single allergen elicits a reaction, rather than looking for a generalizable mechanism.

The results could also change allergy-treatment strategies, which typically target the allergen directly or downstream immune responses. Now, researchers can start looking for ways to target the hole-creating proteins that are initiating the immune response, Ryan says.

Researchers based in Beijing, China, identified two proteins in the mould Alternaria alternata, which causes allergic reactions in about 5% of people, that trigger the airway inflammation seen during allergic reactions.

Together, the proteins, called Aeg-S and Aeg-L, create a pore in the membranes of cells lining the nose, throat and lungs. This allows calcium ions to enter the cells and release molecules that alert the immune system to danger. The damage to cell membranes from these pore-forming proteins could be a “common signal that our body uses to recognize something as an allergen”, says co-author Mo Xu, who studies immune responses at Tsinghua University.

To test how the proteins stimulated the immune system, the team treated lung cells with the proteins. Administering the proteins at the same time triggered a similar response as administering an extract of A. alternata, but this response was not seen when the proteins were given one at a time.

The researchers also tested whether the proteins could cause an allergic airway inflammation in mice. Six hours after mice were given the proteins intranasally, the rodents showed immune responses similar to those triggered by exposure to A. alternata.

The team also observed signs that the mice had developed a respiratory allergy, such as increased levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) — an antibody produced in response to allergens — after the mice were given the proteins every three days for two weeks. This response wasn't seen when the proteins were administered separately, or when mice were exposed to genetically modified mould lacking either protein.

I'm sitting in my office, coffee in hand, talking to ChatGPT. I've carved out a rare hour to think through a new research proposal — a luxury amid the demands of teaching, service and parenting as a tenure-track assistant professor developing methods to deliver nucleic acids for gene therapy.

I've always loved writing grants. It's a skill I developed as a graduate student and postdoctoral researchers, and one I still find deeply rewarding: shaping a question, crafting a narrative, imagining the possibilities. It's one of the most creatively satisfying parts of my work, and I am good at it. I wrote a few successful proposals before artificial intelligence (AI) entered the picture.

I've learnt over the years that one of the most efficient ways for me to clarify scientific ideas is to discuss them with someone. In the past, that was usually a fellow postdoc or grad student. But these days, my verbal sparring partner is often a computer.

Using voice dictation, I start with some background: “I've been thinking about X and Y, and how they connect to Z. I wonder if there's something novel here, something that hasn't been done before.” And then I ask: “Do you think this is a fundable idea?”

Forget ChatGPT: why researchers now run small AIs on their laptops

The chatbot replies with its usual enthusiasm: “You're really onto something powerful here. Your instinct is dead on.” It reflects on my idea, identifies promising themes, breaks them down and suggests directions and framing strategies I hadn't considered. We go back and forth. I raise concerns — technical limitations, feasibility, scope — and it responds thoughtfully, sometimes agreeing, sometimes offering counterpoints. But the real value comes only when I press further. 

Initially, the chatbot is unfailingly positive; it will encourage almost anything. To get useful feedback, I have to interrogate the idea: what's missing, what might reviewers say, where's the fatal flaw? It's a dialogue, not a verdict. I have to stay engaged and ask the right questions. When I do, the chatbot surprises me — it readily acknowledges the weaknesses I identify, provides reasons the idea might fail and then pivots towards solutions and refinements I hadn't considered. By the end of our half-hour conversation, I've clarified my thinking. I'm more motivated. Most importantly, I feel excited to start writing.

That emotional impact is something I didn't anticipate when I started using chatbots. Talking science with an AI feels oddly supportive. It's efficient, but also energizing. As a young parent and early-career researcher, I often find myself short on time and mental bandwidth. AI doesn't solve that, but it lowers the barrier to getting started. If I don't know something, I can ask. If I need help articulating a method or identifying a theoretical gap, it offers a starting point. Of course, I always double-check the details — nothing goes into a proposal or paper without being verified using primary sources, because chatbots can confidently generate plausible-sounding yet inaccurate scientific statements. 

What's striking is how natural the back-and-forth feels. It's like doing improvisational comedy with the world's most supportive partner — always ready with a ‘yes, and …'. A partner who also happens to be an amorphous, seemingly all-knowing generalist with a surprising degree of specialist knowledge. It can pull together context across disciplines, synthesize literature and help me to connect my work to areas I know less well.

That kind of breadth is invaluable. But if you're a specialist, you'll quickly notice the cracks. Chatbots can mislead on technical nuances and they're best at reiterating what's already been published. That's why I find them most powerful as big-picture ideation tools — they let me explore ideas freely, without judgement, and help me to quickly uncover what's already known.

This kind of fast, exploratory dialogue is quite different from the results of tools such as ChatGPT's Deep Research mode, launched this year by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which can prepare detailed reports on specific topics on its own. What I'm describing is much more immediate — a conversational exchange that helps me to clarify and refine ideas as I think them through.

Over time, I've learnt a few ways to make these conversations more productive.

Start with a specific prompt, then expand. I begin with a concrete question — concerning a technique, problem or recent paper — and then ask, could this be used differently? What else might this apply to? This invites unexpected angles and broadens the conversation.

Be vigilant about accuracy. I read papers while chatting, grounding ideas in the literature. Chatbots can fabricate references or get details subtly wrong, so I always verify claims and citations using peer-reviewed sources.

Ask critically, not passively. I stay engaged by constantly questioning the chatbot's output. When it says something, I often counter: isn't this wrong? Wouldn't it actually work like this? Usually, it agrees — and then expands helpfully on the correction. The real value is in how it builds from your thinking, adding context and detail that sharpen the idea.

DELLA proteins integrate external and internal cues into a signaling network critical for land plant survival. In flowering plants, gibberellins (GAs) induce DELLA recognition to its receptor GID1, resulting in the polyubiquitylation and degradation of DELLA repressors. Notably, bryophytes lack the canonical GA receptor, despite the presence of genes encoding DELLA in these nonvascular land plants. Consequently, the underlying molecular mechanisms of DELLA regulation in bryophytes have remained largely elusive. Here, we report that MpVIH, responsible for the synthesis of inositol pyrophosphate messenger InsP8, negatively regulates DELLA in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha to promote cell division and thallus development. Mechanistically, we elucidate that MpVIH-derived InsP8 binds to MpDELLA, promoting polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the repressor. Lastly, our study provides evidence for the conservation of inositol pyrophosphate-controlled DELLA degradation in angiosperms. We, thus, identify a ‘noncanonical' type of DELLA regulation by the inositol pyrophosphate messengers in land plants.

The existence and intermediacy of halogen-substituted silylium ions have been the subject of speculation for decades. These elusive reactive intermediates are synthetically attractive because of their computationally predicted super Lewis acidity and their relevance in several synthetic transformations such as recycling of waste from the Müller–Rochow process and hydrodefluorination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Here we report the generation and characterization of all halogen-substituted silylium ions of type [Alk2XSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (X = F, Cl, Br or I; Alk = Me, Et, iPr or tBu). While the established Corey hydride transfer reaction fails to make such ions in the condensed phase, the protolysis of the halosilanes Alk2XSi‒LG (LG = H or Ph) using Reed's superacidic benzenium ion [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]− provides practical access. The full series of counteranion-stabilized iPr2XSi+ cations is isolated and crystallographically characterized. The obtained halogen-substituted silylium ions are more Lewis acidic than their known trialkyl- and hydrogen-substituted congeners, as verified by quantitative assessment of their fluoride ion affinities using density functional theory calculations.

The debate on the existence of silylium ions (R3Si+) in the condensed phase, the so-called silylium ion problem1, was finally resolved with the isolation and characterization of the tricoordinate (free) trimesitylsilylium ion (Mes3Si+) (ref. 2). Despite these controversial beginnings3, silylium ions have nowadays emerged as potent reagents and catalysts in synthetic chemistry4,5. In catalytic transformations, tetracoordinate trialkyl-substituted silylium ions stabilized by a donor molecule such as the solvent6 or counteranion7 are typically used as initiators, and the catalytic cycle is then maintained by the self-regeneration of the silylium ion5. The traditional way to make these reactive intermediates is the Corey reaction, that is, the hydride abstraction from the corresponding hydrosilane with the trityl (Ph3C+) salt of a weakly coordinating anion8. Using halogenated 1-carba-closo-dodecaborates, Reed and co-workers succeeded in the synthesis and solid-state characterization of counteranion-stabilized trialkylsilylium ions such as [iPr3Si(HCB11H5Br6)] (refs. 7,9,10,11) (1c → 2c; Fig. 1a). Although the silyl cation is coordinated by one halogen atom of the carborate cluster, this interaction is energetically weak9,10, and the carborate salts show silylium-ion-like reactivity in solution5.

Alk, alkyl substituent; r.t., room temperature. White circles indicate B–H, and grey circles indicate B–Br.

Our laboratory introduced a general approach for the rapid access of carborate-stabilized silylium ions based on the chemoselective protolysis of various tetraorganosilanes using Reed's superacidic benzenium salt12 [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]− (refs. 13,14). Following this strategy, we achieved the synthesis of the full series of hydrogen-substituted silylium ions either by dehydrogenation (leaving group (LG) = H) or dephenylation (LG = Ph), as exemplarily shown for the generation of the secondary silylium ion [tBu2HSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (ref. 15) (3d or 4d → 5d; Fig. 1b).

Recently, we disclosed a protocol for the catalytic halodealkylation of fully alkylated silanes16 and proposed halogen-substituted silylium ions of the type [R2XSi(HCB11H5Br6)] as the key intermediates in the corresponding twofold halodealkylation process17 (Fig. 1c). This method enables the upcycling of Me4Si and Me3SiCl, accumulating as by-products from the Müller–Rochow direct process, into higher-value Me2SiCl2, which serves as feedstock monomer for the silicone production18,19. Within the catalytic cycle, an arenium ion is supposed to cleave the C(sp3)‒Si bond in trialkylhalosilanes, giving rise to hitherto unknown halosilylium ions17. Of note, Dolgov, Voronkov and Borisov have initially postulated the intermediacy of chlorosilylium ions in the substituent redistribution reaction of dialkylchlorosilanes promoted by catalytic amounts of AlCl3 (ref. 20). However, experimental evidence of these reactive intermediates is still lacking. While both inter- and intramolecular halogen stabilization of silylium ions have been investigated systematically21,22, work on halogen-substituted silylium ions has been limited to theoretical23 and gas-phase studies24.

The intermolecular interaction between silylium ions and halides is also the critical step of one of the most prominent applications of trialkylsilylium ions5, that is, the catalytic hydrodefluorination of aliphatic C(sp3)–F bonds in fluorocarbons25. In the search for even more fluoridophilic silylium ions, which even enable the hydrodefluorination of environmentally harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), Gusev and Ozerov identified chlorine-substituted silylium ions as promising candidates by calculating the hydride ion affinity and fluoride ion affinity (FIA) of various silylium ions26. Compared with trialkyl- and hydrogen-substituted silylium ions, these cations are expected to be more electrophilic, as evident by the increasing FIAs in the order Me3Si+ < Me2HSi+ < Me2ClSi+.

Given the importance and relevance of halogen-substituted silylium ions, we envisaged their independent preparation and characterization in the condensed phase. Here, we report the synthesis and solid-state structures of halosilylium ions of type [Alk2XSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (X = F, Cl, Br or I; Alk = Me, Et, iPr or tBu). The key to accessing these long-sought reactive intermediates is the implementation of the protolysis approach by dehydrogenation (LG = H) or dephenylation (LG = Ph) of the corresponding hydro- or phenylsilanes using Reed's superacidic benzenium ion [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]− (6 or 7 → 8; Fig. 1d).

In our initial attempt to generate a halogen-substituted silylium ion, we tested the classical Corey hydride abstraction from a dialkyl-substituted halosilane and chose chlorodiisopropylsilane (6bc) as a test substrate, as we knew from our previous work that the bulky isopropyl group prevents any redistribution of substituents27,28 (Fig. 2a, top). When the trityl salt [Ph3C]+[HCB11H5Br6]− was treated with an excess of iPr2SiHCl (6bc) in benzene at room temperature, a slow reaction occurred, as indicated by a gradual fading of the yellow reaction mixture. However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed the exclusive formation of hydrogen-substituted silylium carborate [iPr2HSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (5c), which is characterized by a 29Si NMR chemical shift of δ = 69.7 ppm and a diagnostic signal in the 1H NMR spectrum for the intact Si–H bond at δ = 5.27 ppm with a 1J(Si,H) coupling constant of 240 Hz. The same reaction outcome was also obtained starting from the corresponding iodosilane iPr2SiHI (6dc), and reducing the silane equivalents to stoichiometric quantities led only to a slower reaction rate. In all cases, no formation of the desired halogen-substituted silylium ion was detected. This result was unexpected, as the trityl cation should not be able to heterolytically cleave silicon‒halogen bonds owing to its substantially lower FIA compared with secondary silylium ions26. We assumed that initial hydride transfer generates a halosilylium intermediate that immediately abstracts the halide from the starting silane to eventually arrive at the observed hydrogen-substituted silylium carborate 5c. This hypothesis was later corroborated by an independent control experiment (see ‘Reactivity‘ section).

The computed 29Si chemical shifts (in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane) were obtained at the X2C-PBE0/x2c-TZVPall-2c level of theory, comparing one-component (1c) calculations with only scalar-relativistic effects (values on the dashed lines) and two-component (2c) calculations including also spin–orbit effects (values on the solid lines). aAll reactions were performed at ca. 0.02 mmol scale in C6D6 (0.2 ml, 0.1 M) in a glovebox under an argon atmosphere. bIsolated yields. cExperimental 29Si NMR chemical shifts determined by 1H,29Si HMQC NMR spectroscopy (500/99 MHz, 298 K, optimized for J = 7 Hz) in 1,2-Cl2C6D4. 1J(Si,F) coupling constant in Hz in parentheses. dComputed 29Si NMR chemical shifts at the ‘exact two-component' (X2C) spin–orbit PBE0/x2c-TZVPall-2c level.

In another effort to access a halogen-substituted silylium ion, we tested our protolysis approach, which already enabled the synthesis of the hydrogen-substituted congeners15. Following this strategy, a pale yellow suspension of Reed's benzenium salt [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]− in benzene was treated with equimolar amounts of iPr2SiHCl (6cb), resulting in immediate gas evolution and the formation of an off-white solid (Fig. 2a, bottom). NMR spectroscopic analysis now indicated successful Si–H bond heterolysis, as apparent by the disappearance of the signal for the Si–H bond in the 1H NMR spectrum. The measured 29Si NMR chemical shift of δ = 74.3 ppm was shifted downfield relative to the hydrogen-substituted silylium ion 5c (Δδ = 4.6 ppm). Because the silylium carborate salts are not very soluble in benzene, the NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated ortho-dichlorobenzene. Unambiguous evidence for the formation of the chlorine-substituted, counteranion-stabilized silylium ion [iPr2ClSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (8bc) was eventually provided by X-ray diffraction analysis (see ‘Crystallographic characterization' section).

We next embarked on a systematic investigation of halogen-substituted silylium ions by variation of the halogen substituent (X = F, Cl, Br or I) and alkyl substituent (Alk = Me, Et, iPr or tBu) in [Alk2XSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (Fig. 2b). Using equimolar amounts of benzenium salt [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]−, iPr2SiHBr (6cc) and iPr2SiHI (6dc) were equally converted in high yields to the corresponding halosilylium ions 8cc and 8dc, respectively (table in Fig. 2b, entries 11 and 15). Conversely, the protolysis of iPr2SiHF (6ac) led to a 1:1 mixture of [iPr2HSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (5c) and [iPr2FSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (8ac). The observed reaction outcome was unclear at this stage, but we had already speculated that fluoride abstraction from iPr2SiHF (6ac) by the transiently formed fluorosilylium ion iPr2FSi+ (8ac) competes with the dehydrogenative protolysis. We therefore used phenyl as the leaving group (LG = Ph) because dearylation (protodesilylation) proved to be a more facile and faster process than the dehydrogenation (LG = H) in our previous study15. Indeed, selective formation of [iPr2FSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (8ac) was now achieved by dephenylation of iPr2PhSiF (7ac) under the same reaction set-up (table in Fig. 2b, entry 3). In addition to the isopropyl group, methyl, ethyl and tert-butyl substituents were also tolerated in this reaction (Fig. 2b). It is worth mentioning that, unlike hydrogen-substituted silylium ions 5, the halogen-substituted silylium ions 8 were obtained without any detectable substituent redistribution, even when decorated with small methyl or ethyl groups at the silicon atom that are prone to intermolecular exchange reactions27,28.

The measured solution 29Si NMR chemical shifts of the halogen-substituted silylium carborates 8 span a relatively wide spectral range (δ(29Si) = 94–41 ppm; Fig. 2b) compared with the purely alkyl-substituted tertiary silylium carborates 2 (δ(29Si) = 113–93 ppm)5. Replacement of one alkyl group in [Alk3Si(HCB11H5Br6)] (2) by a halogen atom generally leads to a considerable high-field shift of the 29Si NMR resonance. Although the 29Si NMR chemical shift of classical trialkylsilylium ions is rather insensitive to the alkyl substituent9, an increasing low-field shift is seen in the order Me < Et < iPr < tBu (refs. 13,28). This trend is also evident for the halogen-substituted silylium ions 8 (except for X = F) and becomes increasingly pronounced in the order Cl < Br < I (Fig. 2c, left). While in the iodosilylium ion series, the 29Si NMR chemical shifts cover the broadest spectral range (δ(29Si) = 94–41 ppm), this alkyl effect is not reflected for the fluorine-substituted silylium ions, and all 29Si NMR chemical shifts are essentially identical (Δδ(29Si) < 4 ppm). However, a correlation is again observable for the 1J(Si,F) coupling constant, which increases steadily in the order Me < Et < iPr < tBu (table in Fig. 2b, entries 1–4). The large 1J(Si,F) values between 369 Hz and 411 Hz are markedly higher than those in neutral fluorosilanes, which typically fall in the range of 275–290 Hz (for example, 1J(Si,F) = 275 Hz for Me3SiF)29. The 1J(Si,F) coupling constant of zwitterionic [tBu2FSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (8ad) also exceeds that of tBu2FSiBr by 65 Hz (1J(Si,F) = 410.5 versus 345.6 Hz)30. The 19F NMR chemical shifts are also more shielded in the same order (δ(19F) = −116.7 ppm for 8aa, −129.0 ppm for 8ab, −137.0 ppm for 8ac and −142.0 ppm for 8ad).

The experimental 29Si NMR chemical shifts were further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (table in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, right). To understand the larger dependence on the alkyl substituent for the heavier halogen-substituted silylium ions, the chemical shifts were computed at adequate, that is, relativistic quantum-chemical levels (see Supplementary Information for the computational details). As expected15, computations on the free gas-phase cations resulted in far too large shifts, and inclusion of the interaction with the carborate counteranion is crucial to obtain shifts in the right range31 (Extended Data Table 1). It should be mentioned here that the silylium ion can exhibit different binding modes with the carborate cluster28,32 (for an in-depth analysis, see Supplementary Information Section 7). Moreover, neglecting the effects of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) at scalar-relativistic one-component (1c) levels leads to an overestimation of the shifts. In particular, the 1c calculations fail to properly describe the trends observed when going to the heavier halogen substituents (Fig. 2c, right, and Extended Data Table 2). Moderate SOC effects for X = F and Cl can be attributed mostly to the interaction of the silicon centre with the bromine atom of the carborate anion, while the larger SOC effects for the heavier halogen substituents align closely with the known SOC shielding effects of covalently bound halogen substituents in many other systems, the so-called normal halogen dependence33,34.

Importantly, the increasing curvature of the experimental shift plot towards X = Br and I with decreasing electron-donating ability of the alkyl substituent is reproduced only when SOC effects are included (Fig. 2c). It is known that such SOC NMR shifts arise through a Fermi-contact mechanism that transfers SOC-induced spin polarization from the heavy substituent responsible for SOC to the respective NMR nucleus33,34. Obviously, the SOC effects increase with the atomic number (that is, nuclear charge) of the halogen. In addition, a better electron-donating ability of the alkyl substituent with Me < Et < iPr < tBu strengthens the covalency of the Si–C bonds and, thus, diminishes the covalency of the Si–X bond. This is clearly evident from the natural population analysis (NPA) charges and from the composition of the relevant natural localized molecular orbitals (Extended Data Table 3), where along this series of alkyl substituents a given Si–X bond becomes increasingly polarized towards the halogen atom. While this effect looks rather moderate, such small changes are known to be sufficient to reduce the effectiveness of the mentioned Fermi-contact mechanism of the SOC NMR shifts34. As a result, the shielding SOC effects for a given halogen tend to be largest for Alk = Me and smallest for Alk = tBu (for example, Δδ(29Si) = −70 ppm for Me2ISi+ and Δδ(29Si) = −40 ppm for tBu2ISi+; Fig. 2c, right, and Extended Data Table 2). The known dependence of the SOC effects on the bond covalency together with the interplay between Si–C and Si–X bond covalency thus largely explain the interesting experimental findings.

The monotonous increase of the computed 29Si chemical shifts in the absence of spin–orbit contributions (see values on the dashed lines in Fig. 2c, right) correlates with decreasing HOMO–LUMO gaps (the energy difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals; Extended Data Table 4) and may reflect, to some extent, decreasing halogen–silicon π-bonding along this series. The more electron-donating alkyl substituents decrease the gaps and therefore contribute to larger shifts at the scalar relativistic level, that is, without spin–orbit effects.

For the isopropyl substituent, we succeeded in the crystallographic characterization of [iPr2XSi(HCB11H5Br6)] for all four halogen atoms (X = F, Cl, Br and I). Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained from a solution of the corresponding silylium salt in ortho-difluorobenzene (for X = F, Br and I) or ortho-dichlorobenzene (for X = Cl) by vapour diffusion with n-pentane and n-hexane, respectively. All molecular structures show the same general features as the reported tertiary trialkyl-7,9,28 and secondary hydrogen-substituted15 silylium carborates (Fig. 3). The positively charged silicon atom is coordinated by one of the bromine atoms from the pentagonal belt of the icosahedral carborate cluster. This interaction leads to a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment at the silicon atom. The key bond lengths and angles of the halosilylium ions 8ac–dc are summarized in Table 1. For comparison, the geometric parameters for [iPr2HSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (5c) and [iPr3Si(HCB11H5Br6)] (2c)7,9 are also listed. As expected, the Si–X bond length increases in the order F < Cl < Br < I. The Si–Br bond distance to the coordinating carborate anion decreases from 8ac (2.439 Å) to 8bc (2.417 Å) and 8cc (2.393 Å), but is longer again for 8dc (2.436 Å). Although all Si–Br bonds are shorter than in trialkyl-substituted silylium carborate 2c, they are still substantially elongated compared with neutral bromosilane Me3SiBr (2.235 Å)35 and dibromosilane (F5C2)2SiBr2 (2.154 Å)36. The bromosilylium salt [iPr2BrSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (8cc) serves as a good reference for assessing the nature of the different Si–Br bonds, as the silicon atom combines both a coordinating and a bound bromine atom. While the former Si–Br bond length is 7% longer, the latter is 3% shorter than in Me3SiBr. This reflects the weakly coordinating nature of the anion and the cationic character of the silylium ion. In addition to the shortened Si–Br bond to the counteranion, the halosilylium ions 8ac–dc exhibit an increasing degree of pyramidalization compared with trialkylsilylium carborate 2c, which is indicative of a higher bromonium ion character arising from the electron-withdrawing effect of the halogen substituent. It should be noted, however, that the Si–Br bond lengths to the carborate anion (2.393–2.439 Å) as well as the sum of the three angles around the silicon atom as a measure of pyramidalization (∑R–Si–R = 344–346°) fall within a relatively narrow range and cannot be correlated with the Lewis acidity of the individual halosilylium ion (see ‘Lewis acidity' section). A trend is seen only for each Si–C bond to the isopropyl substituent, which lengthens steadily from fluorine to iodine within the halosilylium ion series.

Thermal ellipsoids are shown at the 50% probability level. All hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

In an attempt to experimentally correlate the relative Lewis acidities of the halogen-substituted silylium ions, we initially chose the established Gutmann–Beckett method using triethylphosphine oxide37. However, it turned out that this analysis is not compatible with the exceptional Lewis acidity of the halosilylium ions, and multiple signals were observed in the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum. We therefore turned to the Lewis acidity scale introduced by Müller and co-workers using para-fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) as Lewis base38. This NMR probe indeed proved to be suitable, and immediate Lewis adduct formation with the silylium ion led to clean generation of the corresponding silylnitrilium carborate (Fig. 4a). The addition of substoichiometric amounts of FBN ensured that the formation of any pentacoordinate silicon complexes (silanium ions) by double nitrile coordination was prevented. All silylnitrilium ions were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary Information Section 5). The 19F NMR chemical shifts are summarized in the table of Fig. 4a. The degree of deshielding of the 19F NMR chemical shift relative to free FBN (δ(19F) = −103.9 ppm in C6D6) is a measure for scaling the relative Lewis acidities of the corresponding silylium ions. The results depicted in Fig. 4b rank the halosilylium ions 8ac–dc among the strongest isolable silicon Lewis superacids so far39. They are stronger Lewis acids than the corresponding hydrogen-, trialkyl- and triaryl-substituted congeners. The decreasing Lewis acidity from the fluorine to iodine substituent in iPr2XSi+ is in line with the observed trend of intramolecularly halo-stabilized silyl cations reported by Müller and co-workers22.

For a comprehensive list and a comparison with the anchor-point approach using OCF2, see Extended Data Table 5.

The Lewis acidity ranking of the different silylium ions established with the FBN scale was further supported by DFT calculations of the FIAs, a generally accepted more direct thermodynamic index for Lewis acidity39. The FIA is defined as the negative of the enthalpy of the reaction LA + F− → LA–F−. Some of us have recently shown that the widely used anchor-point methods, which are based on isodesmic reactions for Lewis acids with a known FIA (for example, of F2CO) to avoid the calculation of free fluoride, are an improvement only when inadequate density functionals and/or insufficient basis sets lacking diffuse functions are used40. This is also corroborated for the present silylium ions, as supported by a comparison of directly computed and anchor-based FIAs for the full set of silylium ions (Extended Data Table 5). The directly computed FIAs for the different isopropyl-substituted silylium ions are summarized within the table of Fig. 4a. As expected, substitution of hydrogen by fluorine or chlorine enhances the Lewis acidity for a given silylium ion, while bromine or iodine substitution has a much smaller effect. In general, the electron-donating ability of the hydrogen and alkyl substituents increases along the series H < Me < Et < iPr < tBu, and this trend is also reflected in the computed FIAs (as well as in the NPA charges; Extended Data Table 3). Strikingly, Me2FSi+ has the largest FIA only just behind H3Si+ (Extended Data Table 5). Overall, the data clearly confirm that such silyl cations are among the strongest known Lewis acids.

The relative order of Lewis acidity was further tested experimentally by a competition experiment (Fig. 4c). Treatment of chlorosilylium carborate 8bc with equimolar amounts of iPr2SiHCl (6bc) resulted in immediate chloride abstraction from 6bc and the formation of hydrogen-substituted silylium salt [iPr2HSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (5c) along with iPr2SiCl2 (9bc), as monitored by NMR spectroscopy. The reaction outcome can be rationalized by the higher chloride ion affinity of iPr2ClSi+ compared with iPr2HSi+. At the same time, this result also provides an explanation why the established Corey reaction cannot be used to prepare halogen-substituted silylium carborates (Fig. 2a, top). As hydride abstraction from iPr2SiHCl (6bc) by the trityl cation is slow, the incipiently generated chlorosilylium ion iPr2ClSi+ immediately abstracts a chloride from the starting silane 6bc, eventually leading to the selective formation of [iPr2HSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (5c). All halosilylium carborates 8 are crystalline salts stable under inert atmosphere for several weeks at −30 °C, but slow decomposition of any halogen-substituted silylium ion is observed in ortho-dichlorobenzene solution (Fig. 4d, top; for an analysis of this decomposition pathway, see Supplementary Fig. 5). Exposure to sunlight led to even faster decomposition of the halosilylium ions in solution, now resulting in the formation of the corresponding dichlorosilane (Fig. 4d, bottom).

Previously elusive halogen-substituted silylium ions are not only exceptionally strong Lewis acids of academic interest, but also highly relevant in synthetic chemistry. Examples include their intermediacy in the halodealkylation of waste material from the Müller–Rochow process16,17 and their long-sought role as reagents in the hydrodefluorination of PFAS, exploiting their enormous fluoridophilicity25,26. The present work discloses a reliable synthetic access to the whole family of these superreactive cations in the form of their counteranion-stabilized carborate salts [Alk2XSi(HCB11H5Br6)] (X = F, Cl, Br or I). This was achieved by our dehydrogenative (LG = H) or dephenylative (LG = Ph) protolysis13,15 of the corresponding halosilanes R2XSi–LG using Reed's superacidic benzenium salt12 [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]−. The molecular structures have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis with the fluorine congener being particularly fragile and delicate to handle. DFT calculations lend support to the understanding of the stabilization of these superacids, and the agreement between the measured and the computed 29Si NMR chemical shifts is excellent when SOC effects are taken into consideration. An assessment of the Lewis acidity using Müller's FBN method38 and calculated FIAs40 confirm that halogen-substituted silylium ions are among the strongest Lewis acids ever isolated. This work opens the door to unexplored reactivity in catalysis with superelectrophilic silicon reagents.

In a high-quality glovebox (O2, H2O < 1.0 ppm), the indicated hydrosilane 6 or phenylsilane 7 (1.0 equiv.) was added to a suspension of [H(C6H6)]+[HCB11H5Br6]− (1.0 equiv.) in C6D6 (0.2 ml). After stirring the reaction mixture for 2–3 h at room temperature, n-hexane (0.4 ml) was added. The suspension was filtered, and the residue was washed with additional n-hexane (3 × 0.2 ml) and dried for 10 min under high vacuum (~10−3 mbar). The halogen-substituted silylium carborates 8 were obtained as white solids, which can be stored for several weeks at −30 °C in the glovebox.

Dryland carbon fluxes, particularly those driven by ecosystem respiration, are highly sensitive to water availability and rain pulses. However, the magnitude of rain-induced carbon emissions remains unclear globally. Here we quantify the impact of rain-pulse events on the carbon balance of global drylands and characterize their spatiotemporal controls. Using eddy-covariance observations of carbon, water and energy fluxes from 34 dryland sites worldwide, we produce an inventory of over 1,800 manually identified rain-induced CO2 pulse events. Based on this inventory, a machine learning algorithm is developed to automatically detect rain-induced CO2 pulse events. Our findings show that existing partitioning methods underestimate ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis by up to 30% during rain-pulse events, which annually contribute 16.9 ± 2.8% of ecosystem respiration and 9.6 ± 2.2% of net ecosystem productivity. We show that the carbon loss intensity correlates most strongly with annual productivity, aridity and soil pH. Finally, we identify a universal decay rate of rain-induced CO2 pulses and use it to bias-correct respiration estimates. Our research highlights the importance of rain-induced carbon emissions for the carbon balance of global drylands and suggests that ecosystem models may largely underrepresent the influence of rain pulses on the carbon cycle of drylands.

Drylands cover over a third of the global land surface1,2 and substantially influence the trend and interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon sink3,4,5. These ecosystems are water limited, with rainfall driving vegetation and microbial processes that impact ecosystem carbon dynamics6. Sporadic rain pulses in particular play a crucial role in determining plant growth, microbial activity, soil moisture and overall ecosystem productivity7,8,9. Although the influence of water availability on dryland carbon dynamics is well established6,10,11, the processes governing responses to rain pulses remained poorly understood. The amount of carbon lost due to heterotrophic respiration stimulated by rain-pulse events and the key drivers of those losses across diverse dryland ecosystems, remain open questions12,13,14,15, and the underlying processes are thus typically not included in models of dryland carbon dynamics14,16,17.

Rain pulses trigger abiotic and biotic soil CO2 pulses, a phenomenon often termed a rain-induced CO2 pulse event or pulse event. Abiotic CO2 pulses occur when water displaces CO2 from soil pores18,19 or dissolves carbonates20. Biotic CO2 pulses, known as the Birch effect, result from microbial respiration surges following the sudden availability of labile carbon and nutrients13,21,22,23,24. This resource pulse may arise from the release of intracellular solutes, microbial lysis and physical breakdown of soil aggregates23,25,26. While abiotic CO2 pulses are short lived20,27, Birch-effect CO2 pulses can last several days and lead to significant substantial ecosystem carbon losses during the day and night13,15,28,29. Microbial respiration can increase 60–80-fold after rainfall15, then decay as the soil dries13,14,15,21,30, contributing up to 40% to total soil respiration during the growing season29 and 5–10% to annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP)28 (Fig. 1). The intensity of these pulses has been linked to hydrologic dynamics such as the intensity/frequency of rewetting and antecedent soil dryness13,14,15,18. By contrast, plant–microbe interactions are often neglected, mainly because previous research focused on soil-centric environments or vegetation-senescence periods12,20. The combined effects of vegetation, soil properties, climate and hydrologic dynamics on rain-induced carbon losses, therefore, remains poorly constrained.

a, Pulse events, or rain-induced CO2 pulse events, are defined as ecological processes in which rainfall on previously dry soils triggers pulses of soil CO2 and, consequently, pulses of net CO2 flux (NEE). The horizontal bar represents the soil moisture gradient, daytime EF and vegetation growth before and after rain pulses. b, The dynamics of daily ecosystem carbon fluxes (Ra, Rh, Reco, NEE and GPP) during pulse events and CO2 pulse characteristics: (1) length, (2) intensity, (3) size and (4) decay rate (Methods). Reco is ecosystem respiration, Ra is autotrophic respiration and Rh is heterotrophic respiration. The NEE of CO2 flux was measured directly from eddy-covariance towers. We plotted −GPP instead of GPP for visualization purposes. The first-principle relationship between carbon fluxes can be described as follows: NEE = Ra + Rh – GPP, Reco = Ra + Rh. Figure created with BioRender.com.

Modelling these pulse-driven events is particularly challenging due to the sporadic and discontinuous nature of rainfall in drylands6. Most models effectively incorporate steady-state processes such as responses to temperature, long-term changes in soil moisture and vegetation productivity. However they largely neglect non-steady-state but important rain-induced carbon losses15,31,32,33,34,35. This omission could lead to substantial underestimation of soil and ecosystem respiration, potentially resulting in inaccurate estimates of related processes such as gross primary productivity (GPP)14,36. The lack of a broad characterization of dryland rain-induced CO2 pulses has hindered the integration of these processes into existing ecosystem models.

Detecting rain-induced carbon losses across diverse dryland ecosystems is a critical first step to improving model predictions of dryland carbon fluxes. FLUXNET, which provides global eddy-covariance measurements of net CO2 flux or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)37,38, offers a unique opportunity to analyse CO2 pulse responses at high temporal resolution. Rainfall-driven ecosystem respiration (Reco) pulses manifest as net CO2 anomalies, because microbial activity typically responds more rapidly to rainfall than vegetation6,11,26,31,39,40,41 (Fig. 1). However, FLUXNET does not provide continuous measurements of soil and ecosystem respiration36, making NEE the variable of choice for detecting rain-induced carbon losses. Furthermore, conventional eddy-covariance partitioning methods estimate Reco using an Arrhenius-type temperature function34,42 (equation (2)), which may not effectively capture rain-induced carbon losses35,36. NEE observations from FLUXNET thus provide a unique opportunity to both identify and characterize soil CO2 pulses.

Here, we combine a novel manually labelled database of 1,857 pulse events with machine learning frameworks to detect rain-induced carbon losses across 34 dryland eddy-covariance sites, encompassing 323 years of half-hourly observations. Using this database, we characterize the spatiotemporal drivers of net CO2 pulse dynamics and bias-correct Reco estimates derived from the conventional night-time partitioning method. We refer to this integrated detection and correction approach as FluxPulse. Our results highlight widespread underestimation of carbon losses during rain-pulse events in global drylands, with important implications for dryland carbon balance variability under climate change.

We found that pulse events greatly impact the dryland carbon balance, contributing 16.9% ± 2.8% (mean ± the margin of error) to annual ecosystem respiration (Reco) and 9.6% ± 2.2% to NEP across sites (Fig. 2a). These findings align with previous research showing that soil CO2 pulses contribute 5–10% of annual NEP in a mid-latitude forest, with carbon losses during pulse events being comparable with the annual NEP of many ecosystems15,28.

a, Contributions of ecosystem respiration (Reco) and NEP during pulse events to annual Reco and NEP. Pulse event contribution (%) at each individual site is calculated as \(\frac{{{\mathrm{sum}}}\left(x\right)}{{{\mathrm{sum}}}\left(\,y\right)}\times 100\), in which x is FluxPulse bias-corrected half-hourly Reco or NEP during pulse events, and y is all available half-hourly bias-corrected Reco or NEP (two sites whose NEP contribution values greater than three times of standard deviation were removed in the boxplots for visualization purposes). b, Performance of partitioning methods on estimating ecosystem respiration (Reco) and GPP during pulse events. The fluxes estimated from four methods were compared with the FluxPulse bias-corrected Reco and GPP, which are the night-time (NT) method, the daytime method (DT), DML and NN (Methods). The flux underestimation is calculated as \(\frac{{{\mathrm{sum}}}\left(x\right)-{{\mathrm{sum}}}(\;y)}{{{\mathrm{sum}}}\left(x\right)}\times 100\), in which x is the FluxPulse half-hourly Reco or GPP and yis the partitioned half-hourly Reco or GPP from different partitioning methods. Thus, the positive yvalues indicate flux underestimations, while negative yvalues indicate flux overestimations. In a and b, 28/34 sites whose FluxPulse significantly reduces biases (P < 0.001) (Extended Data Fig. 6) are included. The boxes represent interquartile range (IQR) marked with 25th, 50th and 75th percentile and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR. The red diamonds represent the mean of the boxplots. In b, all the boxplots have the mean of distribution statistically greater than 0 (one-tailed paired t-test, P < 0.01). c, Half-hourly time series visualization of NEE, ecosystem respiration estimated by the FluxPulse bias-corrected algorithm (FluxPulse Reco) and by the NT method Reco at the Albuera site, Spain (ES-Abr) in 2017. The NEE points corresponding to pulse events are manually labelled in green, while others are labelled in black. The red line represents FluxPulse bias-corrected Reco, and the blue line represents Reco estimated by the NT method. In the lower graph, the black line shows the daytime EF, calculated daily. The blue bars are precipitation downscaled from ERA-Interim reanalysis data products, with half-hourly resolution. A sharp rise in EF and increased precipitation indicates the occurrence of pulse events and net CO2 pulses.

Source data

Despite this substantial contribution, we found that all four existing eddy-covariance partitioning methods significantly underestimate Reco and GPP during the pulse events when compared our FluxPulse bias-corrected fluxes (Fig. 2b). Underestimation for Reco ranged from 13.4% ± 9.4% to 26.7% ± 9.0%, while GPP ranged from 17.8% ± 11.7% to 33.8% ± 14.2% (Fig. 2b,c). Since GPP is estimated as the difference between Reco and NEE, any underestimation of Reco directly affects the GPP estimates (Fig. 1).

The four partitioning methods examined include parametric approaches (night-time method34 and daytime method42) and machine learning methods (double machine learning (DML)43 and artificial neural networks (NN)44) (Methods). We performed a one-tailed paired t-test to compare partitioning methods, which revealed a clear ranking of Reco underestimation during pulse events, with: NN (13.4% ± 9.4%) < DML (17.9% ± 9.7%) < night-time (22.9% ± 10.7%), daytime method (26.7% ± 9.0%) (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2b). The NN approach underestimates Reco the least, followed by the DML approach, while the night-time and daytime methods exhibit similar underestimations. Regarding GPP during pulse events, the night-time method shows the largest bias (P < 0.01): night-time (33.8% ± 14.2%), daytime (17.8% ± 11.7%), DML (20.9% ± 12.4%) and NN (18.2% ± 11.2%) (Fig. 2b).

Among the four partitioning methods assessed, machine learning approaches (NN and DML) underestimate Reco the least, highlighting their improved performance at capturing non-steady-state events compared with the parametric approaches assessed44. The underestimation of Reco also leads to underestimation of GPP, particularly in methods where GPP is calculated as Reco minus NEE. The night-time method shows the largest GPP underestimations (Fig. 2b), often leading to systematic negative half-hourly GPP during the first few days of pulse events36.

Actual biases in existing methods for estimating Reco and GPP during pulse events could be much higher than those reported here. Our approach assumes minimal GPP during the first day of pulse events, using maximum NEE to estimate maximum Reco, given that the GPP estimates are not reliable during pulse events (Methods). Minimal GPP at the beginning of pulse events could happen in some sites due to the intensive prepulse dryness; however, we demonstrate that this is not the case in most sites (Extended Data Fig. 7). Even though the underestimates we quantified are conservative, our FluxPulse bias-correction method significantly reduces biases compared with existing partitioning methods, providing more reliable estimates of carbon fluxes during pulse events.

Analysing more than 1,800 pulse events, we found that rain-induced carbon pulses decay exponentially after rain events in 85% of sites, following a universal exponential decay pattern (Fig. 3a). The intensity and decay rates of these pulses are primarily governed by environmental factors related to vegetation growth, climate and soil properties (Fig. 3b,c). We calculated site-specific pulse intensity (\({\alpha }_{{{s}}}\)) and decay rate (ks) by fitting a first-order kinetic reaction function to the daily maximum NEE across all pulse events at each site (Fig. 3a). The site-specific pulse intensity represents the maximum magnitude of rain-induced carbon losses at a site, and the site-specific decay rate represents how fast the carbon losses decay over time (equation (1)).

a, NEE declines over time during pulse events across 29/34 sites with statistically significant site-specific decay rate (P < 0.05). The Pvalue is derived from the statistical test for parameter estimates when fitting the decay function to the data. The y axis of the outer graph is the maximum of daily mean NEE from all pulse events from one site, and the x axis is the number of days after the pulse event starts, assuming that rainfall starts on day 1. The first-order kinetic reaction function is fitted for each site and displayed as black lines (equation (2)). The inset presents the same data but normalized by site-specific pulse intensity (\({\alpha }_{{{s}}}\)) and reveals a convergent decay rate across sites (ks = 0.16 ± 0.01, P < 0.001). b,c, A relative importance analysis of nine predictors for site-specific pulse intensity (\({\alpha }_{{{s}}}\)) (b) and decay rate (ks) (c) across 29/34 sites. The predictors related to soil characteristics are clay percentage (%Clay), SOC from 0 to 5 cm (g kg−1) and soil pH. The predictor representing vegetation productivity is annual GPP obtained from the night-time (NT) partitioning method (µmol CO2 m−2 s−1). The predictors representing hydrologic conditions are aridity index (P/PET), rewetting intensity (ΔEF) and antecedent water availability (prepulse EF). The predictors representing climatic conditions are global shortwave radiation (Rg) (W m−2) and air temperature (Tair) (oC). The data in the bar plots are presented as the mean value ± standard deviation. The standard deviation of the bars is calculated by bootstrap sampling (100 times resampling with replacement). All predictors explain 62.5% and 37.5% of the variance in the site-specific pulse intensity and decay rate, respectively.

Source data

When normalizing the NEE rain-pulse response curves by site-specific pulse intensity, the response curves across sites converge to a universal decaying function (\(y=0.96\times {{\mathrm{e}}}^{-0.16x}\)) (Fig. 3a). This indicates a consistent response of soil microbes to rain pulses, probably due to the strong relationship between soil microbes, soil water potential and evaporation45. Prior studies have shown that cumulative soil evaporation follows a square root of time as the soil dries46, further supporting this convergence. Our finding of the convergent decay rate could facilitate the future incorporation of the rain-pulse effect into large-scale ecosystem models. The decaying pattern of net CO2 flux over time probably results from resource depletion (labile carbon, nitrogen, water availability and so on), changes in microbial community composition26 and vegetation growth triggered by pulse events which off-sets CO2 release. The widespread decay pattern highlights the biological influence of rainfall on ecosystem processes beyond abiotic influences, reinforcing the importance of the Birch effect in dryland carbon cycling. Our findings align with previous regional and laboratory studies13,15,21,47, confirming the widespread occurrence of the Birch effect in global drylands.

Multiple environmental factors influence the spatial dynamics of net carbon fluxes during pulse events. The three strongest predictors for the site-specific pulse intensity (\({\alpha }_{{{s}}}\)) across sites are aridity index (P/PET), GPP and soil pH, together with other factors explaining 62.5% variance (Fig. 3b). \({\alpha }_{{{s}}}\) increases with Aridity index (P/PET) and GPP but decreases with soil pH (Extended Data Fig. 9). For the site-specific decay rate (ks), soil pH and air temperature were important predictors, with ksincreasing with soil pH and temperature (Extended Data Fig. 8). However, compared with \({\alpha }_{{\rm{s}}}\), environmental factors explain only 37.5% of variance in ks(Fig. 3b,c). Regarding hydrologic factors, we used evaporative fraction (EF), the fraction of available energy allocated to evapotranspiration, as a proxy of soil water availability and rainfall occurrence (Methods). Despite exhibiting a strong temporal correlation with pulse intensity and size, prepulse EF (the 14-day average EF before a pulse event) and ΔEF (a measure of the rewetting intensity) do not significantly explain the spatial variability of net CO2 pulses during pulse events (Figs. 3b,c and 4c and Extended Data Fig. 4).

a, A performance for detecting the start date of pulse events (within ±2 days error) across 28 qualified sites (see Supplementary Table 1 for more details). Precision is the fraction of pulse events the model detected that were real, while recall is the fraction of actual pulse events that were successfully detected by the model. b, The recall rate for different pulse size groups (divided into equal intervals of 5 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1, ranging from −20 to 20 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1). The dashed line x = 0 defines major (x > 0) and minor (x < 0) pulse events based on the size of net CO2 pulses. Major pulse events (73.7% of the testing set) are defined as carbon sources, while minor pulse events (26.3%) are carbon sinks. c, Feature importance score for all variables used in the random forest model to detect pulse events across 28 sites. The data are presented as the mean value ± standard deviation of accumulation of the impurity decrease for each feature within each decision tree.

Our results show that vegetation productivity is key to initial rewetting responses, as more productive sites supply more labile carbon through root exudation and plant litter, enhancing microbial decomposition12,15,48 (Fig. 3b,c). This also explains why soil organic carbon (SOC) shows little explanatory power for the spatial distribution of pulse characteristics (Fig. 3b,c), since SOC composition (for example, labile versus recalcitrant SOC) is likely more important than total SOC in sustaining the Birch effect23,49 (Fig. 3b,c). Besides GPP, the aridity index (P/PET) is a major predictor of pulse intensity across sites (Fig. 3b). Among all dry sites, wetter sites have higher pulse intensity (Extended Data Fig. 9). This suggests that wetter dryland sites have sufficient moisture to enhance vegetation growth, supplying substrates for microbial decomposition, while they are still dry enough for the Birch effect to occur.

Among all environmental factors, soil pH is a top predictor of both site-specific pulse intensity and decay rate (Fig. 3b,c). Previous studies have highlighted the influence of soil pH on microbial composition50,51,52,53,54,55,56, with soil microbial diversity peaks at near-neutral soil pH at a continental scale53. In our study, we also observe that the site-specific pulse intensity peaks at pH 6 and gradually declines as the pH increases to 8 (Extended Data Fig. 9). This could be attributed to various soil characteristics associated with soil pH, as well as physiological constraints on soil bacteria under extremely acidic or alkaline conditions53. Our validation of SoilGrids pH against site-specific measurements confirms soil pH measurement robustness (Extended Data Fig. 3). Our study shows that soil pH is an important spatial driver of rain-induced carbon pulses, potentially due to its influence on soil microbial dynamics.

Rain-induced CO2 pulse events are non-steady-state ecological processes, making them challenging to detect and model across sites. Nevertheless, automated pulse detection is now possible, given the large amount of data and a better understanding of the complexity of rain-pulse responses. We developed an automated detection framework using a random forest binary classification algorithm, in addition to manually labelling pulse events (Methods). Our results demonstrate that although performance varies across sites, which is possibly due to data quality and site-specific measurement uncertainties, such automated detection is applicable across diverse ecosystems. We successfully detected at least 60% of pulse events in 15/28 sites (Fig. 4a). Detection is most effective for major pulse events—those with net positive CO2 emissions, with 76% of pulses whose size between 10 and 15 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 being correctly detected across sites (Fig. 4b).

We used two common classification metrics to evaluate model performance: precision and recall. Precision is the fraction of detected pulse events that are actual pulse events, while recall is the fraction of actual pulse events correctly detected by the model. Actual pulse events, in this case, are manually labelled pulse events. For example, if 12 pulse events occur, and the model detects 10 events, with only 7 of them being real, then precision is 7/10 (70%) and recall is 7/12 (58%) (Methods). Across sites, the model achieves a precision greater than 0.60 at 15/28 sites (Fig. 4a). Recall rates are generally lower than precision, with the highest recall rate (0.67) observed at the ES-LM1 site (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). Recall improves with the net CO2 pulse size, reaching 0.76 for pulses ranging from 10 to 15 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 (Fig. 4b). Although the model did not effectively capture pulse events with negative pulse sizes, it performed well on most pulse events (73.7% of the pulse events in the testing set), particularly those with positive pulse sizes (Fig. 4b).

Among the features used for classification (Methods), prepulse NEE and daily mean NEE are the two most important predictors of the forest detection algorithm (Fig. 4c), meaning that ecosystem status before pulse events is crucial to detecting them. Pulse occurrence is more likely with positive prepulse NEE and less likely with negative prepulse NEE values when vegetation is active (Extended Data Fig. 10). In a woody savanna, the magnitude of CO2 pulses has also been shown to be inversely correlated with prepulse Reco(ref. 15).

Moreover, EF-derived indices (EF, antecedent water availability (prepulse EF) and rewetting intensity (ΔEF)) accurately describe temporal variability in pulse characteristics and improve machine learning detection performance (Figs. 3b,c and 4c and Extended Data Fig. 4). Lower prepulse EF and higher EF associate with a higher chance of pulse events (Extended Data Fig. 10). Furthermore, our analysis across multiple sites indicates that more intense rewetting events (ΔEF) and drier prepulse periods (prepulse EF) are linked with higher pulse intensity (ΔNEE) and greater pulse size (Extended Data Fig. 4). This indicates that larger pulses are more likely after prolonged dry periods followed by intense rewetting. Our findings suggest that under future scenarios of more intense precipitation and prolonged dry intervals, rain-induced carbon losses will probably intensify57.

Including site-static variables (for example, soil pH, vegetation productivity and aridity index) does not enhance model performance, though adding month as a temporal variable enhances results (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, precipitation is not a substantial predictor of pulse occurrence or intensity (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 4), most likely because EF already captures rainfall effects, and not all rainfall events trigger CO2 pulses.

Overall, EF is an integrated index that captures water dynamics, including the wetting intensity and antecedent water availability. Compared with precipitation, EF-derived indices play an important role in the pulse detection algorithm (Fig. 4c) and they significantly correlate with pulse intensity and size across most sites (Extended Data Fig. 4). While precipitation is undoubtedly a major driver of rain-induced CO₂ pulses, its direct influence is difficult to detect due to under-report rainfall from using the tipping bucket method and landscape heterogeneity58,59. EF, which integrates both wetting intensity and antecedent water availability, could thus be a promising index for water availability particularly at eddy-covariance sites where precipitation and soil moisture data are limited.

While the start date of pulse events is typically well-defined, determining the end date is more ambiguous, as the end date corresponds to the system either returning to prepulse conditions or reaching a stabilized state. However, since carbon emissions are greatest in the first few days of pulse events, potential misidentification of the end date is unlikely to impact overall CO₂ loss estimates. Future work should further optimize detection algorithms and test whether rain-induced CO2 pulses occur in other biomes whose high vegetation activity could mask their signals. Overall, the random forest gives insight into the drivers of pulse responses, enabling a deeper understanding of pulse responses in dryland ecosystems.

Drylands drive the interannual variability and trend of global land carbon sink, but the processes underlying the rain-induced carbon losses responsible for carbon flux variability have not been widely incorporated in terrestrial ecosystem carbon models60. Our study demonstrates that rain-induced carbon losses follow a significant and consistent decay pattern across sites and contribute significantly to the carbon balance of drylands (16.9% ± 2.8% of annual ecosystem respiration and 9.6% ± 2.2% of annual NEP). We show that existing partitioning methods substantially underestimate carbon fluxes in drylands, potentially affecting higher-level ecosystem carbon models and upscaling studies that rely on flux partitioned data. We resolve persistent biases in current eddy-covariance partitioning methods by providing FluxPulse, a bias-corrected dataset of ecosystem carbon fluxes in drylands. Our results highlight the importance of effectively incorporating rain-induced carbon losses from pulse events into models from site to global scales. This is particularly important given the projected expansion of drylands in the twenty-first century61 and rapid changes in global precipitation patterns favouring more intense and less frequent rainfall57.

We collected openly available eddy-covariance data from FLUXNET201562, AmeriFlux (www.ameriflux.lbl.gov) and ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) Warm Winter 2020 (ref. 63) (www.icos-cp.eu), all produced through ONEFlux processing under a CC-BY-4.0 license62. We used only original half-hourly measurements extracted from the gapfilled versions of NEE of CO2 (NEE_VUT_REF), latent heat flux (LE_F_MDS) and sensible heat flux (H_F_MDS), along with meteorological variables such as air temperature (TA_F_MDS) and incoming shortwave radiation (SW_IN_F_MDS). For precipitation, we gathered both tower-measured precipitation (P) and downscaled precipitation (P_ERA) from ERA-Interim reanalysis data products published via the above eddy-covariance networks64.

We selected eddy-covariance sites that satisfied the following criteria: (1) ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (P/PET) <0.65, a common definition of a dryland65, (2) at least 4 years of data and (3) short and sparse vegetation (typically height <2 m and area <30% of tree cover) with IGBP vegetation types belonging to grasslands, savannas, open shrublands, closed shrublands and woody savannas (WSA). We selected ecosystems with short and sparse vegetation to minimize rain loss from vegetation interception and reduce strong vegetation interference with rain-induced CO2 pulse signals detected in NEE measurements. In total, our data contained 34 sites across North America, Europe and Australia, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranging from 245 to 1,180 mm, mean annual temperature ranging from 7 °C to 29 °C and record length ranging from 4 to 21 years in each site (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

We established a foundational database of pulse events by manually labelling the start and end dates of these events, across 323 site-years of data in 34 sites. We then developed a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect pulse events from half-hourly eddy-covariance data, which was trained on the manually labelled dataset.

Rainfall is typically measured by the tipping bucket method in the eddy-covariance network; nevertheless, this method is known to under-report rainfall due to instrument limitations and landscape heterogeneity58,59. We confirmed that many tower data probably under-reported precipitation by noting that precipitation downscaled from ERA (P_ERA) is more synchronous with net CO2 pulses than the in situ-measured precipitation (P) (Extended Data Fig. 2). We therefore used P_ERA as the primary rainfall record.

In addition to rainfall, we used daytime EF as an index of soil water availability and rainfall occurrence. EF is the fraction of available energy allocated to evapotranspiration from the land surface, which we calculated on a daily scale as the average daytime ratio between latent heat flux and the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes66. Daytime EF varies between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a non-water-limiting condition as all available energy is converted to latent heat and 0 indicating a water-limited condition since all available energy is converted to sensible heat. EF range is 0.19 ± 0.18 to 0.52 ± 0.15 across 34 studied sites, including both growing and non-growing seasons. Rainfall after a long dry period creates a surge of EF, and dry ecosystems rarely get too wet for EF to saturate, making EF a potential indicator of soil water availability and rainfall occurrence. Compared with in situ soil water content measurements, EF is broadly available and can be calculated consistently across eddy-covariance sites.

We manually labelled the start and end dates of pulse events via observations of net CO2 pulses, aiming to study their spatiotemporal dynamics and to develop supervised machine learning models for labelling these events (Extended Data Fig. 10 for detailed criteria for labelling). We used original half-hourly time series data on NEE of CO2, daytime EF and downscaled precipitation (P_ERA) from ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Across 34 sites over 323 site-years, we manually labelled 1857 pulse events, with durations ranging from 2 to 26 days. The start date of the pulse event was labelled based on satisfying the following conditions: (1) NEE suddenly increases sharply, (2) NEE gradually decays over at least 2 days after the peak day to distinguish the start of pulses from random noises, (3) EF suddenly increases sharply and (4) positive precipitation (Supplementary Table 2). Sometimes, condition (4) was not satisfied, but we still marked the start of the pulse event because it is likely that rainfall was under-reported. The end date of the pulse event was defined as the date when night-time NEE stabilizes and approximates its prepulse magnitude (Extended Data Fig. 10).

We used random forests to automatically label pulse events at a half-hourly scale, since random forests or tree-based models in general, have been shown to outperform deep learning on tabular datasets67. Furthermore, random forest can inherently handle missing time series data and is more time-efficient compared with deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we applied the random forest binary classification algorithm using the function ‘RandomForestClassifier' in the Python ‘sklearn' package. The algorithm, trained on previously manually labelled datasets, processes FLUXNET formatted data to label measurements as pulse events or not on a half-hourly scale. To train and evaluate this model, we first selected 28 out of 34 sites that each has at least 5 years of data and 20 recorded pulse events. We trained one foundation model using data from all selected sites, using the last 3 years at each site as the testing set; the rest of the observations were randomly split into a training set and a validation set of ratio 80%:20%. This approach not only enhances the generalization capability of our model but also mitigates the risk of overfitting. The validation set was used for model selection purposes (such as tuning hyper-parameters), while the test set was used to evaluate the model's final performance. The features used by the random forest model include hydrologic and carbon flux characteristics that are important signals for the pulse events, including rewetting intensity (ΔEF), antecedent water availability (prepulse EF), pulse intensity (ΔNEE) and antecedent ecosystem productivity (prepulse NEE) (Methods). The full list can be found in Fig. 4c.

We evaluate this model, again with respect to the test set, using two common metrics for classification tasks: precision and recall. Precision is the fraction of pulse events the model detected that were actually real \(\left(\frac{{\rm{true}}\;{\rm{positive}}}{{{\rm{true}}\;{\rm{positive}}}+{{\rm{false}}\; {\rm{positive}}}}\right)\), while recall is the fraction of actual pulse events that were successfully detected by the model \(\left(\frac{{\rm{true}}\;{\rm{positive}}}{{{\rm{true}}\; {\rm{positive}}}+{\rm{{false}}}\;{{{\mathrm{negative}}}}}\right)\). For example, if there are 12 pulse events in total, and the model detected 10 events with only 7 of them being actual pulse events, then precision is 7/10 and recall is 7/12.

Finally, the random forest model allowed us to investigate feature importance, that is, how relatively useful each covariate is in predicting the outcome. In particular, for each feature, we computed the normalized total reduction in the Gini impurity across decision tree leaves. Higher Gini importance indicates that the feature reduces more uncertainty in prediction on average and hence is more important68. We report these scores in Fig. 4c.

We characterized rain-induced carbon pulses within the eddy-covariance network by defining the length, intensity and size of NEE during each event (equation (1) and Fig. 1). Even though the decay rate is an important feature of pulse events (Fig. 1), due to the uncertainties of half-hourly data and heterogeneity in data quality across sites, it is not possible to derive the decay rate for each event. Instead, we characterized the site-specific decay rate for all pulse events within one site (see ‘Site-specific pulse intensity and decay rate'). Regarding pulse length, we defined it as the number of days of the pulse events from the start to the end dates, which was directly calculated from the manually labelled dataset. Pulse intensity is, conceptually, the initial response of microbial respiration (Rh) to rainfall, which was calculated as the change in NEE (ΔNEE) between the mean of 2 days after and the mean of 2 days before rainfall (Fig. 1). NEE was used instead of Rh to calculate the pulse intensity since vegetation has a lagged response to rainfall, hence ΔNEE is equal to ΔRh on the first few days of the pulse events, and the eddy-covariance network does not provide direct measurements of Rh (Fig. 1). Regarding pulse size, we defined it as the sum of the daily mean of half-hourly NEE during the whole period of pulse events (Fig. 1).

To estimate site-specific pulse intensity and decay rate, we fitted a first-order kinetic equation, which aims to mimic the litter decomposition function50

where NEEi,s is the maximum of daily mean NEE on day i from all pulse events in site s (equation (1)). αsand ksare the site-specific pulse intensity and decaying rate of site s, respectively (equation (1)). The site-specific pulse intensity αsis obtained by fitting equation (1) to all pulse events from one site, which is different from the pulse intensity of individual pulse events mentioned above (ΔNEE), even though they represent a similar concept of the initial response of the net carbon flux to rainfall.

The partitioning methods we utilize partition Reco and GPP from NEE based on the relationship NEE = Reco – GPP, in which NEE is the NEE of CO2 fluxes measured directly from eddy-covariance towers, Reco is ecosystem respiration and GPP is gross primary productivity (Fig. 1). We evaluated the performance of partitioning methods on estimating Reco and GPP during pulse events and annually. The common parametric approaches that have been widely used by the flux community are the night-time method, which derives Reco from night-time data as an Arrhenius-type function of temperature34,69, and the daytime approach, which models GPP and Reco based on the light-response curve of GPP and temperature response of Reco(ref. 42). Both approaches model Reco at half-hour j as an exponential function of air temperature (equation (2))69

where \({\mathrm{{Rec}{o}}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}{{\;j}}}\) is Reco modelled by the night-time method at half-hour j, Tair,jis the air temperature at half-hour j, Rref is reference respiration at reference temperature (Tref = 288.15 K) and T0 = 227.13 K and E0 is temperature sensitivity (Fig. 2c).

In addition to evaluating the parametric approaches, we assessed machine learning methods to partition Reco and GPP during pulse events, which are a hybrid model based on artificial NN44 and a causal hybrid model based on DML43. The NN approach integrates physical constraints to simultaneously estimate Reco and GPP through two sub-networks and showed improved flux estimates during pulse events at the US-SRG site44. The causal hybrid model enhances the hybrid model by incorporating principled causal knowledge and employs the DML approach for estimating causal effects43. Each model incorporates variables such as soil water content, shortwave radiation, day of the year, wind speed, vapour pressure deficit and air temperature as predictors. We reimplemented both approaches and ran them on our selected sites.

We developed the FluxPulse algorithm to model rain-induced carbon pulses from eddy-covariance flux data in 34 studied global dryland sites. FluxPulse bias-corrects Reco and GPP from the night-time method during pulse events and prepulse periods, in which the night-time method fails to capture the temporal dynamics (Fig. 2c). For non-rewetting and non-prepulse periods, FluxPulse retains Reco and GPP estimates from the NT method. A visualization tool for FluxPulse bias-corrected datasets can be accessed via ref. 70.

To bias-correct both Reco and GPP during pulse events, we first bias-corrected Reco, then calculated GPP as the difference between bias-corrected Reco and NEE. In summary, FluxPulse re-estimates Reco during pulse events by forcing Reco on the first day of pulse events to approximate maximum NEE on the same day, then calculating Reco in the following days using the decay rate k, which is computed empirically for each pulse event (equation (4)). A correction factor β, which was written as a decay function and calculated on a daily scale, was applied to all half-hourly night-time method Reco (\(\left.{{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}}\right)\)) from the same day to obtain the half-hourly FluxPulse Reco (\({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{\rm{FluxPulse}}}\)) (equation (3))

where \({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{\rm{FluxPulse}},{i},{{\;j}}}\) is the FluxPulse bias-corrected Reco on day i and half-hour j, and βiis the correction factor applied to all \({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}{{i}},{{\;j}}}\) on day i and half-hour j, in which \({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}{{i}},{{\;j}}}\) is Reco obtained from the NT method. β decays over time to represent the decaying characteristics of Reco during pulse events13,15 (equation (4) and Fig. 1) and is calculated as

where \({{\mathrm{NEE}}}_{{98}_{1}^{{\rm{th}}}}\) and \({\mathrm{Reco}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}{98}_{1}^{{\rm{th}}}}\) are, respectively, the 98th percentile of half-hourly NEE and night-time method Reco on day 1 of the pulse event (equation (4)). The 98th percentile values were chosen to select the maximum NEE and might-time method Reco during pulse events. On day 1 (i = 1), βiis equal to the ratio between the 98th percentile NEE and the 98th percentile night-time method Reco (equation (4)), hence for \({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}{{i}},{{\;j}}}\) equals to \({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{{\rm{NT}}}_{{\rm{method}}}{98}_{1}^{{\rm{th}}}}\), \({{\mathrm{Reco}}}_{{\rm{FluxPulse}},{{i}},{{\;j}}}\) is equal to the 98th percentile NEE. This bias-correction method reduces the bias of the NT-method Reco and forces the maximum of FluxPulse Reco to approximate maximum NEE during pulse events, given Reco should be theoretically larger or equal to NEE (equation (3)).

In equation (4), kis theoretically the decay rate of each pulse event. Since the half-hourly data are often noisy, and we do not have direct, continuous measurements of Reco or Rh, the decay rate k was estimated empirically as follows (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). First, we fitted a first-order kinetic equation similar to equation (1) to the array \({{\mathrm{NEE}}}_{{68}_{1}^{{\rm{th}}}}\), \({{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{{68}_{2}^{{\rm{th}}}}\), \({{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{{68}_{3}^{{\rm{th}}}}\)… \({{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{{68}_{{\rm{i}}}^{{\rm{th}}}}\) in which \({{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{{{{p}}}_{{{i}}}^{{\rm{th}}}}\) is the pth percentile of all half-hourly NEE on day i. The 68th percentile was chosen to reflect values within ±1 standard deviation from the mean on each day. If the nonlinear fit is statistically significant (P < 0.1), then the estimate of k is accepted. If the nonlinear fit is not statistically significant, we fitted a first-order kinetic equation to an alternative array: \(\,\bar{{{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{1}}\), \(\bar{{{\mathrm{NEE}}}_{2}}\), \(\bar{{{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{3}}\) … \(\bar{{{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{i}}\), in which \(\bar{{{{\mathrm{NEE}}}}_{i}}\) is the mean of all half-hourly NEE in day i from all pulse events in a specific site. We validated FluxPulse Reco against NEE at night, which was assumed to approximate Reco due to the lack of photosynthesis at night (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). We only selected pulse events that lasted longer than 3 days for validation to minimize the effect of random error and the potential introduction of uncertainties due to low-turbulence conditions.

It is worth noting that in equation (4), by using NEE to set FluxPulse Reco during pulse events, we implicitly assume that GPP during the first day of rainfall is minimal due to the prepulse dry periods. Even though this is not the case in most sites (Extended Data Fig. 7), the assumption is necessary as there are no direct measurements of GPP and the partitioning methods available cannot provide reliable GPP estimates during pulse events. Importantly, this assumption is conservative and does not inflate the magnitude or importance of the main results. If GPP is positive on the first day of the pulse event, the bias in Reco is expected to be even larger, as Reco = NEE + GPP. Our reported bias values therefore probably underestimate the true bias associated with the partitioning methods assessed during pulse events (Fig. 2a,b).

In addition to being biased during pulse events, the NT partitioning method is biased in the days leading up to pulse events (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5). This is due to the fact that the NT method uses a moving window to estimate Rref (equation (2)), and this window overlaps with the pulse event periods in the days before the pulse event. We therefore bias-corrected Reco and GPP before the pulse events to reduce the prepulse biases (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Methods). We selected the prepulse period as n days before the pulse events (n being the event length) and used a 2-day window to estimate Rref instead of a 4-day window used in the night-time method34 (equation (2)). Only prepulse periods that do not overlap with previous pulse events were selected for correction.

Validation against the NEE measurements at night is complicated by the fact that rain events greatly reduce data quality for eddy-covariance measurements, particularly for open-path sensors. The three sites in the database use enclosed CO2 sensors (ES-LM1, ES-LM2 and ES-Abr), however, which are robust under rainfall conditions71. Evaluation against night-time observations for those three sites shows that FluxPulse reduces the median Reco bias from 27.0% to 0.7% (Extended Data Fig. 5). Across 82% of all studied sites, FluxPulse reduces biases significantly from the night-time method (P < 0.001, one-tailed paired t-test) and successfully captures the pulse temporal dynamics (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6).

Carbon flux characteristics during pulse events are strongly affected by the level of soil dryness and rainfall rewetting intensities14,15. We tested two different indices for rewetting intensity: the EF and precipitation (P) (Extended Data Fig. 4). The rewetting intensity (ΔEF or ΔP) is the difference in either EF or P between 2 days after and 2 days before the rainfall. We calculated the antecedent water availability, denoted as prepulse EF, as the mean of EF 15 days before rainfall. A lower prepulse EF indicates a drier antecedent period. We took the average EF in 15 days before the pulse events happened but not a longer or shorter period, because a longer time window could include a mix of growing season and non-growing season, and a shorter period does not fully represent the history of water stress.

Microbial response to rewetting is influenced not only by water dynamics but also by soil properties15,72. We extracted soil chemical and physical properties such as soil pH, texture and SOC from SoilGrids (www.soilgrids.org), which is a 250-m resolution interpolated global map of soil properties73.

We used the Lindeman, Merenda and Gold (LMG) method in the R package ‘relaimpo' to assess the importance of spatial drivers such as soil characteristics, vegetation uptake, and climatic conditions on the intensity and decay rate of NEE during pulse events (Fig. 3). The LMG method is robust to multicollinearity between variables and provides confidence interval estimation via bootstrapping74. Regarding the temporal drivers of rain-induced carbon losses, we used the feature importance scores obtained from using random forests to label pulse events (‘Identification of pulse events' section).

To analyse the directional relationship between site-specific pulse intensity/decay rate and each predictor, we used partial dependence plot, which effectively considers confounding effects between multiple predictors and the target variable, without assuming a linear relationship such as the Pearson correlation (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 10).

Thirty-four eddy-covariance sites were drawn as orange points.

Percent of pulse events that have precipitation data record (P, P_F, and P_ERA columns in FLUXNET database) within ±1 day from the start day of the events in 34 sites (0.001 mm was set as the threshold for precipitation occurrence). P_ERA aligned most accurately with the occurrence of pulse events, whereas P_F and P records were absent for several of these events.

Soil pH obtained from Soilgrids was compared to soil pH obtained from the BADM (Biological, Ancillary, Disturbance and Metadata) of AmeriFlux & ICOS sites.

Only sites with a significant linear relationship with climatic drivers are shown as points (p < 0.05). Asterisks indicate the level of two-tailed t-test significance for whether the mean of the distribution is different than 0. The boxes represent interquartile range (IQR) marked with 25th, 50th, 75th percentile and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR. n indicates the number of points in each boxplot.

Bias (%) is calculated as (x-y)/x*100%, in which x is the 68th percentile (1 standard deviation) of half-hourly Nighttime NEE, and y is the 68th percentile of half-hourly modelled Reco (either FluxPulse or NT-method Reco) during two days before and after the start of pulse events. Note that there are fewer points before pulse events than after because we only bias-corrected the pre-pulse periods that are not overlapped with previous pulse events. The pre-pulse period covers n days before each pulse event, in which n is the length of that pulse event. The boxes represent interquartile range (IQR) marked with 25th, 50th, 75th percentile and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR. The red diamonds represent the mean of the boxplots.

The boxes represent interquartile range (IQR) marked with 25th, 50th, 75th percentile and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR. The red diamonds represent the mean of the boxplots.

Difference between half-hourly NEE during daytime and nighttime (NEEDT - NEENT) for the period of two days before each pulse event. NEEDT - NEENT could indicate the presence of vegetation activity before pulse events, since the more negative is NEEDT – NEENT, the more likely vegetation is active (NEEDT - NEENT = (Reco DT – GPP) – Reco NT = (Reco DT – Reco NT) – GPP). Assuming that Reco DT – Reco NT is positive since Reco increases with temperature, then the observed negative NEEDT - NEENT must be due to positive GPP. Asterisks indicate the level of one-tailed t-test significance for whether the mean of the distribution is greater than 0 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). The boxes represent interquartile range (IQR) marked with 25th, 50th, 75th percentile and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the IQR.

Partial Dependence Plots for the responses of site-specific decay rate (ks) to nine predictors. Predictors related to soil characteristics are clay percentage (%Clay), soil organic carbon from 0-5 cm (SOC) (g kg−1), and soil pH. The predictor representing vegetation productivity is annual GPP obtained from the Nighttime (NT) partitioning method (µmol CO2 m−2 s−1). Predictors representing hydrologic conditions are aridity index (P/PET), rewetting intensity (ΔEF), and antecedent water availability (Pre-pulse EF). Predictors representing climatic conditions are global shortwave radiation (Rg) (W m−2), and air temperature (Tair) (oC).

Ecosystem restoration is increasingly recognized as a means of climate change mitigation. Recent global-scale studies have suggested that ecosystem restoration could offset a substantial fraction of human carbon emissions since the Industrial Revolution. However, global carbon sequestration potential remains uncertain due to the tree-centric view of some models and difficulties in modelling restoration across different ecosystem types. Here we applied a model-based prediction workflow to estimate the carbon capture potential of restoring forest, shrubland, grassland and wetland ecosystems until 2100. We found that the maximum sequestration potential is 96.9 Gt of carbon, equivalent to 17.6% of the anthropogenic emissions to date, or 3.7–12.0% if taking into account future emissions until 2100. Our results suggest that ecosystem restoration has limited potential for climate change mitigation even if orchestrated with a pervasive shift towards sustainable, low-emissions economies globally. In addition, if we plan restoration targets to match future climatic conditions and consider state transitions of currently natural ecosystems due to climate change, the potential for natural climate solutions related to ecosystem restoration is close to zero. Therefore, we recommend that ecosystem restoration is pursued primarily for restoring biodiversity, supporting livelihoods and resilience of ecosystem services, as the climate mitigation potential will vary depending on the state transitions that occur between vegetation types.

In 2024, the European Parliament passed the ambitious Nature Restoration Law to address the biodiversity crisis by initiating ecosystem restoration in 20% of the European Union's land and maritime areas until 2030 and in all degraded habitats of member states by 20501. The EU initiative aligns with global movements, including the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, launched to halt biodiversity loss and secure human well-being on a long-term basis2,3. Most biodiversity initiatives are linked to the mitigation of anthropogenic climate change through ecosystem-scale carbon storage. The EU Nature Restoration Law explicitly states that accelerating and up-scaling ecosystem restoration will contribute to climate change mitigation.

There is wide consensus that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is central to climate change mitigation4, but recapturing atmospheric CO2 is also necessary to reach climate targets5,6,7. Technological solutions for atmospheric CO2 removal are today unavailable at relevant scales8. Conversely, natural climate solutions (NCSs) are considered straightforward and rely, among others, on the ability of plants to capture CO2 and store carbon in their tissues or later in the soil.

Ecosystem restoration includes revegetation of degraded land to a reference state, thus qualifying as an important NCS via capturing CO2. However, the potential of ecosystem restoration to offset anthropogenic emissions remains controversial. Given the urgency to act and the opportunity to up-scale ecosystem restoration from the mid-2020s, a clear picture of the realistic impact of ecosystem restoration is required.

Influential studies provided promising model outputs9,10, suggesting up to two-thirds of the anthropogenic carbon burden can be recaptured with restoration-based NCS. However, Bastin et al.9 received criticism for their tree-centric view of global ecosystems that ignored diverse ecosystem types and overlooked negative afforestation impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of non-forest ecosystems11,12,13. Open ecosystems (for example, grasslands and savannahs) with their unique biodiversity and ecosystem services, also sequester considerable amounts of carbon14. Unlike in forests, open ecosystem carbon stores are mostly belowground, out of reach from fire and drought, processes to which these ecosystems have a high resilience, and that in forests substantively reduce aboveground carbon15,16,17. Into the future, open ecosystems may be a more secure land-cover type to store carbon in fire-prone regions15. Empirical studies have shown that fire-suppression-driven increases in tree cover of historically open ecosystems has limited impact on total ecosystem carbon stocks18. Furthermore, open ecosystem afforestation increases water scarcity19,20, alters fire regimes, reduces biodiversity21 and albedo, which can offset or outweigh climate benefits22,23.

Strassburg et al.10 addressed some of the above issues by modelling the potential carbon gain of restoring a range of ecosystems and found values similar to Bastin et al.9. However, they used a method to predict potential ecosystem types earmarked for restoration that generates high uncertainty. Examining the current composition of every 4.96 × 4.96 km pixel on Earth's terrestrial surface, they identified natural-looking ecosystem patches and used the proportion of each to extrapolate to the entire pixel, an approach appropriate for homogeneous landscapes but yields high uncertainty in mosaic landscapes (for example, open-forest mosaic, topographically or hydrologically complex landscapes)24,25,26 where uniform anthropogenic impacts were highly unlikely. Furthermore, partially degraded areas are largely overlooked27, and woody vegetation, including non-native plantations, were considered natural looking. Therefore, non-forested landscapes converted to arable land with some planted trees were considered potential forest restoration areas. This bias led, for example, to predicting forest restoration across the Carpathian Basin in Eastern-Central Europe, home to the largest stretch of intact steppe grassland within the European Union. Moreover, Bastin et al.9, Strassburg et al.10 and a recent tree-centric model by Mo et al.28 considered total carbon stocks, although reaching those values by 2100 seems unlikely in certain ecosystem types, especially if restoration is not performed instantaneously but with a realistic schedule over the twenty-first century.

At the low end of the predicted carbon sequestration potential, Cook-Patton et al.5 listed ecosystem restoration as the least effective of the main NCSs, with protecting intact ecosystems and improving land management ranked as best alternatives. This aligns with Mo et al.28, who also focused on increasing carbon stocks of existing forests. Nolan et al.6 then highlighted the uncertainty of restoration-mediated CO2 removal, given the tenfold difference between current highest and lowest predictions. The low predicted values of some models are due to potential difficulties in realizing large-scale ecosystem restoration due to social, economic and governance constraints. Recently, some of these constraints have started to be alleviated via top-down mechanisms such as the EU Nature Restoration Law. Williams et al.29 provide a partial solution for economic and governance constraints via effective ongoing unassisted large-scale forest regeneration, requiring minimal intervention but potentially contributing >2.15 million km2 of forest gain within 30 years.

Relying on previous modelling approaches and via addressing the criticisms they received, we present results of a global ecosystem restoration model. In our approach (Fig. 1), we applied machine learning to predict the potential cover percentages of native ecosystem types to terrestrial locations using climatic, soil and topographic predictors (Extended Data Table 1). We then assessed the potential restorable area for each ecosystem. Using published carbon sequestration rates for each ecosystem type, we calculated expected global carbon gain until 2100. Our estimates may be more realistic than previous ones because we account for (1) all major terrestrial ecosystem types, (2) above- and belowground carbon storage, where relevant, (3) carbon sequestration rates (instead of total stocks, which often require > 70 years, that is the length of the 2030–2100 planning period, to develop), (4) the carbon sequestration rate of current ecosystem type (because the net carbon gain is the difference between current and post-restoration rates), (5) biogeographic differences, (6) socio-economic considerations that exclude built-up and intensive agricultural areas from restoration and (7) sustainable land-use practices in restoration targets (that is, certain high-nature-value farming landscapes, such as wood pastures, can also be predicted as targets), (8) future carbon emissions, (9) a schedule of restoration implementation and (10) current and future (2061–2080) climatic conditions to predict restoration targets. Using our model, we estimate how global ecosystem restoration can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation until 2100.

Detailed description of the steps marked with capital letters A to M can be found in Methods. Extended Data Figs. 6–8 provide further details of the model. Boxes in green are external sources of input data, orange boxes signify intermittent datasets and models and the blue box is the final output. Horizontal tan shading separates the main steps of modelling and prediction.

Using current climate, we predicted a total of 42.48 million km2 of forest, 14.14 million km2 of shrubland, 36.07 million km2 of grassland and 3.10 million km2 of wetland on Earth's land surface as potential natural ecosystems (Fig. 2a–d). The majority has been greatly altered by human actions30, but according to our model, 28.76 million km2 are available for ecosystem restoration. Of this, 11.66 million km2 (40.5% of the total area) is potential forest (Fig. 2e), slightly higher than the 9 million km2 predicted by Bastin et al.9, but lower than the 15.50 million km2 of Strassburg et al.10. We found large potential areas for forest restoration (including restoring the forested component of mosaic landscapes) across the northern temperate and boreal zones and across subtropical and tropical regions. Nearly 4.91 million km2 (17.1%) was suitable for shrubland worldwide as the target of ecosystem restoration (Fig. 2f), particularly in eastern Australia and southern-central United States, a figure similar to the Strassburg et al.10 prediction (4.11 million km2).

a–d, Potential distribution of modelled forest (a), shrubland (b), grassland (c) and wetland (d) ecosystems using current climates for predictions. e–h, The available area for forest (e), shrubland (f), grassland (g) and wetland (h) restoration. Colour coding indicates the percentage of each ecosystem type (predicted and restorable) within a 1 × 1 km grid. Thus, ecosystem combinations (for example, forest steppes and savannah-forest mosaics) are also allowed in our grid-level restoration planning, although the proportion of each constituting ecosystem type appears on different maps. For example, a savannah-forest mosaic landscape can contain forested, shrubby and grassy parts within a grid cell, and their proportional values are shown on each of the three corresponding maps. Available area is the potential area minus (1) intact areas not requiring restoration, (2) intensive agricultural areas, (3) built-up areas and (4) biomes with low productivity (polar and arid regions).

The total area for grassland restoration is 9.37 million km2 (32.6%), ~30% higher than Strassburg et al.'s10 7.17 million km2, implying overestimation of forest expansion at the expense of grassland. Potential grassland restoration in our model is concentrated in North America, Eurasia, Asian highlands and tropical mosaics (Fig. 2g). Large potential grassland restoration targets were predicted at the northern edge of boreal forests, potentially indicating misplaced tree plantations or other forms of degradation due to grassland overuse or a lagging of climate-change-driven expansion of grassland on currently sparsely vegetated areas.

Total area predicted for wetland restoration including all freshwater and saltwater herbaceous wetlands (excluding permanent water and wooded wetlands) was 2.83 million km2 (9.8%), concentrated in the American Midwest and Eastern Asia, where wetlands have been extensively drained for agriculture31,32. Potential wetland restoration was also identified in many floodplains and coastal habitats, such as the Euphrates River and Gulf of Bengal (Fig. 2h). Strassburg et al.10 calculated potential wetland restoration at 0.57 million km2, and they were explicit wetland restoration was probably underestimated. However, our model's predictive power was also comparatively low for wetlands.

Using a climate scenario projected for 2061–2080 (that is, the middle of our planning period) may potentially provide more relevant target ecosystems as in the future, sites may become available for restoration if a current native ecosystem type will no longer be a potential predicted ecosystem type. These state transitions may happen spontaneously (for example, tree encroachment in present-day tundra or grassland expansion due to excessive fires in dry tropical forests) but can also be actively assisted if the transition is for some reason favourable.

Predicted 2061–2080 potential forest extent is 35.9–37.4 million km2, depending on the climate scenario (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0 or SSP5–8.5), with forest expansion at high latitudes but widespread loss in tropical zones (Extended Data Figs. 1–4a). The latter is especially prevalent in the Amazon Basin, as forecast by other studies33,34,35. Taking such modelled state transitions into account includes both expansion and loss compared to the present, with a net outcome that is negative, indicating 2.3–3.4 million km2 forest loss globally (Extended Data Figs. 1–4e).

Compared to current predictions, future potential shrubland area doubles, mostly due to potential forest loss, and reaches 11.2–11.7 million km2 (Extended Data Figs. 1–4b) with a net available amount for restoration and state transitions of 0.7–1.1 million km2 (Extended Data Figs. 1–4f). Grasslands (and savannahs) expand their potential area, predicted to increase to 26.9–28.8 million km2, largely due to savannah expansion, montane grassland cover growth in Tibet and forest-steppe expansion over boreal forests (Extended Data Figs. 1–4c). However, dependent upon the combination of climate scenario, restoration opportunities and state transitions, there is a combined change from a loss of 0.6 million km2 to a gain of 1.1 million km2 (Extended Data Figs. 1–4g). Conversely, potential future wetland area, amounting to 3.7–5.2 million km2 (Extended Data Figs. 1–4d), is not only higher than current potential, but 2.6–3.8 million km2 will be available for restoration and state transitions (Extended Data Figs. 1–4h).

Overall, restoration of available land (all potential land minus areas with natural vegetation, built-up and intensive agricultural areas and arid and polar regions) using current climate predictions would lead to carbon capture of 1.92 Gt yr−1, summing to a total of 136.3 Gt between 2030 and 2100 (Fig. 3). However, reclaiming all this land by 2030 and initiating target ecosystem restoration are extremely unlikely. Using the momentum of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration combined with the targets of the EU's Nature Restoration Law, feasibility calculations36 and the potential of natural regeneration29, achieving 20% of the potential area is theoretically possible for restoration initiation by 2030. The remaining 80% could be implemented evenly across the 2031–2100 period (Fig. 4). This more realistic timeframe suggests sequestration of 85.2 Gt by 2100. Of this, 49.4 Gt (58.1%) is allocated to forests, which is substantially less than either Bastin et al.1 or Mo et al.28. Open ecosystems combined sum to 35.8 Gt (41.9%). Including the three main open ecosystems in global agendas can thus nearly double potential carbon sequestration, while also provide a control on misplaced tree planting and afforestation with undesired effects, such as warming due to reduced albedo22,23,37, increased wildfires15 and biodiversity declines.

A global maximum sequestration rate gain of 1.92 Gt yr−1 can be achieved using restoration, of which 67.4%, 9.2%, 12.3% and 11.4% come from restored forests, shrublands, grasslands and wetlands, respectively. Carbon gain includes both above- and belowground carbon capture (except in savannah grasslands where we considered only belowground rates due to frequent fires). Shown carbon gain rates are calculated as the difference between the rates of the predicted restoration targets minus the rates of the current ecosystem types in 1 × 1 km modelling sites. We used biome-specific rates for each of the four ecosystem types instead of global averages.

Priority regions are 100 × 100 km pixels, covering 20% of all restorable land area with the highest possible carbon gain. Priority regions do not necessarily require restoration in their entire area and certain amounts of the degraded areas may not be available for restoration. Restoration is not restricted to reforestation but is inclusive of any potential ecosystem type (that is, forest, shrubland, grassland, wetland or their mosaic) predicted to each region.

The above 85.2 Gt can be increased by prioritizing regions with the highest potential carbon benefit. For this, we laid a grid of 100 km × 100 km mesh size on the terrestrial surface of Earth and selected those cells as priority regions that cover 20% of the potentially restorable area with the highest possible carbon gain. Starting restoration until 2030 within these priority regions and then continuing randomly with the rest increases capture to 96.9 Gt carbon until 2100. These priority regions include temperate areas, such as American prairies and central Asian steppes (Fig. 4), and not only formerly prioritized tropical rainforest regions29. On reflection, we probably received this nuanced pattern over previous studies via our ecosystem-inclusive approach, the use of rates over final carbon stocks and that we did not ignore the carbon sequestration of the ecosystem type before restoration. As a result, there is a more even biogeographic distribution of priority regions, with greater opportunities for both high- and low-income countries to contribute to large-scale restoration, supporting climate justice, ameliorating an increasing pressure on historically low-emitting countries to meet ambitious restoration targets29,38,39. The inclusion of non-forested ecosystems offers the promise of more equitable global NCS efforts than, for example, simplistic tree-planting campaigns. Such campaigns driven by carbon credits may eventually have little climate change mitigation37,40,41 and rather have detrimental impacts on biodiversity21 and livelihoods of local people42,43,44, for example, by displacing people for afforestation, which in turn can lead to deforestation elsewhere. In addition, future agricultural expansion in low-income countries can cause conflicts with the realization of ecosystem restoration predicted on the scale of the present study. The total area allocated to agriculture is expected to be more stable in high-income countries45, making them also perhaps sustainable targets of restoration interventions.

Our estimate of 96.9 Gt carbon sequestration potential is substantially smaller than previous models9,10, as it equals to 47.3% and 31.8% of their respective predictions, and amounts to 17.6% of the 640 Gt of carbon emissions since 175011. We estimate our difference from previous studies is primarily due to the use of rates instead of final stocks of mature ecosystems, as most restored sites would not reach maturity by 2100 due to the gradual implementation of restoration over the twenty-first century and that certain ecosystem types (Extended Data Fig. 9) require >70 years to build up their carbon stock.

Our predicted amount thus forms an important but moderate contribution to reducing atmospheric CO2 closer to pre-industrial levels by 2100. A more realistic role of ecosystem restoration may thus be to keep pace with future emissions. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are widely applied scenarios for forecasting emissions that consider impacts of varied climate policies from a shift towards a sustainable green future (SSP1–2.6) to business as usual (SSP5–8.5)46,47. Combining the carbon benefit of global ecosystem restoration with emission trends of each SSP (SSP1–2.6: 169.6 Gt, SSP2–4.5: 642.4 Gt, SSP3–7.0: 1,319.4 Gt and SSP5–8.5: 1,989.0 Gt) suggests restoration has a limited mitigating effect without transformative global climate policies (Fig. 5). Anthropogenic contributions to the atmospheric carbon balance remain positive throughout the twenty-first century in SSP5–8.5 and SSP3–7.0 even with restoration site prioritization for carbon gain, and the proportion of total anthropogenic carbon burden can only be reduced by 3.7% (SSP5–8.5) or 5.0% (SSP3–7.0). Ecosystem restoration in SSP2–4.5 leads to zero annual emissions by 2100 (and a 7.6% reduction of the carbon burden), but this is insufficient to meet any reasonable climate target. SSP1–2.6 is the most difficult scenario to realize due to its dramatic global greening requirements of the industry, but its implementation with predicted restoration actions could reduce the atmospheric carbon burden by 12.0%. SSP1–2.6 entails zero and then negative emissions from the second half of the 2070s. Combined with global restoration, this threshold can be brought forward to the late 2060s. Prioritization of regions with the highest carbon gain affects this date only marginally. However, SSP1–2.6 also contains some NCS-based mitigation by afforestation46, so the actual improvement of this pathway might be overestimated by simply adding all restoration-related sequestration to it.

Solid line: no restoration, dashed line: restoration without prioritization, dotted line: restoration with site prioritization for carbon gain. Arrows point at the years when the global zero-emissions line is crossed, whereas the shaded area corresponds to negative emissions. In SSP1–2.6, we expect a pervasive shift towards sustainable green economies globally, whereas SSP2–4.5 is characterized by slower progress and little shift from the current socio-economic patterns. In contrast, SSP3–7.0 takes place if domestic and regional concerns about competitiveness and security hinder the global shift towards sustainability, and SSP5–8.5 will take place if we keep on relying on competitive markets and rapid technological progress to maintain a resource- and energy-intensive lifestyle all over the world45. Decimal numbers in the pathway names indicate expected radiative forcing values (expressed in W m−2) in 2100.

Source data

Considering restoration possibilities and predicted ecosystem state transitions using climate projections, our model provides alarming results, as we predict a continuous loss of ecosystem-locked carbon, particularly in tropical forest regions, although carbon gains are also expected at higher latitudes. Depending on the scenario, the rate of annual carbon emission is predicted to range from 0.11 to 0.64 Gt, in SSP1–26 and SSP5–8.5, respectively, with the other scenarios located between them. However, it is important to acknowledge the resilience of natural, functional ecosystems against state transitions48, which thus may take place with some delay after underlying drivers exceeded their original rate of variability. Our findings highlight the importance of measures supporting ecosystem resilience (for example, promoting tree recruitment in forests threatened by climate change49) to delay state transitions48 and concomitant carbon emissions. If this is sustained until all mitigation measures (including improved habitat management and industrial solutions) restore atmospheric CO2 levels in a more distant future, unfavourable state transitions may be prevented. Furthermore, future climate scenarios probably contain novel climates that our model is inherently not trained for, reducing its reliability50.

In sum, we demonstrated that terrestrial ecosystem restoration can play a role in climate change mitigation in the near future, if applied in conjunction with a prompt shift towards energy-efficient, renewable-based economies of SSP1–2.6 and if ecosystem state transitions are suppressed where possible and desirable. In other scenarios, the most appropriate aims of ecosystem restoration as an NCS will be around local to regional-scale climate change adaptation due to uncertainties related to global-scale mitigation. Optimizing restoration site selection for adaptation instead of mitigation would probably yield lower carbon capture, but the importance of ecosystem restoration in climate change adaptation cannot be overestimated for the livelihoods of local communities, especially those that are nature-reliant51,52. Intact ecosystems dampen the effects of heatwaves by optimal evapotranspiration rates53, prevent soil erosion after increased precipitation events due to well-developed root systems54 and increase the resilience of pollinator populations55, which are threatened by climate change56,57. Due to the limited likelihood of any notable mitigation of climate change through global ecosystem restoration in the short or medium term, future policies should (1) prioritize adaptation and optimize restoration activities in favour of vulnerable peoples, (2) streamline mitigation plans by rigorous mechanisms to cut emissions instead of investing in offsetting with uncertain results20,43 and (3) support the original goal of ecosystem restoration to combat the biodiversity crisis58 and thereby increase the resilience of ecosystem services, rather than solely carbon sequestration.

Ecosystem restoration can have a large variety of goals and natural target vegetation states. For modelling purposes, we narrowed these down to four broad ecosystem types: forest, shrubland, grassland and wetland. These are also listed among the major land-cover categories of Earth in the Copernicus Global Land Service–Land Cover raster and available as fractional scores in pixels of 1-ha resolution (version 2019)59 (A in Fig. 1). Other land-cover categories in the database correspond to either non-target ecosystem types for classical restoration (cropland and built-up areas; but see Elmqvist et al.60 and Klaus and Kiehl61 for urban restoration initiatives) or natural ecosystem types with little vegetation and therefore minor carbon sequestration rates (bare/sparse vegetation, snow and ice and moss and lichen).

To construct a predictive model for the potential global cover distribution of the four selected ecosystem types, we followed modelling principles in Bastin et al.9 For learning sites (that is, pixels with known fractional cover scores of target ecosystems and environmental predictors), we used their 78.850 pixels (100 m × 100 m) supplemented with 20.000 more pixels with non-zero fractional cover percentages for each ecosystem type (80.000 additional pixels in total) in protected areas worldwide (except Antarctica) (B in Fig. 1). These latter pixels were selected by first assigning every pixel in protected areas that contained at least one of the target ecosystem types to a pool of each ecosystem type (pixels could be allocated to more than one pool if they contained more than one target ecosystem type), then we randomly selected (without repetition) 20.000 pixels from each pool, leading to 158.850 pixels in total (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Fractional cover scores were kept for subsequent model construction, so pool assignment did not mean that a pixel was fully attributed to an ecosystem type. The four pools were needed to enable similar representations of each ecosystem type in the final set of learning sites. We used the World Database on Protected Areas62 for the delineation of protected areas. We included all listed protected areas (for example, EU Natura 2000 areas) and did not restrict pixel selection to strict nature reserves, as that procedure would exclude sustainable coexistence of humans with nature, such as extensive grassland management or silvopastoral systems, which can also lead to high biodiversity and co-benefits for climate change mitigation/adaptation and are often practical targets of restoration efforts63. Thus, our approach includes components of land sharing and land sparing.

We allocated ten environmental predictors, including five climatic (WorldClim database64; 1 km × 1 km resolution), three edaphic (SoilGrids250m65; 250 m × 250 m) and two topographic (GMTED201066; 250 m × 250 m) variables (Extended Data Fig. 9) to every learning site (Supplementary Table 1) (C in Fig. 1). These environmental variables proved to be reliable predictors in Bastin et al.9. The differences in the spatial resolution of the variables were handled with the bilinear resampling technique of ESRI ArcMap 10.8. The bilinear resampling technique involves attributing the average value of the four nearest pixels within a 2 × 2 window to the relevant output pixel. This process follows a bilinear mathematical function along both the horizontal and vertical axes and is the commonly applied method for smoothly transitioning continuous datasets lacking clear boundaries67.

We used Random Forest machine learning regression models with fivefold cross-validations68 for training 500 trees of (potentially) unlimited depth (D in Fig. 1). The number of variables to possibly split at each node was set to three (that is, the default value for ten predictors). The models were evaluated by regressing observed values by predicted values (both of which were fractional)69. Spatial distribution of the model uncertainty was assessed by the standard deviation of the predictions made by the five trained sub-models originated from the fivefold cross-validation. According to the regression-based evaluation, the models of forest, shrubland and grassland had high predictive power (0.70 < R2 < 0.82), although at high (above 60%) observed shrubland cover scores, the predictions tended to yield underestimations. This was due to the low prevalence of such pixels in the datasets (approximately 0.1%), but because they are rare, uncertainties in their range do not affect the overall predicted amount of shrubland (Extended Data Fig. 7). The model for wetlands was fair (R2 = 0.32), with uncertainties also caused by the rarity of high empirical cover scores. Models' uncertainty, estimated using standard deviations, was evenly distributed across continents and biogeographic regions (Extended Data Fig. 8).

We predicted the potential forest, shrubland, grassland and wetland cover distributions as the ensemble mean of the five trained sub-models (according to the fivefold cross-validation) of each of the four ecosystem models to a global grid of 1 × 1 km cells (henceforth ‘modelling sites') (E in Fig. 1). We also made predictions for a future period to take into account the effect of changing climate on the potential cover of ecosystem types, by updating the climatic predictors but leaving the non-climatic predictors unchanged. We chose the period 2061–2080 because it is in the middle of our study period (between 2030 and 2100). From among the global climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)70 having predictions in the WorldClim database64, we selected EC-Earth3-Veg model71, which has a medium (that is, 4.33) effective climate sensitivity value72 and its predecessor (that is, EC-Earth) has been successfully used for carbon sequestration prediction73. Among the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), we considered SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0 and SSP5–8.5.

The differences in the spatial resolution of the variables were handled with the bilinear resampling technique of ESRI ArcMap 10.8. Due to the independent construction of the four ecosystem models, the predicted total cover could exceed 100%. In such cases, we proportionately reduced the cover of each ecosystem type to sum up to 100% (for example, a prediction of 60% forest and 60% grassland was reduced to 50% each).

Once having the potential distribution of target ecosystems (in percentage fractions for every modelling site), we compared them to the present cover of the target ecosystems using the Copernicus Global Land Service–Land Cover raster (version 2019)59. We used the difference to identify degraded areas globally (F in Fig. 1).

However, built-up areas are rarely available for restoration purposes, so we removed them (their fractional cover from the modelling sites) from subsequent calculations. Likewise, restoration activities cannot be implemented in all agricultural areas due to their role in food security. Therefore, we identified intensive agricultural areas using the Land Use Systems of the World 1.1. database74 and removed all corresponding modelling sites (G in Fig. 1). Fractional removal was not possible due to the data structure of the database. We considered the following categories as intensive agriculture: rain-fed crops, crops with moderate or higher livestock density, crops with high livestock density and large-scale irrigation agriculture.

It was common that a currently natural ecosystem type in a particular location is not the potential type in the future predictions, indicating that state transitions are expected worldwide in the near future. These can take place spontaneously but can also be assisted by landscape and conservation management (for example, to prevent catastrophic, pyric transitions from forests to savannahs by allowing a smooth transition with management). We did not lump them with restoration but handled them separately as ‘state transitions', with additional (often negative) effects on carbon sequestration rates.

We finally had five potential cover values (one based on current and four based on future climates) for every target ecosystem type in all modelling sites, covering the terrestrial surface of Earth that is available for restoration (or prone to state transitions). Our model did not identify specific mosaic ecosystems (for example, savannah-forest mosaics) but handled them adequately, because the ecosystem-type cover values were proportional, meaning that such a modelling site, for instance, contained certain proportions of forest, shrubland and grassland alike. These constituting ecosystem types were then used separately in subsequent carbon gain calculations.

As the next step, we assigned carbon sequestration rates (t ha−1 yr−1) to the modelling sites. Carbon sequestration rates of a target ecosystem type can vary greatly among biomes (for example, tropical rainforest vs boreal forest). To account for this heterogeneity, we first removed all modelling sites located in polar or arid biomes using the ‘Resolve EcoRegions2017' database75 (H in Fig. 1), because these climates allow very low primary productivity and therefore low carbon sequestration rates. Then, we combined the four target ecosystem types with the remaining biomes listed in the database, resulting in 12 biome-specific ecosystem types: boreal forest, temperate forest, tropical/subtropical dry forest, tropical/subtropical moist forest, mangrove forest/shrubland, boreal/temperate shrubland (including heathland), tropical/subtropical shrubland, boreal/temperate grassland, tropical/subtropical grassland, boreal wetland (predominantly peatland), temperate wetland (including salt marshes) and tropical/subtropical wetland (I in Fig. 1). For boreal, temperate, tropical/subtropical dry forest and tropical/subtropical moist forests, we adopted the sequestration rates from Cook-Patton et al.76, who compiled and summarized over ten thousand records from regenerating forests. They provided ecoregion-specific rates, which we averaged across our broader biome-specific forest ecosystem types. For open ecosystems, we heavily relied on the database of the European Environmental Agency77. For biome-specific ecosystem types that were not included in any of these databases or had a poor coverage in the European Environmental Agency's database, we searched for published literature records that considered total ecosystem carbon sequestration rates, including both above- and belowground biomass and soil organic carbon, except in tropical/subtropical grasslands, where frequent fires (and herbivory) preclude the formation of a stable aboveground carbon sink. So in their case, we used only records from belowground compartments (Extended Data Fig. 9 and J in Fig. 1).

Once having the carbon sequestration rates of the 12 biome-specific ecosystem types, we calculated the carbon sequestration rate of each modelling site after the implementation of restoration or the combination of restoration and state transitions in future-climate-based predictions (K in Fig. 1). To get the carbon gain potential of modelling sites, we calculated their current, pre-restoration sequestration rate (L in Fig. 1) and subtracted this from the post-restoration rate (plus state transition, where applicable) (M in Fig. 1). We assumed 0 t C ha−1 sequestration to non-target ecosystem types (for example, bare soil surface and snow and ice). In a few rare cases we predicted negative carbon gain based on current climates, which can happen if, for example, current forest cover is locally higher for some reason than predicted by our model. We ignored these rare cases but negative rates owing to state transitions in future-climate-based predictions were retained. We used carbon gain values based on current climates to estimate the impact of ecosystem restoration on carbon emissions projected by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, SSP5–8.5) between 2030 and 2100 (SSP Public Database 2.046).

Besides the global sequestration potential until 2100, we also identified priority regions for restoration where the highest carbon gain can be achieved first. Selecting the modelling sites with the top carbon gain values is a possible option, but they may be scattered across the world and due to their relatively small size are not especially suitable for planning global restoration strategies. Therefore, we used a coarser global grid of 100 × 100 km cells (22.880 cells in total). We ranked these large grid cells according to their total potential carbon gain as the summed values from the included modelling sites and set the cut-off at that rank above which the cells contained 20% of all restorable land area, that is, the 80th percentile. This way, we identified regions where the highest carbon sequestration can be achieved until 2030, which was set as a milestone year to restore the first 20% of the available land. This selection method yielded 2,669 priority regions (corresponding to 11.7% of all grid cells). We performed prioritization using only the present-climate-based predictions, because of the very low overall carbon gains predicted when future climates were considered.

Data preparation and model construction were done in ESRI ArcMap 10.8 and R 4.2.0 statistical software, respectively. We used the R packages ‘groupdata2', ‘ranger', ‘raster' and ‘sf' for model construction and predictions.

Using carbon sequestration rates instead of the carbon stocks of mature stands is a major improvement of our model compared to previous ones, but we used linear functions, although deviations from this can happen during stand maturation in some ecosystem types78. The lack of global data across different biomes precluded us from taking into account these nonlinearities. Our input dataset structure allowed us to consider restoration actions that entailed a change in vegetation or ecosystem type through the restoration, although this is not a prerequisite for ecosystem restoration and for carbon gain (for example, restoration of intensively managed grasslands to natural grasslands or tree plantations to forests, although these actions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from improved management). However, using proportional ecosystem type cover values alleviated this deficiency in mosaic ecosystems if the degradation manifested in changes in the proportions of constituting ecosystem types; so, for example, our model included the restoration of degraded savannah-forest mosaics to pristine ones with the original ecosystem-type cover proportions. Furthermore, future changes of some input data and other relevant trends (for example, changes in the area of intensive agriculture, biome boundary shifts and the effects of elevating CO2 and changing climate in general on assimilation, decomposition, fire frequency) were not taken into account due to high uncertainties, but this also gives room for future research. Lastly, the 1-km2 model resolution does not mean that the output maps are directly usable for local-scale restoration planning because the predictors are often extrapolated values that are not sensitive enough to fine-scale environmental heterogeneity (topography, soil and so on), which cannot be ignored in small-scale planning.

Color coding indicates the percentage of each ecosystem type (predicted and available) within a 1 × 1 km grid. Thus, ecosystem combinations (for example forest steppes and savanna-forest mosaics) are also allowed in our grid-level restoration planning, although the proportion of each constituting ecosystem type appears on different maps. For example, a savanna-forest mosaic landscape can contain forested, shrubby and grassy parts within a grid cell, and their proportional values are shown on each of the three corresponding maps. We excluded potential restoration activities in intensive agricultural and built-up areas and in biomes with low productivity (polar and arid regions).

Calculations were made on all land available for restoration or subject to ecosystem state transitions, predicted using climates projected for 2061–2080 in scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5. Carbon gain or loss includes both above- and below-ground carbon capture (except in savanna grasslands where we considered only belowground rates due to frequent fires). Shown carbon gain rates are calculated as the difference between the rates of the predicted restoration targets minus the rates of the current ecosystem types in 1 × 1 km modeling sites. We used biome-specific rates for each of the four ecosystem types instead of global averages.

Located within protected areas, we assumed that they contain each ecosystem type in proportions that match restoration targets.

Percentage scores in the right side of the subplots indicate the amount of pixels in the respective ranges. Boxes show the interquartile range (IQR) of the data. Thick lines in the boxes are the median values. Whiskers extend towards the minimum or maximum values but are no longer than 1.5 times the IQR. Data beyond the whiskers are shown as individual points.

Uncertainty was assessed using the standard deviation of the predictions calculated from the five sub-models originated from the 5-fold cross-validation. Uncertainty was rather low and uniform globally for all four models.

Build-up time is the time in year required to reach the stock considering the listed rates and assuming linear trend.

Three days after the Trump administration published its much-anticipated AI action plan, the Chinese government put out its own AI policy blueprint. Was the timing a coincidence? I doubt it.

China's “Global AI Governance Action Plan” was released on July 26, the first day of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC), the largest annual AI event in China. Geoffrey Hinton and Eric Schmidt were among the many Western tech industry figures who attended the festivities in Shanghai. Our WIRED colleague Will Knight was also on the scene.

The vibe at WAIC was the polar opposite of Trump's America-first, regulation-light vision for AI, Will tells me. In his opening speech, Chinese Premier Li Qiang made a sobering case for the importance of global cooperation on AI. He was followed by a series of prominent Chinese AI researchers, who gave technical talks highlighting urgent questions the Trump administration appears to be largely brushing off.

Zhou Bowen, leader of the Shanghai AI Lab, one of China's top AI research institutions, touted his team's work on AI safety at WAIC. He also suggested the government could play a role in monitoring commercial AI models for vulnerabilities.

In an interview with WIRED, Yi Zeng, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and one of the country's leading voices on AI, said that he hopes AI safety organizations from around the world find ways to collaborate. “It would be best if the UK, US, China, Singapore, and other institutes come together,” he said.

The conference also included closed-door meetings about AI safety policy issues. Speaking after he attended one such confab, Paul Triolo, a partner at the advisory firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told WIRED that the discussions had been productive, despite the noticeable absence of American leadership. With the US out of the picture, “a coalition of major AI safety players, co-led by China, Singapore, the UK, and the EU, will now drive efforts to construct guardrails around frontier AI model development,” Triolo told WIRED. He added that it wasn't just the US government that was missing: Of all the major US AI labs, only Elon Musk's xAI sent employees to attend the WAIC forum.

Many Western visitors were surprised to learn how much of the conversation about AI in China revolves around safety regulations. “You could literally attend AI safety events nonstop in the last seven days. And that was not the case with some of the other global AI summits,” Brian Tse, founder of the Beijing-based AI safety research institute Concordia AI, told me. Earlier this week, Concordia AI hosted a day-long safety forum in Shanghai with famous AI researchers like Stuart Russel and Yoshua Bengio.

Comparing China's AI blueprint with Trump's action plan, it appears the two countries have switched positions. When Chinese companies first began developing advanced AI models, many observers thought they would be held back by censorship requirements imposed by the government. Now, US leaders say they want to ensure homegrown AI models “pursue objective truth,” an endeavor that, as my colleague Steven Levy wrote in last week's Backchannel newsletter, is “a blatant exercise in top-down ideological bias.” China's AI action plan, meanwhile, reads like a globalist manifesto: It recommends that the United Nations help lead international AI efforts and suggests governments have an important role to play in regulating the technology.

Although their governments are very different, when it comes to AI safety, people in China and the US are worried about many of the same things: model hallucinations, discrimination, existential risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, etc. Because the US and China are developing frontier AI models “trained on the same architecture and using the same methods of scaling laws, the types of societal impact and the risks they pose are very, very similar,” says Tse. That also means academic research on AI safety is converging in the two countries, including in areas like scalable oversight (how humans can monitor AI models with other AI models) and the development of interoperable safety testing standards.

But Chinese and American leaders have demonstrated they have very different attitudes toward these issues. On one hand, the Trump administration recently tried and failed to put a 10-year moratorium on passing new state-level AI regulations. On the other hand, Chinese officials, including even Xi Jinping himself, are increasingly speaking out about the importance of putting guardrails on AI. Beijing has also been busy drafting domestic standards and rules for the technology, some of which are already in effect.

As Trump goes rogue with unorthodox and inconsistent policies, the Chinese government increasingly looks like the adult in the room. With its new AI action plan, Beijing is trying to seize the moment and send the world a message: If you want leadership on this world-changing innovation, look here.

I don't know how effective China's charm offensive will be in the end, but the global retreat of the US does feel like a once-in-a-century opportunity for Beijing to spread its influence, especially at a moment when every country is looking for role models to help them make sense of AI risks and the best ways to manage them.

But there's one thing I'm not sure about: How eager will China's domestic AI industry be to embrace this heightened focus on safety? While the Chinese government and academic circles have significantly ramped up their AI safety efforts, industry has so far seemed less enthusiastic—just like in the West.

Chinese AI labs disclose less information about their AI safety efforts than their Western counterparts do, according to a recent report published by Concordia AI. Of the 13 frontier AI developers in China the report analyzed, only three produced details about safety assessments in their research publications.

Will told me that several tech entrepreneurs he spoke to at WAIC said they were worried about AI risks such as hallucination, model bias, and criminal misuse. But when it came to AGI, many seemed optimistic that the technology will have positive impacts on their life, and they were less concerned about things like job loss or existential risks. Privately, Will says, some entrepreneurs admitted that addressing existential risks isn't as important to them as figuring out how to scale, make money, and beat the competition.

But the clear signal from the Chinese government is that companies should be encouraged to tackle AI safety risks, and I wouldn't be surprised if many startups in the country change their tune. Triolo, of DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, said he expected Chinese frontier research labs to begin publishing more cutting-edge safety work.

Some WAIC attendees see China's focus on open source AI as a key part of the picture. “As Chinese AI companies increasingly open-source powerful AIs, their American counterparts are pressured to do the same,” Bo Peng, a researcher who created the open source large language model RWKV, told WIRED.

Peng envisions a future where different nations—including ones that do not always agree—work together on AI. “A competitive landscape of multiple powerful open-source AIs is in the best interest of AI safety and humanity's future,” he explained. “Because different AIs naturally embody different values and will keep each other in check.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Measles Cases Are Soaring in Mexico","https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-soaring-in-mexico/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:58:24 GMT","

The spread of measles is showing no signs of slowing down in Mexico. Between July 21 and 25, the country's number of confirmed infections in 2025 rose from 3,553 to 3,730, an increase of 197 in only four days, according to the Ministry of Health. Experts and health officials in Mexico have warned that the virus's speed of transmission appears to be increasing.

So far, the outbreak has claimed the lives of 12 people: 11 in the state of Chihuahua—which borders Texas to the north, the epicenter of the US's measles outbreak—with one more death in the neighboring state of Sonora to the west. Mexican health authorities have called on all health care providers to reinforce surveillance and prevention measures to contain the spread of the virus.

Children between zero and four years of age continue to be the population most affected, with 838 infections—an incidence of 8.05 cases per 100,000 children. People aged between 25 and 29 also account for a large number of infections—512 cases—while there have been 419 cases among those between 30 and 34 years old.

The latest bulletin issued by Mexico's National Epidemiological Surveillance System, SINAVE, points out that infections have been concentrated in Chihuahua. The border state has reported 3,490 cases, which represents 93 percent of the total for the country. So far, a total of 7,086 probable cases have been counted, in 82 municipalities across 20 states of the country.

In view of the seriousness of the outbreak, the government of Chihuahua has activated what it is calling the “Juarez Shield Strategy.” The initiative includes a massive free vaccination campaign for those between six months and 49 years of age. Over the last week, state health authorities have vaccinated around 42,000 people against measles.

The Ministry of Health has also launched its “Rapid Response Plan for the Interruption of the Measles Outbreak,” a multi-part initiative that aims, among other things, to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and laboratory diagnosis to speed up the identification and containment of cases. The plan also proposes establishing controls in clinics and out in the community to break the chain of transmission, which includes isolating probable and confirmed cases in health care settings.

Measles is one of the world's most contagious viral diseases. It spreads through contact with infected bodily fluids or by airborne transmission. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus can remain active in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours. An infected person can infect up to nine out of 10 unvaccinated close contacts, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.

Anyone unvaccinated can contract the disease, although it is most common in children. Initial symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash that spreads over the body. The incubation period is 10 to 14 days, and the illness lasts between four and seven days.

Complications of measles affect a small minority of patients, but they can be deadly, and are the main cause of mortality following an infection. They can include blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, dehydration, ear infections, and pneumonia. Complications are especially dangerous for children under five, adults over 30, and patients with malnutrition or weakened immune systems. In addition, according to the WHO, the virus weakens the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to other infections.

There is no specific treatment for measles, so mass vaccination is the best prevention strategy. But following successful elimination strategies in many parts of the world, including the US, the virus has resurfaced in some of these places in recent years due to declining vaccination rates. In 2023, the WHO recorded 10.3 million cases globally, representing a year-on-year increase of 20 percent. Until recently, most infections were concentrated in Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific. However, the disease has begun to gain ground in the Americas, with outbreaks raising alarm bells in the United States, Canada, and Argentina.

This ain't no orchestra and I'm not a conductor, but today we'll be navigating the experience of the Crescendo 2. First, you may be wondering, “Ariana, what are you doing here?” My specialty lies in WIRED's sleep-related content as a professional mattress tester and certified sleep science coach, not as a sex toy reviewer. But, here's the thing: Sex and sleep are far more intertwined than we may think or give them credit for. Whereas sleep is one way to relax and unwind, so is sex. As bodily functions, they are both necessary and integral for the healthy functioning of many of our systems.

And the fact of the matter is that many women out there aren't fully enjoying the experience, nor the benefits that come from having an orgasm. For those looking to take matters into their own hands, the ob-gyn-designed Crescendo 2 is one of the more customizable vibrators on the market.

In a crowded vibrator market, the Crescendo 2 stands out specifically for its levels of customizability. The vagina is beautifully complex, with increasing research pointing to it having well over 10,000 nerve endings. Not to mention the fact that every body type is different. However, the Crescendo 2 can cover the clitoris, labia, vagina, and perineum in one fell swoop.

This vibrator is, in a word, girthy. The main shaft is 8.7 inches long, 1.7 inches wide, and 1.8 inches tall. Two clitoral stimulators sit at the top like fins. The end point design is meant to mimic two-finger insertion, and the shaft can be bent into a number of shapes—specifically, the letters I, C, U, L, O, or S. This way, you can customize it to not just what you need and like, but your physical form.

Along with the Crescendo 2's flexibility, there are six motors along the length of the device. These aren't meant to be in excess, turbocharging your sensory experience—you're not a race car (though, hilariously, there is a “Mad Max” vibrational setting). Rather, each one creates a touchpoint of stimuli specifically around highly sensitive zones—MysteryVibe says this is clinically proven to help address issues like pelvic pain and dryness.

That's just one aspect of the design that makes the Crescendo 2 stand out. The real magic, in my opinion, is the app feature that allows you to adjust each of the six motors individually. While the buttons on the side can help you adjust intensity or switch up vibrational patterns, it's not necessarily intuitive to reach for that in the heat of the moment. To really enjoy the full extent of what the device has to offer, download the MysteryVibe app ahead of time and Bluetooth-sync it to your device. Upon unboxing, plug it into a USB port for an hour with the attached charger—once fully charged, you've got two hours of usage.

With the app, you can make one motor more or less intense depending on what you prefer. In addition to this individualistic motor approach, the app also has a vibration pattern library where you can download preset patterns. You can fine-tune your search by searching for patterns that offer things that are more your speed, from slow pulsations to sensations just around the edges of the device.

What's really impressive is that you also have the option to customize your own, bringing a whole new aspect of individualistic and customizable experience to the table. The synchronicity of the app and device lets you figure out what feels right for you as you mix and match the motors to create your “vibe.” This is a cheeky way of saying that you can adjust each motor's pulse intensity and frequency. From there, the Crescendo 2 can store 12 vibrational patterns at a time, with 16 intensities. And yes, the preset patterns have clever names.

Another bonus is the Crescendo 2's button locking feature. This is particularly helpful if and when you're rendered low-key mindless during the throes of passion and accidentally hit a button. The button lock ensures you're on your way to catapulting toward the finish line instead of losing focus from the change of pace. I've met many women where reaching orgasm is a mental hurdle, and something like an accidental vibe check would throw them off. This is one less tangible thing you would have to deal with.

MysteryVibe says the Crescendo 2 is “infinite toys in one” due to its ability to be bent into various shapes. Since it is shaped somewhat like two fingers, it's meant to mimic various hand shapes one may employ during sex. While it's malleable enough to bend the internal joints upward and downward, the vibrator isn't meant to be twisted. Because of this, of the letters I mentioned previously, some of them weren't necessarily the easiest to accomplish—namely, the “U.” During my hands-on testing I found that this particular shape wouldn't stay in place for me, yet it was the most fun one. Ugh! That could very well be because of my anatomy, but it does challenge MysteryVibe's claim of the Crescendo 2's toy configurations being “infinite.”

The clitoral stimulation pieces at the top also didn't do much for me, which goes back to the overall length of this thing. I have to wonder, if it were a slightly smaller size, would I get the full package of benefits this vibrator offers? But given this is supposed to be a “one size fits all” approach, I can understand why MysteryVibe designed the Crescendo 2 the way they did.

""Different strokes for different folks"" is very on the nose when not only discussing the customization the design offers you, but the pulse settings as well. You can really get creative and experiment with what you like, which makes it that much more exciting for partnered use—speaking from personal testing, of course. Mix things up on a whim, and never let your partner know your next move. They may like what kind of vibes you have up your sleeve; I sure did. I cannot confirm nor deny the custom vibe patterns we came up with are offshoots of Mad Max sayings, but it's another sort of bonding activity to create that sort of inside joke. So many puns, so little time!

Another claim that popped out at me was that, according to MysteryVibe, the Crescendo 2 is many users' first-ever vibrator. I can say confidently that if this happens to be you, you are starting off very strong. In fact, you may be ruining all other vibrators for yourself going forward, because this one sets the bar so high.

A new game in the Katamari series, Once Upon a Katamari, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 October 24. The game was announced today during a Nintendo Direct, along with release dates, reveals, and updates for several others. Today's Direct was focused on third-party developers, with many games releasing ahead of the holiday season, as Nintendo steadily builds its offerings on the new console.

Much like previous games in the series, players in Once Upon a Katamari steadily roll up everything they can find, from chairs to people, to create an evergrowing ball of junk. This time around the King of All Cosmos has accidentally destroyed Earth, and players will travel through different historical eras to restore both the planet and the stars. The game includes online battles with up to four players, as well as character customization, and will also launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam.

Also on the way: two games from Square Enix reminiscent of Super Nintendo-era RPGs, Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales. Octopath Traveler 0, launching for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, is a prequel to the acclaimed series launching December 4. The game lets players to make their own customized protagonist and recruit more than 30 party members. The Adventures of Elliot is a new game from Square Enix, though it won't be available until next year. The game takes place in Philabieldia—no, not Philadephia—where Elliot and his fairy travel embark on a time-traveling journey.

Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection launches on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.

Nintendo will also bring several ports to the Switch 2, including Star Wars Outlaws (September 4), Final Fantasy Tactics—The Ivalice Chronicles (September 30), and Persona 3 Reload (October 23).

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, which acts as a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, is expected to launch this winter. A new Monster Hunter game, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, will also come to the Switch 2 next year. More games are expected to launch this fall for the console.

There are a lot of advantages to building a startup in Seattle. 

That's the word from founders we interviewed Wednesday evening at a startup showcase event hosted as part of Seattle Tech Week. 

We asked what they like about being a startup founder in Seattle. Here's what they had to say:

Seattle's elite technical talent and cultural humility were themes in our story this week on the state of Seattle's startup ecosystem in the AI era. 

But our reporting also showed that there is concern about the region's risk-averse culture, the lack of local capital, and government policy.

Generally, though, the vibe is optimistic. 

“I am very, very, very bullish on Seattle, particularly in the AI space,” said Pioneer Square Labs Managing Director Greg Gottesman, speaking at another Seattle Tech Week event on Tuesday.

Microsoft's market value touched $4 trillion for the first time, becoming only the second U.S. company to cross the milestone, as investors reacted positively to stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and growing momentum in AI and cloud computing.

Shares rose more than 4% in early trading Thursday, with Microsoft's valuation hovering just above or below the $4 trillion mark moment by moment. The company's shares are up more than 28% over the past year.

Analysts' comments were so effusive that they read like movie-poster blurbs.

The $4 trillion milestone cements Microsoft's position as the world's second-most valuable company, behind Nvidia, which has seen the AI boom push its market cap above $4.4 trillion.

Azure revenue topped $75 billion for the year, up 34% annually from the prior year, driven by demand for AI services and “growth across all workloads,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's earnings release.

Microsoft plans to invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures in the current quarter — a new high — as it expands cloud and AI capacity to keep pace with rivals Amazon and Google.

At the same time, Microsoft's global headcount held steady at 228,000 over the past year. That reflected an initial round of layoffs in May, prior to larger cutbacks in July, even as the company continues to hire in some areas.

“Bottom line, Microsoft is exhibiting very strong cost control,” wrote UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, citing its efforts to keep its operating margins strong by managing its headcount even as it spends billions on AI infrastructure. 

UBS analysts drew a connection between Microsoft's rising capital spending and Azure's accelerating growth. They noted that while the company attributed the gains largely to core, non-AI demand such as enterprise migrations, the two-quarter jump in Azure growth — from 31% to 39% — was “so material that we can't help but wonder if Azure is getting an incremental boost from Microsoft standing up materially more GPU infrastructure.”

Microsoft is no longer disclosing the percentage-point contribution of AI to its cloud growth, saying that the distinction between AI and other cloud workloads is increasingly difficult to define.

Uber Eats announced on Wednesday that it will now allow restaurants and merchants to chat with customers to help prevent issues with orders. The app is also introducing new AI tools for merchants, and is inviting users to submit photos of their orders if the item doesn't yet have a menu image.

With the new “Live order chat” feature, merchants can message customers in real time to do things like confirm replacements for sold-out items, clarify special requests, and check on dietary or allergy preferences.

Uber states that users can't initiate chats with merchants, as customers can only message merchants if they have contacted them first. Live order chat is available for both delivery and pickup orders, and ends once the food has been handed off to a courier or customer for pickup. 

The launch of the new feature comes three months after Uber Eats rival DoorDash announced the ability for merchants to chat directly with customers to resolve order issues.

As for the new AI tools for merchants, Uber Eats is launching AI-powered summaries of customer reviews to make it easier to understand feedback at scale. Plus, Uber Eats is rolling out AI-generated item descriptions for menus to help users make informed decisions when deciding what to order. 

The app will also use AI to enhance low-quality food images by improving lighting, resolution, framing, and plating. For example, if there's a photo of food in a takeout container, Uber Eats might use AI to generate an image of the same dish on a plate.

In addition, Uber Eats will now encourage users to snap a photo of their delivery. The company says it's doing this because it's aware that customers are more likely to order a dish when they are able to see what it looks like. If a customer's photo is chosen and published, they can get $3 in Uber Cash if they live in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, or the U.K. 

To submit a photo, users need to tap the “Add Photos” button on the rate order screen after their order is delivered.

Privacy-focused productivity tool company Proton released a new authenticator app today, allowing users to log in to services using dynamically generated two-factor authentication codes.

The company said that just like its other products, Proton Authenticator is open source and uses end-to-end encryption to protect user data.

Users can easily import login codes from other authentication apps, the company said. Plus, the app automatically backs up codes and also works without any internet connection.

“Two-factor authentication is essential for everyone – not just those who care about their privacy. Proton Authenticator is built for anyone who wants a secure, transparent, and convenient way to protect their accounts,” Eamonn Maguire, head of Account Security at Proton, said in a statement.

“We believe strong security should never come at the cost of your convenience or privacy. That's why we've developed Proton Authenticator: to give users peace of mind that their 2FA codes are available wherever they need them, without relying on Google or Microsoft. We're putting users firmly in control not only over their data, but the way they access their online accounts,” he added.

Two-factor authentication using an app provides users with an extra layer of security to prevent attackers from taking over accounts. While SMS-based two-factor authentication is another option, it is often vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks, in which attackers can intercept your calls and messages.

Proton is on a product-releasing spree. Earlier this week, the company launched a privacy-focused AI chatbot named Lumo, which doesn't keep any conversation records or use user data to train models.

As TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain, the company is merging its Core Product and Trust & Safety teams into a single organization, according to an internal memo sent to staff by TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and viewed by TechCrunch and confirmed by TikTok.

“This new team will allow us to better leverage our technical capabilities across both business and safety objectives, and will help us move faster as we develop the next generation of safety technology,” Chew wrote in the memo. 

As part of the changes, the memo said that TikTok's head of Operations and Trust & Safety, Adam Presser, will become the general manager of TikTok USDS, a separate entity of TikTok that's tasked with safeguarding U.S. national security interests, TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch.

Andy Bonillo, the current general manager of TikTok USDS, who led the organization's creation and growth, will transition to a new role as senior adviser, reporting to Presser.

The TikTok Operations teams will continue to report directly to Presser, while Sandeep Grover will become the new head of Global Trust & Safety.

Meanwhile, Jenny Zi will become the leader for TikTok Live.

The reorganization comes as President Trump extended the TikTok shutdown deadline for a third time last month. The current deadline is September 17.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that TikTok will go dark in the country if China doesn't approve a deal for the sale of the app. Lutnick also stated that the U.S. must control the app's algorithm as part of the sale. 

Given the tense situation, which comes in the middle of a tariff war with China, it would not be surprising to see TikTok trying to beef up its USDS team as its U.S. deal hangs in the balance. 

“For increased alignment across our robust trust and safety programs, the T&S Product team will now become part of the TikTok Product organization,” Chew wrote. “We are creating a new Platform Responsibility team, which will be led by Adam Wang, reporting to Fiona Zhi. Adam has successfully led the launch and expansion of TikTok LIVE globally over the past four years.”

“I am confident that this reorganization will put us in an even stronger position to match the opportunities ahead of us,” the memo said.

GitHub Copilot, an AI coding tool offered by Microsoft-owned GitHub, has now reached more than 20 million users, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's earnings call Wednesday. A GitHub spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that this number represents “all-time users.”

That means 5 million people have tried out GitHub Copilot for the first time in the last three months — the company reported in April the tool had reached 15 million users. Microsoft and GitHub don't report how many of these 20 million people have continued to use the AI coding tool on a monthly or daily basis — though those metrics are likely far lower.

Microsoft also reported that GitHub Copilot, which is among the most popular AI coding tools offered today, is used by 90% of the Fortune 100. The product's growth among enterprise customers has also grown about 75% compared to last quarter, according to the company.

AI coding tools are rising in popularity, and they seem to be one of the few AI products generating notable revenue. In 2024, Nadella said GitHub Copilot was a larger business than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018. In the year since, it seems GitHub Copilot's growth rate has continued in a positive direction.

The world's most popular AI coding tools still have tiny user bases compared to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, which attract hundreds of millions of users every month. Of course, software engineering is more niche than the general informational queries offered by AI chatbots. 

That said, software engineers and their employers seem to be willing to pay a premium for AI coding tools. And with Microsoft's long list of enterprise customers and GitHub's ecosystem of developers, GitHub Copilot is well positioned to dominate the market for enterprise AI coding tools.

Cursor, another popular AI coding tool, wants to challenge GitHub Copilot in the enterprise, and it's been scooping up talent from fledgling AI startups to do so. Cursor reportedly had more than a million people using its product every day in March, according to Bloomberg. At that time, the company generated about $200 million in annualized recurring revenue. Today, Cursor's ARR is more than $500 million, suggesting there are now a lot more people using its products every day.

While GitHub Copilot and Cursor initially sought to tackle different parts of the developer experience, they're steadily converging into similar products. 

Both companies have recently introduced AI agents to review code and catch bugs introduced by humans. GitHub and Cursor are also trying to create AI agents that automate programmer workflows, allowing developers to offload tasks altogether. Nadella said during Wednesday's earnings call that GitHub was seeing great momentum with their AI coding agents.

Beyond Cursor, GitHub has an array of well-capitalized competitors that would like to sell AI coding tools to the enterprise. 

There's Google — which acquired the leaders of AI coding startup Windsurf — as well as Cognition, the maker of Devin that subsequently acquired the rest of Windsurf's team. And there's OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both building out their own AI coding offerings powered by in-house AI models, Codex and Claude Code, respectively, in an attempt to win the market.

The nascent space is quickly heating up into one of AI's most competitive markets.

1. It is leaderless by design. So there is no single lead broker you need to route the traffic. So you can eliminate majority of the inter-zone traffic.2. It is lakehouse-native by design. It is not only just use object storage as the storage layer, but also use open table formats for storing data. So streaming data can be made available in open table formats (Iceberg or Delta) after ingestion. One example is the integration with S3 Tables: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/seamless-streaming-to-a... This would simplify the Kafka-to-Iceberg integration.

Anyone who's used SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools knows the issues of high false positives while missing entire classes of vulnerabilities like AuthN/Z bypasses or privilege escalations. This limitation is a result of their core architecture. By design, SAST tools parse code into a simplistic model like an AST or call graph, which quickly loses context in dynamically typed languages or across microservice boundaries, and limits coverage to only resolving basic call chains. When detecting vulnerabilities they rely on pattern matching with Regex or YAML rules, which can be effective for basic technical classes like (XSS, SQLi) but inadequate for logic flaws that don't conform to well-known shapes and need long sequences of dependent operations to reach an exploitable state.My co-founder and I saw these limitations throughout our careers in national intelligence and military cyber forces, where we built automated tooling to defend critical infrastructure. We realised that LLMs, with the right architecture, could finally solve them.Vulnerabilities are contextual. What's exploitable depends entirely on each application's security model. We realized accurate detection requires understanding what's supposed to be protected and why breaking it matters. This meant embedding threat modeling directly into our analysis, not treating it as an afterthought.To achieve this, we first had to solve the code parsing problem. Our solution was to build a custom, compiler-accurate indexer inspired by GitHub's stack graphs approach to precisely navigate code, like an IDE. We build on the LSIF approach (https://lsif.dev/) but replace the verbose JSON with a compact protobuf schema to serialise symbol definitions and references in a binary format. We use language‑specific tools to parse and type‑check code, emitting a sequence of Protobuf messages that record a symbol's position, definition, and reference information. By using Protobuf's efficiency and strong typing, we can produce smaller indexes, but also preserve the compiler‑accurate semantic information required for detecting complex call chains.This is why most ""SAST + LLM"" tools that use AST parsing fail - they feed LLMs incomplete or incorrect code information from traditional parsers, making it difficult to accurately reason about security issues with missing context.With our indexer providing accurate code structure, we use an LLM to perform threat modeling by analyzing developer intent, data and trust boundaries, and exposed endpoints to generate potential attack scenarios. This is where LLMs' tendency to hallucinate becomes a breakthrough feature.For each potential attack path generated, we perform a systematic search, querying the indexer to gather all necessary context and reconstruct the full call chain from source to sink. To validate the vulnerability we use a Monte Carlo Tree Self-refine (MCTSr) algorithm and a 'win function' to determine the likelihood that a hypothesized attack could work. Once a finding is above a set practicality threshold it is confirmed as a true positive.Using this approach, we discovered vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-51479 in ONYX (an OSS enterprise search platform) where Curators could modify any group instead of just their assigned ones. The user-group API had a user parameter that should check permissions but never used it. Gecko inferred developers intended to restrict Curator access because both the UI and similar API functions properly validated this permission. This established ""curators have limited scope"" as a security invariant that this specific API violated. Traditional SAST can't detect this. Any rule to flag unused user parameters would drown you in false positives since many functions legitimately keep unused parameters. And more importantly, detecting this requires knowing which functions handle authorization, understanding ONYX's Curator permission model, and recognizing the validation pattern across multiple files - contextual reasoning that SAST simply cannot do.We have several enterprise customers using Gecko because it solves problems they couldn't address with traditional SAST tools. They're seeing 50% fewer false positives on the same codebases and finding vulnerabilities that previously only showed up in manual pentests.Digging into false positives, no static analysis tool will ever achieve perfect accuracy, AI or otherwise. We reduce them at two key points. First, our indexer eliminates any programmatic parsing errors that create incorrect call chains that traditional AST tools are susceptible to. Second, we avoid unwanted LLM hallucinations and reasoning errors by asking specific, contextual questions rather than open-ended ones. The LLM knows which security invariants need to hold and can make deterministic assessments based on the context. When we do flag something, manual review is quick because we provide complete source-to-sink dataflow analysis with proof-of-concept code and output findings based on confidence scores.We'd love to get any feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I'll be in the comments to respond!

This is where LLMs' tendency to hallucinate becomes a breakthrough feature.For each potential attack path generated, we perform a systematic search, querying the indexer to gather all necessary context and reconstruct the full call chain from source to sink. To validate the vulnerability we use a Monte Carlo Tree Self-refine (MCTSr) algorithm and a 'win function' to determine the likelihood that a hypothesized attack could work. Once a finding is above a set practicality threshold it is confirmed as a true positive.Using this approach, we discovered vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-51479 in ONYX (an OSS enterprise search platform) where Curators could modify any group instead of just their assigned ones. The user-group API had a user parameter that should check permissions but never used it. Gecko inferred developers intended to restrict Curator access because both the UI and similar API functions properly validated this permission. This established ""curators have limited scope"" as a security invariant that this specific API violated. Traditional SAST can't detect this. Any rule to flag unused user parameters would drown you in false positives since many functions legitimately keep unused parameters. And more importantly, detecting this requires knowing which functions handle authorization, understanding ONYX's Curator permission model, and recognizing the validation pattern across multiple files - contextual reasoning that SAST simply cannot do.We have several enterprise customers using Gecko because it solves problems they couldn't address with traditional SAST tools. They're seeing 50% fewer false positives on the same codebases and finding vulnerabilities that previously only showed up in manual pentests.Digging into false positives, no static analysis tool will ever achieve perfect accuracy, AI or otherwise. We reduce them at two key points. First, our indexer eliminates any programmatic parsing errors that create incorrect call chains that traditional AST tools are susceptible to. Second, we avoid unwanted LLM hallucinations and reasoning errors by asking specific, contextual questions rather than open-ended ones. The LLM knows which security invariants need to hold and can make deterministic assessments based on the context. When we do flag something, manual review is quick because we provide complete source-to-sink dataflow analysis with proof-of-concept code and output findings based on confidence scores.We'd love to get any feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I'll be in the comments to respond!

I just started a scan on an open source project I was looking at, but I would love to see you add Elixir to the list of supported languages so that I can use this for my team's codebase!

Was this an incorrect code path or an incorrect understanding of a security issue?This is why we focus heavily on threat modelling and defining the security and business invariants that must hold. From a code level, the only context we can infer is through developer intent and data flow analysis.Something we are working on is custom rules and allowing a user to add context when starting a scan to  improve alignment and reduces false positives.

It also asks for permission to ""act on my behalf"" which I can understand would be necessary for agent-y stuff but it's not something I'm willing to hand over for a mere vuln scan.

An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm's roster. Even his bungled ouster ended with him back on top—and more famous than ever. But look past the charismatic frontman and you get a clearer sense of where this company is going. After all, Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests. 

That responsibility falls to OpenAI's twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.

I sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation during a recent trip the pair made to London, where OpenAI set up its first international office in 2023. We talked about how they manage the inherent tension between research and product. We also talked about why they think coding and math are the keys to more capable all-purpose models; what they really mean when they talk about AGI; and what happened to OpenAI's superalignment team, set up by the firm's cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to prevent a hypothetical superintelligence from going rogue, which disbanded soon after he quit. 

In particular, I wanted to get a sense of where their heads are at in the run-up to OpenAI's biggest product release in months: GPT-5.

Reports are out that the firm's next-generation model will be launched in August. OpenAI's official line—well, Altman's—is that it will release GPT-5 “soon.” Anticipation is high. The leaps OpenAI made with GPT-3 and then GPT-4 raised the bar of what was thought possible with this technology. And yet delays to the launch of GPT-5 have fueled rumors that OpenAI has struggled to build a model that meets its own—not to mention everyone else's—expectations.

But expectation management is part of the job for a company that for the last several years has set the agenda for the industry. And Chen and Pachocki set the agenda inside OpenAI.

The firm's main London office is in St James's Park, a few hundred meters east of Buckingham Palace. But I met Chen and Pachocki in a conference room in a coworking space near King's Cross, which OpenAI keeps as a kind of pied-à-terre in the heart of London's tech neighborhood (Google DeepMind and Meta are just around the corner). OpenAI's head of research communications, Laurance Fauconnet, sat with an open laptop at the end of the table. 

Chen, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt, is clean-cut, almost preppy. He's media trained and comfortable talking to a reporter. (That's him flirting with a chatbot in the “Introducing GPT-4o” video.) Pachocki, in a black elephant-logo tee, has more of a TV-movie hacker look. He stares at his hands a lot when he speaks.

But the pair are a tighter double act than they first appear. Pachocki summed up their roles. Chen shapes and manages the research teams, he said. “I am responsible for setting the research roadmap and establishing our long-term technical vision.”

Study Mode helps students walk through topics rather than just giving them answers. But there's a glaring problem.

“But there's fluidity in the roles,” Chen said. “We're both researchers, we pull on technical threads. Whatever we see that we can pull on and fix, that's what we do.”

Chen joined the company in 2018 after working as a quantitative trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street Capital, where he developed machine-learning models for futures trading. At OpenAI he spearheaded the creation of DALL-E, the firm's breakthrough generative image model. He then worked on adding image recognition to GPT‑4 and led the development of Codex, the generative coding model that powers GitHub Copilot.

Pachocki left an academic career in theoretical computer science to join OpenAI in 2017 and replaced Sutskever as chief scientist in 2024. He is the key architect of OpenAI's so-called reasoning models—especially o1 and o3—which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, math, and coding. 

When we met they were buzzing, fresh off the high of two new back-to-back wins for their company's technology.

On July 16, one of OpenAI's large language models came in second in the AtCoder World Tour Finals, one of the world's most hardcore programming competitions. On July 19, OpenAI announced that one of its models had achieved gold-medal-level results on the 2025 International Math Olympiad, one of the world's most prestigious math contests.

The math result made headlines, not only because of OpenAI's remarkable achievement, but because rival Google DeepMind revealed two days later that one of its models had achieved the same score in the same competition. Google DeepMind had played by the competition's rules and waited for its results to be checked by the organizers before making an announcement; OpenAI had in effect marked its own answers.

For Chen and Pachocki, the result speaks for itself. Anyway, it's the programming win they're most excited about. “I think that's quite underrated,” Chen told me. A gold medal result in the International Math Olympiad puts you somewhere in the top 20 to 50 competitors, he said. But in the AtCoder contest OpenAI's model placed in the top two: “To break into a really different tier of human performance—that's unprecedented.”

People at OpenAI still like to say they work at a research lab. But the company is very different from the one it was before the release of ChatGPT three years ago. The firm is now in a race with the biggest and richest technology companies in the world and valued at $300 billion. Envelope-pushing research and eye-catching demos no longer cut it. It needs to ship products and get them into people's hands—and boy, it does. 

OpenAI has kept up a run of new releases—putting out major updates to its GPT-4 series, launching a string of generative image and video models, and introducing the ability to talk to ChatGPT with your voice. Six months ago it kicked off a new wave of so-called reasoning models with its o1 release, soon followed by o3. And last week it released its browser-using agent Operator to the public. It now claims that more than 400 million people use its products every week and submit 2.5 billion prompts a day. 

OpenAI's incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, plans to keep up the momentum. In a memo to the company, she told employees she is looking forward to “helping get OpenAI's technologies into the hands of more people around the world,” where they will “unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.” Expect the products to keep coming.

I asked how OpenAI juggles open-ended research and product development. “This is something we have been thinking about for a very long time, long before ChatGPT,” Pachocki said. “If we are actually serious about trying to build artificial general intelligence, clearly there will be so much that you can do with this technology along the way, so many tangents you can go down that will be big products.” In other words, keep shaking the tree and harvest what you can.

A talking point that comes up with OpenAI folks is that putting experimental models out into the world was a necessary part of research. The goal was to make people aware of how good this technology had become. “We want to educate people about what's coming so that we can participate in what will be a very hard societal conversation,” Altman told me back in 2022. The makers of this strange new technology were also curious what it might be for: OpenAI was keen to get it into people's hands to see what they would do with it.

Is that still the case? They answered at the same time. “Yeah!” Chen said. “To some extent,” Pachocki said. Chen laughed: “No, go ahead.” 

“I wouldn't say research iterates on product,” said Pachocki. “But now that models are at the edge of the capabilities that can be measured by classical benchmarks and a lot of the long-standing challenges that we've been thinking about are starting to fall, we're at the point where it really is about what the models can do in the real world.”

Like taking on humans in coding competitions. The person who beat OpenAI's model at this year's AtCoder contest, held in Japan, was a programmer named Przemysław Dębiak, also known as Psyho. The contest was a puzzle-solving marathon in which competitors had 10 hours to find the most efficient way to solve a complex coding problem. After his win, Psyho posted on X: “I'm completely exhausted ... I'm barely alive.”  

Chen and Pachocki have strong ties to the world of competitive coding. Both have competed in international coding contests in the past and Chen coaches the USA Computing Olympiad team. I asked whether that personal enthusiasm for competitive coding colors their sense of how big a deal it is for a model to perform well at such a challenge.

 

In a Roundtables event for MIT Technology Review subscribers, the author of Empire of AI explains how everyone has a stake in AI's development.

They both laughed. “Definitely,” said Pachocki. “So: Psyho is kind of a legend. He's been the number one competitor for many years. He's also actually a friend of mine—we used to compete together in these contests.” Dębiak also used to work with Pachocki at OpenAI.

When Pachocki competed in coding contests he favored those that focused on shorter problems with concrete solutions. But Dębiak liked longer, open-ended problems without an obvious correct answer.

“He used to poke fun at me, saying that the kind of contest I was into will be automated long before the ones he liked,” Pachocki recalled. “So I was seriously invested in the performance of this model in this latest competition.”

Pachocki told me he was glued to the late-night livestream from Tokyo, watching his model come in second: “Psyho resists for now.” 

“We've tracked the performance of LLMs on coding contests for a while,” said Chen. “We've watched them become better than me, better than Jakub. It feels something like Lee Sedol playing Go.”

Lee is the master Go player who lost a series of matches to DeepMind's game-playing model AlphaGo in 2016. The results stunned the international Go community and led Lee to give up professional play. Last year he told the New York Times: “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing ... I could no longer enjoy the game.” And yet, unlike Lee, Chen and Pachocki are thrilled to be surpassed.   

But why should the rest of us care about these niche wins? It's clear that this technology—designed to mimic and, ultimately, stand in for human intelligence—is being built by people whose idea of peak intelligence is acing a math contest or holding your own against a legendary coder. Is it a problem that this view of intelligence is skewed toward the mathematical, analytical end of the scale?

“I mean, I think you are right that—you know, selfishly, we do want to create models which accelerate ourselves,” Chen told me. “We see that as a very fast factor to progress.”  

The argument researchers like Chen and Pachocki make is that math and coding are the bedrock for a far more general form of intelligence, one that can solve a wide range of problems in ways we might not have thought of ourselves. “We're talking about programming and math here,” said Pachocki. “But it's really about creativity, coming up with novel ideas, connecting ideas from different places.”

Look at the two recent competitions: “In both cases, there were problems which required very hard, out-of-the-box thinking. Psyho spent half the programming competition thinking and then came up with a solution that was really novel and quite different from anything that our model looked at.”

“This is really what we're after,” Pachocki continued. “How do we get models to discover this sort of novel insight? To actually advance our knowledge? I think they are already capable of that in some limited ways. But I think this technology has the potential to really accelerate scientific progress.” 

I returned to the question about whether the focus on math and programming was a problem, conceding that maybe it's fine if what we're building are tools to help us do science. We don't necessarily want large language models to replace politicians and have people skills, I suggested.

Chen pulled a face and looked up at the ceiling: “Why not?”

OpenAI was founded with a level of hubris that stood out even by Silicon Valley standards, boasting about its goal of building AGI back when talk of AGI still sounded kooky. OpenAI remains as gung-ho about AGI as ever, and it has done more than most to make AGI a mainstream multibillion-dollar concern. It's not there yet, though. I asked Chen and Pachocki what they think is missing.

“I think the way to envision the future is to really, deeply study the technology that we see today,” Pachocki said. “From the beginning, OpenAI has looked at deep learning as this very mysterious and clearly very powerful technology with a lot of potential. We've been trying to understand its bottlenecks. What can it do? What can it not do?”  

At the current cutting edge, Chen said, are reasoning models, which break down problems into smaller, more manageable steps, but even they have limits: “You know, you have these models which know a lot of things but can't chain that knowledge together. Why is that? Why can't it do that in a way that humans can?”

OpenAI is throwing everything at answering that question.

“We are probably still, like, at the very beginning of this reasoning paradigm,” Pachocki told me. “Really, we are thinking about how to get these models to learn and explore over the long term and actually deliver very new ideas.”

Chen pushed the point home: “I really don't consider reasoning done. We've definitely not solved it. You have to read so much text to get a kind of approximation of what humans know.”

OpenAI won't say what data it uses to train its models or give details about their size and shape—only that it is working hard to make all stages of the development process more efficient.

Those efforts make them confident that so-called scaling laws—which suggest that models will continue to get better the more compute you throw at them—show no sign of breaking down.

“I don't think there's evidence that scaling laws are dead in any sense,” Chen insisted. “There have always been bottlenecks, right? Sometimes they're to do with the way models are built. Sometimes they're to do with data. But fundamentally it's just about finding the research that breaks you through the current bottleneck.” 

The faith in progress is unshakeable. I brought up something Pachocki had said about AGI in an interview with Nature in May: “When I joined OpenAI in 2017, I was still among the biggest skeptics at the company.” He looked doubtful. 

“I'm not sure I was skeptical about the concept,” he said. “But I think I was—” He paused, looking at his hands on the table in front of him. “When I joined OpenAI, I expected the timelines to be longer to get to the point that we are now.”

The announcement confirms one of two rumors that circled the internet this week. The other was about superintelligence. 

“There's a lot of consequences of AI,” he said. “But the one I think the most about is automated research. When we look at human history, a lot of it is about technological progress, about humans building new technologies. The point when computers can develop new technologies themselves seems like a very important, um, inflection point.

“We already see these models assist scientists. But when they are able to work on longer horizons—when they're able to establish research programs for themselves—the world will feel meaningfully different.”

For Chen, that ability for models to work by themselves for longer is key. “I mean, I do think everyone has their own definitions of AGI,” he said. “But this concept of autonomous time—just the amount of time that the model can spend making productive progress on a difficult problem without hitting a dead end—that's one of the big things that we're after.”

It's a bold vision—and far beyond the capabilities of today's models. But I was nevertheless struck by how Chen and Pachocki made AGI sound almost mundane. Compare this with how Sutskever responded when I spoke to him 18 months ago. “It's going to be monumental, earth-shattering,” he told me. “There will be a before and an after.” Faced with the immensity of what he was building, Sutskever switched the focus of his career from designing better and better models to figuring out how to control a technology that he believed would soon be smarter than himself.

Two years ago Sutskever set up what he called a superalignment team that he would co-lead with another OpenAI safety researcher, Jan Leike. The claim was that this team would funnel a full fifth of OpenAI's resources into figuring out how to control a hypothetical superintelligence. Today, most of the people on the superalignment team, including Sutskever and Leike, have left the company and the team no longer exists.   

When Leike quit, he said it was because the team had not been given the support he felt it deserved. He posted this on X: “Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity. But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Other departing researchers shared similar statements.

I asked Chen and Pachocki what they make of such concerns. “A lot of these things are highly personal decisions,” Chen said. “You know, a researcher can kind of, you know—”

He started again. “They might have a belief that the field is going to evolve in a certain way and that their research is going to pan out and is going to bear fruit. And, you know, maybe the company doesn't reshape in the way that you want it to. It's a very dynamic field.”

“A lot of these things are personal decisions,” he repeated. “Sometimes the field is just evolving in a way that is less consistent with the way that you're doing research.”

But alignment, both of them insist, is now part of the core business rather than the concern of one specific team. According to Pachocki, these models don't work at all unless they work as you expect them to. There's also little desire to focus on aligning a hypothetical superintelligence with your objectives when doing so with existing models is already enough of a challenge.

“Two years ago the risks that we were imagining were mostly theoretical risks,” Pachocki said. “The world today looks very different, and I think a lot of alignment problems are now very practically motivated.”

Still, experimental technology is being spun into mass-market products faster than ever before. Does that really never lead to disagreements between the two of them?

It's not really a disagreement, but there is a natural tension between these different objectives and the different challenges that the company is facing that materializes between us.”

Roughly 124 miles (200 kilometers) beneath the Appalachian Mountains in New England lies the aptly named Northern Appalachian Anomaly (NAA), a mysterious 218-mile-wide (350-km) region of unusually hot rock.

Researchers have long believed that the NAA resulted from the plate tectonic movement that broke North America off northwest Africa 180 million years ago. In a new study published Tuesday in the journal Geology, however, a team of international researchers argue that the hot, subsurface rocks are related to when North America and Greenland split near the Labrador Sea between 90 and 80 million years ago.

The NAA “lies beneath part of the continent that's been tectonically quiet for 180 million years, so the idea it was just a leftover from when the landmass broke apart never quite stacked up,” Tom Gernon, lead author of the study and an Earth scientist at the University of Southampton, said in a university statement.

To reach this conclusion, the team used advanced computer simulations, seismic tomography data (like an ultrasound, but for Earth's interior), and tectonic plate reconstructions. According to the study, the NAA may have developed around 1,119 miles (1,800 km) from its current position and, at the rate of around 12 miles (20 km) per million years, slowly moved southwestward to where it sits now.

“Our research suggests it's part of a much larger, slow-moving process deep underground that could potentially help explain why mountain ranges like the Appalachians are still standing,” Gernon added.

The slow-moving process is the team's previously proposed “mantle wave” theory, which hypothesizes that hot, dense chunks of material detach from the base of tectonic plates after continents separate, like blobs in a lava lamp.

“Heat at the base of a continent can weaken and remove part of its dense root, making the continent lighter and more buoyant, like a hot air balloon rising after dropping its ballast,” Gernon explained. “This would have caused the ancient mountains to be further uplifted over the past few million years.”

As the blobs slowly “drip” from the lithosphere—the layer including Earth's crust and upper part of the mantle—hotter mantle rocks rise to fill up the space, which creates a thermal anomaly. The same team's earlier work also revealed that these blobs can move over time.

“The feature we see beneath New England is very likely one of these drips, which originated far from where it now sits,” said Sascha Brune, study co-author and head of the Geodynamic Modelling Section at GFZ, Germany's national research center for Earth sciences. According to the team, the center of the NAA will likely move under New York in the next 15 million years.

“The idea that rifting of continents can cause drips and cells of circulating hot rock at depth that spread thousands of kilometres inland makes us rethink what we know about the edges of continents both today and in Earth's deep past,” admitted Derek Keir, another co-author of the study and a tectonics expert at the University of Southampton and the University of Florence.

The researchers argue that their mantle wave theory could explain a similar anomalous hot zone under north-central Greenland—basically a reflection of the NAA on the other side of the Labrador Sea.

The study is ultimately a reminder to never judge a book by its cover—or the Earth by its surface-level tectonic activity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Amazon Throws Money at ‘Netflix of AI'","https://gizmodo.com/amazon-throws-money-at-netflix-of-ai-2000636838","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 11:59:49 GMT","

Amazon poured more than $1 billion into its streaming series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, only for it to get a pretty tepid reception. So Amazon appears to be going for a new approach to streaming content: If you think you can do better, prove it. According to a report from Business Insider, the company is funding an AI streaming platform called Showrunner that, in theory, will let people create their own shows using generative AI tools.

Showrunner is the creation of Fable Studio, a virtual reality-turned AI-powered media company that blew up in 2023 after it released an AI version of South Park (which it happened to drop smack dab in the middle of the ongoing writers' strike that sought to secure protections against the encroachment of AI on the livelihood of creatives). A limited version of the service launched last year, dubbed the “Netflix of AI,” with some AI-generated content that viewers could iterate on to create custom episodes and storylines.

Now, with Amazon's backing, it seems Showrunner is going wide. Per Variety, it is expanding beyond its closed alpha test of 10,000 users and launching widely this Thursday. The service will be free to use at first, but will eventually allow users to buy credits to create their own content using the platform's built-in content and generative AI tools. Those credits will cost between $10 and $40 per month, according to a pitch deck obtained by Business Insider. Viewing the content will be first, and users can share the content via YouTube and other third-party platforms.

Gizmodo reached out to Amazon for comment on its reported funding of Showrunner, as well as any potential content partnerships the company may enter into with Fable Studio. Amazon has not responded at the time of publication.

For now, it seems that Fable will be limited primarily to the company's own content, which is apparently AI-generated to begin with (and frankly not that well received by audiences who have been subjected to it). But the company certainly has its eyes set on bigger brands. According to Variety, Fable is in talks with Disney and other Hollywood studios about potentially licensing IP for Showrunner, which would allow users to use that material to create their own versions of familiar movies and shows.

Showrunner has some interesting ideas, which is ironic since creating your own version of an existing property is pretty uninteresting and glorified fan fiction. For instance, if a person creates a show on Showrunner that another person remixes, 40% of the revenue of the remix goes to the original creator, according to Business Insider. But, again, the fact that this is AI-generated content at the outset means there is likely a pretty low ceiling on the level of quality those shows will achieve.

Fable Studio founder Edward Saatchi, to his credit, seems fully aware that this might suck. “Maybe nobody wants this and it won't work,” he told Variety. Probably! But hey, if you can burn someone else's money to find out for sure, who can really blame you?

If you're the type to store a lot of stuff without constantly worrying about running out of space, chances are you already know Seagate as a great brand for high-quality external hard drives.

With back to school season about to start now just weeks away, Seagate has released an incredible deal on their massive 22TB external hard drive: It's now $249, a fraction of its original price of $599. This is one of the top-selling hard drives with more than 261,000 reviews and an average rating of 4.6 stars on Amazon. Millions of customers rely on Seagate, and at that price point, this deal is really hot.

See at Amazon

The very first thing to notice is the colossal 22 terabytes of storage. To put it in context, that is enough space to hold thousands of high-definition photos, hours of 4K video, or vast collections of music and games all in one place. This drive uses USB 3.0 technology so it's easily plugged into most desktops and laptops and copies files quickly compared to previous USB technology.

The Seagate drive is also made to be incredibly simple to use: You just plug it into a USB port, and it's ready to go. It's a simple, plug-and-play solution that anyone can use. That convenience makes backing up your data or expanding your storage capacity hassle-free. If you're working with multiple devices or need to jam-pack your files without upgrading your computer's internal storage, this drive is a solid choice.

One feature that stands out is the inclusion of Rescue Data Recovery Services along with the hard drive. Things do go awry, and sometimes even the best storage drives fail. Rescue services offer some level of guarantee because, in the event of any data loss in the case of hardware failure, Seagate comes to your rescue to restore your precious files.

On top of the functional qualities, this portable hard drive is also rugged: It is built in a casing that is solid enough to use every day, protecting your files from everyday knocks and bumps. It is also of a useable size and shape and easy enough to stash away when not being used without taking up much room.

Overall, paying $249 for 22TB of space is a hard value to top in today's market (way more than a random cloud storage solution).

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) recently introduced legislation that he claims is designed to allow Americans to “benefit” from Trump's tariff scheme. Now, he's giving everyone good reason to believe that his ploy to send rebate checks at a time of rising inflation is just a political stunt.

The administration's tariffs are unprecedented in modern economic history and are currently generating revenue for the U.S. government by taxing U.S. businesses on their imports. Critics have noted that the administration is just asking many companies to pass along the higher cost of doing business to consumers. No matter what Trump says, there's just no avoiding the fact that tariffs will drive up the cost of electronics, including video games, laptops, graphics cards, cars, smartphones, and practically every other imported good.

To allow everyday people to “benefit” from this bizarre system, Hawley has proposed sending a $600 rebate to Americans, in a fashion somewhat similar to the Covid-era stimulus checks that came with the CARES Act. Hawley previously said that his legislation “would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump's tariffs are returning to this country.” However, it would appear that he was only talking about hard-working Americans who agree with Donald Trump.

In an interview with Trump acolyte Steve Bannon, Hawley claimed that his legislation was only designed to send money to people of a particular economic and political persuasion. “Well, you wouldn't give it to everybody, you'd give it to the working people,” the Senator told Bannon on Tuesday. “You'd give it to our people.” Who counts as “our people”? From Hawley's comments, it doesn't exactly sound like a representative sample of the country.

“I mean, you know, the rich people don't need it … what I mean by that is all those Democrat donors of Wall Street, all these hedge fund guys, who all hate the tariffs, by the way,” Hawley said. “My view is, we ought to give a portion [of] that back to our working-class blue-collar voters who powered the Trump revolution, who got this president into office multiple times, and who are the backbone of this nation.”

During his conversation with Bannon, Hawley provided other vague details about his supposed plan. “It'd be $600 for every adult and child, so if you've got a big family, you're gonna get more,” he claimed. “And you'd phase it out for income, you know? So again, the wealthy—you start making six figures, you get into the big six figures—you'd phase the thing out.” He continued: “So this is not going to the hedge fund managers or all the Biden voters. This is not going to the Wall Street kingpins. So they don't need any of it.”

It's worth noting that some 81 million people voted for Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Nearly 75 million voted for Kamala Harris last year. The number of people who make six-figures in this country is significantly smaller, but still represents a significant chunk of the population pie. In other words, it sounds like the target demographic for Hawley's rebate program is actually quite small, and would mostly be: MAGA. Surprise, surprise.

Of course, it seems more than likely that the rebates won't ever materialize, which means that nobody is going to be getting any money and Hawley is just engaging in a bit of theater to seem like he's doing something to alleviate the harms of rising prices. If that's the case, it's just one more example of the MAGA brand of faux-populism—a largely rhetorical program in which economic elites lambaste their own class while sucking up to the poor. Meanwhile, Washington continues with business as usual, the rich get richer, and we're all just a little bit more confused by what our leaders are doing.

As if wasps couldn't get any scarier, a chilling discovery near Aiken, South Carolina, suggests they're comfortable making their nest in a former nuclear bomb facility. 

On July 3, employees conducting a regular checkup of radiation levels at the Savannah River Site (SRS)—a former nuclear weapons production facility dating back to the 1950s—found themselves staring down at something that probably should not have been there. That something was a wasp nest measuring more than 10 times the federally permitted radiation limit. 

Nearly three weeks after this bizarre discovery, Department of Energy (DOE) officials published a report on the incident, in which they assured local residents that no new leaks had been found in the waste tanks. Rather, the nest likely became radioactive from leftover contamination dating back to when the site was fully operational. As per procedure, the workers sprayed the nest with insecticide and bagged it—along with the dead bees—as radioactive waste, according to the report. 

“The delay in reporting was to allow time for reviewing previous wildlife contamination for consistency in reporting criteria,” officials said. “No further action was required in the field. There is no impact from [the] event on other activities and operations.”

The SRS was built in the early 1950s to produce tritium and plutonium-239 for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Close to the turn of the century, the U.S. government transitioned the plant from a weapons manufacturer to a producer of fuel for nuclear plants, in addition to cleaning up decommissioned structures.

Overall, DOE and its contractor Savannah River Mission Completion (SRMC), which manages the site, concluded that the incident, while understandably unsettling, shouldn't be of significant concern to the public.

“Upon discovery of the contaminated nest, the immediate area was secured and surveyed; no contamination was found in the area,” SRMC told the Aiken Standard. “There were no impacts to workers, the environment, or the public.”

The company also said that further surveys of the nest revealed there weren't any wasps left on the nest, adding that even if there were, the individual insects “would have significantly lower levels of contamination.”

Watchdogs of the site aren't so impressed by the official explanations. Savannah River Site Watch criticized the report for being incomplete, failing to address where the contamination came from, how the wasps encountered the radiation, and, most importantly, whether a yet-uncovered leak could have left another radioactive wasp nest in the vicinity. 

“I'm as mad as a hornet that SRS didn't explain where the radioactive waste came from or if there is some kind of leak from the waste tanks that the public should be aware of,” Tom Clements, executive director of Savannah River Watch, told CBS News. 

Identifying the type of wasp nest could have revealed the source of the contamination, Clements said, since some wasps build nests from dirt while others use materials that can point to specific locations. It's unclear, however, whether this apparent lack of effort reflects ignorance or negligence on the part of the officials.

Star Wars is one of the most popular licenses that LEGO has (alongside Harry Potter) and whenever there's a discount on one of their Star Wars sets, fans flock to get their hands on it. That's what's going on right now with the Star Wars R2-D2 set, which is now available at a new all-time low price of $79 on Amazon, having been $100. This is as good as it gets on Black Friday and Prime Day, so this is an excellent opportunity. Loaded with an excellent 4.9-star rating on Amazon, this set is a best-seller.

See at Amazon

This LEGO set recreates the adorable R2-D2 droid with 1,050 pieces in a model that stands over 9 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches deep. The model perfectly blends playful details with a faithful look that will please Star Wars fans. The head rotates a full 360 degree, so you can spin Artoo around like he's scanning the surroundings. A third leg that is removable opens, allowing him movement in “driving” or “walking” positions, just like in the movies.

The front panels open to reveal extendable tools, highlighting R2-D2's classic skill at spaceship repair and system hacking. A secret compartment is included within to store Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, so this is a set that is not only full of surprises but also storytelling potential. Along with the primary build, this set also includes a LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary Darth Malak minifigure.

Display options are built into the set. It comes with a stand that holds R2-D2 securely in position and there's an information plaque with the 25th Anniversary logo to provide your collection with a museum-quality feel.

Given the price of $79, this set offers excellent value. LEGO Star Wars sets rarely drop this low, especially for figures as iconic as R2-D2. If you're a fan or know someone who is, now is a great time to add this piece to your collection without paying full price.

High bandwidth memory could be the savior.

Samsung's semiconductor business is coming off a rough quarter, with profits plunging nearly 94% year-over-year. It's the weakest the chip division has looked in six quarters, and the culprit isn't hard to identify. Between U.S. export restrictions limiting the sale of advanced chips to China, and persistent inventory corrections, the company's Device Solutions division recorded just 400 billion won ($287 million) in profit for Q2 2025—a steep fall from the 6.5 trillion won ($4.67 billion) it pulled in the same period last year. However, Samsung is betting big that artificial intelligence will flip that narrative by the end of the year.

The recovery, as Samsung sees it, lies in HBM3E—the latest generation of High Bandwidth Memory used to feed data to AI accelerators at blazing speeds. According to a ZDNet Korea report, the company is actively working to lower the production costs of HBM3E in an effort to court Nvidia, which has so far leaned heavily on SK hynix for its AI GPU supply chain.

Samsung's strategy is simple: make HBM3E memory more affordable and available than anyone else and become indispensable to the future of AI computing. For context HBM3E (High Bandwidth Memory Gen 3E) is critical in modern AI accelerators, especially for large language model training where bandwidth and capacity bottlenecks limit performance. It's the memory found on Nvidia's top-end AI GPUs like the B300.



The company's memory division's quarterly sales rose 11% from Q1, reaching 21.2 trillion won ($15.2 billion), thanks in part to the expansion of HBM3E and high-density DDR5 for servers. NAND inventory is being cleared out faster too, with server SSD sales picking up. For the second half, Samsung plans to ramp up its production of 128GB DDR5, 24Gb GDDR7, and 8th-gen V-NAND, particularly for AI server deployments.

Adding a boost to its long-term outlook is Tesla's recently confirmed $16.5 billion partnership with Samsung, which will see the South Korean firm manufacture next-gen AI6 chips at its Texas foundry through 2033. This could inject much-needed scale and stability into Samsung's foundry operations, especially as the company battles stiff competition not just from TSMC, but from geopolitical pressures as well.

Just this week, U.S. President Donald Trump, slapped a 15% tariff on South Korean goods (reduced from 25%), clouding the second-half recovery narrative with fresh uncertainty. Samsung is walking a tightrope—betting on AI to pull it out of its slump, while navigating volatile trade dynamics and trying to claw back market share in the fiercely competitive high-end memory business.

If Samsung can pull off cheaper, high-yield HBM3E production, it could change this narrative. Winning back Nvidia, which is reportedly testing Samsung's HBM3E but still skeptical of thermals and power efficiency, would be a turning point. And with Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon all scaling their in-house AI silicon, memory suppliers like Samsung are in a new race to prove not just capability but value.

Although Nvidia is now permitted to sell its H20 HGX GPU to Chinese entities without a mandatory U.S. export license, the company may face an unexpected roadblock. According to a Reuters report, China now questions the security of the processor. China's concerns stem from fears that the hardware might expose user data or contain hidden tracking functions.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) recently subpoenaed Nvidia for a meeting to explain whether the H20 processor includes any security vulnerabilities. This is essentially a response to a U.S. legislative proposal requiring export-restricted AI accelerators (such as Nvidia's H100, H200, B100, and B200) to include tracking and location-check features. Chinese officials are reportedly worried that such additions could endanger personal information.

There are a couple of catches though. The H20 GPU is a cut-down version of the H100 that was created as a tailored solution for China after the U.S. imposed export limits on the performance of processors that can be shipped to China in 2023. The GPU module is not restricted (even though the U.S. government banned its exports for a while in mid-April as part of its effort to ink a trade deal with China) and to that end does not have any tracking devices onboard.

However, the concerns of the CAC may not be related to any security issues, but they could be related to a government plan to limit the sales of American GPUs to Chinese entities, which pay billions to companies like Nvidia and AMD. By contrast, Chinese authorities of are interested in supporting domestic developers and would like Chinese companies to buy AI accelerators from companies like Cambricon, Biren, or Huawei.

Tilly Zhang, an analyst for Gavekal, noted that Beijing now has more confidence in its domestic chip capabilities than in previous years, making it more willing to challenge overseas suppliers. However, analysts still acknowledge that China remains dependent on Nvidia hardware for key uses because the software stack of many (if not the majority) of companies relies on Nvidia's CUDA. Charlie Chai of 86Research suggested that the warning may be largely a symbolic counter to U.S. demands rather than a serious attempt to restrict Nvidia's business. Therefore, despite the ongoing scrutiny, do not expect an outright ban on Nvidia's hardware.

China has a history of accusing U.S. tech companies of security risks. In early 2023, it banned key infrastructure players from buying from Micron. It also raised similar issues with Intel, though those did not result in official government actions.

Media consumers are bombarded daily with aggressive, testimonial-driven ads for pricey supplements purported to sharpen memory, focus, and working brain function.

Some even claim to stop or slow the development of dementia.

Patients, especially older adults, may express interest in these supplements during clinic visits.

Most claim to be “clinically tested.” However, since the FDA exercises only limited regulatory control over these products, they are not held to the same purity, safety, and efficacy standards as are FDA-approved drugs.

“Manufacturers have a lot of leeway to market them as they want,” said Pieter Cohen, MD, director of the Supplement Research Program at the Cambridge Health Alliance in Somerville, Massachusetts, and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. “That's not to say they haven't been studied — there might be small studies posted online done in, say, 100 people in another country, for example.”

Cohen, therefore, does not generally recommend that his patients take them to improve brain health, “although I do recommend supplements to patients who need them to treat medical conditions,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Many contain dubious or unlisted ingredients, he noted. In a 2021 study of over-the-counter (OTC) cognitive enhancement supplements, Cohen and colleagues identified unapproved drugs (omberacetam, aniracetam, phenibut, vinpocetine, and picamilon) — as well as compounds not listed on the label and with unknown health effects. For those products with ingredient quantities provided on the labels, 75% of declared quantities were inaccurate. 

These OTC brain enhancers may feature, alone or in combination, nonpharmaceutical ingredients such as vitamins (including vitamin E), minerals like magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, turmeric, and herbal compounds like ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and coffee fruit extract. Some feature alleged boosters of brain performance that are less familiar, including alpha-GPC (L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine), huperzine A, the Chinese mushroom lion's mane, L-carnitine, and the Ayurvedic medicine compound Bacopa monnieri.

Some ingredients are more exotic. The memory enhancer Prevagen, for example, contains apoaequorin, a lab-made version of a protein found in the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria.

In 2024, the Federal Trade Commission and a federal district court in New York State ordered Prevagen's makers to stop their claims on the grounds they lacked reliable evidence.

The brain health supplements all have one thing in common, noted Jayne Zhang, MD, an attending neurologist specializing in cerebrovascular disease at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore — uncertain evidence of claimed efficacy.

“There is some modest support for a benefit from these products in people who already have nutritional deficiencies or mental degeneration, but there's not a lot of strong evidence from rigorous trials,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Added Alejandra Sánchez López, MD, an assistant clinical professor of neurology and geriatric medicine at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research at the University of California, Los Angeles, “Weak evidence of benefit usually comes from studies with small sample sizes and sponsored by the manufacturing company.”

Like Cohen, Sánchez López recommends that her patients not take the brain supplements. “They come with palpable GI [gastrointestinal] side effects such as nausea and diarrhea,” she said.

Zhang is more open to patients' hopeful inquiries. “I try not to be dismissive. Instead, I ask them what they're hoping a supplement will do for them, then I reveal what we know about them and talk about safety.”

Zhang uses these encounters with OTC nootropics to talk about improving cognitive function in other ways: good nutrition, exercise, sleep, alcohol reduction, and social engagement, as well as proven medical therapies that mitigate cognition-impairing conditions such as depression, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. “Patients need to understand there is no magic pill for brain health,” she said.

The old-fashioned multivitamin tablet shows some promise, however. In a large National Institutes of Health-funded, placebo- and comparator-controlled randomized trial, Baker and colleagues found that older adults given a multivitamin had higher global cognition scores than those who did not take it. Specific effects on global cognition, episodic memory, and executive function were noted. The improvement was most pronounced in those with a history of cardiovascular disease.

Potential toxicity must be an issue with any loosely or unregulated OTC supplement, especially if taken over the long term.

A content analysis of 12 cognitive supplements found the majority had at least one ingredient listed but not detected or, conversely, contained compounds detected but not reported on the label. And as noted, they can contain unapproved and potentially dangerous drugs.

Drug interactions are another safety issue. Some dietary supplements can affect the pharmacokinetics of prescription drugs, altering their absorption, metabolism, or excretion and decreasing or increasing their potency.

So, clinicians need to urge patients to be cautious, Sánchez López said. “I always ask my patients to show me what supplements they're taking, and I go over the ingredient list.”

Emma Laing, PhD, RDN, a clinical professor and director of dietetics at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, noted that a safer, proven alternative to commercial cognitive supplements can be found in the kitchen. “While genetic predisposition, medical conditions, and environment are strongly linked to brain health, consuming a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods can improve cognitive health and reduce your risk for chronic disease,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Minimally processed, nutrient-dense foods have been shown to support neurologic health, along with coffee and tea, Laing added. And even a small reduction in alcohol intake can improve cognitive function.

Both the Mediterranean diet and the “brain-healthy” MIND Diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) — a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) regimens — have been well studied for their potential role in supporting cognitive function, memory, and alertness.

Nootropics with cognitive potential are under ongoing evaluation, but until large scientific studies establish a positive effect of commercial brain health supplements on cognition, a healthy lifestyle may deliver more solid benefits to the brain.

Cohen has reported receiving grants from Consumers Union and PEW Charitable Trust, as well as personal fees from UpToDate and the CDC, not relevant to his comments. Zhang, Sánchez López, and Laing had no relevant conflicts of interest to declare.

The odds of a mental health diagnosis in children with chronic medical conditions increased stepwise based on the severity of their illness, according to data from nearly 3 million children presented at the Pediatric Hospital Medicine (PHM) 2025 in Anaheim, California.

Mental health diagnoses are known to complicate outcomes of underlying medical conditions in children, but the prevalence of mental health diagnoses across multiple complex, chronic conditions and the factors associated with them have not been well studied, wrote Maria Newmaster, MD, of Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, and colleagues.

“Understanding mental health trends across the array of medical complexity and chronicity in pediatrics is important for informing intervention efforts, which may ultimately aid with disease trajectory and healthcare use and spending,” Newmaster said in an interview.

In a retrospective study, the researchers examined data from children aged 5-17 years with at least 11 months of continuous Medicaid enrollment in 2022 based on the Merative MarketScan Medicaid Database. The study population included 2.9 million children, categorized into noncomplex nonchronic (NCNC) conditions, noncomplex chronic (NCC) conditions, and complex chronic conditions (CCC).

The primary outcome was diagnosis of a mood disorder or affective mental health condition including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorders, trauma-related disorders, and suicide/self-injury.

Overall, 310,000 (10.6%) of the children had a mental health diagnosis, and the rates increased stepwise with increasing severity and chronicity of disease: 7.6%, 16.0%, and 20% for the NCNC, NCC, and CCC groups, respectively. The most common mental health diagnoses were trauma/stressor disorders, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders, accounting for 5.3%, 4.6%, and 4.3%, respectively.

In the CCC group, the prevalence of any mental health diagnosis varied across disease category. The disease categories with the greatest odds of a mental health diagnosis were cardiovascular, neurologic, and metabolic.

When stratified by race, Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic children were less likely to have a mental health diagnosis than non-Hispanic White children (adjusted odds ratios [aORs], 0.56 and 0.57, respectively).

However, foster care, female sex, and older age (13-17 years) were independently associated with increased odds of a mental health diagnosis (aORs, 3.37, 1.51, and 3.89, respectively).

The findings were limited by several factors including the retrospective design, the researchers noted. However, the variability in mental health diagnoses across medical conditions as well as race/ethnicity and foster care status may reflect true differences in prevalence vs inequities in diagnosis or access, they said.

The results can guide clinicians to increase attention on mental health screening and treatment in this patient population, Newmaster told Medscape Medical News.

Future studies may be aimed at identifying the proportion of children receiving mental health care intervention, as well as identifying specific risk factors among the complex chronic categories with the greatest odds of mental health diagnoses, she added.

The current study highlights the increased rates of mental health diagnoses that clinicians are seeing every day, said Margaret Thew, DNP, FNP-BC, a nurse practitioner and specialist in adolescent medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, in an interview.

The increased numbers of children and adolescents presenting with mental health concerns cross all socioeconomic, acute, and chronic medical conditions, said Thew, who was not involved in the study.

“What has been a surprise is the positive mental health screenings we are seeing in primary and specialty clinics,” she said. These conditions have always been present, but more are being identified and treated, she said. Thew has been working with children and teens with disordered eating for the past 10 years and has never had a patient with cerebral palsy, but in the past year, she has had three who also have had some form of anxiety and anorexia nervosa.

“Developmentally, children compare themselves to others during preteen and early teen years, so I would image [imagine] the children who are developmentally appropriate but also deal with chronic conditions would compare themselves to peers; these comparisons spotlight their differences, and they may have increased isolation,” she said.

The implications of the current study for clinical practice include persistent screening of all children and teens, regardless of chronic conditions, Thew told Medscape Medical News. The study also shows the need for psychologists and practitioners with the knowledge and clinical skills to support the unique medical and mental health needs of children with chronic and complex health conditions, she said.

The study was limited by the use of insurance coverage to identify the population, as it may be missing a population not covered by Medicaid, Thew noted.

“This study may also have some reporting bias given the higher Caucasian population, female, and foster care status,” she said. “Although children in the foster care system may have higher rates of trauma and [mental and behavioral health], they may also be screened at a higher rate, resulting in sampling bias,” she explained.

The study received no outside funding. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Thew had no financial conflicts to disclose.

In an analysis of all FDA approvals for anticancer drugs from 2009 to 2020, only about 29% of next-in-class drugs were evaluated in head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs) against their first-in-class counterparts. And in these head-to-head RCTs, only 22% of the “me-too” agents showed a survival benefit compared to the originals.

“These results suggest a need for regulatory bodies to incentivize within-class RCTs,” the authors wrote, adding that “in cases where head-to-head RCTs were lacking, it is difficult to assess the true therapeutic value of next-in-class drugs.”

This study, led by Timothée Olivier, MD, Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, was published online in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Drug development often occurred in parallel, limiting the feasibility of head-to-head comparisons. Some comparative trials published after the analysis period may not have been captured.

NYU Langone Hospitals in New York City is once again the best US hospital for neurology care, according to the 2025-2026 U.S. News & World Report annual ranking of best hospitals for neurology and neurosurgery.

NYU Langone also claimed the top spot in last year's ranking.

University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health-UCSF Medical Center has climbed to second place for neurology care, improving from third last year. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia and Cornell in New York City has also moved up, now ranked third after holding fourth place previously.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, has fallen from No. 2 last year to No. 4 this year. Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, ranks fifth this year, rising two spots from No. 7 last year.

Rounding out the top 10 hospitals for neurology/neurosurgery (in order) are Northwestern Medicine-Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago; Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore; Hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian, Philadelphia; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas; and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.

To determine the rankings, U.S. News evaluated 1227 top neurology hospitals and ranked them based on care for brain hemorrhage, conditions affecting the central nervous system, spinal disorders and injuries, degenerative nervous system diagnoses such as multiple sclerosis, care for stroke, seizures, meningitis, and more.

As in prior years, this year U.S. News also recognized “honor roll” hospitals that have excelled across multiple areas of care. There are 20 this year, listed in alphabetical order here:

Oral anticoagulants are an important tool for preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation, but they also increase the risk for serious bleeding events. Now a new study, published in July in Heart, sheds some light on how soon a patient should resume taking blood thinners after a serious bleed.

Nour Al-Hussainy, MD, PhD, a cardiologist at Aalborg University Hospital in Aalborg, Denmark, who led the work, said bleeding events are quite common among patients taking blood thinners, and when they happen physicians face a dilemma about what to do. “Should they discontinue treatment? Continue it? Interrupt it? When should it restart?” Al-Hussainy said.

Until now, clinicians have had little evidence on the balance between preventing strokes and the risk for further bleeding events to help make that decision. So Al-Hussainy and her colleagues examined the medical records of more than 10,000 people in Denmark taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) who had experienced a serious bleeding event requiring hospital treatment, such as an intracranial bleed, gastrointestinal bleed, or nosebleed.

They divided the patients into two groups — those who restarted DOAC within 60 days of hospitalization (the early restart group) and those who restarted more than 60 days after (late restarters).

Patients who restarted treatment early were 21% more likely to experience recurrent bleeding than those who restarted later, the researchers found. Although their risk for stroke was slightly lower, the CI ranged from moderate benefit to no clear difference, making the actual benefit uncertain (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.74-1.08).

In other words, Al-Hussainy said, “You don't gain much by restarting blood thinners early after a bleed.”

The study does not define the optimal time to resume anticoagulation after a bleed, she added, and more studies will be needed to determine how soon treatment can be restarted without increasing the risk for bleeding.

Marc Carrier, MD, head of Hematology at The Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and president of Thrombosis Canada, said most prior studies have shown resuming anticoagulation is generally the right decision because the consequences of a stroke are usually more severe than all but the most serious bleeding events. But clinicians often find it difficult to communicate that balance to patients who have yet to experience a stroke but are understandably upset about the possibility of future bleeds.

The new research could help in those conversations. “Having these discussions is important, and this will help with tailoring when to resume anticoagulation,” he said.

Al-Hussainy said she hopes the study helps to bring some of the focus in those discussions back onto the potential side effects of anticoagulation. “We shouldn't forget the bleeding risk associated with blood thinners,” she said.

Al-Hussainy and Carrier reported having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Socioeconomic factors, including education and employment status, along with clinical parameters, such as modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, were linked to longer in-hospital stays among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

“We suggest that health caregivers would stratify COPD patients according to their risk profile, including predictors such as smoking, unemployment, and family support and provide interventions (eg, telecommunication, education, reduction of smoking, and environmental exposures) to reduce the risks for poor disease outcomes,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Dekel Shlomi, The Adelson School of Medicine, Ariel University in Ariel and Pulmonary Clinic, Clalit Health Services Community Division in Ramat Gan, Israel. It was published online on June 29, 2025, in Chronic Respiratory Disease.

Although the analysis used systematically collected clinical trial data, its post hoc nature limited causal interpretations. The sample size was chosen to provide statistical power for testing the original trial's objective and may be insufficient to detect associations with a larger set of predictors.

The Medical Research Infrastructure Development and Health Services Fund by the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan provided support for the original COPD-community disease management clinical trial. No conflicts of interest were reported.

 July 31, 2025  

TORONTO — An expert panel convened by the Alzheimer's Association has released the first clinical guidelines to help clinicians choose the most appropriate blood-based biomarker (BBM) test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The evidence-based guideline recommends that tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker testing.

Tests with ≥ 90% sensitivity but only ≥ 75% specificity should be used as a triaging test. In this case, a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability and a positive result should be confirmed with CSF or PET testing.

Evidence-based guidelines are key to standardizing the use of BBMs in clinical practice, Rebecca M. Edelmayer, PhD, vice president of scientific engagement for the Alzheimer's Association, told Medscape Medical News.

“The whole purpose of developing the clinical practice guideline is to try to create pragmatic recommendations for clinicians on how to choose the right test for the right patient at the right time,” Edelmayer said.

This new guideline is the first step in a developing process, she added. “The blood-based biomarker area is still a burgeoning field.”

The findings were presented on July 29 at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) 2025 and published online simultaneously in Alzheimer's & Dementia.

With the approval of anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) therapies to treat early symptomatic disease, more rapid and accurate diagnosis of AD is becoming increasingly important. A number of different BBM tests are available to clinicians, but the lack of clinical practice guidelines has hindered more widespread use of the diagnostic tools, guidelines authors wrote.

A panel of clinical experts, researchers with experience and technical knowledge surrounding BBM, and guideline methodologists conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the accuracy of BBMs in detecting amyloid pathology for triaging (≥ 90% sensitivity, ≥ 75% specificity) and confirmatory (≥ 90% sensitivity and specificity) diagnostic workup.

After a review of 1050 papers, 49 observational studies of 31 different BBM tests were selected for inclusion.

The BBMs of interest included plasma phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and Aβ tests measuring these analytes: p-tau217, the ratio of p-tau217 to non-p-tau217 ×100 (%p-tau17), p-tau181, p-tau231, and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. The reference standard tests included CSF, amyloid PET, or neuropathology examination.

The relatively low-cost BBM tests are minimally invasive compared with PET and CSF tests and can significantly reduce the physical discomfort and anxiety often associated with lumbar puncture or PET imaging procedures, the authors wrote.

The systematic review focused on single analytes, not combinations of different analytes, sometimes referred to a “blood panel,” noted Edelmayer.

Using predefined decision thresholds, the panel determined whether tests have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to be used as a triaging test where a positive test is to be confirmed by PET or CSF, sufficient diagnostic accuracy as a confirmatory test to replace PET or CSF, or insufficient diagnostic accuracy to recommend current use in clinical practice.

The recommendations are focused on individuals with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia who are undergoing diagnostic assessment by providers trained and experienced in memory disorders, where AD is the suspected underlying etiology.

The guideline does not endorse specific tests or rank them.

“We just don't have enough data at this time,” said Edelmayer. “We're not ready to pick one single test out of a lineup of tests to say this test is performing much better in a comparative analysis and through systematic review evidence than another test.”

Researchers now have a clearer picture of how AD pathology evolved over time, with changes in some tau biomarkers occurring very early on, said Edelmayer.

“What we've learned from all of the evidence so far is that some of these biomarkers, like tau 217, tend to be very accurate predictors of Alzheimer's disease biology in the brain, and they can be used to aid in the diagnostic process early on, sometimes even before tau tangle formations can be visualized with brain imaging.”

The guideline authors noted some limitations of the evidence. For example, undesirable effects of BBM testing could include false positive or false negative results, which could delay accurate diagnosis and treatment.

The authors also cautioned that there's significant variability in the accuracy of diagnostic tests and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet accuracy thresholds.

Edelmayer stressed this is the first iteration of the clinical practice guideline and the expert panel is already working on next steps, including determining if these biomarkers can be used as confirmatory or triage tests in cognitively unimpaired people and in a primary care setting.

The tests aren't a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional, said David Knopman, MD, a clinical neurologist and researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who commented on the new guidelines for Medscape Medical News.

“The use of any AD-specific biomarker is dependent on the context,” he said. “For example, the history or no history of cognitive impairment, the objective cognitive assessment, and the presence or absence of features of non-AD biologics.”

While he noted the guideline was reasonable for the separate functions of triaging and confirming AD biology, as with any such document, no matter how thoughtfully constructed, there's the risk that people ignore stipulations in the recommendation.

“So people without cognitive impairment will be captured. There's also the risk that the memory disorder clinic is not well versed in non-Alzheimer causes of memory impairment,” he said.

Edelmayer is an employee of the Alzheimer's Association. Knopman reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who experienced sleep impairments, including short sleep duration, snoring, and insomnia symptoms, were more likely to face an increased risk for diabetes distress. In particular, daytime coping difficulties due to sleep problems showed a notably prominent association with diabetes distress.

""The assessment of sleep quality should be part of routine diabetes care in people with T2D. Efforts need to be made to raise awareness towards the relationship between sleep impairments and diabetes distress, which further may encourage these individuals to prioritize sleep and seek help when needed,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Hilde K.R. Riise, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Bergen, Norway. It was published online on July 25, 2025, in Diabetic Medicine.

The study population was predominantly Caucasian. The cross-sectional design of the study precluded causal inferences between sleep impairment and diabetes distress. Moreover, sleep impairment data were self-reported without clinical verification and were collected at a single timepoint.

This study was supported by the Swedish Research Council and Helse Vest. Some authors reported receiving honoraria for lectures and lecture fees from certain pharmaceutical companies.

Tango, a rhythmic partner dance that enhances balance and coordination, can help ease the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Choral singing, which combines vocal training and social interaction, may reduce depression in individuals with dementia. Music therapy has been shown to support stroke recovery by improving speech disorders.

Many clinics in Germany have incorporated music therapy to address mental and physical health conditions. “There is good evidence of effectiveness,” said Lutz Neugebauer, PhD, chairman of the German Music Therapy Society and co-organiser of the 13th European Music Therapy Congress, themed “Bridges,” during an online press briefing.

He noted that since Germany last hosted an international music therapy congress in 1996, nearly 9000 music therapy-related articles have been published in PubMed, including 1500 randomised controlled trials and 360 systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Germany's clinical guidelines on dementia, which reflect the highest level of evidence-based medical recommendations, endorse music therapy to ease symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, and apathy. Music therapy is also included in 37 national clinical guidelines in Germany published by the Association of Scientific Medical Societies, 29 of which follow the country's highest standard for evidence-based care.

“There is an impressive wealth of evidence,” said Sabine C. Koch, PhD, professor of empirical research in the arts therapies at Alanus University of Arts and Social Sciences in Alfter, Germany. She outlined the conditions under which music therapy can complement psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy and its effectiveness.

A recent meta-analysis of the effects of arts-based interventions in the treatment and management of noncommunicable diseases included 150 systematic reviews encompassing 3885 randomised controlled trials. “The results particularly support music and dance therapy,” said Koch. The authors reported small-to-moderate effects for neurologic disorders (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30-0.50) and moderate effects for cancer (SMD = 0.52), cardiovascular disease (SMD = 0.52), mental illness (SMD = 0.53), and chronic respiratory disease (SMD = 0.76). However, most of these reviews had low methodologic quality. Still, the authors concluded that “arts-based interventions may be a valuable addition to traditionally first-line treatments.”

Music therapy has been well studied in the context of chronic pain and pain management in patients with advanced cancer. “The overall effect is comparable to opioids, but without unwanted side effects,” Koch said. Music therapy also improves sleep and helps reduce fatigue, anxiety, and depression.

Among newborns, music therapy has been shown to improve oxygen saturation, heart and respiratory rates, sleep duration, body temperature, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In premature infants, it also supports the development of a functional brain. Studies have shown positive effects on cardiorespiratory function, pain scores, oxygen saturation, and sleep duration, even during sleep.

“Music therapy helps these children reduce stress and recover,” said Koch.

Neugebauer added that in premature infants, music therapy also strengthens the parent-child bond, “one of the key indicators for better development after a difficult start in life.” Music therapy supports speech development in children with developmental delays.

“Music therapy is particularly effective for adolescents and young adults who have experienced trauma such as domestic violence, during migration, or war,” Neugebauer said. “It enables expression beyond the spoken word and bridges language barriers.” He added that music therapy is often the first-choice approach for individuals struggling to communicate through speech, including those with disabilities.

Koch reported that music therapy has shown significant benefits for people with cancer, including reduced anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue, heart rate, and blood pressure. “The effect is strong and significant,” she said, noting that the outcomes are comparable to those seen with cognitive-behavioural therapy.

Music therapy promotes relaxation and reduces fatigue during palliative care. “Music therapy is an effective treatment with a low dropout rate and improves the well-being of terminally ill patients,” said Koch. “In treating depression and anxiety, it often matches the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy.”

According to Neugebauer, music therapy is an established part of inpatient care for anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and the consequences of social isolation. However, music therapy remains excluded from outpatient reimbursements for health insurers.

“This urgently needs to change, particularly in vulnerable groups who depend on this therapy,” he said.

Despite strong scientific evidence and positive clinical experience, calls to establish music therapy as a standard outpatient service are yet to be addressed at the political level, as Neugebauer noted. A 2011 report by Christine Bergmann, a former commissioner for the investigation of child sexual abuse, called for outpatient music therapy to be covered by health insurance.

In 2019, the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care reported that access to outpatient treatment remains unequal, with only higher-income individuals being able to afford it.

“In a healthcare system that prioritises outpatient over inpatient care, access to music therapy must be guaranteed for all patients — including in outpatient settings and health insurers must be required to cover the cost,” Neugebauer emphasised.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) – critical but enigmatic players in tumors – exhibit ""paradoxical"" effects on immunotherapy, according to a new review in Clinical and Translational Discovery. While most CAFs suppress immune cells to accelerate cancer progression, certain subtypes actively restrain tumors. This duality stems from CAFs' extreme heterogeneity, explaining why depleting all CAFs sometimes backfires by accelerating metastasis.

CAFs sabotage immunotherapy through multiple mechanisms: remodeling the extracellular matrix into physical barriers; reprogramming immune cells (like macrophages and T cells) into pro-tumor states; and secreting immunosuppressive molecules (TGF-β, IL-6) or exosomes. Consequently, CAF-rich tumors often resist PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

Yet in specific cancers like pancreatic and breast cancer, certain CAF subtypes (e.g., αSMA+ CAFs) enhance CD8+ T-cell infiltration or restrain tumor growth.

CAFs are neither friend nor foe universally. Their impact depends on context and subtype – precision targeting is key.""

Dr. Peng Luo, senior author 

Promisingly, therapies eliminating specific ""bad"" CAFs (e.g., FAP-positive subtypes) boost immunotherapy efficacy in preclinical models. Approaches include:

- FAP-targeted CAR-T cells or vaccines

- Blocking CAF-secreted factors (CXCL12, TGF-β)

- Disrupting CAF-ECM remodeling

Combining these with existing immunotherapies could overcome resistance. However, challenges remain – FAP-targeted therapies risk toxicity since healthy cells also express FAP.

""Future success requires mapping CAF subtypes and their functions across cancer types,"" emphasizes Dr. Jian Zhang, co-corresponding author. ""We need biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit from CAF-directed combos.""

Last July, a team of physicians and researchers successfully proposed modifications to the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, advocating against the use of race in lung function testing. In a new publication in The New England Journal of Medicine, the team describes the history of how race and pulmonary function testing have been used to quantify lung function impairment, which often determines disability and eligibility for worker's compensation. They also outline a path forward toward more equitable evaluation and warn against the dangers of overreliance on ""objective"" cutoff-based criteria.

""Race has long been inappropriately used as a proxy for biological traits in medical care and research, including in lung function testing reference equations used to evaluate how much someone's lung function is impaired,"" said lead author Rohan Khazanchi, MD, MPH, a resident physician in the Harvard Internal Medicine & Pediatrics combined residency program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center and research affiliate at the FXB Center for Health & Human Rights at Harvard University. ""National guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society now advocate against the use of race in lung function equations, but there are significant barriers to de-implementation.""

After our group made the recommendation to remove race from pulmonary function reference equations, we quickly realized the need to address implementation not only in a clinical care setting but also in the area of disability evaluations. We were fortunate to be able to collaborate with the AMA on the proposed modifications to remove the bias of race-based equations.""

Nirav Bhakta, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco

The AMA Guides are used by the majority of U.S. states, U.S. federal employee compensation programs, and multiple multinational corporations and international government agencies as a ""gold standard"" for evaluating worker's compensation claims. The most recent version of the Guides continues to recommend race-based reference equations for spirometry-a breathing test to evaluate a patient's lung capacity and function. In their NEJM publication, the authors outline pitfalls in the original studies that led to race-adjusted interpretation of spirometry, many of which emphasized biological explanations for racial differences in readings while ignoring known environmental or social factors which predict lung-related health outcomes.

The authors' proposals to eliminate race-based assessments from lung function testing will be reflected in the next update to the Guides, but the authors note that complex solutions will still be needed to ensure that pulmonary evaluations are equitable in the future.

 ""The medical field should critically reevaluate the whole ecosystem surrounding pulmonary impairment evaluations - including and beyond the choice of reference equations,"" the authors write.

The authors also emphasize the need for remedy of harms, especially for patients whose degree of lung function impairment – and thus, their disability ratings or worker's compensation payments – may have been underestimated by race-based equations.

Mass General Brigham and UCSF recently removed race from their pulmonary function testing calculations, moving to the race-neutral Global Lung Function Initiative reference equation. Other healthcare systems have also been shifting to this race-neutral equation in accordance with the American Thoracic Society guidelines.

Here's what science says","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250730/Can-stacking-creatine-and-ceb2-alanine-give-you-extra-gains-Heree28099s-what-science-says.aspx","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 02:45:00 GMT","

Curious if stacking creatine and β-alanine will supercharge your training? This systematic review reveals who actually benefits, and when you might be wasting your money.

Review: Effects of Creatine and β-Alanine Co-Supplementation on Exercise Performance and Body Composition: A Systematic Review. Image Credit: Andrii Zastrozhnov / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the journal Nutrients, researchers investigated whether co-supplementation with creatine and β-alanine, two of the most popular and effective sports supplements, provides synergistic benefits. It synthesizes evidence from seven randomized controlled trials and found that co-supplementation effectively enhances high-intensity exercise performance, particularly in repeated, short-duration efforts.

Surprisingly, however, the review concluded that the combination of creatine and β-alanine offered no additional benefit over creatine alone for improving maximal strength, body composition, or aerobic capacity. These findings provide crucial insights for athletes and coaches, allowing for the development of science-based supplement plans.

Dosing wasn't one-size-fits-all: Studies used different creatine strategies (some with loading phases, others without) and varying β-alanine doses (3.2g-6.4g/day), highlighting the lack of a standard co-supplementation protocol.

Creatine and β-alanine are well-established ergogenic aids in the world of sports nutrition, backed by decades of scientific research. The former (specifically creatine monohydrate) boosts the body's stores of phosphocreatine, enhancing the rapid regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby fueling explosive movements like sprinting and heavy lifting. This leads to measurable improvements in athlete strength and power.

In contrast, β-alanine aids athletic performance through a distinct physiological pathway. β-alanine is a precursor to carnosine, a molecule that acts as an intracellular buffer. During high-intensity exercise, muscles produce hydrogen ions, leading to acidosis (a drop in pH) and fatigue. Carnosine neutralizes this acid, delaying fatigue in intensive efforts lasting between one and four minutes.

Notably, creatine and β-alanine function through complementary mechanisms – while the former promotes energy supply, the latter delays fatigue, leading sports nutritionists to hypothesize that combining the two could produce a synergistic effect. However, existing research shows inconsistent results.

Your results may vary: The paper suggests genetics, muscle fiber types, and even baseline diet (like vegetarianism) might influence who responds best to either supplement, explaining inconsistent findings between individuals.

The present systematic review aims to address this knowledge gap, examine an increasingly popular hypothesis (the “synergistic effect”), and inform athletes' supplementation programmes by synthesizing all available evidence from high-quality clinical trials on the combined use of creatine and β-alanine. The review adhered to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) guidelines (CRD420251066302).

Study data (relevant publications) were identified via a custom keyword search of three online scientific repositories: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Due to limited research on this specific combination, all peer-reviewed studies from database initiation until March 2025 were included in the repository search.

Study inclusion criteria comprised: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with adult participants (any sex), combination use of both creatine and β-alanine for at least four weeks, and direct comparison of the combined supplement group to groups taking either creatine alone, β-alanine alone, or a placebo.

The outcomes of interest included exercise performance (e.g., maximal strength via one-repetition maximum [1RM], anaerobic power from a Wingate test) and body composition (lean body mass and fat mass). The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Since the included studies were substantially different in terms of study designs, participant populations, and specific outcomes measured (heterogeneity), a quantitative meta-analysis could not be performed, restricting the findings to a qualitative synthesis.

Women gained less muscle mass: While creatine boosted lean mass more than β-alanine overall, a cited meta-analysis found men gained over twice as much lean mass from creatine (1.2kg) compared to women (0.54kg).

Of the 5,537 publications initially collated from the title search, abstract, and full-text screening, only seven RCTs (comprising 231 male and 32 female participants, 263 total) met all systematic review criteria. Review findings were organized into: 1. High-intensity exercise and anaerobic power evaluations, 2. Maximal strength outcomes, 3. Body composition changes, and 4. Aerobic endurance.

High-intensity exercises demonstrated a clear, positive effect of co-supplementation, with cases consistently improving performance in activities requiring repeated, high-intensity efforts. Okudan et al.'s study involving repeated Wingate anaerobic tests found that while creatine alone improved peak power, when combined with β-alanine, the combination significantly increased mean power output across multiple sprints and reduced the fatigue index, suggesting that creatine provides the initial power burst while β-alanine helps sustain that power over successive efforts.

Body composition evaluations showed mixed results: One study in resistance-trained males found co-supplementation yielded greater lean mass gains and fat loss versus creatine alone after 10 weeks of training. However, another 4-week study in females found no body composition benefits. Overall, the review concluded these effects were equivocal.

In contrast, maximal strength and aerobic endurance-based metrics did not reveal a significant advantage of adding β-alanine to an otherwise creatine-only supplementation program. Studies measuring maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), lactate threshold, or time-to-exhaustion found no meaningful improvements from the combination compared to either supplement alone or placebo.

Training type mattered: The lack of anaerobic power benefit seen in women (Kresta study) might be partly explained by their concurrent endurance training, suggesting supplement effects can be masked by other exercise demands.

The review reveals that while co-supplementing with creatine and β-alanine does not universally boost sports/athletic performance, it can be an effective strategy for meeting specific training or competition goals.

Individuals engaged in high-intensity, repeated-bout activities where muscle fatigue from acidosis is a limiting factor (e.g., HIIT, combat sports, or repeated sprinting) stand to gain meaningful benefits from co-supplementation regimes according to the evidence. For athletes focused purely on maximal strength or power, creatine monohydrate remains the cornerstone supplement, with β-alanine offering little additional value. The body composition benefits appear context-dependent and require further validation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Novel eye-tracking metrics can help properly identify concussion-related vision disorders","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250731/Novel-eye-tracking-metrics-can-help-properly-identify-concussion-related-vision-disorders.aspx","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:12:00 GMT","

In a new study led by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), researchers found that novel eye-tracking metrics can help properly identify concussion-related vision disorders, a common phenomenon among patients with persisting post-concussive symptoms that last more than 28 days after their initial injury. The findings, recently published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, suggest that objective infrared eye tracking could help identify which patients would benefit the most from referrals to and treatment from concussion specialists.

Almost two million pediatric concussions occur every year in the United States. While most children report their concussion symptoms resolving within the first 28 days after injury, up to 30% of children have persisting post-concussive symptoms, which can impact both school performance and physical activity. Early identification of concussion-related vision disorders – causing symptoms of blurred or double vision, eye strain, or headaches – is critical for improving outcomes.

Prior research demonstrated that a clinical visio–vestibular examination (VVE) – a series of brief eye movement and balance assessments intended to identify deficits in visual and vestibular function – and infrared eye tracking may provide helpful data that can help clinicians diagnose concussion.

A comprehensive vision examination by an eyecare professional remains the basis for making the diagnosis for a concussion-related vision disorders, which might be missed during a typical concussion evaluation. The earlier we can identify these vision disorders through easy-to-use objective means, the earlier we can refer patients to specialists to get a proper diagnosis and start receiving more specialized treatment.""

Christina L. Master, MD, senior study author, sports medicine specialist and co-director of the Minds Matter Concussion Program at CHOP

This prospective study enrolled 108 adolescents whose concussion symptoms persisted beyond 28 days after initial injury. The patients were evaluated with VVE, comprehensive vision examination, and an eye tracking device. Of those enrolled, 67 (62%) were diagnosed with a concussion-related vision disorder by a comprehensive vision examination, with the most common diagnosis being convergence insufficiency, which can cause double vision and visual fatigue when looking at things up close in tasks such as reading.

The study also utilized EyeBOX, which measures and records the gaze positions across five 40-s cycles while the subject watches a video. Higher BOX scores indicate a greater likelihood of concussion. The study found that the average BOX score was significantly higher for patients with concussion-related vision disorders compared with patients who did not have vision disorders (8.1 ± 5.8 vs. 5.2 ± 4.1; p = 0.007). The study found that for each 1-point increase in the BOX score, the odds of a patient experiencing a concussion-related vision disorder was 15% higher.

""Our study strongly suggests that eye-tracking technology could significantly augment current clinical concussion evaluations, ensuring that patients with ongoing vision symptoms are identified promptly and are referred for rehabilitation for their concussion-related vision disorder,"" Master said.

This study was supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke grant 1R41NS103698-01A1.

In a breakthrough for cardiovascular medicine, researchers have harnessed artificial intelligence to discover unexpected lipid-lowering effects in existing FDA-approved drugs. The study, published in Acta Pharmacologica Sinica, addresses critical gaps in hyperlipidemia treatment-where many patients struggle with intolerance or inadequate response to statins and other standard therapies.

Using a novel machine learning framework, the team analyzed 3,430 drugs (176 known lipid-lowering agents vs. 3,254 controls). Top-performing AI models flagged 29 candidates for repurposing. Crucially, these predictions underwent rigorous validation by using clinical data, mouse experiments, and molecular docking.

We've established a paradigm for AI-driven drug repositioning. By integrating computational predictions with clinical and experimental validation, we bypass decades of traditional drug development-offering clinicians new tools faster and cheaper.""

Dr. Peng Luo, senior author

This study employs an innovative approach by integrating machine learning techniques to systematically explore the lipidlowering potential of non-lipid-lowering drugs, potentially offering novel treatment options for patients with hyperlipidemia. The research methodology encompasses retrospective clinical data analysis and in vivo animal experiments for validation, while also examining the binding and interaction mechanisms between drugs and lipid-lowering targets at the molecular level. This approach may provide alternative options for patients exhibiting poor tolerance or inadequate response to conventional lipid lowering therapies, thus offering the potential for individualized and precise treatment of hyperlipidemia. Consequently, this research has the potential to enhance patient outcomes, thereby demonstrating substantial academic value and promising clinical applicability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","A tourist ended up with a wild bat in her mouth — and nearly $21,000 in medical bills","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250731/A-tourist-ended-up-with-a-wild-bat-in-her-mouth-e28094-and-nearly-2421000-in-medical-bills.aspx","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:47:00 GMT","

In retrospect, Erica Kahn realizes she made two big mistakes.

The first was choosing to temporarily forgo health insurance when she was laid off from her job.

The second was screaming when a wild bat later landed on her face.

The bizarre encounter happened last August, while the Massachusetts resident was photographing the night sky during a vacation at the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona. Kahn, now 33, noticed a few bats flying around but didn't worry about them — until one flew up to her and got tangled between her camera and her face.

She screamed, and part of the bat went in her mouth. She doesn't know which part or for how long, though she estimates it was only a few seconds. ""It seemed longer,"" she said.

The bat flew away, leaving Kahn shaken.

She didn't think the animal had bitten her. Regardless, her father, who is a physician and was traveling with her, said she should go to a hospital within a day or so and begin vaccinations against rabies.

Figuring she would be covered as long as she obtained insurance before going to the hospital, Kahn said, she found a policy online the day after the bat incident. She said she called the company before she bought its policy and was told services related to an accident or ""life-threatening"" emergency would be covered.

Kahn went the next day to a hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, where she started rabies prevention treatment. Over the next two weeks, she received the rest of the rabies shots at clinics in Arizona and Massachusetts and at a hospital in Colorado.

Then the bills came.

Kahn received a total of four doses of the rabies vaccine. The doses are administered over the course of 14 days. Along with her first vaccination, she received three shots of immunoglobulin, which boosts antibodies against the virus.

Rabies is typically transmitted through bites or scratches from an infected animal. Experts recommend precautionary measures when a person has been potentially exposed to rabies, because once the neurological disease causes symptoms, it is fatal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says postexposure rabies treatment has reduced the number of human fatalities to fewer than 10 a year in the U.S.

According to explanation-of-benefits statements, Kahn owed a total of $20,749 for her care at the four facilities. Most of the charges were from the hospital where she was first treated, Flagstaff Medical Center: $17,079, including $15,242 for the rabies and immunoglobulin shots.

Kahn's policy did not pay for any of the services. ""The required waiting period for this service has not been met,"" said an explanation-of-benefits letter she received in December.

Kahn was stunned. ""I thought it must have been a mistake,"" she said. ""I guess I was naive.""

When Kahn was laid off from her job as a biomedical engineer last summer, she had the option to temporarily stay on her former employer's insurance under a COBRA plan, at a cost of about $650 a month. But as a young, healthy person, she gambled that she could get by without insurance until she found another job. She figured that if she needed medical care, she could quickly buy a private policy.

According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, those who qualify for COBRA must be given at least 60 days to sign up — and if they do, the coverage applies retroactively. Kahn, who was still within that period at the time of the incident, said recently that she did not realize she had that option.

The policy she purchased after the bat episode, which cost about $311 a month, was from a Florida company called Innovative Partners LP. Documents Kahn provided to KFF Health News say the policy has a 30-day waiting period, which ""does not apply to benefits regarding an accident or loss of life.""

Kahn said that after receiving notice that her claims were denied, she called the company to ask how she could appeal and was told a doctor would have to file paperwork. She said she wrote a letter that was signed by a doctor at Flagstaff Medical Center and submitted it in March but was unable to reach doctors at the other facilities.

Kahn said she was given conflicting answers about where to send the paperwork. She said a representative with the company recently told her it had not received any appeals from her.

Benefits statements Kahn received in early July show Innovative Partners had not paid the claims. The company did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said most health coverage plans take effect on the first day of the month after a customer enrolls.

""The insurance companies — for good reason — don't want people to wait to sign up for coverage until they are sick,"" she said, noting the premiums healthy people pay help balance the costs of paying for health care.

The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or heart issues. But that doesn't mean they have to pay for treatment of an injury sustained shortly before a person enrolls in coverage, she said.

Corlette, who reviewed a brief benefits overview provided by Kahn, said the policy appears to have been a limited, ""fixed indemnity"" plan, which would pay only set amounts toward treatments per day or other period regardless of total expenses incurred. Such plans have been around for decades and aren't required to meet ACA standards, she said.

But she said even if Kahn had bought comprehensive health insurance, it probably wouldn't have covered treatment received so soon after she purchased it.

David Shlim, a travel medicine specialist in Wyoming who studies rabies, said Kahn made the right choice by promptly seeking treatment, even though she didn't feel the bat bite her. The disease is deadly, and the fact that the bat went into her mouth meant she could have been infected from its saliva, he said: ""You could hardly have a more direct exposure than that.""

Shlim, who recently co-wrote a federal advisory about rabies prevention, added that healthy bats don't normally fly into people, as the one in this case did. The animal's entanglement with Kahn suggests it could have been sick, possibly with rabies, he said.

Rabies prevention treatment is much more expensive in the United States than in most other countries, Shlim said. The priciest part is immunoglobulin, which is made from the blood plasma of people who have been vaccinated against rabies.

The treatment is often administered in hospital emergency rooms, which add their own steep charges, Shlim noted.

Kahn said she is employed again and has good health insurance but is still facing most of the bills from her misadventure at Glen Canyon. She said she paid a doctor bill from Flagstaff Medical Center after negotiating it down from $706 to $420. She said she's also arranged a $10-a-month plan to pay off the $530 she owes for one of her rabies shots at another facility.

She said she plans to continue appealing the denials of payment for the rest of the bills, which total more than $19,000.

In a statement on behalf of the Flagstaff hospital — where Kahn incurred the highest charges — Lauren Silverstein, a spokesperson at Northern Arizona Healthcare, said the health system does what it can to limit costs. ""We have less ability to control the prices of critical supplies that we use to treat patients, including pharmaceuticals, biologics, diagnostics and medical devices made by other companies,"" she said.

Silverstein said the hospital needs to keep immunoglobulin on hand to prevent rabies, even though such cases are relatively rare and the drug is expensive.

COBRA insurance policies, named for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, enable many people who lose job-based coverage to pay to stay on those plans temporarily. There is a 60-day window to choose COBRA coverage, and once a beneficiary pays for it, the coverage applies retroactively — meaning that medical care is covered even if it occurred when the person was uninsured.

Corlette said Kahn's predicament illustrates why people need to make sure they have health insurance.

She said people who lose employer-based coverage should consider enrolling in individual insurance plans sold on federal or state marketplaces. Many people who buy such policies qualify for substantial ACA subsidies to help pay premiums and other costs.

""If you are losing your job, COBRA is not your only option,"" Corlette said.

Kahn wishes she had signed up for insurance coverage when she was laid off, even though she felt confident she would find another job within a few months. ""That's a very big lesson I learned the hard way,"" she said.

Her wildlife encounter did not destroy her love of the outdoors. She even sees humor in it.

""I know what bats taste like now. It's an earthy, sweet kind of flavor,"" she joked. ""It's actually a pretty funny story — if it weren't for the horrible medical bill that came with it.""

Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

T cell senescence occurs in the TME, affecting cancer prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy. The TME induces T cell senescence through multiple pathways, including persistent stimulation by tumor-associated antigens, metabolic pathway alterations, activation of chronic inflammatory responses, proliferation of immunosuppressive cells, and T cell damage caused by tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Senescent T cells exhibit characteristics such as genomic instability, protein imbalance, functional subgroup distribution and proportion imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction with metabolic disorders, and epigenetic changes. Additionally, in the TME, crosstalk between senescent T cells and other immune cells (such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic cells) further exacerbates the immunosuppressive TME, and these interactions also impair T cells' ability to recognize and monitor tumor antigens.

The presence of senescent T cells is often associated with poor prognosis and reduced immunotherapy efficacy. In many tumor models, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes show increased DNA damage and elevated SA-β-gal levels due to tumor progression, indicating that the TME contributes to driving T cell senescence and may lead to weakened immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) outcomes. Evidence suggests that CD28 signaling is a key intermediary limiting T cell responsiveness in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, incorporating immune senescence biomarkers may become predictive factors for ICI efficacy. Additionally, T cell senescence also weakens the effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy and cancer vaccines, and is even associated with immune-related adverse events. Therefore, breaking the immune senescence state in cancer patients is crucial for maintaining effective immune function after treatment.

This review systematically summarizes pathways that can improve T cell senescence states, including targeting senescence-associated key genes, regulating cell-cell interactions, intervening in cellular metabolism, modulating hormonal axis feedback, and protecting thymic function. Additionally, the review clarifies the differences between T cell senescence, exhaustion, and anergy, discusses the importance of precisely regulating immune senescence to avoid excessive or broad interventions that might drive tumor cell proliferation and invasion, proposes that accumulation of senescent unconventional T cells may also alter the tumor immune microenvironment, and explains the key role of current single-cell transcriptomics and cell trajectory modeling in locating T cell heterogeneity states.

New research shows that just 15 minutes of brisk walking a day can make a big difference in life expectancy for low-income and Black Americans, highlighting the power of simple habits to reduce health disparities.

Study: Daily walking and mortality in racially and socioeconomically diverse US adults. Image Credit: Oleg Elkov / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers explore how the duration and pace of daily walking are linked to cause-specific and overall mortality in predominantly Black and low-income American adults.

Sicker participants saw bigger drops: Individuals starting the study with more health problems, like high blood pressure or diabetes, experienced larger proportional reductions in death risk from brisk walking than healthier participants did.

Their findings indicate that brisk walking for as little as 15 minutes a day could reduce the risk of death by 20%, compared to a non-significant 4% reduction for those who walk slowly for more than three hours. Notably, the reduction associated with slow walking was not statistically significant. However, the study found that long durations of slow walking (over one hour daily) were associated with reduced mortality from ischemic heart disease, suggesting some benefit for those unable to walk briskly.

Risk reductions from fast walking were especially pronounced among individuals with pre-existing health conditions, although all participants benefited.

The study's questionnaire defined “fast walking” to include activities such as brisk walking, exercising, and stair climbing, which may overlap with other forms of physical activity.

Walking is widely acknowledged as a beneficial activity for longevity and overall health. Many studies have shown that aspects like walking frequency, speed, and number of steps are linked to lower mortality.

Brisk or moderate-intensity walking is particularly recommended by health organizations. Some studies also suggest that light-intensity walking can improve glucose and insulin levels, reduce blood pressure, and lower inflammation markers, although findings have been mixed.

Slow walking's limited role: The study found long periods of slow walking only showed a potential benefit for reducing ischemic heart disease deaths; its impact on overall survival remained unclear.

One recent study showed older adults who engaged in over 1.5 hours of light activity daily had a 30% reduction in mortality, though walking specifically was not analyzed.

However, most existing research has focused on higher-income, predominantly white populations. This limits our understanding of walking's benefits in low-income groups, especially among Black individuals who may face barriers such as higher substance use rates, poor diet, limited access to healthcare, and unsafe neighborhoods.

These conditions can increase health risks and mortality, potentially explaining some racial disparities in life expectancy. Few extensive, long-term studies have evaluated how walking habits affect mortality in these underserved populations.

This study addresses that gap by using data from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), which includes a large number of low-income and Black participants, to investigate links between walking and mortality.

Researchers used data from the SCCS, which enrolled nearly 85,000 people between the ages of 40 and 79 between 2002 and 2009. Most participants were low-income and recruited from community health centers across 12 southeastern U.S. states.

Combining paces matters: People who walked slowly and added even small amounts of brisk walking saw better survival rates compared to those who only walked slowly.

Baseline data on demographics, health history, lifestyle, and walking habits were collected through structured questionnaires. For this analysis, individuals who died within two years or had missing walking data were excluded, resulting in a final sample of nearly 80,000 participants.

Participants reported how much time they spent walking slowly and fast each day. These durations were grouped into four categories: none, less than 30 minutes, 30–60 minutes, and more than 60 minutes.

The researchers also considered lifestyle factors such as diet quality, sedentary behavior, physical activity, alcohol use, and smoking to create a composite lifestyle score. This score was based on regression coefficients associated with mortality risk. Mortality data (cause and date of death) were obtained via linkage to the National Death Index up to the end of 2022.

Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess how walking pace and duration related to mortality risk, adjusting for various demographic, behavioral, and health-related factors.

During a median follow-up of nearly 17 years, over 26,800 deaths occurred among the 79,856 participants. Roughly half reported no fast walking, and about one-third reported more than three hours of slow walking daily.

Fast walking showed a clear association with reduced all-cause mortality. Just 15 minutes per day of fast walking was linked to a 19% lower mortality risk compared to no fast walking.

Fast walking's strongest link: While protecting against various causes of death, fast walking showed its most powerful association with preventing deaths specifically from heart failure.

This relationship remained significant even after adjusting for lifestyle and health factors. In contrast, slow walking showed only a small, statistically non-significant 4% reduction in mortality even at higher durations.

Fast walking was associated with lower risks of death from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, and other causes, with the most substantial benefits observed for CVD, especially heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Long durations of slow walking (over one hour per day) were linked to reduced mortality from ischemic heart disease, providing some benefit for those who cannot walk briskly.

Stratified analyses suggested stronger effects among people with higher income and those who did not smoke, though benefits were observed across all subgroups. However, the magnitude of mortality reduction was generally comparable across most subgroups. Additional fast walking further reduced mortality among those already walking slowly.

The benefits were independent of other leisure-time physical activity levels, suggesting that even short bouts of brisk walking can provide health benefits regardless of broader exercise routines. Risk reduction from fast walking was especially notable among those with baseline comorbidities, although benefits were seen for all participants.

This large, long-term study found that fast walking was consistently linked to lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality, especially from cardiovascular diseases, in a predominantly low-income and Black population.

Even just 15 minutes of fast walking daily led to meaningful reductions in death risk. The findings highlight fast walking as a low-cost, accessible way to improve health in underserved communities.

Strengths include the large sample size, long follow-up, and focus on an underrepresented population. However, walking data were self-reported and may include other activities such as stair climbing, and physical activity was only measured at baseline, which may introduce inaccuracies or overlook changes over time. Despite these limitations, results remained stable in sensitivity analyses.

In conclusion, promoting brisk walking, even for short durations, could be a powerful strategy to reduce mortality and improve public health equity. Targeted interventions that address barriers such as safety and poor infrastructure may help make fast walking more accessible in disadvantaged communities.

Young, helmetless, and often under the influence, stand-up e-scooter riders are landing in Helsinki emergency rooms at much higher rates than cyclists, spotlighting urgent safety gaps in urban mobility.

Study: Comparing the characteristics of electric scooter and bicycle injuries: a retrospective cohort study. Image Credit: Andrey_Popov / Shuttertock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, a group of researchers quantified and contrasted the incidence, severity, and risk factors of stand-up electric scooter (e-scooter) and bicycle injuries.

Picture a Friday night downtown: neon lights flash, rideshares queue, and wheels buzz past traffic. Micromobility keeps streets moving, yet prior studies estimate about 10 riders in every 100,000 land in an emergency department (ED) after a stand-up e-scooter spin, but the Helsinki-specific rate was 7.8 per 100,000 trips. This is about triple the toll for bicycles. Unlike cars, these platforms offer no crumple zone; the rider is the bumper.

Younger adults, late-night trips, alcohol, and helmets left at home create a risky mix. Knowing how scooter crashes differ from bicycle crashes can guide speed caps, safety campaigns, and lanes. Further research must confirm which measures truly flatten the injury curve.

Small wheels, big falls: E-scooter riders' foot positioning close to the ground might let them bail faster, possibly explaining fewer arm fractures than cyclists who often brace with outstretched hands.

The team conducted a cohort analysis of stand-up e-scooter and bicycle injuries treated in three EDs between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. Anonymized cases were mined with keyword searches from the hospital data pool, and records were screened to confirm a crash. Age, sex, timing, helmet use, alcohol testing, and injury details were abstracted. The most severe lesion was coded with the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS), and the composite New Injury Severity Score (NISS) captured trauma burden.

Usage denominators came from two sources: trip logs supplied by the Vianova Cityscope service for shared scooters and survey-derived estimates of cycling trips. Injury incidence per 100,000 trips and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed.

Continuous variables with a Gaussian distribution are reported as means and standard deviation (SD); proportions are given as counts and percentages. Statistical comparisons employed Fisher's exact, chi-squared (χ²), or Student's t tests as appropriate, with significance set at 0.05. Analyses followed the STROBE checklist and were executed in SPSS version 29. The hospital research committee approved the protocol and waived informed consent, and all procedures complied with local regulations.

Intoxication's clear link to head trauma: When riders were drunk, head injuries spiked to 76% for e-scooter users and 63% for cyclists, showing alcohol drastically raises crash severity.

In the two-year window, EDs treated 677 stand-up e-scooter riders and 1,889 cyclists for crash-related trauma. Mean age: 33 ± 13 versus 47 ± 17 years; males constituted 64% and 59%, respectively. Helmet adoption was scarce among scooter riders, just 29 individuals (4%), contrasting with 522 helmeted cyclists (28%). Alcohol played a major role, as tests and notes indicated intoxication in 29% of scooter riders versus 8% of cyclists.

Linking injuries to exposure revealed a sharper disparity. Shared scooter logs recorded 8.06 million trips, yielding an ED incidence of 7.8 injuries per 100,000 trips. Survey-based estimates suggested 82.98 million cycling trips, corresponding to 2.2 injuries per 100,000 outings. The resulting RR for scooter travel was 3.6 (95% CI: 3.3–3.9), underscoring a risk more than triple that of bicycling.

Injury patterns also diverged, as head and neck trauma occurred in 46% of scooter crashes compared with 31% of bicycle crashes, while cyclists bore more upper extremity (45%) and torso (11%) injuries. Craniofacial fractures were the archetypal scooter break (12%), whereas wrist and hand fractures dominated cycling injuries (9%). The AIS distribution skewed mildly for both modes, yet scooters had a slightly higher share of serious wounds (10% versus 8%). The single critical scooter case involved diffuse axonal injury (DAI), whereas one cyclist experienced multiple intracranial hemorrhages.

Resource consumption reflected these profiles. Eight scooter riders (1.2%) required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), seven with head trauma and six who were intoxicated. Cyclists registered 12 ICU stays (0.6%). Operative management was more common after cycling crashes (13%) than scooter crashes (8%), largely because orthopedic teams plated fractured wrists, clavicles, and ribs. Overall, inpatient admission rates were low, yet cyclists again edged scooters (9.8% versus 8.1%).

Sixty-nine percent of cycling accidents occurred between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m., while 60% of scooter accidents occurred during these hours, and 40% occurred overnight. Half of the nighttime scooter crashes involved alcohol, compared with one-fifth of nocturnal cycling crashes. Among intoxicated riders, helmet use was rare. Despite a 15 km/h night limit on rentals since 2021, summer evenings still produced dense clusters of alcohol-linked head injuries among commuters. This trend persisted across seasons and facilities.

Most injuries weren't major: Over half the injuries for both groups were minor scrapes or sprains (AIS 1), though e-scooters had slightly more serious wounds overall.

To summarize, this comparative analysis indicates that stand-up e-scooter travel currently carries a higher injury burden than traditional cycling. Scooter riders were younger, more often intoxicated, seldom helmeted, and especially vulnerable to head trauma, whereas cyclists primarily injured arms and torso but required more surgery.

Even with speed caps, the RR remained 3.6, suggesting that behavior, not technology, drives harm. Municipalities should prioritize helmet campaigns, integrate alcohol checks into rental apps, and consider further nighttime restrictions.

Future prospective studies should test whether such interventions, together with redesigned lanes, reduce ED visits and ICU admissions. As with all retrospective observational studies, caution is advised when interpreting causality, and incomplete or missing data may influence findings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Cancer cells use energy surge to survive physical squeezing","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250731/Cancer-cells-use-energy-surge-to-survive-physical-squeezing.aspx","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 11:05:00 GMT","

Cancer cells mount an instant, energy‑rich response to being physically squeezed, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. The surge of energy is the first reported instance of a defensive mechanism which helps the cells repair DNA damage and survive the crowded environments of the human body.

The findings help explain how cancer cells survive complex mechanical gauntlets like crawling through a tumour microenvironment, sliding into porous blood vessels or enduring the battering of the bloodstream. The discovery of the mechanism can lead to new strategies which pin cancer cells down before they spread.

Researchers at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona made the discovery using a specialized microscope that can compress living cells to just three microns wide, about one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair. They observed that, that, within seconds of being squeezed, mitochondria in HeLA cells race to the surface of the nucleus and pump in extra ATP, the molecular energy source of cells.

It forces us to rethink the role of mitochondria in the human body. They aren't these static batteries powering our cells, but more like agile first responders that can be summoned in emergency situations when cells are literally pressed to the limit.""

Dr. Sara Sdelci, co-corresponding author of the study

The mitochondria formed a halo so tight that the nucleus dimpled inward. The phenomenon was observed in 84 percent of confined HeLa cancer cells, compared with virtually none in floating, uncompressed cells. The researchers refer to the structures ""NAMs,"" for nucleus-associated mitochondria.

To find out what NAMs did, the researchers deployed a fluorescent sensor that lights up when ATP enters the nucleus. The signal soared by around 60 percent within three seconds of the cells being squeezed. ""It's a clear sign the cells are adapting to the strain and rewiring their metabolism,"" says Dr. Fabio Pezzano, co-first author of the study.

Subsequent experiments revealed why the power surge matters. Mechanical squeezing puts DNA under stress, snapping strands and tangling the human genome. Cells rely on ATP-hungry repair crews to loosen DNA and reach broken sites to mend the damage. Squeezed cells that received the extra boost of ATP repaired DNA within hours, while those without stopped dividing properly.

To confirm relevance for disease, the researchers also examined breast‑tumour biopsies from 17 patients. The NAM halos appeared in 5.4 percent of nuclei at invasive tumour fronts versus 1.8 percent in the dense tumour core, a three‑fold difference. ""Seeing this signature in patient biopsies convinced us of the relevance beyond the lab bench,"" explains Dr. Ritobrata (Rito) Ghose, co-first author of the study.

The researchers were also able to study the cellular engineering which makes the mitochondrial rush possible. Actin filaments, the same protein cables that let muscles flex, compound around the nucleus, while the endoplasmic reticulum throws a mesh-like net. The combined scaffold, the study shows, physically traps the NAMs in place, forming the halo-like structure. When the researchers treated cells with latrunculin A, a drug that dismantles actin, NAM formation collapsed and the ATP tide receded.

If metastatic cells depend on NAM-driven ATP surges, drugs that block the scaffold could make tumours less invasive without broadly poisoning mitochondria and sparing healthy tissues. ""Mechanical stress responses are an underexplored vulnerability of cancer cells that can open new therapeutic avenues,"" says Dr. Verena Ruprecht, co-corresponding author of the study.

While the study looked at cancer cells, the authors of the study stress the phenomenon is likely a universal phenomenon in biology. Immune cells squeezing through lymph nodes, neurons extending branches, and embryonic cells during morphogenesis all experience similar physical forces.

""Wherever cells are under pressure, a nuclear energy boost is likely safeguarding the integrity of the genome,"" concludes Dr. Sdelci. ""It's a completely new layer of regulation in cell biology, marking a fundamental shift in our understanding of how cells survive intense periods of physical stress.""

Filed under:

Was the youngster's attitude a problem in the United States?

Sky Germany journalists Kerry Hau and Torben Hoffmann recently discussed the transfer of of former Bayern Munich left-back Adam Aznou on the latest of edition of their “Mia san vier” Podcast.

Per the reporters (as published on Sky Germany's website), there were some issues with Aznou during the team's stay in the United States for the Club World Cup: 

FC Bayern have complied with Adam Aznou's express wish to move to Everton FC. The 19-year-old full-back has been vehemently pushing for a departure in recent weeks after playing just eight minutes at the Club World Cup.

Max Eberl made a telling statement in the record champions' official press release. Although the club regrets his departure, the sporting director explained: “In general, the door is open to anyone who gives their all every day to achieve our common goals to establish themselves permanently with FC Bayern's professional squad.”

The Moroccan international is said to have stopped doing this recently. “We heard from several sources that he let himself down in training during the Club World Cup and no longer showed the attitude that is needed at FC Bayern,” report Sky Sport reporters Kerry Hau and Torben Hoffmann in the latest episode of the FCB podcast Mia san vier.

Vincent Kompany and his coaching team are even said to have been disappointed with Aznou's behavior. “If there's one thing Kompany doesn't like, it's when players drag their feet in training — and perhaps think a little too highly of themselves.”

Hau, though, made it a point to state that Aznou could have been disappointed by the lack of an opportunity presented by Bayern Munich, even with the injuries to Alphonso Davies and Hiroki Itō:

However, Hau also has sympathy for Aznou. After all, promises were made to the player by those responsible that could not be kept. Former Bundesliga professional Hoffmann, on the other hand, clearly takes Aznou to task: “Talent alone is simply not enough. You have to be at 100 percent in every training session. Not even at 93, not even at 80. (...) These are mistakes that many boys make at that age.”

The Bayern reporters concluded: “In the end, all sides are probably relatively happy that this separation has taken place and the issue is over.” According to Hau, however, Eberl could have spared himself the parting words towards Aznou: “I don't think that's the smart thing to do. (...) He certainly wouldn't have said that if the player had been loaned out.”

Aznou, of course, has made the move to Everton with a chance for a fresh start. Hopefully, the youngster can regroup and be prepared to take advantage of this chance to break into first team football.

Manchester United continue to explore goalkeeper upgrades, with the club reportedly reaching out to Paris Saint-Germain about the availability of Gianluigi Donnarumma.

The club lodged an enquiry with the Champions League winners earlier in the transfer window and remain interested in a potential deal, The Telegraph reports.

PSG are pursuing Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier and seem informed that United could return for Donnarumma if that deal comes to fruition. 

The Itay international starred in goal for PSG on the road to their first ever Champions League trophy last season. Donnarumma has just 12 months left on his contract and the club are thought to be open to selling for the right price, but would be equally happy to keep him.

Manchester United's troubled goalkeeper situation is well documented. Former manager Erik ten Hag cut David de Gea loose in 2023, bringing in his old Ajax player André Onana. The Cameroonian has struggled since arriving in England and Ruben Amorim could look to move on from him this summer. The Red Devils also had interest in Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, even submitting a loan bid. But Villa are thought to be only interested in a permanent deal.

Royal Antwerp and Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also been linked with an Old Trafford move this summer, with the player publicly confirming interest in a potential switch. 

Onana is recovering from a hamstring injury, forcing him to miss the ongoing Premier League Summer Series tour in the United States. Amorim has started both Altay Bayındır and Tom Heaton in their first two games, with the former likely to close things out in Atlanta on August 3. 

Onana is racing to be fit for the Premier League opener against Arsenal on August 17, but if things fall into place he may not be the starter for very much longer.

The son of United States President Donald Trump has made a bizarre claim about his father's encounter with Chelsea at the FIFA Club World Cup


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Donald Trump's son has made a bizarre Chelsea claim, following the US president's appearance on stage with the Blues.

Trump Snr. arrived on stage as Club World Cup champions Chelsea were presented with the trophy, alongside high-profile FIFA figure Gianni Infantino.

The scene went viral and made headlines as Chelsea's players mingled with the controversial politician.



In a new interview with the BBC, Eric Trump, the President's son, has claimed that Chelsea's players requested Trump's presence on stage at the trophy lift.

""Listen, he's the commander-in-chief of the United States of America and in terms of FIFA, the winning team invited him to the stage because they said it would be the greatest honour of their life if the President of the United States could present the Club World Cup trophy to the team.



""By the way, I was there, I was watching it. The place went crazy. There's no-one who's done more for sport than him and I think in time that will be rewarded, I truly do,"" Trump Jnr. said.

As Trump appeared on stage ahead of Chelsea's presentation, it appeared as though large sections of the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey took to booing the President, contrary to Trump Jnr's claim.

North America will host next year's FIFA World Cup with the United States playing a central part in the revamped 48-team tournament.

Eleven of the 16 planned host stadiums are situated in the US, with three in Mexico and two in Canada.



Trump's second term as President runs until 2028 meaning he will still be in office at the time of the tournament next summer and likely front-and-centre of proceedings at the opening and closing ceremonies.

The 79-year-old was shepherded onto the stage by FIFA President Infantino after Chelsea's Club World Cup Final victory over Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month.

Trump and Infantino then jointly presented the trophy to Chelsea skipper Reece James, before the President shared a joke with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, urging James to lift the prize.

Whilst Infantino exited stage right, taking up a position on the periphery of Chelsea's celebrations, Trump remained beside James as Chelsea's players jubilated behind him. Infantino promptly joined the President as the Blues' squad gradually filtered in front of the statesman.

A close-up clip of Cole Palmer's reaction went viral on social media as the Chelsea playmaker's facial expression appeared to question why Trump was involved in the Club World Cup trophy presentation.

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) said that its BOD has “approved the extension of the trial” of referee body cameras for “broadcast purposes to worldwide domestic and international competitions” following “successful tests” at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, according to Dan Sheldon of THE ATHLETIC. Other competitions “wishing to participate in the trial and implement referee body cameras must seek permission” from IFAB and FIFA to do so. This is a “similar process” to the introduction of “previous new officiating measures,” such as in-stadium VAR announcements. The implementation of the technology in the Premier League for the 2025-26 season is “under consideration.” The NWSL, meanwhile, has “shown interest in implementing the technology but is still exploring how it may work in practice” (THE ATHLETIC, 7/30).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

EPL

Levi Colwill was enjoying a much-earned holiday in Trinidad before cutting it short to attend a pre-season friendly between non-league Sholing FC and Chelsea Under-18s last Saturday.

“I had a manic journey to get here,” he tells The Athletic. “I missed a connecting flight in Miami due to the airline. I had to find another plane to get me to Paris and then from there to London. I was travelling for over 24 hours, but I wanted to get back for this.”

Those unaware of Colwill's affinity to Sholing FC, who play in the Southern League Premier Division South (the seventh tier of English football), may be wondering why the centre-half would be prepared to do such a thing. Colwill's summer break began less than two weeks earlier due to being part of the Chelsea side that beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 to win the Club World Cup on July 13.

But Colwill is driven by a desire to help children. The Athletic was last at Sholing FC in December when an open trial was held to find recruits for the new Levi Colwill Academy (LSC Academy), which officially gets under way in September. As revealed back then, the 22-year-old has also funded the cost of a new 3G pitch for the club, and Saturday's fixture against Chelsea was the grand opening for the new playing surface.

A club record 1,888 were in attendance. At half-time, a proud Colwill walked round the pitch with some of the youngsters who will make up the first class at the LSC Academy.

“Being here was a priority for me,” Colwill says. “A lot of hard work has been put in, not just from me, but from my family. We know how much this is going to help the LSC Academy, too. I am so excited to launch it — everything around it is so positive. I couldn't not be here. This is one of the best days of my life; the turnout has been amazing.

“When I was walking round with the academy boys on the pitch at half-time, it just felt so good. You could see all the people having a good time, greeting us as we went round. It just felt all part of the plan to give something back, but it is just the start.”

Colwill's connection to Sholing FC, which is on the outskirts of Southampton, is an understandable one. He grew up nearby, and his uncles have played for the club. One of them, Daniel Mason, scored a superb free kick to help his side beat Chelsea's youngsters 2-0 on the day, a goal which brought a huge smile to Colwill's face.

“It's not just about Sholing FC,” Colwill insists. “I want to help as many underprivileged kids as possible. I thought to myself, ‘How am I going to do that?'. Football is all I know. I grew up as an underprivileged kid. I came to Sholing FC games and enjoyed them. It made me happy and made me want to become a footballer.

“If I can help bring a load of kids to come down to an event like this, to enjoy being here, to fall in love with the game, that can change their lives. They can perhaps do something else rather than being on the streets. That's the main reason.

“I went into the dressing room after the game and thanked the players because there are so many kids out there who have not been as lucky as me. Life could have been different for me, so if I can help as many as possible, give them a new ambition to aim for, that's what I want to do in life.

“I also did something when I was on holiday in Trinidad. I organised a training session out there with some kids who were all from my grandma's local area. My nan flew out with me. A few hundred people turned up. We bought the goals and so on out of my back pocket, just to give them something else to enjoy. Doing this drives me. I want to leave a legacy and have people be proud of me.”

No one should be concerned about the off-the-pitch endeavours being a negative distraction for Colwill. For example, several people are working at the LSC Academy, which is run by his uncle Daniel with the support of first-team coach Ross White.

Colwill adds: “We have a group chat on WhatsApp with me, my uncles and the staff. They are the ones doing things on a day-to-day basis. I want to know what's going on and will say something if I need to, but I have full trust in them because they are really good people.

“If one of the players goes on from the academy to have a pro career at any level, it would mean as much as things I have done myself. If I have influenced them to do that, hopefully they will do something similar when they get older and help the kids in their community, too. That's all I want, to build a chain of giving back and helping.”

Colwill is used to being asked for autographs and selfies when he attends Sholing FC matches, but this seems like another level. He is inundated with requests throughout the afternoon and does hundreds with a grin on his face. Perhaps it is not that surprising that hundreds approach him, with Chelsea supporters also in attendance. But you suspect being a world champion has boosted his profile even further.

He will return, like the rest of Chelsea's senior squad, to pre-season training next week, but the success enjoyed in America this month has already been consigned to the past.

When asked how he feels to be called a world champion, he replies: “It doesn't feel real. It's not like I sit there and think, ‘Ah, we won this and that'. I have realised that when you win things, life doesn't change. My goal is to win as many things as possible, so I am not going to be hung up on this. I need to move on and plan for the next.

“This is a feeling shared in the dressing room. We have an elite mindset in our team, and this is what we need to do. The Premier League restarts in less than a month, and we need to start preparing for that.”

Few gave Chelsea a chance of beating Champions League holders PSG in the final. In many ways, you could understand why. The Ligue 1 side had put six goals (combined) past Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the previous two rounds without conceding a goal.

Being written off proved great motivation. Chelsea swept PSG aside with a style of football that should ensure they will be taken a lot more seriously in future.

Finishing the season with 14 wins from 16 games also showed a sustained level of consistency for the first time since the Todd Boehly-Clearlake consortium took over in 2022. It also helped them secure a top-four finish in the Premier League and the Conference League trophy.

Colwill believes it is a good sign that a corner has been turned, but suggests a lack of credit from outside of Stamford Bridge will also continue to drive the players on as they try to compete for a first league title since 2017.

He continues: “We had ups and downs like a lot of teams last season. We still stayed around the top four and were never miles behind. With the fans, we really went all together and just pushed. When that happens, I feel something just lights up and you just win, win, win. That's what we were doing in the Premier League, then we won the Conference League and headed into the Club World Cup with that mindset.

“But it felt like no one thought we had half a chance, even in the final, and I thought that was very disrespectful. All the questions before the game were based on, ‘You're not stopping PSG'. I am not complaining. It gave us that fire in the belly, and we proved everyone wrong.

“It does feel like there are not many people who respect us out there. We have been using it and will continue to do so. It might change now that we are world champions, we don't know. But we are going into games feeling like we have a point to prove. It gives us that extra one per cent, which can make a huge difference.

“Do I think teams will target a win over Chelsea even more so that they can say they have beaten the world champions? Definitely, but that is not a bad thing. They will give us respect. But we have to always be on it; our mindset has to be that we have to win every game.

“We feel like we can definitely compete for the Premier League. The players we have in our squad are among the best, and we are really excited for this season, to once again prove people wrong.”

The prospect of playing in the Champions League for the first time in his career is something he is particularly looking forward to. “When that anthem comes on, it is going to be a dream. I could get a bit emotional, to be honest,” he admits.

“I went to watch many Champions League games at Stamford Bridge when I was younger. I have walked out with the flags waving against Barcelona. Many kids dream of playing in the Champions League, so it doesn't feel real that I am about to. It's going to be amazing.

“When you hear that song, it just makes your hair stand up on your neck. No matter where you are, if you hear that tune, you know it's the Champions League. It's so special.”

And with that, Colwill left to enjoy the last few days of his holiday before the hard work begins all over again. He has certainly earned it.

Could the United States host the event in 2029? It's not out of the question, but these nations have also thrown their name into the ring

Fans of the FIFA Club World Cup will need to wait another four years before the spectacle returns — and it very well could return to the United States. 

It's believed in FIFA's continued efforts to attract more American sponsorships and grow the game here, it's not inconceivable to think the U.S. could receive the tournament yet again after hosting this year. 

However, as a result of other nations have watched the success of the revamped tournament here in America, FIFA does have suitors lining up to serve as host nation, with some countries partnering up to do joint bids. 

Here's a look at a few of those nations and why the idea of going there is appealing, or not, when it comes to bringing the fervor the later stages of the event in the States brought. 

As hosts of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and with the infrastructure already in place, Brazil is an appealing destination for 2029. Helping their case was the traveling fandom three clubs in Fluminense, Botafogo and Flamengo brought to this year's tournament. 

It would be a good look for CONMEBOL too, considering it would make for an ultra-competitive push from teams that have aspirations of collecting what could be at minimum another share of a $1 billion purse. Brazil has been successful too at hosting various FIFA tournaments, and could prove its ready to welcome the world with success at the 2027 FIFA women's World Cup. 

Both nations have expressed interest and FIFA has recent history of success coming off the 2023 Women's World Cup, which was one of the most watched women's tournaments of all-time. Having it there could continue to bolster soccer as a major sport in Australia, which like the United States has a hard time garnering mass appeal due to more popular sporting events. 

It's been reported that in efforts to strengthen the commitment, New Zealand would considering partnering up once more just as it did to secure the women's World Cup bid two years ago. 

Planning for FIFA's marquee event in 2022, gives Qatar a bit of a leg up to host the Club World Cup given there's infrastructure that would still be less than a decade old in multiple locations across the nation. However, the one issue is the heat, which has been a major sticking point with teams and players alike, coming off the tournament here in the States, amid what's been oppressive heat across many parts of the country. 

Qatar found success in building climate-controlled arenas, but what really helped its case was moving the 2022 World Cup to the winter months to combat summer temperatures that could reach up to 112 degrees by day. Would FIFA be OK with weaving the tournament into a club calendar that runs from August-May for much of the world's teams is the question. 

Just like this year's event was a tune-up for the larger FIFA World Cup next summer, these three countries all linked by train, would look to dual hosts, after being awarded the 2030 FIFA World Cup. 

Much like here, it could serve as a litmus test for all three to understand how it would effectively work, with everything from tourism, transportation and hospitality. It's not out of the question, considering that viewers got an opportunity to see the passion from fans of Morocco's Wydad AC, who traveled throughout the East Coast in support of the team with songs, smoke and in some cases, flares.

Donald Trump is reportedly thinking banning visas for one major nation ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

In less than a year, the 2026 World Cup will get underway, with the major tournament set to be hosted across the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

The historic competition will be the first World Cup to be take part in three countries, with the US hosting the majority of the matches across 11 different stadiums, including the MetLife Stadium which will host the final on July 19.

A total of 48 different countries will compete in the 2026 World Cup, millions of fans will fly in to support their sides in the biggest event of the football calendar.

But now, the attendance of fans of one major country has been cast into doubt as US President Trump is reportedly considering banning their visas in the build up to the World Cup.

As it stands, Brazil are joint favourites  to win the World Cup next year, alongside France and England, but fans hoping to support the South American side might not be able to travel over for matches in the USA.

According to a report from CNN, President Trump is considering the possibility of banning visas for Brazilians, including during the World Cup.

Advert

It is believed to be Trump's hope that doing so would have an impact on Brazilian public opinion against the country's current government, something he has recently influenced with tariff hikes.

Journalist Lourival Sant'Anna claims that some of the increased visa restrictions for Brazilian citizens have already started being implemented ahead of senators' mission to Washington this week.

He claims that the politicians had to deal with much more restricted visas that limited the number of days they could stay in America.

Advert

Both FIFA and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) are yet to comment on the report,  but it is claimed that the governing body is aware of the possibility, but is waiting for further developments before considering taking any action.

They are also said to be considering holding meetings with the Federal Government to resolve any issues regarding potential sanctions against fans in the United States.

In June, Trump signed a order that banned travel to the US from several countries, meaning citizens from these nations cannot enter the United States for the foreseeable future.

Advert

One of the countries impacted by this is Iran, who became the second team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup back in March.

But, as it stands, the national team will be able to enter the US next summer, but fans and, and potentially the media, will not.

Premium hospitality prices for one of Boston's five group stage games or its Round of 32 game in the 2026 FIFA World Cup “start at $1,900 and top out at $3,900, depending on the game and what type of lounge level” fans want to experience, according to Michael Silverman of the BOSTON GLOBE. To attend all seven games at Gillette Stadium, it would cost “between the standard Champions Club rate of $14,600 up to the ‘Pitchside Lounge Standard +' rate of $26,700.” FIFA is currently offering three hospitality packages -- “single-match tickets, series tickets for every game played at one stadium, and a ‘Follow My Team' package for a non-North American team's three group stage games and first elimination game in the Round of 32.” FIFA will release the “first batch of tickets up for sale to the public” on September 10, though it has not yet announced how much those tickets will cost. As the September date approaches, FIFA said that it will “announce step-by-step details on how to buy tickets.” As “vague as that sounds,” FIFA is creating a “distinct vibe that demand will exceed supply.” By registering interest in buying tickets online, fans will be “included in a random draw for the chance to buy tickets.” A person selected “will be assigned a specific time slot to purchase tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.” All ticket sales will be “handled online.” More information about “another ticket tranche will be released” in December around when FIFA “conducts the draw that will determine which non-North American teams will play in which of the 16 host cities” (BOSTON GLOBE, 7/30).

IN THE NORTH: The CP's Neil Davidson noted Canada Soccer's “revamped fan membership program” relaunched yesterday, “opening the door to its ticket allotment for Canada's games” at the World Cup. Fans “have to be a member of the CanadaRED program to be part of the ticket lottery.” The new program is an “expanded version of the one used to distribute Canada game tickets at the 2022 tournament in Qatar.” There are “seven tiers, ranging from free to $5,000 a year, with tax receipts available for the charitable component of each contribution.” A separate lottery will be “held for each of Canada's matches, with an equal number of tickets assigned to a draw at each CanadaRED tier.” Members unsuccessful in the lottery at their level “become eligible for the lottery at lower tiers.” So the “higher the tier, the better the odds of getting a ticket -- and the more perks.” Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue said that the revamped program is “part of the organization's fundraising efforts.” Canada Soccer noted that it “currently has a little more than 100,000 members across the three tiers” (CP, 7/29).

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, football fans around the world are starting to look for information about tickets for the opening match, which will take place in Mexico at the legendary Estadio Azteca —now known as Estadio Banorte— on Thursday, June 11, 2026. One of the top Google Trends questions is: How much does the cheapest ticket cost to attend the 2026 World Cup opening match?

The first thing you should know is that FIFA has not yet released individual ticket sales for the opening match. For now, the only way to get a ticket to the opening match is by purchasing a hospitality package called Venue Series, which includes tickets for all five matches to be played at Estadio Azteca and premium services such as food, drinks, VIP lounges, and personalized service.

This means that you cannot purchase a standalone ticket for the opening match. All available categories include this game as part of a full package.

According to the official sales system from On Location, the authorized FIFA Hospitality operator, the cheapest ticket for the opening match is part of the FIFA Pavilion Standard package, which includes entry to the five matches scheduled at Estadio Azteca.

In this package, the estimated cost of the opening match —based on the official cart breakdown— is:

It is important to note that you cannot purchase only the June 11 ticket. This price is part of a complete package with the following features:

The full price of the FIFA Pavilion Standard package, which includes all five matches, is:

FIFA has announced that registration for general ticket sales without hospitality will open in September 2025.

The 2026 opening match will mark a historic milestone: the Estadio Azteca will become the first stadium in the world to host three World Cup openers (1970, 1986, and now 2026). This prestige has increased demand and interest in attending this match, making its tickets the most sought-after of the tournament.

Before talking about prices, it's important to remember that the Estadio Azteca, or Estadio Banorte, will host five matches in total during the 2026 World Cup:

This makes Azteca the Mexican stadium with the most assigned matches, ahead of Estadio Akron in Guadalajara (4 group stage matches) and Estadio BBVA in Monterrey (3 group matches and one Round of 32).

Could the United States host the event in 2029? It's not out of the question, but these nations have also thrown their name into the ring

Fans of the FIFA Club World Cup will need to wait another four years before the spectacle returns — and it very well could return to the United States. 

It's believed in FIFA's continued efforts to attract more American sponsorships and grow the game here, it's not inconceivable to think the U.S. could receive the tournament yet again after hosting this year. 

However, as a result of other nations have watched the success of the revamped tournament here in America, FIFA does have suitors lining up to serve as host nation, with some countries partnering up to do joint bids. 

Here's a look at a few of those nations and why the idea of going there is appealing, or not, when it comes to bringing the fervor the later stages of the event in the States brought. 

As hosts of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and with the infrastructure already in place, Brazil is an appealing destination for 2029. Helping their case was the traveling fandom three clubs in Fluminense, Botafogo and Flamengo brought to this year's tournament. 

It would be a good look for CONMEBOL too, considering it would make for an ultra-competitive push from teams that have aspirations of collecting what could be at minimum another share of a $1 billion purse. Brazil has been successful too at hosting various FIFA tournaments, and could prove its ready to welcome the world with success at the 2027 FIFA women's World Cup. 

Both nations have expressed interest and FIFA has recent history of success coming off the 2023 Women's World Cup, which was one of the most watched women's tournaments of all-time. Having it there could continue to bolster soccer as a major sport in Australia, which like the United States has a hard time garnering mass appeal due to more popular sporting events. 

It's been reported that in efforts to strengthen the commitment, New Zealand would considering partnering up once more just as it did to secure the women's World Cup bid two years ago. 

Planning for FIFA's marquee event in 2022, gives Qatar a bit of a leg up to host the Club World Cup given there's infrastructure that would still be less than a decade old in multiple locations across the nation. However, the one issue is the heat, which has been a major sticking point with teams and players alike, coming off the tournament here in the States, amid what's been oppressive heat across many parts of the country. 

Qatar found success in building climate-controlled arenas, but what really helped its case was moving the 2022 World Cup to the winter months to combat summer temperatures that could reach up to 112 degrees by day. Would FIFA be OK with weaving the tournament into a club calendar that runs from August-May for much of the world's teams is the question. 

Just like this year's event was a tune-up for the larger FIFA World Cup next summer, these three countries all linked by train, would look to dual hosts, after being awarded the 2030 FIFA World Cup. 

Much like here, it could serve as a litmus test for all three to understand how it would effectively work, with everything from tourism, transportation and hospitality. It's not out of the question, considering that viewers got an opportunity to see the passion from fans of Morocco's Wydad AC, who traveled throughout the East Coast in support of the team with songs, smoke and in some cases, flares.

The Red Devils have moved to the front of the queue to sign the RB Leipzig hitman, who models himself on Erling Haaland and Zlatan Ibrahimovic

Manchester United first set their eyes upon Benjamin Sesko when he was 16 years old, and even had the chance to snap him up for a pittance. They didn't take it, instead leaving Red Bull Salzburg to sign the Slovenian teenager in the summer of 2019 for just €2.5 million.

In Erik ten Hag's first summer in charge in 2022, meanwhile, the Red Devils had another look at Sesko, but again balked at the price, which had by then risen to €24m for a player who had only one season of top-flight football under his belt in the Austrian Bundesliga. Instead, Sesko agreed to jump ship to fellow Red Bull franchise RB Leipzig, although he did not make the move until the following year, which is when United signed Rasmus Hojlund for up to £72m.

To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to miss out on a promising and prolific striker once may be regarded as a misfortune, to miss out twice looks like carelessness. But six years after first failing to sign the player once billed as the next Erling Haaland, United look determined to bring Sesko to Old Trafford at the third time of asking. 

The club have organised a secret trip to Germany, led by head of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who brought Sesko to Leipzig when he was the Bundesliga side's technical director, to try and get the deal done. And in typical United fashion, they are set to pay a huge price for their earlier indecision, with Leipzig expected to demand at least €80m (£69m/$91.5m) for the 22-year-old, who is also being pursued by Newcastle.

Yet despite the big fee and some concern that United could be about to make the same mistake they made with Hojlund by signing a costly 'project' in favour of a proven Premier League striker like Ollie Watkins, there is a lot of excitement about the striker heading to the red side of Manchester and completing Ruben Amorim's new-look attack...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Some of the top seeds are in action at the Toronto Masters on Thursday, with No. 3 seed Lorenzo Musetti taking on American Alex Michelsen and No. 10 Daniil Medvedev going up against Alexei Popyrin.

(3)Lorenzo Musetti vs. (26) Alex Michelsen

This year's National Bank Open offers a great opportunity for an up-and-coming player to nab a Masters 1000 title. Top players have withdrawn from one of the premier ATP events on the tennis calendar, owing to various injuries and fatigue from the grueling clay and grass-court seasons. Enter Italy's Lorenzo Musetti, whose two titles have come in Hamburg and Naples back in 2022. The world No. 10 routinely finds himself in the business end of tournaments–often on clay, but on other surfaces as well. He is a 2025 French Open semifinalist and a 2024 Wimbledon semifinalist.

American Alex Michelsen is waiting for his first big breakthrough. The No. 26 seed had a poor showing at Wimbledon, where he lost in the first round, and another early exit in Washington last week. He is ranked 34th in the world, but his results so far this season haven't matched his ranking and he'll need to perform better especially during the North American hard-court swing. Musetti and Michelsen have never faced each other. The Italian is the better player, and althought the tour is in North America, Michelsen isn't playing in front of a home crowd. Look for experience to win out on this one.

(10) Daniil Medvedev vs. (18) Alexei Popyrin

Daniil Medvedev is decidedly off the boil. The former world No. 1 and U.S. Open champion has had absolutely miserable Grand Slam results in 2025. Three slams in, he has a second, first, and first round to show for his efforts. He made the quarterfinals in Washington, D.C. but lost to lucky loser Corentin Moutet.

Alexei Popyrin had a good second half of 2024, but he hasn't maintained that level in 2025. He owns a losing 12-16 record on the season. It's tempting, given Medvedev's form, to suggest a Popyrin upset on Thursday. However, it's worth nothing that the Russian is at his best during this part of the season. Additionally, he boasts a 4-1 record over Popyrin; the Australian's one win came at the Paris Masters last year. While Medvedev is far from his best right now, he is still on his favorite surface and there is certainly no risk of fatigue given the relative brevity of his clay and grass seasons. The favorite should advance.

As good as Musseti is on grass and clay, hard is a very different story where the courts are quicker and the ball comes at him differently,so he has less time to set up his shots, so is less effective, the good news is that neither player looks in form on hard coming into this match, Michelsen was upset by Evans last week, having said that Michelsen is the better HC player, Michelsen in 3, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.

Even though Meddy has a 4-1 HTH with Popyrin, they're last 2 matches on hard have been very close and Popyrin got the last one, also Popyrin won this event last year, so the advantage goes to him here, Popyrin in 3, 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-4.

Taylor Fritz was tested in his Toronto opener Wednesday, yet the 27-year-old edged Roberto Carballes Baena 7-5, 7-6(1) to advance at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.


The first American top-two seed at an ATP Masters 1000 event since No. 1 Andy Roddick in 2005 (Paris), Fritz has another stern challenger looming next. The World No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings will meet Gabriel Diallo, the last Canadian in the Toronto draw, whom Fritz beat earlier this month at Wimbledon. Fritz outlasted Diallo in a five-set thriller at the All England Club — a result which the 6'8” home favourite will be eager to avenge on Friday.


Fritz wavered at times against Carballes Baena, even surrendering his typically reliable serve while serving for the first set at 5-3 after a short rain stoppage. The Spaniard absorbed Fritz's firepower and tested the American's consistency in lengthy rallies, but Carballes Baena blinked late in the second set, double faulting on break point while serving at 5-4.

“Being down that break, getting it back at 5-4 — 30/0 for him too — I played a really good point to get back in that and then I just grinded it out in the breaker,” said a relieved Fritz. “Tough conditions all week here. I feel like even in practice, I've had such a hard time just literally putting the ball in the court. Happy to get through that.”

An 18-minute rain delay preceded the second-set tie-break, but then Fritz went into lockdown mode and struck the ball cleanly to avoid any late drama, advancing after two hours, 31 minutes.


Now 33-13 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Fritz is attempting to complete the set of quarter-finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 events. The 10-time tour-level titlist is seeking his second Masters 1000 crown (Indian Wells, 2022).


In other action, Fritz's countryman Frances Tiafoe rallied past Yosuke Watanuki 1-6, 7-5, 7-6(5) to avenge his March Indian Wells loss to the Japanese player. 


Despite Watanuki's barrage of 45 winners to Tiafoe's 19, the seventh seed held his nerve in crucial moments to advance. Watanuki, who won nine more points than Tiafoe, will rue his two-for-nine break point conversion rate. Tiafoe, a top-eight seed at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament for the first time in his career, now leads Watanuki 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

 


Christopher O'Connell shocked 23rd seed and 2018 finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. O'Connell, who arrived in Toronto on a seven-match tour-level skid, is into the third round of an ATP Masters 1000 event for the second time (Miami, 2024). Tsitsipas, No. 29 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, is in danger of falling out of the Top 30 for the first time since July 2018.


Alejandro Davidovich Fokina defeated Corentin Moutet 6-4, 6-3. Davidovich Fokina is competing at a career-high No. 19 following his runner-up finish in Washington, D.C, where the Spaniard let slip three championship points to Alex de Minaur. The Aussie De Minaur continued his Washington form by defeating Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-2. The 26-year-old reached the Toronto final in 2023.


Hungarian Fabian Marozsan spoiled the hopes of home favourite Felix Auger-Aliassime with a 6-4, 6-4 victory amidst windy evening conditions. Marozsan crucially struck a second-serve ace down break point while serving for the match at 5-4 en route to closing out the contest.


Arthur Fils was back in action for the first time since aggravating a back injury at Roland Garros. The 21-year-old Frenchman ousted 2022 champion Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-4 to set a meeting with Jiri Lehecka, who was a 7-6(2), 6-4 winner against Mackenzie McDonald.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Davidovich Fokina won't let heartbreak hold him back: 'I want more'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/davidovich-fokina-toronto-2025-feature","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 06:20:39 GMT","

Last week's Washington final will live in Alejandro Davidovich Fokina's memory forever. The Spaniard had three championship points in the final of the ATP 500 event against Alex de Minaur, but was unable to convert one and lift his first ATP Tour trophy. 

There was a memorable scene after the match, when an emotional Davidovich Fokina sat in his chair — understandably devastated by the result — while De Minaur comforted him. That clip quickly went viral on social media, but what was missed was that the Spaniard had enjoyed another deep run and cracked the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time at No. 19.

“I'm happy but I'm not thinking about Top 20,” Davidovich Fokina told ATPTour.com. ""It wasn't the first goal from the beginning. But now that I'm in the Top 20, obviously I'm happy. But I want more and I want to go for more.”

Davidovich Fokina fell as low World No. 68 this January, but he believes that he began moving in the right direction earlier last year when he made big changes to his team, including a split with Jorge Aguirre, whom he began working with in 2011. For more than a decade, they shared a successful partnership, but it was time to begin a new chapter. Taking that ownership of his career has proven beneficial, according to 'Foki'.

“I think it gave me a lot of confidence for myself to play on court,” Davidovich Fokina said.

The 2025 season has been a consistent one for the surging Spaniard. After advancing to the fourth round at the Australian Open, he made back-to-back finals in Delray Beach and Acapulco, and has not looked back. A key has been keeping his level even and enjoying his time on court.

“To be consistent, to be just happy, enjoying. I know the level I can create on court and I think now the people can see that I am [playing] with confidence, power,” Davidovich Fokina said. “They [will look at me and think], ‘He is on fire, he is running every ball. He doesn't do mistakes'. At the end that creates the opponent to think.”



Davidovich Fokina pointed to players like Daniil Medvedev, Tommy Paul and his Washington final opponent, De Minaur, as competitors who make life very difficult for their opponents. The Spaniard likes the idea of becoming a player like that.

“These are guys who to beat them you need to kill them three times to win the match point,” Davidovich Fokina said. “In the end those kinds of players are so tough to play. Obviously they are Top 10, but I think they are not easy. I will not say it's easy to play against other Top 10s, but for me I think these ones are examples to play against other guys.”

The Spaniard understands that every week on the ATP Tour is difficult, so accomplishing that will not be easy. Davidovich Fokina is competing for an ATP Masters 1000 title this week in Toronto and will do the same in Cincinnati ahead of the season's final major, the US Open. To continue climbing, the formula will be simple.

“Keep winning,” Davidovich Fokina said, cracking a smile. “Keep winning.”

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","The 5 oldest tennis tournaments: Where do Canadian Open, Wimbledon, US Open rank?","https://www.tennis365.com/facts-stats/the-5-oldest-tournaments-in-tennis-wimbledon-canadian-open-us-open","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:53:25 GMT","

The Canadian Open is in full swing in 2025, with the Masters and WTA 1000 events underway.

The tournament is one of the most prestigious on both circuits and is steeped in history, with the event one of the most historic in tennis.

Here, we look at the five oldest active tournaments across either the ATP and WTA Tour calendars.

Despite going through multiple changes in its 133-year history, the Hamburg European Open has survived to become the fifth-oldest active tournament on the calendar.

Walter Bonne won the first edition of the event in 1892, and the tournament was originally held at the Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, before permanently switching to the Am Rothenbaum in 1924.

The men's singles event was part of the Grand Prix circuit from 1971-90 and was a Masters 1000 tournament from 1990-2008, when it became an ATP 500 event.

A women's singles event has been held intermittently since 1982, though it officially returned to the WTA Tour in 1925.

The oldest active clay-court event and one of the biggest titles up for grabs in the sport, the French Open is the fourth-oldest ongoing event in the sport.

The French Championships first launched at the Societé de Sport de l'Île de Puteaux in 1891, one of four venues used on rotation in the early decades of the tournament.

H. Briggs was the first man to lift the title, with Adine Masson lifting the first women's title six years later in 1897.

The 7 men with the most Canadian Open match wins: Rafael Nadal 38, Novak Djokovic 5th

The 10 men with the most ATP titles before turning 23: Rafael Nadal 3rd, Carlos Alcaraz joint-9th, Bjorn Borg with 46

After being based at the Stade Français from 1925 to 1927, the event officially moved to the Stade Roland Garros in 1928, where it remains to date.

The centre court was renamed after Philippe Chatrier in 2001, though the site is still known as Roland Garros, while the event officially became a Grand Slam in 1925.

First held in August 1881, the US Open is the second-oldest of the Grand Slam events, and the third-oldest active tennis tournament on the calendar.

Originally known as the U.S. National Championships, the event was held in Newport from 1881-1914, after which the event was based at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills.

Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the men's singles event from 1881-87, while Ellen Hansell won the inaugural women's event in 1887.

The event remained on grass courts until 1974, when it briefly switched to clay before becoming the first hard-court Slam in 1978, following a move to the Flushing Meadows site that summer.

The Arthur Ashe Stadium, which opened in 1997, is the largest tennis stadium in the world.

Older than three of the four Grand Slams, the Canadian Open is the second-oldest active tournament in tennis.

The event debuted at the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club in July 1881, with Isidore F. Hellmuth becoming the first ever tournament champion, while Maude Delano-Osborne won the first women's event in 1892.

Known as the Canadian National Championships until 1968, the event switched from clay to hard courts in 1979 and was solely contested at the Toronto National Tennis Centre until 1980.

From 1981 onwards, the event has been split between Montreal and Toronto, with the men's and women's events switching between the two cities in alternating years.

Wimbledon is the most famous and iconic tournament in tennis and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is also the oldest.

The Championships were first held in 1877, with Spencer Gore becoming the first man to triumph at the famed event.

A women's singles event was held for the first time in 1884, with Maud Watson lifting the title, and then successfully defending her title the following year.

Until 1922, the reigning champion did not have to contest a match until the final, playing against whoever had won through to challenge them.

1922 was also the year in which the All England Club relocated to Church Road, where it remains to this day, with the centenary of Centre Court celebrated back in 2022.

After a silver runner-up plate and a few hard truths in London, Amanda Anisimova returned to Montreal with a new number next to her name and the same fire in her game.

After losing last year's National Bank Open final, Amanda Anisimova made a point to say she was proud of herself.

“Obviously, the support of everyone around you is important,” she told reporters, “but I think the most important thing is the support you give yourself. It's not easy for every single person, it's not easy being your own best friend. We all struggle with that a little bit.

“It's something I'm working on a lot -- trying to be less critical of myself. It's pushed me in the right direction, maybe spreading the message to other people that you can be proud of yourself and you can push through challenges.”

Indeed, Anisimova pushed Jessica Pegula to three sets in Toronto but fell 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. She was the second-lowest ranked finalist ever in a WTA 1000, and that ended a spectacular week, in which she beat four Top 20 players -- including Aryna Sabalenka and Emma Navarro. Her ranking vaulted to No. 50 from No. 132. 

It was a flash of the form she displayed when she reached the semifinals in Paris at the age of 17.

And now …

Anisimova arrived at the Omnium Banque Nationale in an eerily similar state of mind. After advancing to her first Grand Slam singles final at Wimbledon, she fell 6-0, 6-0 to Iga Swiatek. At times, it was difficult to watch.

And yet, the 23-year-old's honesty and sincerity in the on-court trophy presentation and postmatch interviews were widely applauded.

“I think I was a bit frozen there with my nerves,” Anisimova said. “She definitely made it difficult for me. She's an unbelievable player. ... She deserves this win.”

That was 19 days ago. In Montreal, Anisimova regrouped Wednesday to defeat Lulu Sun 6-4, 7-6 (5) and faces resurgent Emma Raducanu in a highly anticipated third-round match on Friday.

Anisimova's run at Wimbledon, reminiscent of last year's fortnight in Toronto, thrust her into the Top 10 for the first time. She's the No. 5 seed and playing as a Top 10 seed in a WTA 1000 for the first time.

But Raducanu has beaten her twice -- both times in straight sets, earlier this year at the Australian Open and in Miami. In Montreal, Raducanu defeated Elena-Gabriela Ruse and Peyton Stearns by identical 6-2, 6-4 scores. Raducanu, a teenage winner of the 2021 US Open, has already collected a career-high 23 victories this year.

This should be a good test for both. Raducanu's record against Top 10 opponents is 3-13 (1-7 on hard courts).

Twenty-two years ago, Jana Novotna tore through the Wimbledon field, beating Gabriela Sabatini and Martina Navratilova on the way to the final. She was serving at 4-1 in the third set against Steffi Graf, but on game point she double faulted and Graf came back to win.

At the trophy presentation, a crushed Novotna memorably cried on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder.

That image took on a special meaning when Novotna returned five years later to win the Wimbledon title.

Anisimova, who was comforted by Catherine, Princess of Wales, after the loss to Swiatek, hopes her harrowing Centre Court experience will produce a similar result. 

“I'm going to keep putting in the work,” she said. “I always believe in myself, so I hope I'm going to be back here one day.”

Taylor Fritz was tested in his Toronto opener Wednesday, yet the 27-year-old edged Roberto Carballes Baena 7-5, 7-6(1) to advance at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.


The first American top-two seed at an ATP Masters 1000 event since No. 1 Andy Roddick in 2005 (Paris), Fritz has another stern challenger looming next. The World No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings will meet Gabriel Diallo, the last Canadian in the Toronto draw, whom Fritz beat earlier this month at Wimbledon. Fritz outlasted Diallo in a five-set thriller at the All England Club — a result which the 6'8” home favourite will be eager to avenge on Friday.


Fritz wavered at times against Carballes Baena, even surrendering his typically reliable serve while serving for the first set at 5-3 after a short rain stoppage. The Spaniard absorbed Fritz's firepower and tested the American's consistency in lengthy rallies, but Carballes Baena blinked late in the second set, double faulting on break point while serving at 5-4.

“Being down that break, getting it back at 5-4 — 30/0 for him too — I played a really good point to get back in that and then I just grinded it out in the breaker,” said a relieved Fritz. “Tough conditions all week here. I feel like even in practice, I've had such a hard time just literally putting the ball in the court. Happy to get through that.”

An 18-minute rain delay preceded the second-set tie-break, but then Fritz went into lockdown mode and struck the ball cleanly to avoid any late drama, advancing after two hours, 31 minutes.


Now 33-13 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Fritz is attempting to complete the set of quarter-finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 events. The 10-time tour-level titlist is seeking his second Masters 1000 crown (Indian Wells, 2022).


In other action, Fritz's countryman Frances Tiafoe rallied past Yosuke Watanuki 1-6, 7-5, 7-6(5) to avenge his March Indian Wells loss to the Japanese player. 


Despite Watanuki's barrage of 45 winners to Tiafoe's 19, the seventh seed held his nerve in crucial moments to advance. Watanuki, who won nine more points than Tiafoe, will rue his two-for-nine break point conversion rate. Tiafoe, a top-eight seed at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament for the first time in his career, now leads Watanuki 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

 


Christopher O'Connell shocked 23rd seed and 2018 finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. O'Connell, who arrived in Toronto on a seven-match tour-level skid, is into the third round of an ATP Masters 1000 event for the second time (Miami, 2024). Tsitsipas, No. 29 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, is in danger of falling out of the Top 30 for the first time since July 2018.


Alejandro Davidovich Fokina defeated Corentin Moutet 6-4, 6-3. Davidovich Fokina is competing at a career-high No. 19 following his runner-up finish in Washington, D.C, where the Spaniard let slip three championship points to Alex de Minaur. The Aussie De Minaur continued his Washington form by defeating Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-2. The 26-year-old reached the Toronto final in 2023.


Hungarian Fabian Marozsan spoiled the hopes of home favourite Felix Auger-Aliassime with a 6-4, 6-4 victory amidst windy evening conditions. Marozsan crucially struck a second-serve ace down break point while serving for the match at 5-4 en route to closing out the contest.


Arthur Fils was back in action for the first time since aggravating a back injury at Roland Garros. The 21-year-old Frenchman ousted 2022 champion Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-4 to set a meeting with Jiri Lehecka, who was a 7-6(2), 6-4 winner against Mackenzie McDonald.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Novak Djokovic's ex-team member was fired by Jannik Sinner for one reason","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/reason-jannik-sinner-fired-team-members-novak-djokovic-before-wimbledon","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 11:24:04 GMT","

Jannik Sinner surprised many when he parted ways with two important team members on the eve of Wimbledon, and the reason for his decision has seemingly been revealed.

The Italian star split with both fitness trainer Marco Panichi and his physiotherapist Ulises Badio days before the start of Wimbledon.

Sinner brushed off concerns that the move could affect his Wimbledon chances, though, as he went on to secure his maiden title at the London major and fourth Grand Slam overall.

Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera has reported that Sinner took the decision to fire the two team members due to Panichi sharing details in interviews.

One incident after Sinner's defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the epic five-set 2025 French Open final particularly bothered the world No 1.

Panichi disclosed to the media that Sinner cried for 15 minutes in the locker room after the match and also that the Italian was frustrated by the crowd's heavy support for Alcaraz.

This, apparently, did not go down well with Sinner, while Badio — who joined the team at the same time as Panichi in September 2024 — was reportedly axed as “collateral damage.”

Panichi and Badio spent long spells working as a duo in Novak Djokovic's team before their time with Sinner.

Jannik Sinner claimed to have ‘wanted' controversial fitness trainer back despite doping row

In his pre-Wimbledon press conference, Sinner insisted there had been no issues between him and Panichi or Badio as he addressed the split.

“No, nothing major happened,” the 23-year-old explained. “Nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. I feel me and my team, we are ready to do the best we can.

“So I'm here to play good tennis. I think that's my main goal, the main reason why I'm here. We've reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. We made some great job, but I decided to do something different.”

Pressed on the reason for his decision, Sinner did not give much away: “As I said, there's not one specific thing. Nothing crazy happened. That's for sure not.

“We made some great work. For me the final in Roland Garros was an amazing achievement. That's it. Look, in this sport things can happen. There is nothing incredible, no, because sometimes a player feels something different, and that's my case.

It was a move that former No 1 Andy Roddick struggled to explain before Wimbledon.

“That's a really weird thing to do, yeah. On the eve of Wimbledon, you wouldn't… had to be something,” the American said on his Served podcast.

“I don't know anything, but my guess would be that it has to be something off court, whether it's financial, whether it's an argument. This doesn't feel like what you would do when you're trying to win your first Wimbledon.

“This also sounds like it could be something that we will never know the answer to, at least publicly.”

Panichi has since been hired by Holger Rune and will join the Dane at the Cincinnati Masters.

Emma Raducanu bid farewell to Eugenie Bouchard with a classy message on Instagram after her emotional retirement from tennis.

Bouchard announced earlier in the month that the Canadian Open would be her final tournament before calling time on her career.

At the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, she became the first Canadian-born player to represent Canada in a major singles final.

The 31-year-old also made semi-final appearances in the Australian and French Opens that same year.

Bouchard's last appearance on court came in a 2-6 6-3 4-6 defeat to Belinda Bencic in the Canadian Open second round.

She took to the microphone afterwards and delivered an emotional speech in her hometown of Montreal.

""Tennis has given me so much, I'm filled with so much gratitude for this sport and for the people who helped me along the way.""

A tearful Bouchard paused, before adding: ""I want to thank my family, mum, dad, my sisters and brother for their sacrifice and support. 

""It's only because of that that I'm standing here today, and I want you guys to know that when this crowd cheers for me, they're cheering for you guys too. I wouldn't be here without you.

""Also, to all the coaches, physios, trainers, everyone I've worked with this whole journey, you all know who you are. 

""Because of all your hard work and your help, I was able to live out my dreams and I think that's.... I mean, how lucky am I, to be able to live out my dreams? So, thank you.""

Despite never facing Bouchard, British star Raducanu took to Instagram and sent a heartfelt message to the former world no. 5.

""Thank you Genie, loved watching you compete and play,"" she said.

""Wish you all the best for your next chapter.""

Bouchard turned professional in 2005 and won the girl's doubles title at Wimbledon with Grace Min six years later.

She later won the girl's singles title in SW19 in 2012, as well as another doubles trophy, before making her main draw debut in 2013.

Petra Kvitova was her opponent in the 2014 women's singles final and won 6-3 6-0 to win her second Grand Slam title.

Bouchard's first and only WTA Tour title came at the Nuremberg Cup that year, the second of eight singles finals.

Although she has retired from tennis, the Canadian star competes on the professional pickleball tour.

She caused an upset in October by beating world no. 3 Lea Jansen in the last 16 of the Rate Championships tournament.

However, Bouchard once suffered a freak pickleball injury by being hit in the eye and left with a scratched cornea.

The impact of the hard plastic ball meant she bravely donned an eye patch afterwards.

Bouchard reflected on how she went from sitting in the stands at the IGA Stadium in Montreal, to playing on Centre Court in her home city.

""I think it's so special to play my last match here in Montreal on this court in front of you guys.

""I remember being a little kid, sitting in these stands, hoping and dreaming that I would play on this court one day.

""I grew up playing on these courts and courts all around Montreal, and near here.

""So it feels like such a full circle moment to finish my career here.""

The 31-year-old from Westmount, Que. Eugenie Bouchard started playing tennis at the age of five at Tennis Canada's National Training Centre in Montreal. She made her professional debut in 2009, but it took her almost five years to burst onto the scene. In 2014, after making it to the semifinals of the AO and the French Open, Bouchard reached the finals at Wimbledon. With that, she became the first Canadian-born player representing Canada to reach the final of a major singles tournament, but her dream run was cut short by the Czech, Petra Kvitova. She defeated Bouchard by 6-3,6-0.

But following that defeat, the Canadian said, “I hope I can walk out to many more finals. That's the goal.” Did she achieve her goals? Well, unfortunately, Eugenie Bouchard never reached the finals of a major tournament in her career after that, and throughout these 16 years of her professional career, the former world number 5 had won just one title (2014 Nuremberg Cup). Earlier this year, Eugenie Bouchard decided to retire from the sport. She claimed that she had no regrets about her relentless pursuit of success, but the wear and tear of the sport has led her to a new chapter beyond tennis.

Hence, she made up her mind to hang up her racket by playing her last match at the Omnium Banque Nationale présenté par Rogers, as one of the most decorated Canadian tennis players (led them to BJK Cup triumph in 2023). Talking about her retirement, Bouchard had previously claimed, “I want to soak up every moment of love and tennis and the hard stuff on the court, the amazing stuff off the court. I want to make it like a celebration, not a funeral, and see everybody.” Everyone perhaps expected her campaign at the Canadian Open to end at the hands of Emiliana Arango in the first round. But she delayed her retirement with an impressive three-set triumph over the Colombian. Following that match, Bouchard said, “I told my family that if I won the tournament, I would come out of retirement.“

She stated that she felt like the “old Genie” out there, but sadly for Eugenie Bouchard and all her fans, her incredible run in Montreal came to an end in the very next match. Belinda Bencic brought an end to her incredible journey with a 6-2,3-6,6-4 win in the R64. Eugenie Bouchard broke down in tears while addressing her family and fans in her post-match interview. She said, “Tennis has given me so much. I am filled with so much gratitude for this sport and the people who helped me along the way. I want to thank my mom, dad, sisters, & brother for their sacrifice and support. I want you to know that when this crowd cheers for me, they're cheering for you, too. I wouldn't be here without you.”

Following that, she also thanked her coaches, physios, trainers, and everyone else with whom she had the chance to work with in her career. Bouchard ended her career with a win-loss record of 299-230. Other than her on-court heroics, she also made it to the top 10 of Forbes' World's Highest-Paid Female Athletes list in 2017 and 2018. What a player! What a journey! How did the tennis world react to Eugenie Bouchard's retirement, though?

Eugenie Bouchard has been largely inactive for the last two years, and she has featured only in a handful of tournaments in 2024 and 2025. However, having said that, there should be no denial of her contributions to Canadian tennis. The National Bank Open tournament director, Valérie Tétreault, said, “She has been one of the most important figures in the history of our sport in Canada and a trailblazer who redefined what Canadian tennis could be.” He stated that everyone is proud of everything that Bouchard has done as a player and as a role model.

Talking about being a role model for youngsters, the 18-year-old Canadian, Victoria Mboko, who recently made the headlines by defeating the former Grand Slam champion, Sofia Kenin, in the R64 of the Canadian Open, also shared a few thoughts on Bouchard. In a previous interview, Mboko said, “She was quite a big role model when she made the finals of Wimbledon, that was a really amazing thing — first Canadian woman to do something like that. She kind of paved the way a little bit and kind of put Canada on the map in women's tennis.”

Did Eugenie Bouchard retire too soon, or was it the right time to hang up her racket?

Debate

She feels Eugenie Bouchard is too young to retire. Even Jessica Pegula, who is also the same age as Bouchard, spoke about her camaraderie with the Canadian and how much she loved playing with her in the doubles, especially. “I mean I feel like she really put Canadian tennis on the map a little bit,” said Pegula.

Madison Keys and Coco Gauff shared a heartfelt message for Eugenie Bouchard. Keys revealed that she grew up with Bouchard, playing the juniors together. “I think Genie is just herself, and I think it comes across. Everything she says and does feels authentic. People have always gravitated towards that. We like to see authentic people in the spotlight. Sometimes everything is too scripted, and I feel like she never fell into that,” said Keys.

Coco Gauff said that she was not aware of her retirement till about a few days before the Canadian Open. She wished her all the best in her next chapter. But what's going to be her next chapter, though? Pickleball? Well, Bouchard has already been involved with the Professional Pickleball Association, and she was also seen partnering with Andy Roddick to play against Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in a thrilling contest. Can she find similar success in her pickleball career as well?

Flushing Queens is no tropical island, but the USTA is hoping that 'Game, Set, Matchmaker' will find an audience.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	There's no shortage of love at the US Open tennis tournament (or love-15, or love-40), but the USTA and Fresh Tape Media think that there is more love to be found.


	The Tennis association and production company are planning to shoot an entire reality dating series on the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, during this year's US Open tournament. The series, Game, Set, Matchmaker, will follow a woman (Ilana Sedaka, aka “The Champion”) and a cast of potential partners that include influencers, tennis superfans, and social personalities, as she seeks an, ahem, match amid the milieu of one of the biggest events in tennis.

“I've been going to the US Open since I was little, and it's honestly one of the best sporting events in the world—so to be stepping into something this fun, flirty, and personal right in the middle of it is kind of surreal,” Sedaka says. “I've actually gone on a few dates at the Open before, but this time, I get to explore real connection with seven amazing guys and actually choose what feels right for me. I'm in a place where I know what I want, and I'm not afraid to take my time and see who's really showing up.”


	The series will run on the official US Open YouTube channel, with the first episode posting on the first official day of the Open, Aug. 24, and the finale times to the women's final. US Open sponsors Dobel Tequila and Moët & Chandon will be integrated into the show, ensuring that the champagne and Ace Paloma's flow freely.

	











	“We're excited to break new ground with Game, Set, Matchmaker, at the US Open and across our channels this year,” says Jonathan Zipper, senior director of social media for the USTA, in a statement. “It's the perfect time for us to launch a fun, social-forward concept that meets the moment, engaging fans at the intersection of tennis, pop culture and entertainment.”  


	“The US Open is more than a tournament; it's a cultural stage,” adds Alana Glenn Moritz, creative director for Fresh Tape Media. “We built this series to capture that energy in its purest form. It's unexpected, it's current, and it taps into the drama and connection that makes this event unlike anything else.”

Alexander Bublik is one of the most in-form players on the ATP Tour at the moment.

Bublik has won 22 of his last 25 matches, enabling him to reach 12th in the race to the ATP Finals.

This includes Bublik beating Jannik Sinner, reaching the Roland Garros quarterfinals and winning three main tour titles.

As a result of his recent form, Bublik is seen as a potential dark horse for the US Open, but that may not actually be the case.

After Bublik won the ATP tournament in Kitzbuhel, many were expecting him to continue this on into the US Open hard court swing.

However, that has turned out not to be the case, with Bublik now withdrawing from both Masters 1000 tournaments in Toronto and Cincinnati. 

There is a lot of confusion about why this is, but his previous record during the US Open hard court swing may provide some explanation.

Of the three main events during the North American hard court season (Canada, Cincinnati, US Open), Bublik has only ever won six of his 18 matches.

Bublik has never won more than two matches at any of these tournaments, which came during his US Open debut in 2019.

The Kazakhstani has also only ever beaten one player ranked inside the top 60 at these tournaments, with Bublik beating Dan Evans at the Canadian Open in 2021.

Bublik had competed in Canada for four consecutive years until 2025, but his withdrawal from the Cincinnati Masters should not come as a huge surprise.

The last time that Bublik played in Cincinnati was in 2021, when he lost in the second round to Grigor Dimitrov.

Although hard courts are the surface that Bublik has the worst win-loss record on, it is also the surface where he has won the most titles on.

However, all of these ATP 250 titles have come on indoor hard courts, which Bublik will not be able to experience at the US Open unless he is playing under the roof of either the Arthur Ashe Stadium or the Louis Armstrong Stadium.

Bublik's poor record on North American hard courts is not exclusive to the US Open swing, as he has only ever won two of his eight matches at the sunshine double of Indian Wells and the Miami Open.

The world number 25 will be hoping that he can continue his form when the US Open begins on Sunday, 24 August.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Serena Williams' former coach tells Carlos Alcaraz what he can change to improve his game ahead of the US Open","https://tennishead.net/serena-williams-former-coach-tells-carlos-alcaraz-what-he-can-change-to-improve-his-game-ahead-of-the-us-open/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz has enjoyed a stellar 2025 season, despite losing the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner.

The 22-year-old won his fifth major title at the 2025 French Open, saving match points to defeat long-time rival Jannik Sinner in an epic five-set match.

However, he was unable to defend his Wimbledon title, losing to Sinner in the final.

The Spaniard, who has already qualified for the ATP Tour Finals in November, recently withdrew from the Canadian Open along with the likes of Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper.

However, he is set to compete at the Cincinnati Open and US Open in August, and one former coach has pinpointed an area of his game that could still be improved heading into those competitions.

Alcaraz was recently spotted working on his net approaches and passing shots while training in Spain. 

However, Rick Macci, who is credited with the early development of Serena and Venus Williams during their initial playing days in Compton, California, has suggested Carlos Alcaraz should adjust another area of his game: his positioning on serve.

The iconic coach believes Alcaraz should switch to a platform stance when serving, rather than a pinpoint stance.

Macci said: “He has every shot in the book. Most talented player on tour. 

He has every shot in the book. Most talented player on tour. The wildcard for Carlos is the serve. Time to dabble. He has a gun but if he switches to a platform stance with less moving parts no doubt will fire a better % of Spanish Darts. @carlosalcaraz

“The wildcard for Carlos is the serve. Time to dabble. He has a gun but if he switches to a platform stance with less moving parts no doubt will fire a better % of Spanish Darts.”

Both stances have been heavily utilised by various well-known players. While Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic have both used a platform stance, other stars, like Nick Kyrgios, Sam Stosur, and Serena Williams, have used a pinpoint stance.

Alcaraz certainly struggled on his first serve in the Wimbledon final, possibly legitimising Macci's suggestion.

A platform stance involves static use of the feet when serving. Upon tossing the ball, the player maintains the position of their feet, which are usually around shoulder width apart.

It is a simpler stance to pick up as a beginner. However, this is not to say it is less effective than the pinpoint stance. The technique has been used by some of the best servers in history, like Pete Sampras.

In contrast, the pinpoint stance involves movement of the outer leg upon tossing the ball. The outer leg steps inwards towards the most advanced foot, allowing the player to create a spring-like motion when jumping up to strike the ball.

Some of the biggest and best servers in history have used this technique, including Ivo Karlovic, John Isner and Andy Murray.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Explained: Why Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyrgios didn't receive US Open mixed doubles WC?","https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Stories/158052/explained-why-naomi-osaka-nick-kyrgios-didn-t-receive-us-open-mixed-doubles-wc/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 02:05:00 GMT","

Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios haven't been awarded a wildcard for the US Open mixed doubles, but there is a very probable explanation why that's the case. 

When the US Open revealed the list of signed-up teams for their revolutionary mixed doubles tournament in late June, the Japanese four-time Grand Slam champion and the 2022 Wimbledon runner-up were there. On Tuesday, the organizers of the last Grand Slam of the year shared the list of eight teams that made the tournament directly and other six pairs that received a wildcard - the Japanese/Australian combination wasn't on the list.

Osaka and Kyrgios not being on the list came as a surprise to many, considering that they would be one of the most attractive and entertaining teams to watch despite competing in a star-studded field. However, there is probably a reason why the US Open organizers are waiting to see whether to award one of the remaining two wildcards to the Japanese/Australian pair.

Last week in Washington, Kyrgios played his first tournament in four months. But even that didn't go as planned since he was forced to withdraw from singles and only played in doubles - where he and Gael Monfils were thrashed 2-6 2-6 by Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Hugo Nys.

Later, the Australian said that his knee was ""cooked."" With that being said, the US Open organizers likely agreed with the 30-year-old to first see if he is is fit enough to play and then award him and Osaka a wildcard for the mixed doubles tournament.

Earlier this month, the Australian confidently stated that he and Osaka ""could do some big things"" as a duo.

""What other sport in the world can you have your favourite female athlete play with your favourite male athlete and compete for prize money and a Grand Slam trophy? So pairings like Raducanu and Alcaraz, they've created such a buzz around the sport and my partner, Naomi Osaka, I think we can do some big things,"" Kyrgios said three weeks ago.

Emma Raducanu continued her run of good form as she booked a place in the third round of the National Bank Open in Montreal with a straight-sets win over Peyton Stearns.

The world No 33 proved too strong for the American 32nd seed, a couple of breaks in each set clinching a 6-2 6-4 win.

Raducanu, who arrived at the WTA 1000 event fresh from an impressive semi-final showing at the Mubadala Citi DC Open last week, had won her two previous meetings with Stearns and an early break put her in control of the first set.

R1: Elena-Gabriela Ruse - Win 6-2 6-4
R2: Peyton Stearns - Win 6-2 6-4
R3: Amanda Anisimova
R4: Elina Svitolina or Anna Kalinskaya
Quarter-finals: Jessica Pegula
Semi-finals: Iga Swiatek
Final: Coco Gauff or Mirra Andreeva

She broke again in a lengthy eighth game to seal the set, but fell a break down midway through the second as double faults crept into her game.

The British No 1 broke back to level at 4-4 and a final break completed a run of four successive games to clinch a place in the last 32.

Raducanu told Sky Sports: ""I know Peyton is a really tough opponent, we've played two times in the past and always had really long matches. I'm really happy with how I came through in that match.

""I kind of lost my focus at some moments in the second set and she took advantage, but very happy that I came through against a top opponent and happy to extend my stay in Montreal.

Raducanu will face Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova in the third round after the American fifth seed beat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-4 7-6.

She has played Anisimova twice before at the Australian Open and Miami Open this year, winning on both occasions.

Canadian Eugenie Bouchard retired from professional tennis after the former world No 5 lost 6-2 3-6 6-4 to Belinda Bencic in the second round.

The 31-year-old, who announced earlier this month this would be her last tournament, looked swiftly lost the first set to 17th seed Bencic but rallied in the second, breaking with a blistering forehand to take a 5-3 lead before going on to level the match.

Bouchard then seized a 3-1 lead in the decider but Bencic clawed her way back and sealed victory when the Canadian's backhand drifted wide.

""It's so special to play my last match here in Montreal, on this court and in front of you guys,"" Bouchard said at an emotional retirement ceremony.

""I remember being a little kid, sitting in these stands hoping and dreaming that I would play on this court one day, so it feels like a full circle moment to finish my career here.""

Bouchard's best year was 2014 when she reached the semi-finals of the French and Australian Opens, and the final of Wimbledon.

Caroline Garcia plans a Queen City return before her final farewell in Queens.

The 31-year-old Garcia aims to plan next month's Cincinnati WTA 1000 event in preparation for her final tournament at the 2025 US Open.

Garcia shared a brief video of her training with coach Bertrand Perret on Instagram Stories today. She captioned the video “Getting ready for Cincy tennis with my fave coach Bertrand Perret.”

It's been a life-changing month for Garcia, who married long-time boyfriend Borja Durán in a beautiful and joyous ceremony earlier this month.

The happy couple shared exquisite images from their wedding ceremony on social media.

A post shared by Caroline Garcia (@carogarcia)

“The most beautiful day of our lives,” Garcia posted on social media.

The July 19th wedding comes nearly 13 months to the day after the couple announced their engagement.

Borja Durán is a Catalan university professor who has lived in Barcelona.

The couple launched their own podcast, The Tennis Insider Club, last year.

They've interviewed several stars, including Gael Monfils, Alize Cornet, Andrey Rublev and Victoria Azarenka for the podcast.

Former world No. 4 Garcia announced her intention to retire from the pro tour after the 2025 US Open in May. Garcia won 11 WTA singles titles, including defeating Aryna Sabalenka to capture the 2022 WTA Finals championship. Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic captured the Roland Garros doubles championship twice.

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros. The 2025 French Open has reached the men's semifinals. Defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz has made it through to the semis. Defending champ Iga Swiatek was knocked out in her semis match by the top seed of the women's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka — who will face No. 2 Coco Gauff in the women's final this Saturday. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the men's semis at the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Davidovich Fokina won't let heartbreak hold him back: 'I want more'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/davidovich-fokina-toronto-2025-feature","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 06:20:39 GMT","

Last week's Washington final will live in Alejandro Davidovich Fokina's memory forever. The Spaniard had three championship points in the final of the ATP 500 event against Alex de Minaur, but was unable to convert one and lift his first ATP Tour trophy. 

There was a memorable scene after the match, when an emotional Davidovich Fokina sat in his chair — understandably devastated by the result — while De Minaur comforted him. That clip quickly went viral on social media, but what was missed was that the Spaniard had enjoyed another deep run and cracked the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time at No. 19.

“I'm happy but I'm not thinking about Top 20,” Davidovich Fokina told ATPTour.com. ""It wasn't the first goal from the beginning. But now that I'm in the Top 20, obviously I'm happy. But I want more and I want to go for more.”

Davidovich Fokina fell as low World No. 68 this January, but he believes that he began moving in the right direction earlier last year when he made big changes to his team, including a split with Jorge Aguirre, whom he began working with in 2011. For more than a decade, they shared a successful partnership, but it was time to begin a new chapter. Taking that ownership of his career has proven beneficial, according to 'Foki'.

“I think it gave me a lot of confidence for myself to play on court,” Davidovich Fokina said.

The 2025 season has been a consistent one for the surging Spaniard. After advancing to the fourth round at the Australian Open, he made back-to-back finals in Delray Beach and Acapulco, and has not looked back. A key has been keeping his level even and enjoying his time on court.

“To be consistent, to be just happy, enjoying. I know the level I can create on court and I think now the people can see that I am [playing] with confidence, power,” Davidovich Fokina said. “They [will look at me and think], ‘He is on fire, he is running every ball. He doesn't do mistakes'. At the end that creates the opponent to think.”



Davidovich Fokina pointed to players like Daniil Medvedev, Tommy Paul and his Washington final opponent, De Minaur, as competitors who make life very difficult for their opponents. The Spaniard likes the idea of becoming a player like that.

“These are guys who to beat them you need to kill them three times to win the match point,” Davidovich Fokina said. “In the end those kinds of players are so tough to play. Obviously they are Top 10, but I think they are not easy. I will not say it's easy to play against other Top 10s, but for me I think these ones are examples to play against other guys.”

The Spaniard understands that every week on the ATP Tour is difficult, so accomplishing that will not be easy. Davidovich Fokina is competing for an ATP Masters 1000 title this week in Toronto and will do the same in Cincinnati ahead of the season's final major, the US Open. To continue climbing, the formula will be simple.

“Keep winning,” Davidovich Fokina said, cracking a smile. “Keep winning.”

They've played once, at the Australian Open in 2024, and Yastremska won in three sets. That was the start of her first and so far only run to a Slam semifinal. But it was Navarro who would go on to have the breakout season, reaching a high of No. 8, and making her own major-semi run at the US Open.Navarro is still ranked 11th, 24 spots above Yastremska, but the American has come down to earth in 2025. She's 25-18 overall, and has struggled to maintain her form for more than a match or two at a time. Yastremska is what she has always been: Terminally streaky. But she has been on a decent streak of late, beating Coco Gauff at Wimbledon and making the semis in Hamburg. If—and it's always a big if with Yastremska—she can stay in that zone, and at that level, she can beat the 2025 version of Navarro. Winner: Yastremska

Earlier this year, the Aussie said that he would be interested in playing in the competition with Boulter despite having not played much doubles in the past. The couple competed with each other at Wimbledon two years ago, but de Minaur admitted that the polarizing innovations—which include shortening the format to four-game sets, truncating the draw, and overhauling the entry process—made a US Open mixed doubles debut appealing.Read more: Katerina Siniakova, doubles No. 1, on not making US Open cutoff: ""Nothing more to say""“If I'm looking purely at myself and the situation I'm in, it does present an opportunity for me to play mixed doubles, which in previous years I probably wouldn't have done just because as the format is right now for a singles player, you're not really going to play mixed doubles because your priority is obviously the singles,” he said during the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.“The way it's proposed now, it definitely entices a lot more of the singles players to play, and it's an opportunity.”Your move, USTA!

Last season on indoor hard courts in Bercy, Medvedev won 7-6 in the third set. More memorably, in 2021 the Russian cramped to the point where he could barely put one foot in front of the other, yet somehow found his way past the Australian, 6-4 in the third. Alas, their lone meeting this year, a 6-4, 6-1 win for Medvedev in Rome, wasn't nearly as dramatic as that.As far as their 2025s go, Medvedev and Popyrin have been in similar boats: i.e., they've both been disappointing.

In theory, coming to Canada should make both of them feel a little better. Medvedev won the title here in 2021, and Popyrin in 2024. Neither looked amazing in their first-round wins over much lower-ranked players, but we know these guys have top-tier potential. Popyrin has a serve and a forehand that can knock down any opponent, and Medvedev is a former No. 1 who, despite his recent results, has yet to start sounding like a beaten man.It will be interesting to see who can overcome his recent form by enough to win—one of them has to. Winner: Medvedev

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

As F1 gets set for the Hungarian Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more ahead of the race at the Hungaroring.

Formula 1 heads straight from Spa-Francorchamps to Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend – the final race before the sport's summer break.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 1, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 2 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 3.

• First Grand Prix – 1986
• Track Length – 4.381km
• Lap record – 1m 16.627s, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, 2020
• Most pole positions – Lewis Hamilton (9)
• Most wins – Lewis Hamilton (8)
• Trivia – The event has been the scene of several drivers' first F1 victories, including Oscar Piastri in 2024, Esteban Ocon in 2021, Jenson Button in 2006 and Fernando Alonso in 2003 (more on that below)
• Pole run to Turn 1 braking point – 476 metres
• Overtakes completed in 2024 – 65
• Safety Car probability – 25%*
• Virtual Safety Car probability – 25%*
• Pit stop time loss – 20.6 seconds

*From the last eight races in Hungary

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Budapest feels like a small circuit when you're there but there's plenty that goes into it with 14 corners.

The first sector is basically two corners: a big braking zone at Turn 1, which is a relatively straightforward right-hander but quite bumpy in the braking area, so it can induce some front locking, before heading into Turn 2, which is slightly downhill.

The middle sector is one of those ones where you've got to find a rhythm because out of pretty much every corner you need to be positioned for the next corner coming through it. You go from Turn 4 into 6, then you get a tiny breather, but it carries you through the next sweeping section, building speed all the way.

In the final sector, sometimes the tyres are starting to overheat and you start to scramble around for a little bit of grip there. In the race, you've got to think about setting up your overtake coming out of Turn 14, the final corner, because that is your one chance to do something into Turn 1 and, if not, into Turn 2. If you don't get it done there, you're probably going to be following for the next lap.

I had some good battles here in GP2, and while it's not easy to overtake in Hungary, you can. The layout of the circuit lends itself to overtaking at Turn 2, particularly as you can go inside or outside, so it can be hard to defend. It's a nice one to have some battles at.

• 2024 – Lando Norris (McLaren)
• 2023 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)
• 2022 – George Russell (Mercedes)
• 2021 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)
• 2020 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)

• 2024 – Oscar Piastri (McLaren)
• 2023 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull)
• 2022 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull)
• 2021 – Esteban Ocon (Alpine)
• 2020 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)

“The trio of slick tyre compounds is the same as last year: C3 as hard, C4 as medium and C5 as soft,” reads Pirelli's pre-weekend preview.

“Up until last year, these would have been the softest tyres of all, but this year, the C6 was introduced. However, the new compound would be too extreme a choice for a track that exerts this level of energy density on the tyres for every lap.

“Although the actual loads are not that high in absolute terms, the fact that the lap is short means that it increases cumulatively and significantly with each lap.

“Another factor that plays its part is the high temperature that usually accompanies the Hungarian weekend, leading to predominantly thermal degradation, exacerbated by the very dark track surface. In fact, last year's race here saw the highest recorded track temperature of the season, at 58.6 Celcius.

“The most popular strategy [in 2024] was the two-stop, running various combinations of the C3 and C4. The medium performed best and 13 drivers chose it for the start. Of the remaining seven, four went with the soft and three with the hard.

“Yuki Tsunoda in the Racing Bulls was the only driver to get to the chequered flag having made just one stop, while some pitted three times, running a short final stint on the soft.

“The Aston Martin pair of Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll made two stops, using all three compounds, having gone their own way in terms of tyre management in free practice. The Canadian drove the longest stint (14 laps) on the soft.”

Lando Norris ate into McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri's championship lead via back-to-back victories in Austria and on home soil at Silverstone, but the Australian returned to the top step with a superb display of his own in the changeable Spa-Francorchamps conditions.

It means Piastri sits 16 points clear of Norris heading to the Hungaroring, where the former claimed his first Grand Prix win last year – but given the fine margins involved, either one of them could enter the upcoming summer break with the advantage.

Although McLaren can take plenty of confidence from their performance at the track some 12 months ago, and their generally imperious pace across the 2025 season so far, several rivals will be pushing to cause an upset when the weekend gets going.

Ferrari's update in Belgium last time out appeared to move their SF-25 in the right direction, with Charles Leclerc returning to the podium, while Lewis Hamilton can draw on his records of nine pole positions and eight race wins here.

Max Verstappen and Red Bull also have recent form in Hungary, having won the 2022 and 2023 races, but will the Dutchman and team mate Yuki Tsunoda (who showed signs of improvement at Spa) be able to get the RB21 working around the tight, twisty Budapest venue?

Elsewhere, Mercedes are looking for answers to some serious questions after a difficult run, with a tight midfield group all ready to take advantage of any ongoing issues for the Silver Arrows and bag some more valuable points.

There are so many iconic moments to choose from over the several decades of racing at the Hungaroring, but one particularly dramatic race – and landmark result – came during the 2006 season.

Starting back in 14th, Button excelled in the tricky wet/dry conditions to rise up the order and bring himself into contention, meaning he could capitalise when long-time leader Fernando Alonso lost a wheel nut and spun off.

After a hatful of podium finishes and several near-misses, it marked the first victory of Button's F1 career, the first for Honda as a constructor since John Surtees' win in Italy in 1967 and the first for a Honda engine since Gerhard Berger's triumph in Australia in 1992.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Ferrari have confirmed that they have renewed Team Principal Fred Vasseur's contract with the squad ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Ferrari have handed their Team Principal Fred Vasseur a multi-year contract, which the team say ""reflects Ferrari's determination to build on the foundation laid so far"".

Vasseur joined the Italian squad ahead of the 2023 Formula 1 season and, under his watch, the team challenged McLaren for the 2024 Teams' Championship until the last race before finishing just 14 points behind the champions.

While they trail McLaren by a mammoth 268 points as the sport approaches the summer break this year, Ferrari are still P2 in the Teams' Championship, fending off rivals Mercedes and Red Bull.

On the eve of the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend, Ferrari announced they have renewed Vasseur's contract.

""His ability to lead under pressure, embrace innovation and pursue performance aligns fully with Ferrari's values and long-term ambitions,"" the team said in a statement.

""Under Fred's leadership, Ferrari is united, focused and committed to continuous improvement. The trust placed in him reflects the team's confidence in its strategic direction and reinforces a shared determination to deliver the results that Ferrari's fans, drivers and team members expect and deserve.""

Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said: ""Today we want to recognize what has been built and commit to what still needs to be achieved.

""It reflects our trust in Fred's leadership – trust rooted in shared ambition, mutual expectations and clear responsibility.

""We move forward with determination and focus, united in our pursuit of the level of performance Ferrari has to aim for.""

Vasseur, who joined Ferrari having previously been in charge of Sauber, added: ""I'm grateful for the trust Ferrari continues to place in me.

""This renewal is not just a confirmation – it's a challenge to keep progressing, to stay focused and to deliver.

""Over the past 30 months, we've laid strong foundations and now we must build on them with consistency and determination.

""We know what's expected, and we're all fully committed to meeting those expectations and taking the next step forward together.""

Ferrari's decision to extend and announce Vasseur's contract extension brings to an end speculation surrounding the Frenchman's future at the team.

The 57-year-old was angry and irritated during the Canadian Grand Prix weekend in June when media reports in Italy suggested he was at risk of losing his job.

He said at the time that such reports were ""disrespectful"" and were ""clearly hurting the team"".

One of Vasseur's key strengths is his ability to shield and protect his team from external factors and promote a strong, supportive culture internally.

Despite the uncertainty and speculation, he's managed to do just that – with the team keeping their heads down and securing an upturn in form since Canada.

They've secured two podiums in the last three Grands Prix courtesy of Charles Leclerc, with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton starting to find his feet, too.

There is still plenty of work to do, mind. The gap to McLaren is huge, with the reigning Teams' Champions overwhelming favourites to retain their title.

The new deal will help restore a greater sense of calm among the team and allow them to focus on trying to take advantage of sweeping new chassis and power unit regulations for 2026.

But now that Vasseur's immediate future has been secured, Ferrari senior management will expect him to lead the team to respond well to those rule changes and challenge for both championships next year.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Here are all the timings for the 14th race weekend of the 2025 season from Budapest, Hungary.

Round 14 of the 2025 season comes from the Hungaroring and marks the final weekend of racing before the summer break. The drivers and teams will all be keen to finish on a high, before taking a three-week breather from the action.

Oscar Piastri won this race last year for his debut victory, and is heading to Hungary off the back of a win at Spa-Francorchamps. But Lando Norris has a strong record in Budapest, and will be looking to return to winning ways as he tries to reduce the gap in the Drivers' Championship.

Piastri has a 16-point lead following his win last weekend, with McLaren once again looking the class of the field.

Piastri now has six wins this season to his team mate's four, with Max Verstappen and George Russell the other two drivers to bag a Grand Prix victory this season. But who will come out on top in Budapest?

The event at the Hungaroring will begin with Free Practice 1 and Free Practice 2 on Friday, August 01, followed by Free Practice 3 and Qualifying on Saturday, August 02, and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 03.

Max Verstappen gave an update ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix on where he will be driving next season.

Max Verstappen has confirmed that he will remain with Red Bull for the 2026 season ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, after months of speculation that he could join Mercedes.

The four-time and reigning World Champion's future has been one of the hottest topics in the Formula 1 paddock this campaign, with it confirmed by Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff several weeks ago that he was having conversations with Verstappen about a drive for the Silver Arrows.

At the previous round in Belgium, though, Wolff stated that after recent developments he would prefer to retain his current line-up of Kimi Antonelli and George Russell but fell short of any official confirmation.

Ahead of this weekend's race in Budapest and a three-week summer break, Verstappen was asked whether his and Wolff's yachts would be spending time together, hinting at ongoing negations between the pair.

But the 27-year-old dismissed the suggestion and confirmed he would be staying put with the Milton Keynes-based outfit for next season.

""The thing is, people are waffling so much throughout the whole season while the only one that actually can or should speak is not speaking,"" he said.

""That's me, and I do that on purpose because it makes no sense to start throwing things around and actually that should be the same for everyone.

""Some people just like to stir the pot, some people just like to create drama but for me it's always been quite clear and also for next year.

""I'm discussing with the team already the plans, the things that we want to change next year so that means I'm also staying with the team for next year and if my boat is next to Toto's then the boat is next to Toto's.

""You can have a personal relationship with someone even if you don't have a working relationship with someone.""

He added to media: ""I think it's time to basically stop all the rumours, and for me it's always been quite clear that I was staying anyway.""

Verstappen will remain at Red Bull as F1 enters a new technical regulation era in 2026, which incudes both changes to the chassis and power units.

The team has recently come under new leadership as long-term Team Principal Christian Horner was replaced by Laurent Mekies ahead of the Belgium Grand Prix.

Despite only a limited amount of time in the role, Verstappen praised the new appointment and believes Mekies will drive the team forward.

""We discuss about a lot of things to be honest,"" said Verstappen. ""He's very friendly, he's very open, very motivated, very driven.

""That's of course what you want to see from a boss and I like it. It's a nice atmosphere that he is creating and I'm very excited for the future, what we can do together.

""Of course, for this year the amount of influence with the car is difficult. You jump in the middle of the season but of course for the future, you have a lot more say and influence on that. He's asking, for me at least, the right questions and ideas. I like it.""

Audi are preparing to enter Formula 1 in 2026, with a major partnership now being put in place.

The future Audi F1 Team have announced global financial technology company Revolut as their title partner from the 2026 season onwards.

German automotive giants Audi, who have tasted success in various motorsport categories, will debut in F1 next year after recently completing a takeover of the Kick Sauber entry.

As preparations continue for that arrival, which includes the opening of a UK Technical Centre, Audi are teaming up with Revolut in a flagship, strategic partnership.

According to Audi's press release, the shared goal of the partnership is to establish “new ways for fans to interact with the sport during race weekends, with unique experiences for a new generation of motorsport enthusiasts and exclusive benefits for Revolut customers”.

Revolut Business will also be integrated into the team's financial operations, with fans benefitting from Revolut powering “seamless checkout solutions” for team merchandise.

“Audi is entering Formula 1 with a clear ambition: to use the platform as a technologically relevant and economically sustainable investment in the future of the Audi brand,” said Gernot Döllner, CEO of AUDI AG and Chairman of the Board of Sauber Motorsport AG.

“We firmly believe in the success of our project, which we are approaching with a realistic attitude and a mindset of continuous improvement. In Revolut, we have found a partner that shares our ambitions and attitude.

“Formula 1 is a global stage that offers us the opportunity to reach new target groups together and generate enthusiasm for our products.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal of the future Audi F1 Team, added: “With Revolut, we have found a partner that shares our core ethos of innovation and relentless ambition. This is more than a brand fit; it is a strategic alliance, engineered to challenge conventions in motorsport.

“From 2026, Revolut's digital-first solutions will power key areas of our operations while also redefining how fans and communities engage with our team – delivering a seamless and engaging experience on and off the track.”

Nik Storonsky, CEO of Revolut, added: “This is a monumental partnership for Revolut and the Future Audi F1 Team. We're accelerating towards 100 million customers, and we'll be bringing them into Formula 1 with unforgettable experiences at a pivotal time for the sport.

“As Revolut continues to challenge the status quo in global finance, the Future Audi F1 Team is set to do the same in motorsport. With a shared outlook, global ambition and relentless drive for progress, this partnership will define what's possible in Formula 1.”

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Pierre Gasly managed to score one point for Alpine in Belgium, as he and team mate Franco Colapinto reflect on a difficult race at Spa.

Pierre Gasly was pleased with his and Alpine's work in the Belgian Grand Prix as the Frenchman came home in 10th place at the end of a difficult race with mixed conditions.

Gasly backed up his sixth place from Silverstone with another assured drive, underlining his credentials as one to watch in the wet. He rose from P13 on the grid to finish 10th at the flag, scoring a much needed point for Alpine, who remain rooted to the bottom of the Championship table.

Gasly pitted one lap earlier than the majority of the field as the track dried at Spa, which proved to be the perfect strategy call. That jumped him ahead of some of his midfield rivals, and he defended well in the closing stages to keep the likes of Yuki Tsunoda and Ollie Bearman at bay.

“It was a very intense race and I am pleased that we were able to make the right calls to come away with one point, which we can be satisfied with today,” Gasly said afterwards.

“We made some very good decisions like opting for an aggressive, low downforce set-up, which allowed us to attack and defend on the straights and also pitting at the right time for dry tyres as the track dried up early on.

“So, I am very happy with that and that hard work has paid off today. It is only a point but, after a race like that, defending from a number of cars for so long, we can be pleased.”

Spa is always a poignant place to visit for Gasly, as he uses the opportunity of returning here to pay tribute to his childhood friend Anthoine Hubert. As well as organising a run in Hubert's memory this year, Gasly invited his friend's mother to watch the race from the Alpine garage, alongside his own mum.

“Every year, Spa is a special weekend for me for many reasons, so it was nice to have my family here alongside Anthoine's mum too,” he added.

Colapinto had a more difficult afternoon during the Belgian Grand Prix a he was unable to make much progress after starting 14th on the grid, thanks to Carlos Sainz and Lewis Hamilton opting to start from the pit lane.

After finding himself stuck in the midfield DRS train, the Argentine racer also tried the two-stop strategy, which proved the slower way to the flag at Spa and he ultimately came home in 19th place.

“It was a tough and long race for us,” Colapinto said. “It was very wet to begin and the conditions probably came to us as it dried as we opted for a low downforce wing to prioritise straight line speed.

“The start was good, we caught up the cars in front, before pitting for dry tyres. We seemed to struggle for pace on the medium in traffic. We then pitted again to cover Carlos [Sainz] but, in the end, we could not make any progress towards him.”

Colapinto remains under some pressure as he is still without a score this season, with Alpine now 15-points behind Haas in the fight for ninth in the Championship.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Pirelli have confirmed which tyre compounds the teams will have available to them in Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

The final race before F1's traditional summer break comes from Budapest in Hungary, and Pirelli have now confirmed which tyre compounds they are giving the teams to work with.

For the Hungaroring, the Italian tyre manufacturer have opted to bring the C3, C4 and C5 compounds, an allocation that is one step softer for the mediums and softs that the teams had last time out in Belgium, whilst the hard compound is two steps softer.

The last time these tyre compounds were in play was in Austria.

Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (marked yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (marked red), as well as access to the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required.

An extra set of softs is reserved for those who reach Q3 in Qualifying, while all drivers must use at least two different slick compounds during the race, providing the track is dry.

“The trio of slick tyre compounds is the same as last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “Up until last year, these would have been the softest tyres of all, but this year, the C6 was introduced.

“However, the new compound would be too extreme a choice for a track that exerts this level of energy density on the tyres for every lap. Although the actual loads are not that high in absolute terms, the fact that the lap is short means that it increases cumulatively and significantly with each lap.

“Another factor that plays its part is the high temperature that usually accompanies the Hungarian weekend, leading to predominantly thermal degradation, exacerbated by the very dark track surface. In fact, last year's race here saw the highest recorded track temperature of the season, at 58.6C.

“[Last year] the most popular strategy was the two-stop, running various combinations of the C3 and C4.”

Reflecting on the characteristics of the Hungaroring – which has been undergoing a major redevelopment project in recent times – Pirelli add: “Usually, track evolution over the weekend is very high here, especially during the first two days.

“Graining could put in an appearance during Friday free practice, before gradually decreasing the more the track gets rubbered-in. High thermal degradation is a factor drivers will have to deal with even over a flying lap in Qualifying on the soft. If it is not looked after properly, it could create problems in the final two corners.""

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Former F1 technical chief Adrian Reynard is the latest guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Adrian Reynard's motor racing outfit were one of the best in the world during the 1980s and ‘90s – winning multiple championships across Formula 3000, Formula 3 and IndyCar.

Reynard Racing Cars also held an impressive record of winning the first race of every major single-seater competition they entered.

When Adrian helped create the British American Racing F1 team in 1999, expectations were high, but that previous success didn't quite translate in the pinnacle of motorsport.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid podcast host Tom Clarkson, Adrian tells the fascinating story of BAR – how the team was formed with 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve, why a big falling out with Team Principal Craig Pollock led to Adrian resigning, and how he helped lay the foundations for that team to later become World Champions as Brawn GP and then Mercedes.

Adrian reflects on his F1 ventures before BAR as well – including a failed attempt to create his own team in 1990, despite selling his house to fund it, and his experiences with March F1 as a 29-year-old Technical Director in the 1980s.

Adrian also talks about inspiring legendary engineers like Rory Byrne and Pat Symonds, why he had an up-and-down relationship with the late Eddie Jordan, and the small part he played in the car that Michael Schumacher won his first F1 race in.

The 21-year-old K-pop star, formerly known as Seunghan, speaks with THR about his highly anticipated solo debut following his exit from Riize: ""I hope everyone can look at me from a fresh perspective."" 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	“I'm very excited,” K-pop star XngHan tells The Hollywood Reporter about his solo debut. “My heart swoons.”


	The 21-year-old, officially making his solo debut today with his artist project XngHan and Xoul, is equal parts excited and optimistic on a Zoom call from his label SM Entertainment's Seoul headquarters as he speaks of his new chapter as a soloist. 




	XngHan's debut has been highly anticipated by much of the K-pop community. Late last year, it was announced that the K-pop star, who previously went by his name Seunghan, would be leaving the boy group Riize, just days after the news of his return from a lengthy hiatus. When it was later announced that he'd be debuting as a soloist, XngHan received genuine well wishes from fans across various K-pop fandoms – somewhat of a rarity in online music spaces these days.

	XngHan's first single, “Waste No Time,” is a pitch-perfect choice for his debut track. As the singer puts it, the “refreshing” summer song talks of not wasting any time and spreading his “boundless wings” – perhaps a perfect parallel to XngHan himself, who seems eager to tackle this new chapter head-on. The single is accompanied by a B-Side, “Heavenly Blue,” is similarly catchy and the perfect soundtrack for a sunny summer day. XngHan contributed to writing lyrics and choreographing for the song.

	Below, the XngHan speaks with THR about “Waste No Time” and “Heavenly Blue,” his exit from Riize and what his hopes for the future.


I think there are a lot of people who are eager to hear how you're doing these days. How are you feeling ahead of your debut?


	I made sure that I worked out. I've been practicing my dance skills and also my vocals, so that I can keep everything rolling and going. My solo debut is just around the corner, so I'm very excited. My heart swoons.


You seem very happy. To talk about your future, I think we need to talk a bit about the past. How are you feeling, looking back on what I assume has been an at times difficult year? How do you feel looking ahead?


	I used that time to look back on myself. I think it was a time given to me for more self-improvement, so I was really using that time to make sure that I got better at stuff. I think it was a time where I was trying to get ready for a new start, so I think all the things I learned along the way are definitely going to be something that I can use going forward as a fuel, so I'm very excited and looking forward to my debut as a soloist.


I think there are a lot of people who are really excited to see you debut and have been waiting for it since your time with Riize. Although you're no longer with Riize, you worked and trained alongside them. Do you have any wishes for them? But also what hopes do you have for yourself as a soloist?












	I know that Riize is doing so well, and] I'm rooting for them as a fellow artist. I hope they stay healthy and well. [Since] I'm also preparing my new launch as a soloist, I hope people stay tuned [for my debut]. I'm really going to pour my heart and soul into this.


Why was it so important for you to change your stage name? Do you see this as opening a new chapter for you?


	Yeah, it's exactly as you said. I think it's a new chapter for me, a new challenge for me, and I'm very much looking forward to it. The reason why I wanted to include the letter X is because it symbolizes infinite potentials, [an] infinity of possibilities. It's also the unknown variable when it comes to mathematical formulas. I think it symbolizes that I am now opening up the doors to all the different potentials and possibilities that I could dig into. I wanted to use this letter X to show that. I think with this new artist brand, I can show you different facets of myself.


How has your training been? What do you feel like you've been focusing on in terms of practicing for your debut “Waste No Time” the most?


	I guess the focus in training for this single was that it had to be fun. It's a very vibing kind of song, so I wanted to give it that refreshing mood and vibe. Especially since it's a summer song. Actually, the good thing was that it wasn't very challenging to get ready for these songs. It was actually a very fun experience for me, especially since I got to work together with Xoul, the dance crew comprised of two people. It was really fun. It was almost like we were just playing around, but we were making something and creating something. I felt very much at ease preparing for the songs.

	











Can you tell me about your collaboration with Xoul? Do you find yourself feeling a little more comfortable working alongside them, given you've previously worked in a group setting?


	Yeah, it's definitely a lot more comfortable [especially] because our interests align. These are two professional dancers, so all three of us are bonded by our love and passion for dance. We would be working [on choreography], but we'd also be having a lot of fun dancing. It just made me feel so comfortable and at home working together with them.


How did this concept that you would have a dance crew with you come about? Why did you feel it made the most sense for you right now?


	I thought long and hard about with whom I should collaborate, and I think my top priority was to bring to the table something new, something refreshing, something people haven't seen before. I myself love trying new things and that's how we got to brainstorming ideas. Then I thought my forte is definitely performance, so why don't I start from there and gather a group of professional dancers, and that's how I gathered my first batch of Xoul.


How do you envision this looking like for you going forward in the future?


	One of the ideas that I have in mind… I've always had this dream of creating a band, so that could be one idea. But right now I'm going to really focus on the Xoul dancers. We're just going to nail the performances.


	I have a lot of time ahead of me, and I think I have a lot of potential, a lot of possibilities. I'm going to open it up to all the different things that I could do.

	











Do you feel you've had any big changes in the way you work? Did you realize any new strengths during your debut preparation?


	When I was working on this debut, there's the B-side track called “Heavenly Blue,” and I contributed to writing the lyrics for the song. I also created the choreography together with Xoul. It was my first time trying to pen the words of my own song, and I realized that I'm actually pretty good at it. I think I do have a little bit of a forte in writing [lyrics].


I think for any soloist, it's a bit daunting, having to figure out who you'll be as a singer. What was that process like for you?


	I'd like to be a soloist who appears the same on and off stage. I changed the S in my name to an X, but it's actually not that different sonically because it's still Seunghan. I want to be a soloist who can really be his true self on stage and show his true colors and essence. That's what I'm trying to go for.


“Waste No Time” is so much fun and a great debut single. Why did you feel like it was the right fit?


	The genre of the track is electronic dance, which incorporates a wide range of sounds. That's something I liked about the song, and it was in line with the kind of concept that I wanted to go with. When I thought about performance, I thought this was a song that could really mesh well with the performance that I can show on stage. When I heard the demo of the song, I knew right away that this was the right one. From the very beginning, I really wanted this song to be my debut track.

	











Can you tell me a bit about working on choreography for this project and what that experience was like?


	To be honest, it was quite challenging in the beginning because it was my first time and [Xoul's] first time collaborating. We all had our own style, so it was very hard to come to a consensus in the beginning. But I realized that I was the one who had to lead the debate, so I orchestrated [the process] between us three, and they were very happy to give me a lot of ideas. I was happy to share my ideas, even the very bizarre ones. We had a lot of fun sharing and tossing around ideas and coming up with the choreography.


To look ahead – you're at a new starting line, which can be nerve-wrecking but at the same time, very exciting. What are you hoping the future looks like for you as a soloist? What are your aspirations for the year ahead?


	Maybe it's a little early to say this, but my ultimate dream and goal is to drop an album where I creatively contributed in all the different aspects of all the tracks, including the choreography and writing the lyrics and the composition of the songs. That's my ultimate dream. [Also] to have that album drop and perform it live and receive the love and support of the fans. That's my dream.


As an artist, people's perception of you is often out of your control, but you're a human being and an artist. You've put a great deal of work into this debut and likely have an idea of how you want people to feel. How are you hoping to be viewed as an artist?












	I just hope that when fans watch my performance and see me performing live, they get so excited and happy. They can't help but dance. That's what I want the fans to view me as. When I'm on stage, I want to be remembered as an artist who just lights the stage on fire and nails every performance.


Speaking of fans, do you have a message to the fans who have been eagerly awaiting your debut and supporting you from afar for a while now?


	Thank you for the long wait. Because the wait was so long, I created music that was worth the wait. I hope you stay tuned and really enjoy the music. I'm really going to pour my heart and soul into the promotion for this album. I hope you love the music and love me too.


I'd like to give you the chance to close a chapter for yourself. Is there anything you'd like to add about your exit from Riize and about your debut?


	[My solo debut is] a new beginning for me, so I hope everyone can look at me from a fresh perspective. I'm going to try my hardest to burn the soloist XngHan into your brain. I'm going to work hard to do that.

Sorkin wrote the script for the new drama and will direct. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Mikey Madison, who won this year's best actress Oscar for her performance in Anora, and Jeremy Allen White, who is elbowing for his third acting Emmy for The Bear come September, are circling the lead roles in Sony's high-profile sequel to The Social Network.


Aaron Sorkin, who won an Academy Award for penning the 2010 movie, wrote the script and will direct the drama that is inspired by a series of articles Jeff Horwitz wrote for The Wall Street Journal known as The Facebook Files.




	Insiders stress that no offers have been made and that the film is still in the development process, although the project is a top priority for the studio and moving fast. Sorkin has been meeting with actors and is packaging a cast and budget, which he will then show to the studio for final approval. Meetings with Madison and White have taken place and the chess pieces are slowly coming together.

	While the acclaimed 2010 drama focused on the making of the Facebook, now known as Meta, the story of the new feature will focus on how the company's own reporting pointed to the negative effects its social media was having on teens and kids, how it knew misinformation was proliferating and causing violence, and how it contributed to the coup attempt of Jan. 6, 2021.


	If offers and, indeed, dealmaking closes, Madison would play Frances Haugen, the data engineer-turned-whistleblower who went to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Wall Street Journal with her information. White would play the former WSJ tech reporter who leads the breaking of the Facebook files.

	











	One source said the project would have shades of The Insider, the 1999 movie from Michael Mann that told of a whistleblower blowing the lid off the tobacco industry by talking to 60 Minutes. Another source said the project has shades of Spotlight, the 2015 movie that centered on reporters from the Boston Globe investigating child sex abuse by the city's Roman Catholic clergy.


	Sony had no comment.


	Sorkin, Todd Black, Peter Rice and Stuart Besser are producing the sequel.


	David Fincher directed the original Social Network, which starred Jesse Eisenberg as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and earned eight Oscar nominations, winning three.


	Madison received numerous accolades for her work in Anora, earning multiple nominations and ultimately wins courtesy of the BAFTA Awards and the Academy Awards. Anora won five Oscars, best picture among them. Madison also memorably appeared in Scream (2022) and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019).


	She is due to shoot The Masque of the Red Death, a reimagining of the creepy Edgar Allan Poe story from filmmaker Charlie Polinger, in early 2026. The horror project hails from A24, which will distribute worldwide, and Picturestart, which is producing. Earlier this year, she was in talks to star in Star Wars feature Starfighter, but those talks crumbled over financial reasons.


	White has earned two Emmy wins for his work on FX's The Bear and this fall will portray Bruce Springsteen in 20th Century's true-life Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere, which chronicles the making of his album Nebraska. The drama is due to hit theaters Oct. 24.

	











	Madison is repped by UTA, Authentic Talent and Sloane Offer. White is repped by WME and Entertainment 360.

THR is also debuting new stills from Richard Linklater's homage to 'Breathless' and the French New Wave, which premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received rave reviews.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


Nouvelle Vague, Richard Linklater's loving homage to Jean Luc-Godard's 1960 film Breathless and the French New Wave, which received a 10-minute standing ovation and rave reviews following its world premiere at May's Cannes Film Festival, will be released in American theaters on Oct. 31 and play on big screens for two weeks before dropping on Netflix on Nov. 14, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


	When Netflix acquired Nouvelle Vague's U.S. rights shortly after Cannes, some reacted with surprise and dismay that a movie shot on film and about cinema would end up with a streamer. But the company is planning a robust theatrical release that will include not only screens in New York (where, appropriately enough, it owns the historic Paris Theater) and LA, but in all of the top 10 U.S. markets.

	Additionally, THR can report that the largely French-language film will be pushed across all categories. In my humble opinion, it could well end up a finalist for best picture, a category in which non-English-language films have landed many noms in recent years (including France's Netflix-distributed Emilia Pérez earlier this year); best director (Linklater is a beloved auteur, but his only nom in the category came for 2014's Boyhood); and screenplay (it has yet to be determined if Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script will be classified as adapted or original).

	











	Meanwhile, Zoey Deutch, who is luminous as Breathless star Jean Seberg, will be campaigned in the supporting actress race, while French actors Guiillaume Marbeck and Aubry Dullin, who eerily resemble the characters they play — Godard and Breathless breakout Jean-Paul Belmondo — will be pushed for lead actor and supporting actor, respectively.


	The big question moving forward is whether or not France will select Nouvelle Vague as its entry for the best international feature Oscar competition. Each country's submission is determined by a selection committee comprised mostly of people associated with that country's film industry, who must attest that “creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.”


	The key word is “largely.” In the case of Nouvelle Vague, Linklater and Deutch are American, but almost everyone else who worked in front of or behind the camera is French, including the film's two producers, Laurent Pétin and Michèle Pétin, so the film is certainly eligible. Plus, its financing came from France; it was shot in France; it premiered in France; and it is an out-and-out celebration of French cinema.


	Some selection committees are hesitant to submit a film directed by someone born outside of their country's borders, feeling that doing so would be a missed opportunity to highlight homegrown talent. But other countries enter whichever film they think offers them the best shot at actually landing an Oscar nom. For instance, Japan put forward — and landed a nom in 2024 for — German filmmaker Wim Wenders' Perfect Days. Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland has had films entered by Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic. And twice in the last decade, France itself submitted films by non-French filmmakers: Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Elle in 2016 and Italian filmmaker Filippo Neneghetti's Two of Us in 2020.

	











	France, however, has had bruising experiences with its last two submissions. In 2024, it entered The Taste of Things instead of Anatomy of a Fall; ultimately, the former was not nominated, while the latter went on to five other noms (best picture, director, original screenplay, actress and film editing), suggesting that it almost certainly would have been nominated for — and might have even won — best international feature had it been entered. And in 2025, its submission Emilia Pérez looked certain to bring the country its first win in the category since Indochine prevailed in 1993, but its prospects imploded shortly before the final round of voting, thanks to the exposure of problematic social media posts from its principal star, and it ultimately lost.


	Again, Emilia Pérez was handled by Netflix, so you can be sure that the company is hungry for another chance to get a French film across the finish line in the best international feature Oscar race. (In just the last six years, it backed two films from other countries that went on to win that prize, Mexico's Roma in 2019 and Germany's All Quiet on the Western Front in 2023.) But the decision about whether or not it will have that opportunity is ultimately France's, or at least the French selection committee's.


	Given that no other French film has emerged this year, so far, that would appear to offer the nation a better shot than Nouvelle Vague at landing a best international feature Oscar nom, and possibly even a win, it will be very interesting to see how France's selection committee plays it cards.

'The Late Show' host weighed in on the controversy surrounding Sweeney's American Eagle jeans ad. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Even Stephen Colbert thinks the online uproar over Sydney Sweeney‘s American Eagle jeans ad is a bit much. 


The Late Show host weighed in on the culture war controversy over the Euphoria star's sultry ad which makes a play on words comparing the sex symbol's “genes” with the word “jeans.” The ad has been slammed by some online as a Nazi-like pro-eugenics racist propaganda, while others have cheered the company and actress for refusing to apologize in the wake of social media outrage which many view a bad faith take on something that's meant to be playful.

	But here's how Colbert — who recently learned his CBS series will come to end next year — seemed to find the matter rather silly when he laughingly weighed in Wednesday night (video below).

	“I don't want to alarm you, but the internet is mad about something,” Colbert said. “This time, it's a commercial from American Eagle Outfitters starring Sydney Sweeney, take take a look.” Colbert plays the clip. “Just like Sydney Sweeney, I also carry the gene for sexy commercial scratchy voice. I get it from my uncle on my mother's side … Now, some people look at this and they're seeing something sinister, saying that the genes-jeans denim wordplay in an ad featuring a white blonde woman means American Eagle could be promoting eugenics, white supremacy and Nazi propaganda. That might be a bit of an overreaction — although Hitler did briefly model for Mein Kampfort Fit Jeans.” Colbert added: “How do you say ‘badonk' in German?”

	











	Some of Colbert's fans pushed back on Instagram, writing messages like, “Is it overreaction to observe and point out propaganda in times like these?” and “If not a subtle message of White Supremacy, and Nazi Propaganda, then why only blonde hair blue eyes, and no other races were featured?” and “I don't think it's an overreaction. They knew exactly what they were doing when they made the commercial. So the blue eyed blonde has the best genes?” 


	The controversy has been compared to a rather similar sexy Calvin Klein ad from the 1980s featuring actress Brooke Shields when she was only 15. Shields told Vogue in 2021 that she found the backlash “ridiculous.” 


	In recent days, the White House also sounded off about the ad, with spokesman Steven Cheung sharing an MSNBC story with the headline “Sydney Sweeney's ad shows an unbridled cultural shift towards whiteness” and wrote: “Cancel culture run amok. This warped, moronic, and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way they did in 2024. They're tired of this bulls**t.”

The star's lawyers say he was merely ""producing amateur pornography"" and that he's protected by the First Amendment.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Sean “Diddy” Combs filed a motion to overturn his prostitution convictions, saying the government “painted him as a monster” but that the jury “rejected” the case — and that the “freak-offs” were just pornographic movie shoots protected by free speech.


	Combs was acquitted earlier this month on the most serious criminal charges he faced over drug-fueled sex marathons called “freak-offs,” but was convicted on two lesser counts of interstate prostitution.


	In a new filing on Thursday, his lawyers took the long-awaited move of seeking to have that even those lesser convictions thrown out entirely. They say the outcome was “unprecedented” in the history of the federal prostitution law.


	“Sean Combs sits in jail based on evidence that he paid adult male escorts and entertainers who engaged in consensual sexual activities with his former girlfriends, which he videotaped and later watched with the girlfriends,” writes Marc Agnfilo and Diddy's other lawyers. “That is not prostitution, and if it is, his conviction is unconstitutional.”


	In addition to arguing that the “freak-offs” did not actually legally count as prostitution, Diddy's lawyers are also making a creative alternate argument: That his actions were protected free speech under the First Amendment.


	“He was producing amateur pornography for later private viewing,” they write. “This is protected First Amendment conduct that no substantial government interest justifies prohibiting, since the films depicted adults voluntarily engaging in consensual activity.”


	Combs was arrested and charged last year with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations over accusations that he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating the freak-offs — elaborate events which he allegedly forced his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	But following a blockbuster trial in May and June, a jury cleared Combs on the RICO and sex trafficking charges. The rapper was found guilty on two other counts for transporting Ventura, another woman and various sex workers across state lines for the purposes of prostitution.


	Combs will face sentencing on those convictions in October; sentencing guidelines suggest he'll likely receive between two and five years in prison. 


	Legal filings are not the only avenue Combs is pursuing to clear his name. President Trump is reportedly “heavily weighing” giving him a full presidential pardon after several of his associates have pitched the White House on such a move.

	The Foo Fighters have brought on Nine Inch Nails drummer IIan Rubin ahead of their upcoming tour across Indonesia, Singapore and Japan, Billboard has confirmed.


	As first reported by THR.com, Rubin replaces drummer Josh Freese, who parted ways with Dave Grohl‘s rock outfit in May. Freese had joined the Foo Fighters in May 2023 to fill the spot left by the passing of the late Taylor Hawkins. In a strange plot twist, Freese will now reportedly join Nine Inch Nails to fill in for Rubin on Nine Inch Nails' Peel it Back tour.

	‘KPop Demon Hunters' is dominating the Billboard 200, the Hot 100 and the Global 200, and Billboard staffers sat down to share why the movie's soundtrack has become a global phenomenon, plus BTS showing the soundtrack some love, BLACKPINK's comeback with “JUMP,” and more. They also dive into statistics of K-pop fans, how the genre has taken over the world and more!


	What do you think of ‘KPop Demon Hunters'? Let us know in the comments!


	Tetris Kelly:


	‘KPop Demon Hunters' is taking over the charts and fans, including BTS themselves. BLACKPINK's comeback is massive. We chat with staff after Billboard has surveyed its K-pop readers to find out the info behind the phenomenon. Hey, what's up, guys? Thanks for hanging out and talking all things K-pop with me. You know where we got to start, and it is ‘KPop Demon Hunters.' What is going on with this movie, and why has it taken over everybody?


	Eric Frankenberg:


	Yeah, I mean this movie is on Netflix, and the soundtrack is absolutely everywhere. It was No. 2 last week on the Billboard 200, and four of the songs are in the top 10 this week on the Global 200. To be clear, BTS has never had four songs in the top 10 of the Global 200, BLACKPINK has never done it. This is historic success for K-pop.


	Jason Lipshutz:


	Yeah, what's interesting to me is that we're seeing a little bit of like an ‘Encanto' effect, right, where you have a movie that is streaming, that is reaching millions of homes, and people are loving and spreading through word of mouth, and then you have all the songs where they start spiking on Spotify and Apple Music, because people want to go straight from the film into the soundtrack and listen to all the songs again. So not only do you have a song like “Golden,” which has hit the top 10 of the Hot 100, but you have so many songs from the soundtrack because people want to discover the entirety of the music, and it's become this kind of multi-platform phenomenon that has really spread slowly, but also like now that we're a month into it and a month-plus into it, is just like a total juggernaut.

The superstar just wrapped his Forget Tomorrow World Tour.

	Hannah Dailey



	One day after closing out his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, Justin Timberlake has revealed that he was quietly suffering with Lyme disease throughout the trek.


	In a vulnerable Instagram post Thursday (July 31), the pop star shared photos from his time on the road and wrote, “As I'm reflecting on the tour and festival tour — I want to tell you a little bit about what's going on with me.”

	Timberlake went on to announce, “Among other things, I've been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease — which I don't say so you feel bad for me — but to shed some light on what I've been up against behind the scenes.” 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“If you've experienced this disease or know someone who has — then you're aware: living with this can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically,” he continued. “When I first got the diagnosis I was shocked for sure. But, at least I could understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness. I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going.”




	According to the Mayo Clinic, Lyme disease is caused by borrelia bacteria, which is carried by some ticks. Humans who contract the illness usually do so after being bitten by one of those ticks, often in a wooded area. Symptoms of the disease include rashes, body pain and stiffness, muscle weakness and immune-system issues. 


	Timberlake isn't the first musician who's publicly shared his Lyme diagnosis, with Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Justin Bieber and more stars also previously speaking about their struggles with the illness.


	Timberlake's post marks the end of more than a year of touring on his Forget Tomorrow trek, which kicked off in April 2024, about one month after he released album Everything I Thought It Was. The trek made Timberlake the 10th top touring artist of Billboard‘s midyear Boxscore report, grossing $73.2 million across 41 shows as of late May.

Film Editor


Jeremy Strong is in line for a role in the upcoming The Social Network Part II, and sources say he is the top choice to play META CEO and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Sources say no formal offer has been presented but that he is the top choice.


	Deadline first reported last night that Jeremy Allen White and Mikey Madison are top choices to star in the follow-up movie, with Aaron Sorkin writing and directing.


	Sony and reps for Strong had no comment.


	Deadline first reported in June that Sorkin would direct and pen a sequel after years of figuring out what angle he wanted to pursue telling the next chapter in the Facebook story. The new film project is in development with Todd Black, Peter Rice, Sorkin and Stuart Besser producing. In the first film, Zuckerberg was played by Jesse Eisenberg, who went on to receive an Oscar nomination for the role.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The film is not a straight sequel but rather a follow-up to the original 2010 movie that explored the beginnings of what would become the world's biggest social media platform.


	Sorkin's original screenplay for the new movie explores the story behind the Wall Street Journal‘s The Facebook Files by Jeff Horowitz, an explosive series of articles published in October 2021 that exposed the inner workings of — and multiple harms caused by — Facebook. Ideally, White would play Horowitz and Madison would play the whistleblower behind the series of articles.


	Strong is repped by WME and Range.

Jesus fucking christ, not everything needs a sequel, especially things like this.

Why would Jesse Eisenberg play the role again, especially after receiving an oscar nomination previously?

Change the title of the movie then. If it's not Eisenberg playing him again so what's the point calling it The Social Network II.

Because the star isn't Zuckerberg, it's the machinations of 'Facebook.'

	The Pinellas County Medical Examiner has determined the official cause of death for pro wrestling icon Hulk Hogan.


	Hogan (real name Terry Bollea) died of acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, according to the cremation summary approval report obtained by Deadline. According to the report (read it here), the WWE legend had a history of atrial fibrillation, a heart condition known as AFib characterized by an irregular and often rapid heart rate, and as well as a history of leukemia CLL, a type of blood cancer where the bone marrow produces too many lymphocytes — a type of white blood cell — which then spread to the blood and other parts of the body.

	











Hogan died July 24 in Clearwater, FL. Local police said Hogan suffered cardiac arrest at his home and was pronounced dead at a hospital. He was 71.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Hogan's pro wrestling career began in the late 1970s, and he joined what then was known as the World Wrestling Federation in 1979. His first stint at WWF lasted only a couple of years but included memorable bouts with the likes of Andre the Giant and others. 


RELATED: 2025 Deaths Photo Gallery: Hollywood & Media Obituaries


	A WWE Hall of Famer Known for his showmanship in the ring, Hogan won multiple world championships across companies, most notably being a six-time WWE World Champion.


	News of Hogan's death came three days after Fox Nation secured rights to air Real American Freestyle, the wrestling league started by WWE Hall of Famer Hogan, Eric Bischoff and Chad Bronstein.


	In a statement, CEO and Co-founder Bronstein said: “We lost our Commissioner. We lost a friend. And the sport of wrestling lost one of its greatest champions, not just in the ring, but in spirit. Hulk Hogan believed wrestling was more than just entertainment. He saw it as a brotherhood, a proving ground and a platform for greatness. That's what Real American Freestyle was built to be, a new stage for the toughest, most passionate athletes on Earth. And Hulk was at the center of it.

	











	“From day one,” he continued, “he threw his weight behind this league. He met with athletes. He watched tape, shared stories, and showed up like only he could. RAF was personal to him, something bigger than all of us. This league is part of his legacy, and we intend to honor it.”


	The New York Post was first to report Hogan's cause of death.

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: A first look of Oscar-nominated Italian star Giancarlo Giannini and Tatiana Luter on the set of Italy-set thriller Bunny-Man has been unveiled as filming begins in Rome.


	Giannini and Luter play Judge Gladwell and his wife who are integral to the plot of the thriller, also featuring James Franco, Bella Thorne, Mike Tyson, Debora Nascimento, Meredith Mickelson, and Lexi Coons in the cast.


	The film is produced by Andrea Iervolino, who has yet to reveal the identity of the director.


	It tells the story of the double life of a multimillionaire hip-hop artist known as Bunny-Man (his stage name), whose fame and public persona mask a web of pain, revenge, and private justice. His seemingly perfect life is shattered by the tragic suicide of his sister, a consequence of a brutal sexual assault. Bunny-Man then embarks on a mission to expose those responsible for this horrific crime and confront a corrupt system.

	The characters of Judge Gladwell and his wife Luise lie at the heart of the corruption driving the story. Thanks to the judge's manipulation, the two young perpetrators of the assault against the protagonist's sister manage to walk free. 


	These wealthy young men relied on the criminal Mr. Fox, who orchestrated the scheme by exploiting his passionate affair with Judge Gladwell's wife. To reach the culprits, Bunny-Man must retrace the criminal web step by step, confronting every figure involved in this network of complicity and silence.

	











	“I'm proud to welcome two outstanding Italian performers to the cast – Oscar-nominated actor Giancarlo Giannini and Tatiana Luter, who also stars in Maserati and brings both elegance and on-screen presence. Their addition further elevates an ambitious international project like Bunny-Man, which, while keeping the pace of a thriller, tackles a deep theme with intelligence and powerful narrative impact,” said Iervolino.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Josh Gad, Andrew Rannells making TV show out of barely remembered John Ritter flick Stay Tuned","https://www.avclub.com/josh-gad-andrew-rannells-stay-tuned-john-ritter","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 03:38:00 GMT","

We'll say this for Hulu's plans to drop Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells into a TV series loosely based on 1992 John Ritter/Pam Dawber/We Don't Talk About Jeffrey Jones These Days “classic” comedy film Stay Tuned: At least it's not conventional reboot material.

This is per Deadline, which reports that Gad and Rannells will star in a show, developed by Akiva Goldsman, Greg Lessans, and showrunner Jordan Cahan, that'll tap into a rich cinematic universe previously only available to kids home sick from school in 1993, and thus subjected to the whims of whatever budget-minded weirdo was programming the local afternoon movie. (Speaking of Jones, we feel like this thing was always fighting for airtime with Mom And Dad Save The World.) The premise, admittedly, is evergreen: Folks get sucked into the TV, the TV tries to kill them, creatives get to flip through genres, styles, and even between live-action and animation as needed. (The original movie had a handwaved plot about Hell trying to bump up its numbers, but it's not clear if the new TV show will use that premise, or something more sci-fi/Space Jam 2-y.)

﻿

Gad and Rannells—who became friends after starring together in The Book Of Mormon, but who've never done a film or TV project together—both issued “fun” joke-y statements about the news, which we now print here, unaltered, for you to mercilessly judge. Gad: “For over a decade Andrew and I have been the Laverne and Shirley of our generation (according to our mothers). It only makes sense to now do a TV series where we can literally do an episode as Laverne And Shirley (assuming the rights to those characters aren't prohibitively expensive and that the algorithm rewards Laverne And Shirley viewership).” And Rannells: “Personally, Josh and I have always reminded me more of a Sam and Diane or at times a Cagney and Lacey, but either way, I am thrilled we are reuniting once again! This time with Akiva, Greg and Jordan, who seem even more unhinged than we are.”

(We'll personally give Rannells the point—less labored—but it was a close-run match. Well-played to both teams)

Cahan previously worked with Rannells on Showtime series Black Monday. Neither of them, as far as we can tell, have any experience with turning popular actors into cartoon mice for what will later turn out to be way less of a movie's run time than the trailer would like you to believe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Comedy Central sounds pretty happy about South Park riling so many people up","https://www.avclub.com/south-park-rerun-highly-rated-social-media","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 01:55:00 GMT","

If you ever find yourself wondering why billion-dollar business deals, lawsuits, etc. sometimes hinge on that one Comedy Central TV show where the CGI paper cut-outs do fart jokes at each other, it may be worth looking at some statistics. Paramount released a fresh piece of bragformation this week, for instance, explaining to the uninformed just how big an impact South Park still has in its 27th season, with the show's premiere last week becoming the most-watched thing on cable, most talked-about thing on social media, and its most viewed-premiere in years. (Highest straight ratings since 2022, and the highest share of viewers the show has grabbed with a premiere since 1999.)

Comedy Central already revealed that it would be running the premiere again as an “encore” this week, rather than rolling out the next episode of the season. (Reportedly centered on ICE.) In light of the crowing in its press release today, the decision takes on a certain “ain't broke, don't fix” vibe; if the rerun of “Sermon On The ‘Mount” —inviting viewers who missed seeing a deepfaked Donald Trump with a tiny penis with googly eyes on it the first time—does even a fraction of the original numbers, it'll still be a hefty success.

Certainly, reactions to the episode have cemented Trey Parker and Matt Stone's reputations as provocateurs, if nothing else: Introducing Trump—who'd previously been addressed on the show through stand-in characters—directly into the South Park world, and having him threaten the town into silence with lawsuits very much like the ones he's been using to bully companies like series co-owners Paramount, had the desired effect, pulling a typically apoplectic response from the White House last week. (It also apparently provoked days' worth of arguments over whether the micropenis in question—running as a “live-action” PSA the town is forced to make as part of the terms of its settlement with Trump—could run un-blurred.) Say what you like about this particular brand of satire: It makes for a hell of a marketing tool.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix's The Sandman bows out with a mostly decent special","https://www.avclub.com/the-sandman-special-recap-death-the-high-cost-of-living","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 08:01:00 GMT","

The Sandman concludes with a special bonus episode that is thankfully better than the drudgery that was the end of its second season. That said, Netflix's mostly decent adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Chris Bachelo's Death: The High Cost Of Living can still feel, unfortunately, a few decades too late.

Published in 1993 as a three-issue limited series, the original work is an entertaining story but not one that's incredibly novel. Death walking briefly among us as a mortal is a popular conceit, and the Netflix adaptation makes some changes to the main characters that end up lessening the tale's impact.

Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) befriends the suicidal Sexton (Colin Morgan), who learns something about himself and life in general. The manic pixie dream girl trope has its share of issues, but it was less of a documented cliché when the comic was released. And this adaptation doesn't challenge this dynamic in any meaningful way for the modern setting.

In Gaiman's original story, Sexton is 16 years old, angsty, rude, and willfully miserable—in other words, a fairly normal teenager. Here, he's a full-grown man in his thirties. This was perhaps a necessary change because Howell-Baptiste's Death is also a full-grown woman and not a quirky 16-year-old girl like she is in the comics. There's no hint of actual romantic interest between the two, though, so the show's creators could have kept Sexton a teenager. It would've helped his character or at least justified some of his negative traits. He's almost a total narrative rock, who the vivacious Death drags from place to place, while he mostly complains. Amazingly, his dour, self-pitying personality manages to impress a young woman named Jackie (Ellie Mejia). It's as if Sexton has traveled to the Dreaming.

When the episode starts, Sexton has a serious accident that viewers might assume is fatal once Death arrives. Her appearance in the waking world is rarely good news. However, she quickly reassures Sexton that this is her day off. She invites Sexton back to her flat to tend to his injuries and fix his shirt. (It was his pants in the book, which was funnier and more flirtatious.) Death explains that every 100 years, she spends one day as a human. This helps her fully appreciate life. In the comic, she lives in a ramshackle apartment that contains a picture of Death (a.k.a. Didi) with a family who never existed. It's the universe's way of making her feel comfortable, she says. Netflix removes the photo but keeps the line, so it seems as if the universe is just responsible for her spacious apartment in London's hip Shoreditch neighborhood.

The script also cuts out a humanizing moment for Sexton, when he shows genuine concern for this strange person who claims she's Death and suggests that she seeks help. The TV Sexton doesn't believe she's Death, either, but he doesn't try to assist her. He just leaves, annoyed. That's when he encounters Mad Hettie (Clare Higgins), who forces him back to Death's flat and threatens to kill him if she doesn't locate her missing soul. She'd kept it hidden so Death could never take it, but now she's forgotten where it is. Death agrees to find it for her, dragging Sexton along for the adventure he refuses to actually enjoy.

In a story involving a boring stiff and the beautiful eccentric who likes him anyway,  the stiff should actually want something—anything—even if it's a dull pursuit, like the old dinosaur bones in Bringing Up Baby. Sexton is a passive, unwilling observer. Death and Sexton end up at a nightclub—its own form of death—where they bump into Sexton's flatmate and her girlfriend. This is also where Sexton meets Jackie, and Death proves a capable winglady but not the best judge of character. She goes dancing with club bartender Theo (Jonno Davies), who invites her on a private tour of the club, but it's all a trick. He knows who she is and steals her ankh necklace, assuming this will give him power over life and death. But the necklace itself has no powers—and it's not even that nice of a piece.

The irony, of course, is that Theo covets a power he already possesses. Death herself lacks free will. Like her Endless family, she is defined by her duties, which drive her. She can't choose anything else. She quickly corrects Sexton when he assumes she actively kills people. That's a choice she can never make. Yet, while human, she can make decisions that harm others.  

After escaping Theo, Death buys a new necklace as well as jewelry containing Mad Hettie's soul—a resolution that's heartbreaking. When her 24 hours are finally up, Didi dies and wakes to meet Death, a moment Howell-Baptiste makes both tragic and uplifting. In the book, Sexton learns to enjoy life by falling in love with Death. Alas, there's no such poetic irony here. Death leaves Sexton with a happy ending that he does nothing to earn.

The drama surrounding the position of drummer for long-running rock band Foo Fighters—which started out sad, in the wake of Taylor Hawkins' death, and then fractious, after the band announced it was firing his replacement, Josh Freese—has now somehow gotten even weirder. To wit: THR is reporting that the band has now, in essence, pulled a drummer swap with fellow veteran rockers Nine Inch Nails. According to the report, the latter group's long-time touring drummer, Ilan Rubin—who started playing with Nine Inch Nails when he was just 21, and was inducted with them into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2020—informed Trent Reznor last week that he'd taken a job with another band. Lo and behold, sources report today he's been tapped as the new drummer of Foo Fighters. Coincidentally or not, the news broke at pretty much the exact same time that Nine Inch Nails announced its own new drummer… former Foo Fighters member Josh Freese.

Now, to be fair, Freese has a long history with Reznor: As part of his long journeyman career as a professional drummer, he was NIN's touring drummer from 2005 to 2008, and played on two of the band's albums, Year Zero and The Slip. It doesn't make the timing of all this seem any less weird, though, especially because THR‘s report sure makes it sounds like Dave Grohl and company poached Rubin away from Nine Inch Nails just as Foo Fighters gear up for new shows starting in Southeast Asia this fall. It's not entirely clear at present whether either of these positions are “full-time” drumming jobs, or just touring gigs; Nine Inch Nails, at least, enthusiastically posted the news on their Instagram Story, announcing Freese with a “LET'S FUCKING GO”.

Foo Fighters put out their first new song in a minute earlier this month, accompanied by a statement that (very briefly) thanked Freese for his time in the band. Freese previously stated on social media that the members of Foo Fighters simply called him up one day and told him they were “going in a different direction,” with no reason given. He's since made at least a bit of a joke out of the firing, including posting a joke-y “Top 10 possible reasons Freese got booted from the Foos” list to his Instagram.

“Dancing With The Stars,” known for casting the likes of former Olympic athletes and A-list actors, has never shied away from recruiting former reality TV show stars to boogie, shimmy and shake their way to the coveted Mirror Ball trophy. In 2024 alone, reality stars like Jenn Tran (“The Bachelorette”), Phaedra Parks (“Real Housewives”) and Joey Graziadei (“The Bachelor”) joined the long-running celebrity dance competition series for its 33rd season. 

Reality stars were similarly contacted to join the cast of the show's upcoming 34th season, set to premiere on September 10, 2025. While some, like “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, accepted the offer, others, namely legendary “Survivor” player Rob “Boston Rob” Mariano, allegedly declined the opportunity. 

Boston Rob made his first reality TV appearance on the cast of “Survivor: Marquesas” in 2002 before returning to the competition series for “Survivor: All Stars,” “Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains,” “Survivor: Redemption Island,” which he won, and “Survivor: Winners at War.” He similarly appeared as a mentor to contestants on “Survivor: Island of the Idols.” 

Widely known as one of the greatest “Survivor” players in history, Boston Rob currently holds the record for the most days of “Survivor” played. 

In 2025, following his successful career on the series, Boston Rob was recruited for appearances on other reality competition shows, including “Deal or No Deal Island” and “The Traitors,” where his role as one of the season's cloaked assassins cemented his fan-favorite status. 

While Mariano has since expressed that he's more-or-less “retired” from reality TV, an unidentified source speaking to The US Sun regarding leaked casting decisions for “Dancing With The Stars” Season 34, claimed that the “Survivor” star was “approached” by producers earlier this year. 

“After ‘The Traitors' hype, he was another top name,” the source added. 

Mariano allegedly turned down the opportunity. “‘DWTS' isn't his style, and he has his own projects in the works he is focusing on,” the source revealed. 

While the report made it clear that Boston Rob won't be joining “DWTS,” the inside source added that Mariano's “The Traitors” Season 3 co-star, Dylan Efron, is “still in the running” to join the as-yet incomplete cast. 

So far, only wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin, social media star Alix Earle, and “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” stars  Whitney Leavitt and Jennifer Affleck have been confirmed as contestants on “DWTS” Season 34. Does this mean that Efron is likely to appear on ABC screens this September? According to the inside source, “He's not counted out yet.”

“They would've loved to have both [Boston Rob] and Dylan Efron on the season,” they added, explaining that producers allegedly hope to “pull in younger viewers” by capitalizing on the Emmy-winning success of shows like “The Traitors.”

“These guys, mixed with the influencers and reality stars will, they're hoping, get some more Gen Z interest,” the source concluded. 

Keep in mind that these are purely rumors and may not reflect any actual casting decisions from ABC. As to whether Dylan Efron will join “Dancing With The Stars” in Boston Rob's stead, only time will tell. 

Season 34 of “Dancing With The Stars” will return to ABC and Disney+ on Tuesday, September 16, 2025 at 8:00pm ET.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lindsay Lohan Leaves Kelly Ripa Stunned: Why She Left Hollywood for Dubai","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/lindsay-lohan-dubai-hollywood-privacy/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 03:49:40 GMT","

During a recent appearance on “Live with Kelly and Mark,” Lindsay Lohan revealed why she left Hollywood behind for a quieter, more private life in Dubai. 

The 39-year-old actress, known for her leading roles in films such as “The Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls,” explained that the city's strict privacy laws were a major factor in her decision.

A post shared by LIVE with Kelly and Mark (@livekellyandmark)

“It's just far away from Hollywood, and I live a very normal life,” Lohan said. “There's no worry of, like, I can't go eat at this place 'cause someone's gonna take a picture of my son. And it's just, I feel very safe.”

When host Kelly Ripa asked if paparazzi were a concern in Dubai, Lohan surprised her by saying that the laws around photography are much stricter than in the U.S.

“No, it's not legal,” Lohan explained. “You can't even take a picture of someone else if you're at a restaurant. You have to ask the person, which is a big difference from here.”

Ripa responded in shock, “What? That's incredible!”

“Yeah, privacy is key,” Lohan reiterated.

A post shared by LIVE with Kelly and Mark (@livekellyandmark)

Lohan has lived in Dubai since 2014. In 2022, she married financier Bader Shammas, and in 2023, the couple welcomed their son, Luai. For Lohan, relocating abroad has provided the stability she sought after years in the public eye.

The “Liz & Dick” star has been candid about her complicated relationship with fame. In a 2018 interview with Paper magazine, she shared, “I could do 99 things right and one thing wrong, but it's that one thing that will be focused on.”

“Behind the scenes, I do what I can to be the best version of me, which never gets mentioned,” she added. “I am also human. I make mistakes. That's all that seems to get reported.”

Now, Lohan is promoting her latest film, “Freakier Friday,” a sequel to the 2003 comedy “Freaky Friday.” The movie, which premieres in theaters Aug. 8, reunites her with co-star Jamie Lee Curtis.

In a recent interview with Page Six, Lohan recalled a key piece of advice from Curtis: “She said, ‘How you show up on set is how the whole crew feels. You control the energy that goes on set, so always bring your best self.”

“It's very full circle for me,” she said of the reunion. “And it was just a really exciting day when we were first there, all together.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Catherine Zeta-Jones Rocks Jaw-Dropping Red Carpet Look at ‘Wednesday' Premiere","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/catherine-zeta-jones-wednesday-premiere-dress/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Catherine Zeta-Jones stepped back into full Morticia Addams mode for the “Wednesday” season 2, Part 1 premiere—and did so with dramatic flair. Attending the red carpet event in London on July 30, the 54-year-old actress turned heads in a vampy black gown that gave gothic glamour a sculptural upgrade.

The bold look featured a plunging chest cutout that dipped to her midriff, paired with a thigh-high slit and an open back with a keyhole design. Sculpted 3D mesh ruffles added dramatic flare to the gown, bringing movement and Morticia-worthy edge to the overall silhouette. Zeta-Jones finished the look with fishnet heels, a sleek ballerina bun, bold smoky eyes, a deep plum lip, and glittering spider-inspired ear cuffs that tied the whole gothic glam together.

She joined co-stars including Jenna Ortega, Luis Guzmán and Fred Armisen at Westminster's Central Hall, where the cast gathered ahead of the show's return to Netflix. Ortega opted for a nude snakeskin-print gown, while Zeta-Jones leaned fully into her character's dark feminine energy—marking a return to the haunting glamour fans have come to expect.

Just days earlier, Zeta-Jones surprised fans with a completely different aesthetic during the “Wednesday” season 2 photo call at London's Natural History Museum. On July 28, she traded in her signature gothic gowns for a fashion-forward silver power suit that looked plucked straight out of “Emily in Paris”, per InStyle.

A post shared by Catherine Zeta-Jones (@catherinezetajones)

Her tailored blazer and plunging blouse combo was styled with wide-leg trousers and towering dove gray platform heels by Le Silla. Zeta-Jones accessorized the outfit with black riding gloves featuring silver chain accents, silver cross earrings, and a black fishnet beret. With soft curls, a smoky eye, and a deep plum lip, she struck a balance between polished and edgy.

During this week's press events, Zeta-Jones proved her style versatility, effortlessly moving between gothic glam and chic European tailoring.

A post shared by Catherine Zeta-Jones (@catherinezetajones)

Zeta-Jones' premiere tour arrives just ahead of “Wednesday” season 2's two-part debut on Netflix. Part 1 of the hit Tim Burton series premieres August 6, followed by Part 2 on September 3. The show, led by Jenna Ortega, returns after its massive season 1 success, which earned over 252 million views and 12 Emmy nominations.

This season teases a darker tone, focusing on a chilling vision Wednesday has of her roommate Enid's death—an event she believes she may be responsible for. New cast members include Billie Piper, Steve Buscemi, Owen Painter, and Lady Gaga in a yet-to-be-revealed role. 

The new season reportedly promises expanded family dynamics, more horror, and a deeper look into Wednesday's relationship with her mother. A spinoff series centered around Uncle Fester is also in development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Oscar-Winner Is Pursuing Master's Degree at Harvard","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jessica-chastain-pursuing-harvard-masters-degree/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:58:04 GMT","

An Oscar-winning actress is swapping the red carpet for the classroom. Jessica Chastain, who is recognized for her spectacular performances in “Interstellar” and “The Help,” is officially back in school! 

As per a report published by Variety, the “Mother's Instinct” actress has enrolled in the two-year Master's in Public Administration (MPA) program at Harvard University‘s John F. Kennedy School of Government. The star has been spotted on the Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus this summer, attending classes.

According to Harvard's official site, the program is “for aspiring leaders with real-world experience and graduate-level coursework in economics, public policy, or management.”

Students in the program customize their curriculum to align with their personal and professional goals. The flexibility allows them to focus on areas such as leadership, economics, and global policy.

Chastain's academic path has been impressive. She previously attended Sacramento City College and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts before graduating from Juilliard in 2003 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in drama.

In 2024, she received an honorary doctorate from Juilliard for her “outstanding contributions” to film and theatre.

Chastain made her film debut in 2008's “Jolene,” but it was her portrayal of Tammy Faye Bakker in “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” (2021) that earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as a SAG Award and Critics' Choice Award. 

A post shared by Jessica Chastain (@jessicachastain)

She also made her Broadway debut in 2012 in “The Heiress.”

A post shared by Jessica Chastain (@jessicachastain)

She earned a Golden Globe for Best Actress in 2013 for her performance in “Zero Dark Thirty” and later took home the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2022.

A post shared by Jessica Chastain (@jessicachastain)

Up next, Chastain stars in “Dreams”, a romantic drama about a wealthy socialite and a Mexican ballet dancer who fall in love, set for release in October 2025.

Beyond acting, Chastain has long been a champion of gender equality and women's reproductive rights. She was honored at Variety's Power of Women luncheon in 2017 for her work with Planned Parenthood, an organization she credited for giving her access to affordable birth control early in her life.



“[It] makes it possible for a woman to have the equal opportunity of her male counterparts of having jurisdiction over her body, her life, and her health,” she said at the time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Latest Explosive 2025 DWTS Casting Rumors for the New Season","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/2025-dwts-casting-rumors-season-34/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:59:37 GMT","

“Dancing With the Stars” is building unprecedented excitement for Season 34 with an unusually early reveal strategy, having announced four celebrity contestants months ahead of the September 16 premiere date on ABC. 

While the show typically keeps casting details under wraps until closer to airtime, this year's transparent approach has ignited a wildfire of speculation about which additional stars might grace the ballroom floor.

The rumor mill is working overtime as fans dissect every social media interaction and industry insider comment for clues about potential surprise additions. Social media platforms are buzzing with theories, while judges and professional dancers have been dropping hints that have sent the fan community into overdrive. 

Even entertainment outlets are reporting that “DWTS” bosses are actively pursuing high-profile celebrities from various reality franchises and Hollywood circles.

What makes this season particularly intriguing is the mix of confirmed contestants already announced and the tantalizing possibility of major surprises still to come. The four officially revealed stars represent a diverse blend of social media influence, reality TV fame, and wildlife conservation advocacy, suggesting producers are casting a wide net for maximum audience appeal. 

With several months remaining before the full cast announcement, the speculation continues to intensify as more potential contestants emerge in industry conversations.

The speculation has reached fever pitch with reality TV veterans leading the conversation. Dylan Efron, fresh off his “Traitors” victory, is generating serious buzz after receiving the encouraging comments, “See you on the dance floor?” from Judge Derek Hough on Instagram. Meanwhile, Bachelor Nation stars are practically lining up for their chance at mirror ball glory, with current “Bachelor” Grant Ellis telling Parade exclusively that he “wouldn't say no” if offered a spot, and previous show winner Kelsey Anderson openly campaigning for her own opportunity, telling Swooon, “[Maybe I'll] get my Dancing with the Stars moment. Maybe I'll win.”

Even more intriguing are the whispers surrounding potential surprise additions. Boston Rob Mariano has been coyly deflecting questions about his “DWTS” participation with cryptic responses, telling Access Hollywood he “cannot confirm or deny anything.” Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag have been championed by Derek Hough himself after the couple's devastating wildfire losses, while The Sun reported that show bosses are “in talks” with a major Twilight actor and an “extremely controversial” reality star, though Parade has since debunked the Taylor Lautner rumors as having “no truth whatsoever.”

Wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin made history as the first announced “DWTS” contestant back in April, following in the footsteps of his sister Bindi Irwin, who claimed victory in Season 21. “I cannot tell you what an honor, what a privilege it is to be joining this season,” Robert shared at Hulu's “Get Real!” event, according to Parade.

Social media sensation Alix Earle joined the confirmed lineup in May, bringing her massive online following to the ballroom. The influencer expressed her enthusiasm during her “Good Morning America” reveal, telling hosts Lara Spencer and Michael Strahan: “I used to watch it when I was so young with my grandma. When this opportunity came to me, it was like, ‘What can I do next? Where can I take this?'”

The “DWTS” casting news took an unexpected turn in July when two stars from Hulu's “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” were announced during the show's reunion special. Both Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt will trade Utah for Los Angeles to compete for the coveted Len Goodman Mirror Ball Trophy. Whitney recently posted on social media: “Get ready cause I do be comin for that mirrorball.”

The professional dancer lineup appears largely unchanged from last season, with favorites like Val Chmerkovskiy, Jenna Johnson, and Daniella Karagach expected to return. Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough will continue as co-hosts, while the judging panel remains intact with Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli, and Derek Hough.

“Dancing With the Stars” Season 34 premieres Tuesday, September 16, on ABC and Disney+, with additional casting announcements expected throughout the summer.

Bravo is reportedly in the early stages of casting “Next Gen LA,” a potential spinoff of its hit series “Next Gen NYC.” While two celebrity siblings have already declined to join the cast, several Bravolebrity offspring are still considering the opportunity.

A post shared by 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐎𝐍 𝐁𝐀𝐑𝐊𝐄𝐑 𝐅𝐀𝐍 𝐏𝐀𝐆𝐄 (@itsnot.landonb)

Alabama and Landon Barker won't be joining the cast of Bravo's potential new reality series “Next Gen LA,” despite speculation circulating online.

A representative for the siblings confirmed to TMZ that neither has signed on for the Los Angeles-based series, which is being developed as a companion show to Bravo's hit “Next Gen NYC.” While early reports tied the Barker siblings to the rumored project, they have reportedly declined the offer.

According to Just Jared, producers had approached several children of Bravo stars and other celebrities to appear in the yet-to-be-greenlit series. However, Alabama and Landon passed, and rumors that former Disney Channel star Skai Jackson would appear were also debunked.

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

The Los Angeles version of the successful series is expected to highlight the lives of young adults raised in the spotlight as they forge their own identities in Southern California. 

As reported by Just Jared, names said to be in consideration include Nick Dubrow, the son of “The Real Housewives of Orange County” stars Heather and Terry Dubrow; Alexia and Sophia Umansky, daughters of Kyle Richards; Preston Pippen, son of Larsa Pippen; Mason Grammer, daughter of Camille Grammer; Adrienne Maloof's sons Gavin, Colin, and Christian; and “Dance Moms” alum Nia Sioux.

On a recent episode of “Jeff Lewis Live,” Adrienne Maloof revealed her sons had been approached, saying, “They're coming to us to want to do this show… It's up to them.”

Nick Dubrow's father, Dr. Terry Dubrow, also addressed the rumors on Page Six's “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast, saying, “I can't confirm or deny, but he may have been approached. There may be some things brewing. You might want to talk to Andy Cohen about that.”

Terry added, “I think of all the ‘Next Gen' places, LA is probably the best. Think about how many people you know, both in the Bravo universe and outside of the Bravo universe, who have kids who we know. They look like their parents. They're in the LA scene. It's very dynamic.”

Additionally, Cynthia Bailey shared on “Jeff Lewis Live” that her daughter, Noelle Robinson, has also been approached. “I don't know what Noelle wants to do yet. It's totally her decision,” Bailey said. “She's been watching [the show]. I've just been like, ‘Keep watching and see how you feel about it.'”

Other rumored participants include Sophie Beador, daughter of “RHOC” star Shannon Storms Beador. Sophie was tagged in a post by celebrity stylist Julius Michael, who wrote, “The Next Generation is 🔥 @sophiebeador. All grown up and becoming the #queen she is,” alongside hashtags including #NextGen.

The tense but tender story of a criminal dad who reunites and/or runs off with his child at a crucial point in both of their lives, Nick Rowland's “She Rides Shotgun” is the kind of movie you've seen so many times before in one form (“Paper Moon”) or another (“Leave No Trace”) that it really just lives or dies on whether it gets the characters right. 

In this case, the well-trafficked road to perdition can be rather bumpy at times, and it's prone to long detours where a straight line would have been more effective. It's easy to forgive the occasional pothole or wrong turn when you care this much about the man behind the wheel — and, of course, about the little girl sitting in the passenger seat beside him.

The man is Nate McClusky (“Kingsman” and “Carry-On” star Taron Egerton, body shredded and head shaved), and he's just been released from maximum-security prison to find that a white supremacist gang called Aryan Steel has murdered his ex-wife and her new husband; we never learn much about whatever Nate did to piss them off, but it was bad enough for the group to put a nationwide “greenlight” on him, which authorizes every Nazi in the country to erase him and everyone he cares about. Nate's 10-year-old daughter Polly (richly emotive and eminently believable child actor Ana Sophia Heger) would have been their first target, but she was at school when the skinheads attacked, and Nate — peeling into the parking lot in his dead ex's car — manages to get there before the bad guys do.

 










And so the absent dad and his deeply traumatized daughter make a break for the Mexican border, the two of them blazing a trail across the American Southwest with the cops on their tail — they assume Nate is responsible for the killings — and the Nazis lurking around every corner. It's immediately apparent that Nate and Polly can't trust anyone but each other, but even that won't come easily to a little girl who's only ever known her father as a dark shadow in the corner of her mind (she calls the police as soon as she can). “I'm not a monster,” Nate feels compelled to insist during their first conversation, but he can't bring himself to say that he isn't a bad guy. 

For all of the impressively well-staged shootouts, car chases, and gas station robberies that follow, it should go without saying that everything in this movie only matters so far as it affects Nate's efforts to convince Polly that he's not a total lowlife. What makes “She Rides Shotgun” more compelling than its synopsis, however, is how fiercely it holds onto the fact that it's so much harder for Nate to convince himself of the same thing. 

Adapting Jordan Harper's 2017 pageturner of the same name, “The Night House” screenwriters Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski might struggle to enliven the overextended subplot about a stone-faced cop (“Succession” alum Rob Yang) who offers Nate his freedom in exchange for taking down New Mexico's Nazi meth kingpin (the always wonderful John Carroll Lynch, playing a merry butcher known as “The God of Slabtown”), but their emotionally lucid script makes a full meal of the many scenes between Nate and Polly. If the dialogue has a tendency to cheat toward prescriptiveness (“These days, just staying alive is an act of moral compromise,” someone declares), Nate's vivid desperation smoothes over all of the film's most pointed moments to make up for lost time. 

 










It's mentioned — with a soft touch — that Nate was led down a dark path by following in his older brother's footsteps, and “She Rides Shotgun” is refreshingly uninterested in whatever masculine ideals might stop him from empowering his kid to blaze her own trail. Nate doesn't want Polly to pay for his mistakes, but even more than that, he wants her to be at peace with the vulnerability of being a person in this world (“You gotta feel weak to get strong,” he tells her). This movie's refusal to treat Polly like a burden — like she isn't someone who Nate has been absolutely dying to raise — allows it to skip past the “begrudging” part of their dynamic and go deeper into the good stuff. 

Egerton's poignantly clenched performance aches with the pent-up frustration of a parent desperate to create something positive out of their own deficiencies, and even the “fun,” obligatory scenes where Nate teaches Polly how to survive outside the law — how to beat a Nazi in the knees with a baseball bat, or to be the lookout during a smash-and-grab — are tinged with the regret of having to bond like this. But neither the long shadow of loss nor The Lord of Slabtown can fully diminish the mutual joy that Nate and Polly get from being fugitives together. “She Rides Shotgun” gains the brunt of its horsepower from the errant traces of happiness that Rowland allows his characters to soak in as Nick dyes Polly's hair, or Polly shows Nick her math skills. 

 










It helps a great deal that Heger's performance is much better modulated than Blanck Mass' pretty but suffocatingly overbearing score, and that her fear, resolve, and adolescent confusion are balanced in a way that allows all but the film's tropiest moments to seem fundamentally believable. (The rugged New Mexico locations contribute to that credibility, as does Wyatt Garfield's gritty cinematography.) As is clear from the very first scene, and made all the more so by the very last, “She Rides Shotgun” is Polly's movie at its core, and Heger's face — a detailed portrait of love and loss, its colors all the more radiant by how they run together when she cries — is expressive enough to make it a movie worth watching even when it feels like one we've already seen a number of times before. 

Lionsgate will release “She Rides Shotgun” in theaters on Friday, August 1.

Anu Valia‘s feature directorial debut “We Strangers” not only premiered at SXSW 2024, but soon became a critically acclaimed hit — even earning the coveted IndieWire Critics' Pick title after its debut.

Now, with Quiver Distribution releasing the feature, audiences everywhere can experience the twisty genre-bender that is billed as being “Get Out” with a psychic twist. Kirby Howell-Baptiste stars as Rayelle Martin, a savvy commercial cleaner who soon realizes that there is more money to be had after privately working for one of her office clients (Hari Dhillon). Yet Rayelle's ambition may have unforeseen consequences…

 










The official synopsis reads: “Inspired by director Valia's own childhood in Gary, Indiana, where the film is set, ‘We Strangers' follows Rayelle (Howell-Baptiste), a young commercial cleaning woman who is offered a second job cleaning the homes of several rich, suburban families. To blend into her new surroundings, she inadvertently tells one white lie, which then flips the power dynamic in curious ways. This absorbing character study smartly delves into the world of identity and privilege, showing us the challenges that are baked into navigating different spaces.” Paul Adelstein, Sarah Goldberg, Maria Dizzia, and Tina Lifford also star.

“We Strangers” won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the New Orleans Film Festival, the New Hampshire Film Festival, and the Gary Black Film Festival, and was a Spotlighted Film at the Provincetown International Film Festival. Valia also won the Breakthrough Award at the Athena Film Festival in Conjunction with Barnard College, among many other accolades. 

The IndieWire review by Christian Zilko deemed the film to be a “comedy of manners where navigating the neuroses of her rich patrons is more challenging than any amount of cleaning,” adding, “It's sleek without ever being slick, managing to exist within Rayelle's new world of material comforts without ever becoming a product of it. Valia's decade of directing expensive TV episodes prepared her well for the endeavor, as each frame is composed in a way that elegantly layers the film‘s themes on top of each other. Howell-Baptiste anchors the film with a thrillingly nuanced performance, seamlessly transitioning from a character that's expected to be seen and not heard into someone who has the spotlight thrust upon them at the most inopportune moment. Her facial expressions reveal an emotional metronome that is constantly shifting between discomfort, Machiavellianism, and sincere guilt while trying to perform the endless balancing act that goes into her daily survival.”

 










Valia told IndieWire that “We Strangers” entirely embodied the empathy exhibited by film itself. “I have always been interested in the societal and political structures of American society,” Valia said. “The unwritten rules that each community follows has always struck me as concurrently fascinating and odd. Film has the ability to explore the subtext between people in incredible ways, and I wanted to look at how assimilating makes a person feel. How there can be something comforting to gaining power and control in social systems that see you as an outsider, but how that feeling can ultimately turn on you. It's something I had to really look at within myself, and this film is my attempt to create that experience for others. That's what I believe cinema does, it creates feelings, and that's all I ever want to do. That's all I'm looking for when I go to a movie.” 

She added of the feature, “I aim to create a story that sticks with you. With the title sequence, we played with the ‘afterimage,' the image that stays behind your eyes after an image is gone. Like when you look at something bright and the image is seared into your eyes for seconds after. This film is meant to be like that — I wanted to create an image that lingers, something you can turn over again and again, and hopefully return to. […] I feel so lucky to be able to share this film with a larger audience when it comes out in theaters. We're living in a time where art and the freedom to express is under attack in our country, so the ability to share a film with the world is a great gift and also a relief.” 

 










As for casting Howell-Baptiste in the lead role, Valia explained how “in awe” she was of the actress' performance. “She is a dream collaborator. She knew exactly what I was trying to explore, and she took it the role in directions I couldn't even imagine,” Valia said of how Howell-Baptiste brought the character of Rayelle to life. “She created a singular, full person who only shows us who she wants us to see —she wears masks, but it is almost impossible to tell when she has one on. It's so deceivingly simple what she's doing, but I know the hard work that went into that performance, and it's something I am in awe of and very grateful for.” 

In turn, Howell-Baptiste told IndieWire that working with Valia was an ideal partnership. “I very quickly fell in love with the way Anu tells a story,” Howell-Baptiste said. “Anu has a wonderful way of taking big, sometimes even divisive ideas, and presenting them without bias and without prejudice. Anu and I created something that now goes out into the world and has a life of its own. I had the privilege of living as Rayelle.” 

Quiver Distribution will debut “We Strangers” in limited theaters August 22 and will launch September 9 on VOD. Check out the trailer below.

Since “The Next Generation” first powered up the holodeck, “Star Trek” episodes have been able to use the fabled sci-fi device to create whatever environment someone can program. The conceit — thanks to replicator technology, holograms, and the suspension of disbelief — has given us a pipe-smoking Data playing Sherlock Holmes, Capt. Janeway starting a morally complex relationship with an Irish barman, and the creation of Vic Fontaine and his nightclub on Deep Space Nine.

Starfleet is in the early stages of developing the holodeck in the time of “Strange New Worlds,” and Season 3's “A Space Adventure Hour” has the USS Enterprise beta testing the technology. The episode follows holodeck episode tradition, and in it, we see the cast take on new characters, new costumes, and more than a few wigs.

Anson Mount's Capt. Pike tasks Christina Chong's La'an to run the nascent program through the wringer to see how it holds up. La'an, who loves a 1960s murder mystery series featuring an investigator named Amelia Moon, has Martin Quinn's Scotty upload those stories into the holodeck's programming, which then creates a new mystery for her to solve.

 










The result: Several murders in an extravagant mansion, where the suspects — wearing Enterprise crewmembers' faces — work together on a 1960s sci-fi television show called “The Last Frontier,” and have the hair and wardrobe to prove it. Mount, for example, sports a curly hairdo and a gut to play the nebbish creator of the show, while Paul Wesley's Kirk is an actor who plays a starship captain who delivers lines in a Shatner-esque style.

The episode, written by Dana Horgan and Kathryn Lyn, jumps from scenes on the psychedelic set of “The Last Frontier,” to the gaudy mansion where the murder mystery unfolds, to the USS Enterprise, where Scotty and the real crew face challenges of their own after the holodeck refuses to shut down and drains the Starfleet ship's power at inopportune moments. Things veer into silly territory, but “A Space Adventure Hour” also contains a soupçon of earnestness about the importance of sci-fi shows from that time.

The episode, in fact, was originally planned as a straightforward exploration of a 1960s sci-fi show very similar to “The Original Series,” and how Gene Roddenberry's vision was an inflection point in both American and television history. Getting to that point, however, was a challenge for the writers.

 










“We just weren't good enough,” said Akiva Goldsman in an IndieWire interview with his co-showrunner, Henry Alonso Myers. “God knows we tried, and we kept running up against either things we didn't know how to reflect or weren't right for the form. And so the deeper we got into it, a less earnest look started to evolve.”

Ultimately, Goldsman explained, the ‘60s sci-fi show became “the stone in the soup” around the rest of the story, resulting in a classic holodeck tale that also moves forward a romantic relationship between two characters. Production for the episode began two weeks before filming, and involved costumes galore (almost all of which were made in-house) and creating two new sets.

The bridge of “The Last Frontier” is colorfully zany, full of bulbous knobs and dials, and — like many shows of the ‘60s — appears to be thrown together in a short amount of time with minimal budget.

Making the set look relatively unpolished compared to today's expectations was, according to Myers, “weirdly challenging” for the departments. “We kept having to be like, ‘This is great. We need this to be simpler. This is great. We need this to look cheaper, but real.'”

“It was on the verge of being corny. In fact, it was openly corny, I think here and there,” production designer Jonathan Lee told IndieWire. “But we just leaned into the whole thing.”

 










Inspirations for Lee and costume designer Bernadette Croft (besides “The Original Series,” of course) included the Dan Dare comics, “Lost in Space,” “The Outer Limits,” “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Further efforts to make the show of a certain age included using hot tungsten lights rather than their usual LED setup and having the bridge's video screen merely be a hole in the wall.

That hole in the wall shows us the antagonistic Agonyan, played by Kira Guloien, who we also saw as the multi-armed bartender in the season's second episode. “We wanted to make it look like we dumpster dived for fabrics and just threw it together, like they would have done in the ‘60s, especially with last-minute notice,” Croft explained.

The “crafty” look of the alien was complemented by the glitter, velour, and corduroy Croft used for the characters Wesley, Jess Bush, and Melissa Navia played. And when the shot zooms out and we see the cameras and production crew for the 1960s set, we also hear another voice that may be familiar to Trekkies.

We don't see the director of the “Last Frontier” episode onscreen, though we do hear someone say, “Keep rolling! Keep rolling!” That's the voice of “Star Trek” veteran Jonathan Frakes, who is the director of this “Strange New Worlds” episode. “Frakes was very present in a lot of this,” said Myers. “He's very good at making it a fun place to play, and he very much gave that energy on set.”

 










Everyone enjoyed shooting “The Last Frontier” scenes so much, in fact, that they added one or two extra filming days on that set, including the bloopers we see at the end of the episode. “A lot of that came from Jonathan [Frakes],” said Lee. “He spotted things and said, ‘Wouldn't it be great if that happened?' So we had a door that fell off, and we built the chair with this loose panel on the side, so that if somebody just hits it the right way, it would just fall over. These were all very carefully designed. There were no accidents to any of them at all … and the blooper reel was hilarious.”

The place where all the holodeck murders happen was on location, and finding the right mansion was a challenge. “We spent weeks looking for the right house, and we just couldn't find anything that had the quirkiness that we were looking for,” said Lee.

After going through several options, Lee visited one north of Toronto that was described to him as a bit over the top: “The owner of this house was very passionate about France, and there were portraits of Napoleon, and the detailing of the house was just extraordinary — his architect put all this very elaborate Old French style architecture in there.”

 










Lee knew it was the place the minute he walked in the door. And when he shared the images with Frakes, the director “exploded with joy.”

The Canadian mansion became the place for murder, and the crew spent four or five days ramping up the gaudiness of the house with new wall art and other key pieces of dressing. All that was missing was the actors in their costumes.

Almost all of those costumes, with a few exceptions like Kirk's leather jacket and turtleneck, were made in-house by Croft's team. The actors all loved donning the new clothes and their new characters. “The best thing is how excited the cast is,” said Croft. “They get into it — they're so excited, it's infectious.”

Take Rebecca Romijn's Lucille Ball-inspired character, Sunny Lupino, whose power dress involved the most expensive fabric ever bought for the show. “She had once been an actress or model, and now she's the head of a studio, and she's got all this power,” said Croft. “So we did this late ‘60s mod dress with this beautiful, beaded embellishment that really caught the light and sparkled.”

Mount also delved into portraying TK Bellows, the creator of “The Last Frontier.” “He called me, and was like, ‘I think I need some padding,'” said Croft. “It was interesting to build a belly for Anson, and I think it really helped him get into the character. Because once you have a different physique, you slouch or change the cadence of your walk. And even the way he was posing and stuff, like he was always slouched in the chair. It was so great to see him literally the opposite of this handsome, strapping, commanding leader.”

 










“A Space Adventure Hour” also sees La'an and Ethan Peck's Spock kiss for the first time, something that was originally supposed to happen two episodes ago in “Wedding Bell Blues.” But as the story for the holodeck episode came together, including figuring out the whodunnit for the murder mystery, the writers realized that the awakening of the romance between the two characters made more sense here.

“Henry and I had pairs of scissors just cutting around the stuff we shot [for “Wedding Bell Blues,”] because that was supposed to be the first kiss,” Goldsman said, referencing the dancing scene in episode 302 between La'an and Spock.

“We were trying very hard to make a murder mystery that had a great twist at the end, one that would flip the story,” added Myers. That twist has Spock — more specifically, the holodeck's replication of Spock that La'an, until the end, thinks is the real Spock — be the murderer. La'an figures it out because she's been falling for the Vulcan. She knows what kind of person he is, and the holodeck's version of him reacts in ways the real Spock wouldn't.

La'an confesses all of this to Spock (while they're once again dancing, of course) once she solves the mystery and escapes the holodeck. The two kiss.

 










 “It's one of our favorite types of endings on the show,” said Myers about that romantic moment. “It's both gripping, and it also makes you go, ‘Well, what's happening next week?'”

“A Space Adventure Hour” is now streaming on Paramount+. New episodes of the show are released weekly.

Brian Eno has announced Together for Palestine, a concert at London's Wembley Arena raising funds for families in Gaza. It takes place on Wednesday, September 17, with a lineup to be announced. Eno, who is one of the show's executive producers, describes it as “a night of music, reflection and hope.” Tickets are available from 10 a.m. UK time on August 4.

In a statement on Instagram, Eno wrote:

I've had the good fortune to work with some of the world's most remarkable artists for over 50 years.

But one of my biggest regrets is that during that time so many of us have remained silent about Palestine.

Often that silence has come from fear - real fear - that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career.

But that's now changing - partly because some artists and activists have lit the path, but mostly because the truth of what's going on has become impossible to ignore.

What we are witnessing in Gaza isn't a mystery, and neither is it a blur of competing narratives making it ‘hard to understand'.

When dozens of non-partisan organisations like Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders describe it as genocide, the moral line is clear.

We can't remain silent.

Which is why I'm helping to organise Together for Palestine - a night of music, reflection and hope at Wembley Arena on 17th September.

My sincere belief is that this evening can become a moment of courage where artists come together to speak the truth in their hearts - which is what we trust artists to do.

Whether on stage or by video from around the world, this is a chance for us to stand together and say: this can't continue.

All donations will go to Palestinian partners via Choose Love, a UK charity supporting local humanitarians in conflict zones. “But this is about more than just money,” Eno added. “It's about sending a message of love and solidarity to the people of Palestine—that they haven't been forgotten. We see them, we hear them, and though we may be far away, we're deeply connected—as we are to all humanity.”

Khaled Ziada, Khalid Abdalla, and Tracey Seaward are Eno's fellow organizers for the concert.

The Gary, Indiana, native's pair of acclaimed mixtapes from that year, The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs and Midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik, are among the most exemplary documents of the constant exchange between rap scenes in the Midwest and the South; his runaway popularity on mixtape sites and blogs was at odds with a fetishized idea of street rappers as lagging behind the digital times. The notion persisted. A half decade later, when Gibbs and Madlib released their by then long-awaited collaborative LP, Piñata, the subtext running through reviews was difficult to miss: Gibbs was an interesting instrument for Madlib to play with, no different from some obscure bossa nova record.

Today Gibbs is a subgenre, an economy, a corner of the internet unto himself. He's been prolific on DSPs and on social media, a frequent topic on gossip blogs, a Grammy nominee. That his sometimes excellent later records can feel vaguely like grist for the content mill is a little bit on him (they tend to be dotted with references to social-media characters and his running feuds), a little bit on the ways we receive and metabolize popular art today. Yet as integrated into the algorithm as his writing can be, the reference points for Gibbs songs increasingly seem to be other Gibbs songs, as though his catalog were a large language model trained on itself. The drawbacks are obvious, but the solipsistic streak does give even his pettiest grievances stakes and dramatic shape. It worked for Pac, after all.

The Alchemist, the legendary producer whose work with Prodigy in the 2000s is among the greatest, most mercenary rap music ever made in this vein, has also spawned his own cottage industry, crafting filled LPs with rappers from across the commercial spectrum. The sense—one that Al thankfully does not indulge—that his name lends a high-art sheen to otherwise unknown or unfashionable artists has become a running joke. But that Gibbs Grammy nod did come for his lush 2020 Alchemist collaboration, Alfredo. At this point, the only oddity of the pairing is that either one's persona can accommodate the other.

At its infrequent worst, Alfredo 2—the cover is, maddeningly, a bowl of ramen—embodies the sort of autopilot comfort that could be expected from: a sequel; two busy professionals in their mid 40s with busy schedules; artists whose styles are so codified that they serve as instantly recognizable referents for multiple generations of descendants. The music slows to an indifferent lull on the Larry June-assisted “Feeling”; “Shangri La” is nearly narcotized; “Gold Feet” feels as if it could have been pulled off a hard drive that had been neglected since 2018, all the way down to its JID feature. But more often, the album pushes through that illusory ease to deliver heavier tracks and a more animated Gibbs than we've seen for some time.

After an immediately tedious intro (the electric guitar-besotted “1995”), Gibbs snaps upright on “Mar-a-Lago” and especially on “Lemon Pepper Steppers,” where he raps agitatedly—yet with total control—on the front half of the beat in each measure. Too frequently over the past 10 years, Gibbs, an almost peerless technician, has leaned on minor variances of a circular double-time flow; it would be difficult for an inferior rapper to imitate, but when deployed so often, it dulls the sense of the rapper exerting agency over the track. Here he is as deft as he's been since 2021's Bandana. That's true when he breezes through furious passages, as on the otherwise silky “Ensalada,” but also in deceptively simple moments: Take the opening verse of “Jean Claude,” the way he builds so much tension and release into the words, “drop ceiling.” On “Skinny Suge II,” he begins by quoting Ice-T's opening lines from “Colors”—but where the unflappable Ice was making a sly comment on the way the police saw him, Gibbs seems to actually channel the “nightmare walking, psychopath talking.”

Even before Miseducation and boxframe, Gibbs' gift has been that ability to marry finesse and punishment, whether the latter comes via subwoofers or through unbelievable grim imagery from Gary and beyond. “Empanadas” makes his altercations with Jim Jones and Benny the Butcher sound both grave and like minor details in a hectic week; he burrows into Al's wobbling low end like a particularly determined jackhammer. On the sleepier, softer cuts, the stock street-rap phraseology can seem like a placeholder—here, as on “Skinny Suge,” “Lemon Pepper,” and “Gas Station Sushi,” it plays as genre convention to be dismantled and rearranged by a master of the form.

Alfredo 2, by its nature, will not transform anyone's understanding of Gibbs or Alchemist, but it will likely prove commercially significant for both: Whether audiences are hungry for a pendulum swing back toward formalist rap, or this is simply the reward for years and years of accrued goodwill, it has played so far as an event album despite the artists' indifference toward radio and the press. Scuttling some of that good feeling are the jabs Gibbs throws at Curren$y on “Gas Station Sushi”; even if it's an “I'm surprised you run with them” situation, it's disheartening to hear one of Al's most beloved collaborators dissed on one of his beats. But if the machine is going to churn on, it might as well spit out objects as expert and engaged as this.

Two months after parting ways with Josh Freese, Foo Fighters have unveiled Ilan Rubin as their new drummer, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. Rubin is jumping ship after a 16-year stint with Nine Inch Nails, for whom the prospect of an imminent, drummerless tour ran into a convenient solution: They hired Josh Freese. It is unclear whether Rubin is permanently aboard with Foo Fighters or just a touring member.

Though Foo Fighters are yet to acknowledge formally their hire, Nine Inch Nails posted an Instagram story picturing Freese—who was also their drummer between 2005 and 2008—with the caption, “Let's fucking go.” They kick off a North American tour at Oakland Arena on August 6; Foo Fighters' next dates are a tour of Asia in October.

Rubin had been touring with Nine Inch Nails since 2009, a tenure that encompassed the band's Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2020, in which he was included. He has also drummed for Paramore, Angels & Airwaves, and Danny Elfman, among others. According to a Hollywood Reporter source, Rubin had committed to Nine Inch Nails through the year but told Trent Reznor last week that he had “accepted a job with another band.”

Foo Fighters brought in Freese in 2023 as the successor to their late, longtime drummer Taylor Hawkins. After two years together, Freese announced in May that the band had let him go, offering no reason beyond a decision “to go in a different direction with their drummer.” He added, “I've never been let go from a band, so while I'm not angry—just a bit shocked and disappointed. But as most of you know I've always worked freelance and bounced between bands so, I'm fine.”

Foo Fighters released their first track since his departure, “Today's Song,” this month, which came with a note thanking Freese for his time with the band and saying that, without his “thunderous wizardry,” the band's “story would be incomplete.” Their latest album, But Here We Are, came out in 2023; its predecessor, Medicine at Midnight, won the Best Rock Album Grammy one month after Hawkins' death.

Of the drummer news, Freese wrote on Instagram:

Leaving Nine Inch Nails at the end of 2008 was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. My wife and I were expecting our third child, and I knew I needed to step away from life on the road to be home with my family.

NIN was a band that left me walking off stage every single night thinking, “That was incredible. We absolutely crushed it.” And it wasn't just a feeling, it was a certainty. That level of intensity, pride, and satisfaction after each show is something I've rarely experienced anywhere else.

Now, being back on tour with Trent and the crew—helping them do what they do best night after night—is something I'm incredibly excited about. To be part of that energy again feels amazing.

If you get a chance to catch one of these shows over the next six weeks, I promise, they're going to be absolutely unforgettable.

Hope to see you out there.

There will be a new Spinal Tap album to go with the release of the long-awaited movie Spinal Tap II: The End Continues. The new album, also called The End Continues, is out September 12 via Interscope. Featured on the full-length are some guests who appear in the film: Paul McCartney, Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, and Elton John, the latter of whom is on a new version of “Stonehenge.” Check that one out below.

“Stonehenge” is one of four songs on The End Continues that's been reimagined for the new film and soundtrack. “(Listen to The) Flower People,” “Cups and Cakes,” and “Big Bottom” were also first made for This Is Spinal Tap. See the new album's full tracklist below.

(The new version of “Big Bottom,” featuring Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, is not on most digital streaming platforms due to Brooks' exclusive deal with Amazon Music.)

The End Continues is the fourth actual album from the fictitious band Spinal Tap. Their debut, This Is Spinal Tap, came out with the first film in 1984, and Break Like the Wind and Back From the Dead followed in 1992 and 2009, respectively. The band's fictional discography is far more vast.

	It turns out that the real problem with Spinal Tap‘s “Stonehenge” wasn't just that tiny onstage prop  — the song was also missing some assistance from a living rock monument. A just-released new version of the track, featuring Elton John on vocals, is the first single from the fictional metal gods' new album,The End Continues. The collection, due Sept. 12, will accompany the long-delayed sequel to 1984's This Is Spinal Tap, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, which hits theaters the same day.


	The album, available to preorder now, also includes guest vocals from Paul McCartney on “Cups and Cakes,” the twee, ultra-British ballad that was —  in the band's fictional backstory — the B-side to their single “Gimme Some Money.”  Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood also pop up, singing “Big Bottom,” a cover version that, in the new movie's story, ends up spurring the band's reunion after it goes viral.  Among the nine new songs on the album is “Rockin' In The Urn,” a suitably ludicrous ode to literal rock n' roll immortality. 

	











	The movie, which reunites Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer as Spinal Tap, is directed once again by Rob Reiner, who also reprises his on-screen role as fictional documentarian Marty DiBergi. The film traces the band's fractious rehearsals for what's supposed to be their final concert, and fills in some of the gaps in their story — we learn that Guest's Nigel Tufnel is now the proprietor of the cheese shop. They're also seeing a new drummer — always a dangerous gig — and we see famous percussionists including Questlove turn down the job. McCartney and John both have larger-than-cameo roles in the movie, playing music with the band and improvising dialogue along with the cast.

Spinal Tap II is the first Tap movie since 1984, but the band has kept busy over the years — despite not actually existing — with live shows and recordings. They released a full studio album, Break Like the Wind, in 1992, and a compilation of re-recordings, Back From the Dead, in 2009.

	The family of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide earlier this year, has released a statement responding to President Donald Trump claiming this week that he had a falling out with Epstein because Epstein “stole” Giuffre and other young women employed at Mar-a-Lago's spa.


	“It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen' from Mar-a-Lago. It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal actions, especially given his statement two years later that his good friend Jeffrey ‘likes women on the younger side … no doubt about it,'” Giuffre's family said in a statement provided to The Atlantic. 


	“If our sister could speak today, she would be most angered by the fact that the government is listening to a known perjurer, a woman who repeatedly lied under oath and will continue to do so as long as it benefits her position,” the family added, referring to Ghislain Maxwell, Epstein's accomplice. The Justice Department met with Maxwell last week, and Trump has not ruled out pardoning the convicted sex trafficker.

	











	Trump's friendship with Epstein has been under the microscope since the Justice Department announced it will not be releasing any additional materials pertaining to the disgraced financier's case. Trump has long talked about having a falling out with Epstein, and said this week that it was due to Epstein stealing his employees, including Giuffre.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“He took people that worked for me. I told him don't do it anymore and he did it. I said stay the hell out of here,” Trump said before calling the reporter who asked the question “fake news.”


	When asked if the people Epstein took from him were young women, Trump said “yes” and that they worked in the spa at Mar-a-Lago. When asked if one of the people was Giuffre, Trump said he thought she worked at the spa, adding: “He stole her.”

	Trump claims Epstein “stealing” Giuffre and other employees led to their falling out, but Trump spoke glowingly of Epstein in an interview two years after Giuffre left the club. “I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump said in 2002. “He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”


	Giuffre first sued Epstein and Maxwell in 2009, alleging in civil court that Maxwell recruited her as a minor to be sexually trafficked by Epstein. The suit was settled for an undisclosed amount, later revealed to be $500,000. In 2010, Giuffre went public with allegations that she had been trafficked to powerful associates of Epstein, including former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Prince Andrew, allegations which she reiterated in testimony and depositions at various times. She spent the final years of her life advocating for survivors of sexual assault and sex trafficking, and died by suicide in April at the age of 41.

Donald Trump won his way back into the White House on a claim that he would address Americans' deep-seated economic pain. Months into his second term, the president's reckless approach to tariffs and relentless dismantling of federal investments are driving up prices on everything from clothing and baby strollers to doctors visits and student loans. 


	To better understand how Americans are responding to Trump's failed promise, the organization I lead, The Century Foundation, recently partnered with Morning Consult to ask more than 2,000 voters a range of questions about their financial well-being and what would make their lives better. The findings, which haven't been released before now, show that families are feeling intense financial pressure and are desperately looking for relief. But Americans don't just want leaders who promise lower prices at the grocery store; they want leaders committed to fixing the rigged system that made their lives so unaffordable in the first place. 

	











	Our survey revealed that more than four in five Americans are concerned about groceries, half are worried about affording their rent or mortgage, and two-thirds worry about their ability to pay an unexpected medical expense. An alarmingly high number of families are being forced to make difficult, at times drastic, decisions to make ends meet. In the past year, 41 percent of adults dipped into their savings just to cover the basics. Nearly two in five resorted to paying bills with a credit card, while three in 10 accumulated new debt to afford necessities. And, in the wealthiest nation on earth, one in every four Americans say they or someone in their household has skipped meals in the last year to save money.

	











	Despite the circus-like news cycles coming out of the White House, the president's role in creating this economic catastrophe is not lost on the public. A whopping 60 percent of Americans told us that Donald Trump has made their cost of living worse, and many worry that he will make it harder for them to pay their bills. Nearly eight in 10, including more than two-thirds of Republicans, are concerned that Trump's tariffs will raise prices on everyday goods like clothing and appliances.

	The level of financial distress we're observing is deeply concerning — both for what it means for individuals and for what it means for the future of our economy — and it demands real and aggressive intervention. It also presents an enormous opportunity for those who have a clear diagnosis of how we got here and where we should go. 


	Already, politicians on the left and the right are decrying the high cost of living in America. Even conservatives like Tucker Carlson are sounding the alarm on mounting credit card debt and the increasing difficulty of homeownership. But Americans want more than speeches and policy plans to drive down the cost of eggs. They want leaders who they can trust to make their concerns a priority — and they want accountability for those who have rigged the playing field in order to drive prices up, keep wages down, and extract profits at every turn. 


	Unlike some policy advocates and experts, Americans don't view government red tape or bloated bureaucracy as the key obstacle to making change. Instead, our research shows that a majority think the biggest barrier is billionaires and wealthy corporations that stand in the way of progress. Nearly 80 percent think the federal government should prioritize prosecuting companies that collude to raise prices, holding companies accountable for inflating drug prices, and preventing businesses from taking advantage of consumers and workers. Similar numbers want to increase taxes on the wealthy.


	This might help explain why campaigns like Zohran Mamdani's have captured so much support from New Yorkers and people across the country — and so much opposition from wealthy and powerful interests. Mamdani's policy platform is deeply focused on affordability, and he does not shy away from calling out the role that the wealthy and corporations play in making life unaffordable. His approach to housing, for example, addresses both the need to build more affordable units and also crack down on shady landlords.

	As a former federal regulator, I have seen firsthand how corporations use their outsized power over regular people — whether that's cheating them on student loans, jacking up credit card interest rates, or forcing them to pay medical debts they do not owe. I have also seen how government programs that ought to help people can be turned into boondoggles that enrich private companies.

	We cannot really tackle the cost of living crisis facing American families if we do not address the ways in which the wealthy and powerful benefit from squeezing average families. Americans understand this, and we need leaders who understand it too.

	On Friday, July 26, the day of the week new music drops regularly, three of the hottest pop stars out of Africa doled out the steamiest trifecta of releases this year. Nigerian singer Ayra Starr's latest song is literally about being hot. South African star Tyla came with a four-pack EP called WWP, short for We Wanna Party. And Ghanaian-American shapeshifter Amaarae broke barriers with her new single “Girlie-Pop!” and its steamy, queer-coded music video. It was a day that crystallized a pattern that had been forming all year: the women of Afropop are bringing sexy back. 


	Much of their movement, like others across media right now, is Y2K-indebted. Skirts and tops have gotten microscopic, bottoms are being slung below the waist again, and lots of producers seem to be doing their best impressions of early Pharrell. But that time also came with some trends in how women's sexuality was marketed and received that we now find disturbing, to say the least. We can see that Britney Spears, the queen of Y2K, was someone whose personhood and sexuality was often devoured and exploited as she explored both as a young girl (her iconic and controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover is an emblem of how complicated it is to make a teenager a sex symbol). We now know Janet Jackson was unfairly shamed and punished after Justin Timberlake exposed her pasty-covered breast during their 2004 Super Bowl performance. Today, while some of the cultural relics of that time have rolled back around, many young women may have more agency about why, when, and how they want to participate. 

	











	It feels like that agency is what we're witnessing in Afropop. Ayra Starr — who emerged in 2021 as a cunning 19-year-old surrounded by cartoon butterflies and broken hearts — has grown more edgy in her dress and performance as she's gotten older. In May, she inched towards summer with the fiery “Gimme Dat,” video featuring Wizkid, and last week, she finally released her much-anticipated new single “Hot Body.” “Body be dancing/Slow wine/Summer body/So fine,” she sings on the strip tease of a song. As she breadcrumbed the track on social media over the past few weeks, she could be seen hitting a seductive, TikTok ready dance to it with her girlfriends, and it truly looks like she's having a blast. Just a few days ago, on July 27, she giddily celebrated performing the song with Coldplay, who she's touring with as an opening act this summer. Before she took the stage, Chris Martin, who eagerly accompanied her on acoustic guitar, told the crowd, “Ok, everybody, listen. We will do something special because this is Ayra Starr from Nigeria. She is going to be the world's biggest pop star soon and she has a new song called ‘Hot Body' which I think is amazing. So please indulge us and join us for a big dance party.”

Look what a Hot body can do !!


	Dancing, of course, has been Tyla's thing since she captivated the mainstream with “Water” in 2023. (Cute Y2K fashion has become a bit of a calling card for her, as it has for Starr. They've been friendly collaborators, both 23 years old.) The rollout and name of Tyla's new EP, WWP, takes cues from the popular nightlife chant “[Insert name of DJ or performer leading the crowd here], we wanna party!” That makes perfect sense for a girl who's always been about partying so hard you're soaked, whether with sweat or the contents of your plastic bottle. Tyla's WWP features “Bliss,” a track whose music video spawned an excellent meme about being sexy and sad at once. It takes the quick cut between a scene of the singer fighting tears and another of her grinding against a silver sculpture in desert sand. “Idk if we're supposed to shake ass or cry” one YouTube commenter wrote to the tune of 15,000 likes. 


	The full WWP EP includes two songs that debuted this month, one being “Dynamite,” an energizing collaboration with Wizkid (it's the pair's first and feels reminiscent of Ayra Starr hopping on Star Boy's “2 Sugar” earlier in her rise). The song that really cements the sexy, though, is “Mr. Media.” While the track lambasts the voyeuristic sensationalism she's faced in the public eye, she uses the second verse to remind herself why she shouldn't care: “Bad bitch, I ain't always got time to talk/Too bad, yeah, I know I'm difficult/You'd be too if you had my visuals/You'd be too if you had material.”

					Amaarae Is Ready to Release a New Album — and Take Over the World		
	









Amaarae seems to be channeling a similar devil-may-care confidence as she gears up to release Black Star, her third studio album set to drop August 8. On Friday, she shared the second single, “Girlie-Pop!” following the erotic “S.M.O.” (for “Slut Me Out”). “Girlie-Pop!” ushers in this new era of Amaarae's powerfully, honing a familiar balance of softness, urgency, and cleverly sensual songwriting with a righteously queer arc. Using music as an extended allegory, she coos, “I want you to take me from the top/Kiss me 'til I tell you, ‘Make it soft'/One of us gotta bring this to a stop/Flip positions, switching genres 'til you make it pop.” In the moody video, Amaarae nearly sings into the mouth of another woman, the camera lingering on their lips. In other moments, their heads swirl around each other's face and neck. When that's not happening, the woman is DJing, potentially another bit of innuendo. 

	











	Amaarae's imagery and music has sometimes teetered towards homoerotic (in the “S.M.O.” video, for example, one might say she's literally waxing a beautiful woman's ass) but “Girlie-Pop!” marks a bold embrace of queerness for a Ghanaian artist of her magnitude. For years, Ghanaian lawmakers have notoriously been pushing virulent anti-LGBTQ legislation and now they have a president reportedly committed to passing them. Amaarae declaring that the video was shot in Ghana “with loveeeeee” is a radical act. “My real mission is for us to not think about sexuality, or to subvert it so much to the point where it subconsciously takes people away from that,” she told Galore about her last album, Fountain Baby, in 2023. “I wanted to make the music so sexy and captivating that you kind of wouldn't think about what pronouns I was using, no matter if you are straight, gay, pansexual, whatever. That was my way of trying to slowly break that boundary that things have to be in boxes and confined and defined.” 


	So much of this Summer of Sexy has actually been brewing since 2024. Moliy's “Shake It to the Max (Fly)” is currently one of the biggest songs in the world, and the Ghanaian singer first teased it back in October with a short snippet on TikTok. Today there have been 4.5 million videos made with a remix featuring dancehall stars Skillibeng and Shenseea on the app. In fact, there's been five remixes total, including versions with Sean Paul and Major Lazer. Though Moliy is African, “Shake It to the Max” has always been a dancehall song, produced by Silent Addy and Disco Neal of the DJ duo Bashment Sound. On July 29, Billboard announced that the song had hit Number One on their Rhythmic Airplay chart, meaning it's a certified smash on American radio. It's also been sitting at Number One on the U.S. Afrobeats Song chart for 12 consecutive weeks, too. “Shake It to the Max” has reached these heights as a viral anthem for baddies to let loose and whine their waists. Make sure you get out there and heed Moliy's call over the next month. 


Loosies: More music to move to summer


Rema's “Kelebu” and Theodora's “Kongolese Sous BBL”: So, in honor of the Summer of Sexy, I'm writing about these two at once, as Francophone singer Theodora's burgeoning hit is, in a way, an energetic ancestor to “Kelebu,” Rema's excellent new party-starter. “Kelebu” seems inspired by Bouyon, a high-octane dance music from Dominica, as well as Makossa from Cameroon and Coupé-décalé from Côte d'Ivoire (Theodora was born in Switzerland to Congolese parents and has lived all over the world). These are all threads Theodora has been pulling from the past few years, with the excellent “Kongolese Sous BBL” becoming her biggest hit with well over 47 million streams on Spotify. Rema's closest collaborator, the producer London, also worked with Theodora on her song “Massoko Na Mabele” from this past May. 

	











Darkoo, “Right Now” featuring Rvssian and Davido: Intuitively, Nigerian hitmaker Darkoo titled her June EP $exy Girl $ummer. “A lot of the top people in the game who are making music aren't making music for girls,” she told Apple Music. “They are making music that women like, but it's not about them, and that's what I'm doing. I want them to feel like the sexiest women in the world.” This song definitely does it as the openly queer Darkoo and enthusiastic Davido promise to give some fortunate ladies the world. The song samples Gyptian's Jamaican hit “Whine Slow,” which Rvssian himself produced.

Daddy Lumba, “Se Sumye Kasa A”: This last Loosie is a tribute to Ghanaian legend Daddy Lumba, who died at age 60 on July 26. While he's known as a highlife maven, his music had diverse influences, from gospel to hip-hop, like you can hear on 2002's “Se Sumye Kasa A.” “Daddy Lumba really is a risk taker of his time,” Amaarae said in 2023, part of an interview she re-shared in memoriam of Lumba. She had praised his affinity for “Bad bitches,” adding, “At a time where male highlife artists were taking very romantic approaches to the way they were writing their music, Daddy Lumba said ‘Look, I love the hoes and the hoes love me'.”

Rolling Stone named Beyoncé's “Formation” the greatest music video of all time in 2021. But when it comes to the most influential, first place can arguably go to a clip that isn't even a proper music video — and was shot in black & white 60 years ago.


	Last week, Margo Price released a jaunty new single, “Don't Wake Me Up,” accompanied by a video in which she holds up white cards with snippets of lyrics — among them, “cow pasture cemetery,” “honky tonk leaky tent,” “dive bar,” “madness” — as the song plays. It didn't take a classic-rock historian to see the video as a nod to Bob Dylan's “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” the canonical footage of the young Bob of 1965 in a London alleyway holding, and discarding, cards with bits of the tune's lyrics; in the background is poet Allen Ginsberg talking to off-screen Dylan pal Bobby Neuwirth.


	Not an actual music video, the scene was the opener of documentarian D.A. Pennebaker's penetrating 1967 film Dont Look Back, shot during Dylan's U.K. tour of two years before. As Pennebaker later said, the concept came from Dylan himself: “He said, ‘I've got this idea for a film where I take a whole lot of sheets of paper and write lyrics for a song, and hold them up as the lyrics come up in the song and then I just toss them away.' And I said, ‘That's a fantastic idea.' So we brought along about 50 shirt cardboards.”

	The footage was shot in the alley behind the Savoy Hotel in London, and according to Pennebaker (who died in 2019), some of the handwritten lyrics were supplied by Joan Baez and Donovan, who were both in Dylan's vicinity (and crosshairs) at the time.

	











	Once the MTV era began, the sequence, relatively primitive as it was, was seen as a music video prototype and began to inspire knockoffs and tributes. “When Margo approached me with the concept, I did a deep dive on groups who'd done similar projects with poster cards or cue cards and was shocked to see how many there were,” says Hannah Gray Hall, who directed Price's “Don't Wake Me Up.” “It's like keeping a tradition going.”

	The first may have been “Misfit,” the 1986 video by the stylish British pop band Curiosity Killed the Cat, which featured Andy Warhol dropping white cards during a brief cameo.


	The following year, INXS' “Mediate” elevated the Dylan homage to another level. Starting with singer Michael Hutchence, all the band members held up and subsequently dropped lyric cards in sequence. “You had to get the timing right,” INXS' Andrew Farriss tells Rolling Stone of filming outside of Sydney in the band's home country of Australia. “You had to make sure the cards landed.” In another salute to the Dylan video, some of the words on the cards were intentionally misspelled.


	In a sign that not everything was instantly available on YouTube in 1987 (of course, YouTube was yet to exist), Farriss says he wasn't aware of the source material at the time. “I'm not sure if it was the director's idea or Michael's, but I have to admit that I didn't even know Bob had a video like that,” he says. “Maybe some of the other guys did. All I know is that it sounded like a good idea. I saw [the original] later and went, ‘Oh, wow.'” The recreation was so obvious that one critic at the time noted that “both the filmmaker [Pennebaker] and his subject [Dylan] ought to round up the lawyers,” but that didn't prevent the song from winning Video of the Year at the 1988 MTV Music Video Awards, in conjunction with the band's companion clip for “Need You Tonight.”


	Since then, a cottage industry of “Subterranean Homesick Blues” videos has risen up, each honoring the original in different ways. As with Curiosity Killed the Cat, some approached their remakes as parodies. “Weird Al” Yankovic's “Bob,” in 2003, found everyone's favorite satirical hero with a Dylan wig, vest, and alleyway of his own, a pretend Ginsberg behind him, as Yankovic tweaked Dylan's surrealistic imagery (“Rise to vote, sir/Do geese see God/Do nine men interpret/Nine men, I nod”).

	Even though “Subterranean Homesick Blues” isn't one of Dylan's topical songs, others have used the setup for protest shots of their own. Les Claypool and the Frog Brigade's “Buzzards of Green Hill” has typically carnivalesque Claypool lyrics, which could be about the perils of drunken driving, hence Claypool's use of cue cards in the song's video.


	Earlier this year, Kim Gordon redid the packing-list lyrics of “Bye Bye” into a minimalist anti-Trump protest song, “Bye Bye 25!,” complete with a video with Gordon holding cards with the new lyrics (“immigrant,” “hate,” “injustice”). Artist Ed Ruscha has a Sonic Youth connection of his own (the band named its song “Brave Men Run” after one of his paintings) and a Dylan one too: In 2012, his offered up a lyric-card homage, honoring friend and conceptual artist Lawrence Weiner with snippets of Weiner's own words.


	Wir sind Helden's 2005 video “Nur ein Wort” (“Just One Word”) featured the now-defunct German pop band in their own alley, dancing and cavorting as they flashed their lyric sheets. (Since the song is about encouraging a private person to express themselves — “your silence is your tent” — the use of words in the video made conceptual sense.) And before he was slaying zombies, Andrew Lincoln was wooing Keira Knightley in Love Actually with, yep, words on white cards.

	In the case of Price's video, director Hall says Price's team approached her about doing something similar to Dylan, “but they said to make it my own and do a contemporary take on it.” Using 77 different poster-board cards for her shoot, Hall thinks those lyric snippets also connect to the song's theme and to Dylan's own legacy: “Margo and I didn't talk about it in depth, but to me, it speaks very heavily to our current social climate and people being isolated in their own ways and not looking into other people's opinions. It's more social commentary than protest song.”


	For Farriss, one thing unites nearly 40 years of “Subterranean Homesick Blues” homages. “It's simple,” he says. “Just because something's complicated doesn't mean it's necessarily good.”

	It's been two weeks since Team Trump prematurely began declaring victory in its efforts to quell the “MAGA rebellion” over the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, and this chapter of Donald Trump's second presidency still has no end in sight. 


	The White House's big plan to change the subject — by endorsing the idea of jailing Trump's predecessor on manufactured claims — is doing next to nothing right now to dig the president out of this Epstein-shaped hole that he and his loyalists dug for themselves. And there are already concerns among certain Trump advisers that this gambit is creating, in the words of one such adviser, just another “ticking time bomb” that could blow up in their faces in the months and years to come.


	In recent days, some senior administration officials continue to privately concede that the way Trump talks about the Epstein saga likely arouses more suspicion than it suppresses. This week, for instance, Trump said that he had a falling out with Epstein because the convicted sex offender and accused sex trafficker “stole” workers from him — including the late Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent victims. Behind closed doors, the president has lately expressed frustration at the Epstein debacle's staying power in the day-to-day news cycles, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Concurrently, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are keeping up the pressure on the Trump administration to release the so-called “Epstein Files” — which the president seems to have lied about being in. Recent polling data suggests that the Epstein scandal is breaking through to the American electorate and has indeed hurt Trump. On top of all that, he is now locked in a legal battle with one of his most crucial media allies, Fox News honcho Rupert Murdoch, all because of the Epstein affair. Further, the president's recent moves caused Giuffre's family to publicly press him “for answers.”

	No matter the insistence coming from some of Trump's top advocates that this president is out of the woods on this, he and his team have completely failed to move the country and the media off of a major news story at a time when the White House and Justice Department would prefer to talk about practically anything else. In one such vain attempt, the Trump administration has tried to refocus the public's attention on his fascist impulses.


	In Trump's latest salvo in targeting his political enemies, the president and some of his most senior lieutenants, such as Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have devoted considerable energy this month to pushing their woefully flimsy, Russiagate-related claims that former President Barack Obama committed treason and that he and other ex-officials should be prosecuted.


	“Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people — Obama's been caught directly,” Trump claimed last week. He continued: “What they did in 2016 and 2020 is very criminal. It's criminal at the highest level. So that's really the things you should be talking about.” 


	“He's guilty. It's not a question,” Trump added. “This was treason. This was every word you can think of. They tried to steal the election. They tried to obfuscate the election.”


	Aside from the sitting president being the one who tried to steal an election he lost, the Trump administration has presented no actual evidence for their lofty allegations, and the reports they have declassified and released don't at all reveal what his team is proclaiming they do. The smear — which some of the most powerful people in the world are now using the U.S. government and intelligence community to co-sign — is that then-President Obama and others personally concocted the Trump-Russia scandal near the end of Obama's term, in order to sabotage the first Trump administration.

	To underscore how much of the federal government is in lockstep in this latest ruse, Gabbard announced she made a criminal referral to the Justice Department, with CIA director John Ratcliffe declaring he “strongly” backs the Gabbard-led crusade to rewrite the Trump-Russia history and potentially imprison the president's political foes. 


	“We have referred and will continue to refer all of these documents to the Department of Justice and the FBI, to investigate the criminal implications of this for the evidence,” Gabbard told reporters at the White House last week. Pressed on if she was referring specifically to Obama, she responded with the extraordinary claim: “Correct. The evidence that we have found, and that we have released, directly point to President Obama leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment. There are multiple pieces of evidence and intelligence that confirm that fact.”

	











	On Wednesday afternoon, Rolling Stone called Michael van Landingham — one of the former intelligence analysts for the CIA who literally wrote the 2017 intelligence assessment on how the Russian government meddled in the 2016 election to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump — and asked him if Obama concocted all of this. The former analyst audibly laughed for a few seconds. 


	“No, not at all,” he says. “Neither did [John] Brennan and neither did [James] Comey and neither did James Clapper.” He adds: “No one ever gave me instructions on what to write, and my role as an analyst was so obscure that to this day, none of the senior people would be able to recognize me or know my name.”


	Trump officials have not succeeded in their quest to use this fake scandal to distract from the president's ongoing Epstein mess, but that's not going to stop the administration from trying. But by putting such an emphasis on this, the Trump administration is ironically setting itself up for precisely the kind of intra-MAGA backlash that led to the ongoing Trump-Epstein debacle to begin with.


	Nine sources, including senior Trump officials and others close to the president, have vented to Rolling Stone in recent days that unless the administration actually goes the distance and prosecutes Trump's top political enemies — including Obama, who consistently tops public opinion polls for most popular living president, or even politician, in the country — Team Trump is once again hyping up something it can't or won't deliver on for the MAGA base.


	“It's another ticking time bomb for himself,” a Trump adviser says. “We are promising them [the base] that these people committed the crime of the century, and that Dems are going down for this. What if we don't … take them down? It'd be a broken promise.”


	One Trump administration official adds that “people aren't buying it.” The official notes they have received messages from high-profile Trump allies and MAGA-aligned influencers insisting that this “Obamagate” reboot will not get them to move on from Epstein. Some of these allies have already told this official different, eye-roll-style versions of ‘I'll believe it when I see it,' regarding the Trump administration's promise that they have conclusive proof of Obama and others' criminal, indictable activities. 


	The ex-president, via a spokesperson, responded to Trump's accusation of “treason” by calling it “ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.”

	











	The second Trump administration has already taken concrete steps to criminally investigate and harass the president's foes, often for doing things that clearly aren't crimes or misconduct, but that annoyed Trump. 


	But several Trump advisers point out that one reason prosecuting Obama would be difficult is that the former president enjoys the same, Supreme Court-blessed presidential immunity protections that Trump appears eager to keep exploiting. But even if they don't succeed in jailing Obama, that would leave several other former top government officials on the list for Trump, his intelligence appointees, and his Justice Department to target. 


	But that was the same theory headed into the second Trump administration, when the president and his lieutenants vowed to their most fervent supporters that the anti-Trump “Deep State” would unravel and that the Epstein “Files” would be unfurled for all to read.


	Ever since Epstein's death behind bars in 2019, both the Republican Party grassroots and its political and media elite have fostered right-wing conspiracy theories that the prolific abuser was murdered to cover-up the illicit activities or alleged sex crimes of Epstein's social orbit of powerful and influential men, which once included Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton. To many of these conspiracists and believers, the long-concealed trove of federal investigative files on the late Epstein somehow hold the keys to exposing a Democratic, pedophile cabal running the anti-Trump “Deep State” — and that Trump is the man to finally topple them. 


	These theories proliferated among conservatives and MAGA diehards despite the fact that it is a matter of public record that Trump and Epstein were friends and party companions for years, and despite the fact that Trump was running the government when Epstein suddenly died.


	Since the days of Trump's first presidency, the mantra that Epstein didn't kill himself became such a firmly held belief on the American right that Trump campaigned for reelection last year pledging to release the federal files on Epstein. Some of his highest-ranking appointees this term, like FBI leaders Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, helped push Epstein-related conspiracy theories when Trump was out of power. 


	Shortly after Trump was sworn back into office in January, his administration made a huge deal about how they were launching a new Epstein investigation and finally, finally, getting their base what they wanted and forcing the documents into the public domain. For months, federal law enforcement devoted substantial resources to reviewing the gigantic reservoir of documents. The administration kept teasing their supporters about coming revelations to the point that Attorney General Pam Bondi went on TV in February to tell the nation that the Epstein “client list” of elite co-conspirators and unpunished degenerates was “sitting on” her desk awaiting review.

	











	Then this summer, it all came crashing down.


	In early July, Trump's Justice Department and FBI released a now-infamous memo declaring that Epstein, in fact, committed suicide and that the mythical “client list” that Bondi had referenced on Fox News did not exist. This triggered a fierce backlash from Trump-aligned influencers and activists who quickly alleged that Trump administration officials were now leading the Deep State's Epstein cover-up. The severity of the fallout led to an intense spree of blame games and finger-pointing within the MAGA elite, exacerbated existing tensions within the top echelons of Trump's government, including between Patel and Bondi, and nearly led to Bongino quitting in anger. 


	A number of elected Republicans on Capitol Hill have demanded answers. Democratic lawmakers and liberal groups, sensing an opportunity to sow chaos among the GOP ranks, have now made this a leading issue. This month, House Speaker and close Trump ally Mike Johnson chose to shut down Congress early, rather than have a vote on releasing the Epstein files.


	As new leaks from his administration revealed that the attorney general indeed briefed Trump in May that his name is in the files, the president kept ordering his followers and the American people to move on. He trashed many of his supporters as “stupid” for not letting up on Epstein, and despite the Epstein files' release being a longtime cause célèbre of the Trumpian right, the president started suggesting that President Obama and “Crooked Hillary” wrote the Epstein files in a way to make Trump look bad.


	It didn't work.


	The issue is not going away, the administration continues to be consumed by it, and Trump's poll numbers have gotten worse. A Washington Post poll released this week found that 61 percent of Americans “think the Epstein files contain embarrassing information about Trump.”


	So now, the Trump administration's primary effort — at which they're throwing vast federal resources and manpower — to turn the page on the Epstein debacle is to collectively promote a far-right conspiracy theory about how a secret cabal of Trump-loathing “Deep State” subversives and liberal villains, at the direction of Obama, corruptly wrote some intel reports.

	In doing so, the Trump administration is suggesting to its base that this mission will triumphantly — just you wait! — result in gratifying revelations, maximum criminal accountability, and the likely imprisonment of their sworn enemies.

	











	The last time Team Trump did all that, they drove themselves straight into the ditch that they're fumbling to pull themselves out of today.

YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A metallic spacecraft glistens under ambient light as two figures with elongated limbs, bulbous heads and featureless faces gaze with black eyes into the distance of the island of Java.

The extraterrestrial arrival in Indonesia is one of the science fiction scenes that has captivated groups of outer space enthusiasts at the country's UFO Festival throughout July.

Since 2016, organizers have welcomed hundreds of fans of outer space realities and mysteries from Indonesia and beyond. The festival aims to be a creative and intellectual crossroads for enthusiasts of space science and exploration, Unidentified Flying Objects, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena and SETI, short for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

This year's free event included an Alien Village, UFO Village and UFO Camp at a site near Yogyakarta, about 420 kilometers (260 miles) from the Indonesian capital Jakarta.

Visitors admired a replica of a Mars exploration module and galleries with artistic interpretations of outer space, while workshops for adults and students offered cosmic activities such as spacesuit construction.

Venzha Christ, director of the Indonesia Space Science Society, said a focus on the term UFO allows participants to wonder without boundaries.

“I think the Indonesian generation needs a platform that can transform and socialize creative ideas, whether from the perspective of technology, science or even art,” Christ said. “Imagining outer space, imagining the universe, is imagining limitlessness.”

Spiritualists are demanding the immediate destruction of a spooky Raggedy Ann doll that is claimed to be possessed by demons after a famed paranormal investigator died suddenly during a traveling exhibition featuring the eerie child's toy.

Dan Rivera, 54, was found dead in his Gettysburg, Pa., hotel room July 13 following a three-day, sold-out tour stop at an orphanage in town.

The cause of death of the U.S. Army vet and father of four — who starred on Travel Channel's Most Haunted Places and produced shows including Netflix's 28 Days Haunted — remains a mystery, pending an autopsy, according to officials.

But in an exclusive to Globe, Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow insists he detected “nothing suspicious” about the ghostbuster's early death.

Still, paranormal experts claim the doll — known as Annabelle and featured in the Conjuring horror movies and chillingly linked to a host of real-life violent and eerie acts — should not be preserved.

“That thing should be immediately destroyed,” declares spiritualist Donna Miller, who has used her psychic abilities working with law enforcement.

“Too much evil surrounds that doll. Too much has happened for it to be kept.”

Sources say the doll's origins trace back to 1968, when an unsuspecting Hartford, Conn., woman bought the creepy cuddler at a hobby store and gifted it to her nursing-student daughter for Christmas.

The 28-year-old gal soon saw chilling signs of demonic possession — the doll would change poses, move to different rooms in the house and, most scarily, would growl.

Ominous handwritten notes with messages like “Help me, help us” appeared around her apartment, she said, and her bedroom felt cold at night and the ceiling, at times, glowed.

The alarmed woman contacted a medium, who claimed the doll was possessed by the spirit of 5-year-old Annabelle Higgins, who died in a car accident.

The spooked student gave the scary toy to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the now-deceased paranormal investigators portrayed in the Conjuring films, who encased it in a plexiglass box and stored it at their Occult Museum in Connecticut, later known as the New England Paranormal Research Center.

The facility closed in 2019 and the exhibits were taken on the Devils on the Run tour this year.

Spiritualist Miller warns the doll is a malevolent force that needs to be snuffed out.

“There are forces connected with that doll that human beings should not be meddling with,” she says. “It should be destroyed! It should be burned, at once!”","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Home'}","other"

One thing about 3I/ATLAS is for certain: It's definitely not from Earth's solar system.

But what exactly is the intriguing interstellar object discovered speeding through our cosmic neighborhood? Most astrophysicists widely agree 3I/ATLAS displays all the telltale signs of an icy comet.

Now, a trio of researchers led by Avi Loeb, a controversial astrophysicist from Harvard University, are positing a very different theory: What if 3I/ATLAS isn't just some random space rock that arrived in our solar system by happenstance but an intelligently controlled alien spacecraft?

Even the authors of the research paper positing the wild idea aren't fully sold on it, but – hey – extraterrestrial visitors are always fun to think about.

A likely comet known as 3I/ATLAS made news earlier in July when it was confirmed to have originated outside Earth's solar system, which makes it just one of three known interstellar objects ever discovered in our cosmic neighborhood.

What's more, the object, which scientists estimate to be more than 12 miles wide, is whizzing at 37 miles per second relative to the sun on a trajectory that on Oct. 30 will bring it within about 130 million miles of Earth, according to NASA.

A telescope in Chile – part of the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, or ATLAS – was the first to spot what initially looked like an unknown asteroid on a path approaching Earth's orbit.

The observation was reported to the Minor Planet Center, the official authority for observing and reporting new asteroids, comets and other small bodies in the solar system. The object, eventually confirmed to almost certainly be a comet and named 3I/ATLAS, was later confirmed to have interstellar origins after follow-up observations.

But is 3I/ATLAS definitely an icy comet?

The three researchers, who most prominently include Loeb, recently published a paper speculating about whether the object could be ""hostile"" alien technology.

Loeb is famed for encouraging astrophysicists to have an open mind about extraterrestrials, but his theories and research often rankle other scientists in the field, who push back on some of his bolder claims. He is cofounder of the Galileo Project, a research program at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics dedicated to the search for extraterrestrials.

The paper Loeb cowrote, uploaded July 16 to the preprint server arXiv, is more a ""pedagogical exercise"" examining the unusual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and how fast it is traveling through space than a study meant to offer definitive conclusions. The paper has not been peer-reviewed, it's important to note.

Loeb further explained the paper in a post on the online publishing platform Medium, writing that it was simply an ""interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to explore.""

""This hypothesis proposes that our cosmic neighborhood is dangerous, filled with intelligent civilizations that are hostile and silent to avoid detection by potential predators,"" Loeb wrote.

But experts who spoke to science news website LiveScience cast serious doubt on Loeb's sensational theory.

""Any suggestion that it's artificial is nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object,"" Chris Lintott, an astronomer at the University of Oxford who was part of the team that simulated 3I/ATLAS's galactic origins, told Live Science.

Even Loeb concedes it's unlikely 3I/ATLAS is alien technology.

""By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet,"" he wrote in the blog post.

This is far from the first time Loeb had theorized that an object in our solar system could be not only interstellar but an extraterrestrial artifact.

Loeb made headlines in August 2023 when he claimed that remnants of a meteor he and a team recovered in the Pacific Ocean were interstellar in origin.

An unusual meteorite Loeb and his team named IM1 had crashed into Earth's atmosphere in 2014. The researchers then retrieved suspected remnants of the meteor in June 2023 off the coast of Papua New Guinea.

By August, Loeb announced that early analysis suggested the metallic spherules were composed of substance unmatched to any existing alloys in our solar system – though other astrophysicists were unconvinced.

At the time, Loeb did not yet have an answer to whether the metallic spheres were artificial or natural in origin.

In 2017, the comet Oumuamua, Hawaiian for “scout” or “messenger,” became the first interstellar object ever detected in the solar system, puzzling scientists with its strange shape and trajectory.

But Loeb posited that the comet − as long as a football field and thin like a cigar − was able to accelerate as it approached the sun by harnessing its solar power as a ""light sail,"" not unlike how a ship's sail catches the wind. Because no natural phenomenon would be capable of such space travel, Loeb was essentially suggesting Oumuamua could have been an alien spaceship.

A study in March 2023 explained the comet's odd orbit as a simple physical mechanism thought to be common among many icy comets: outgassing of hydrogen as the comet warmed in the sunlight.

The only other time an interstellar object has been spotted traveling through our solar system occurred in 2019, when comet Borisov passed by.

It's been 20 years since The WB aired Supernatural‘s pilot episode on September 13, 2005, and we first met the Winchesters: bookish Sam (Jared Padalecki), on track to be a lawyer, and his serious older brother Dean (Jensen Ackles), a supernatural hunter like their father John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who trained the boys from childhood. “Dad's on a hunting trip, and he hasn't been home in a few days,” Dean told Sam in that opener, and the brothers were spurred into action. We haven't been able to take our eyes away since.

For the next 15 seasons — and years — viewers watched Sam and Dean grow into formidable hunters. Sometimes, the brothers were sent to Hell, or possessed by a demon or archangel. It was never easy, but they always had each other.

Supernatural was often a monster-of-the-week series, but it was also so much more. You can't really stop the Apocalypse in 42 minutes, and Sam and Dean faced more than one world-ending catastrophe (including a few real-life ones, like the loss of the original showrunner Eric Kripke, or the network's switch from WB to The CW). The brothers went through deep trauma — often sacrificing themselves for each other — and tears were never shied away from. They stayed true to that breadth of emotion until the very end.

There were lots of laughs too, especially in the wacky meta episodes that quickly became fan favorites, like Season 5's hilarious “Changing Channels,” where the Trickster/archangel Gabriel (Richard Speight Jr.) dropped Sam and Dean into various show genres, trapping them in TV Hell (we were in Heaven!). And the addition of Misha Collins‘ angel Castiel changed everything for the better, both for viewers and for the characters of Sam and Dean, whose found family only continued to grow from there.

Although the series aired its final episode on November 19, 2020, SPN gained an afterlife through its stalwart fanbase and touring conventions that the cast members continue to enthusiastically devote their energy to, traveling around the globe to meet the fans that keep the show's heart beating. Those fan fests are the true magic of the series — a gift that keeps on giving for those who first tuned into the series in 2005, or the newcomers who binged it only recently on Netflix.

At one such con in May of this year, Speight summed up the reason we're still obsessed with SPN best: “At the end of the day, the story is about two boys who were aised by a broken man seeking revenge for the death of his wife. You put that in a badass car and send it across the United States, encountering demons, both personal and physical, and it's intoxicating.”

We'll take that ride any day.

These 10 easy-to-miss details from Supernatural really stand out when rewatching the show, and some of them are truly heartbreaking. Despite ending five years ago, and having an incredible 15-year run before that, Supernatural continues to be a very popular show.

Because of that, audiences are still identifying new details from the show's more than 300 episodes even now. Certain details reveal hints about what is to come later in the show, while others exemplify just how intricate the character development was. These 10 details in particular are so much easier to spot when rewatching Supernatural, and some are absolutely devastating.

Star Wars references were a frequent occurrence in Supernatural, but one mention of the galaxy far, far away was particularly surprising. In season 13, Sam walks into Jack's room and finds him watching the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Not only does Sam recognize it, but he seems well aware of the details of the show.

It's easy to miss this Star Wars: The Clone Wars Easter egg in Supernatural, and it's likely going to make you pretty annoyed once you watch it.

Sam even makes an apt and hilarious joke about the show, saying that it's ""probably for the best"" that Jack dislikes Anakin, as he eventually falls to the dark side and becomes one of Star Wars' most powerful Sith. This is especially fitting given Jack is Satan's son and has his own battle with inner darkness.

Bela was a compelling character in Supernatural because she didn't fit into a neat box in terms of what 'side' she was on in the way many other characters did early on in the show. She was frequently only out for herself, which made her feel like an adversary to Sam and Dean.

Yet, she had a tragic past that made her much more complicated than that. Bela made a deal with a demon to kill her parents because her father was abusing her and her mother did nothing to stop it. All Dean knew, however, was that Bela had her parents killed, and he assumed it was just to get their money.

In what was a fairly shocking death even for Supernatural, Bela sadly died before she was able to reveal the truth to Dean, as her time was up and the hell hounds came to get her. This guttingly means Dean never learned the real reason she had her parents killed—and he absolutely would have understood and helped her.

Dean constantly being hungry, eating food, and/or wanting to get food is a running joke throughout Supernatural's 15 seasons, particularly when it comes to burgers and pie. Yet, rewatching Supernatural reveals that there's a much darker reason Dean is always eating.

Flashbacks to Dean and Sam's childhood showed that John often left them alone when he went on hunts, which meant the brothers fending for themselves. At times, this led to the boys having very little food, to the point that Dean got caught stealing food because they were so hungry at one point, and he was punished for it.

This revelation takes Dean's obsession with eating from a funny gag on the show to a reflection of how their difficult, unstable childhood actually affected Dean long-term, which is an easy detail to miss when first watching the show but so much more meaningful the second (or more) time around.

Season 4 of Supernatural sees Sam and Dean at perhaps their lowest in the entire show in terms of their relationship, and that's in large part because they are so divided on the proper steps to take to stop the Apocalypse. This becomes particularly heated when Dean learns that Sam is drinking demon blood to become more powerful.

The brothers have some vicious fights, but one of the most brutal moments was actually fabricated. To keep Sam dedicated to their plan to kill Lilith (which turns out to be a complete trick), Ruby manipulates a voicemail Dean left for Sam to make it seem as though Dean called Sam a monster and implied he was irredeemable.

Sam and Dean ultimately make up, but we never see Sam and Dean discuss the voicemail, which presumably means Sam believes it was real. It seems like the kind of thing Sam wouldn't want to discuss because it was painful, but it's so sad to think Sam went on believing Dean had said those horrible things.

One detail only revealed at the end of Supernatural (and so much more obvious upon rewatch) is that Sam never had another serious romantic relationship with a blonde woman after Jess. In the pilot, Sam's girlfriend, whom he had planned to propose to, died in the same way his mother did, at the hands of the yellow-eyed demon, Azazel.

Even after 15 seasons, though, Sam clearly had never truly recovered from Jess's death, and he admitted that he still thought about her, all that time later, which is reflected in this dating pattern. It may even have been an entirely subconscious choice he was making, but Sam only dating brunettes after Jess reveals how crushing this loss was.

Dean actually went back in time and met younger versions of his parents, Mary and John Winchester, on more than one occasion, but in Supernatural season 5, episode 13, Sam and Dean both encounter their parents in the past and must try to save their lives.

This episode contained an unexpected moment of heartbreak, though, when Dean visibly straightened and stood at attention when John came to the door. His reaction is easy to miss upon first watch, but rewatching this episode made it clear that Dean's reaction to seeing his father reflects the way he had become a soldier, not a son, to his father.

Dean's reaction to seeing his father reflects the way he had become a soldier, not a son, to his father.

Of all Sam's love interests in Supernatural, Eileen continues to be one of the most prominently discussed because many speculate that she was the blurry wife in the Supernatural finale. That remains a major mystery even after the show's conclusion, but whether Sam married Eileen or not, it's obvious that he truly cared for and loved her.

Supernatural season 15's ending posed a huge question about Sam Winchester's life after the show ends, and a potential season 16 would answer it.

One detail that really sticks out upon rewatching Supernatural, however, is that Sam learned sign language just so he could better communicate with Eileen. Sam did have some limited knowledge of sign language before he met Eileen, but by the final season, he was clearly much more fluent in the language, which just proves how much Eileen meant to him.

In Supernatural season 5, episode 16, Dean and Sam are sent to Heaven, and together they experience what each of their respective Heavens would entail. Unfortunately, this ends up being a devastating revelation for Dean because while Dean's Heaven comprises his best memories with Sam, Sam's Heaven consists of the times he was away from Dean and John.

For example, whereas Dean has cherished memories of him spending time with young Sam and Sam thanking him for a great day, Sam's Heaven includes events like having a true Thanksgiving dinner with another family and striking off on his own and finding a dog.

Although this is apparent from the first time viewers see this episode, upon rewatch, the meaning behind this scene becomes so much more poignant and meaningful. Sadly, this would prove to be a pattern for Sam and Dean, even when the two of them were much older than they were in some of these memories.

The very controversial ending of Supernatural revealed that, not too long after Sam and Dean defeated God (a few years, in Jensen Ackles' estimation), Dean died on a hunt after he was impaled on rebar. The way in which Dean died was controversial in and of itself, but viewers were also simply devastated to learn Dean died decades before Sam.

Although Sam's age at the end of the show is not explicitly stated—neither when Dean died nor when, much later on, Sam himself dies—it's clear that several decades pass between these two events. Because of that, it's likely that Sam spent more time without Dean than he spent with him.

This is complicated to a certain degree because the Supernatural timeline is so difficult to pin down, especially due to episodes like ""Mystery Spot,"" in which Sam relives the same day about 100 times. Even with that taken into account, though, Sam clearly lives a full life after Dean's death, perhaps even longer than the life he had with Dean.

Sam clearly lives a full life after Dean's death, perhaps even longer than the life he had with Dean.

In the Supernatural finale, after Dean's death, Sam is sitting in Dean's room when he begins going through the objects in Dean's desk drawers. In that scene, atop Dean's desk, is a job application. Many believe this was an application for Dean to become a firefighter, as he had mentioned that being a dream of his when he was young.

While the exact position for which Dean was applying is actually ambiguous, it does seem to be a job application, as the page is labeled ""Application Portion"" and lists minimum requirements. The text is a bit too small to perfectly make out, but those requirements do mention equipment, uniforms, and other verbiage that would suggest a firefighting position.

No matter what the role was, it is tragic to know that Dean was thinking about life beyond hunting when he died. Ultimately, it's unknown whether he really ever could have walked away, but even him considering it hurts. This is therefore the most devastating detail that becomes clear when rewatching Supernatural.

Of course Jack would ""kinda hate Anakin"". Clone Wars writers seemed to be actively doing everything they could to destroy every aspect about Anakin's character and already make him the villain that Darth Vader became. I hated the creation of Ahsoka, because it's glaringly obvious that she doesn't exist in RotS, and especially HATED how the writers made it seem like Padme and Anakin barely tolerated each other despite how we see them act in Episode 3. He literally destroyed himself in an effort to save her and she died still believing in him.  I could go on about the faults of this show.



Supernatural got BAD around season 6 and the fact that it dragged on and on to Season 15 was ridiculous. Dean got a crap ending but I did love the ending callback to season 1's premiere.

The GOP-controlled Senate has voted to confirm a conspiracy theorist with ties to far-right extremism as the new head of the National Counterterrorism Center.

The Donald Trump-endorsed Joe Kent was confirmed by a 52-44 vote on Wednesday, largely along party lines. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was the only Republican to vote against his nomination to the role.

Democrats firmly opposed Kent's nomination, citing his links to far-right extremists and his peddling of conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and the January 6 attack at the Capitol. The controversial pick also arrives after the Trump administration brought in a 22-year-old with absolutely zero counterterrorism experience to work in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships at the Department of Homeland Security.

Kent, a former Green Beret veteran, frequently pushed the false claim that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump on social media. He also promoted the long-debunked suggestion that the violence carried out by Trump supporters on January 6 was initiated by FBI agents who infiltrated the protests in D.C. that day.

Kent even repeated this conspiracy during his confirmation hearing in April. “We're looking into whether elements of the government could have enhanced the criminal acuity of some of the rioters that day,” Kent said.

Kent, a two-time failed congressional candidate in Washington state, has been condemned for his connections to a number of prominent far-right and extremist figures. This includes white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, even though his 2022 endorsement of Kent was publicly rejected, as well as being linked to pro-Nazi blogger Greyson Arnold.

Elsewhere, Kent also paid Graham Jorgensen, a member of the far-right extremist group Proud Boys, for consulting work during his 2022 campaign, and worked with Joey Gibson, leader of the far-right Patriot Prayer group known for its violent clashes with antifascist protesters in Portland, Oregon, reported the Associated Press.

In May, Kent was also accused of scrapping an intelligence assessment because it couldn't link the Tren de Aragua gang to the Venezuelan government. Kent then reportedly ordered officials to rewrite the assessment, which the Trump administration hoped it could use to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, so it couldn't be “used against” the president.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, warned against installing Kent in the top counterterrorism position.

“At a time when domestic violent extremism is one of the fastest-growing threats to the homeland, we are being asked to put someone in charge of counterterrorism who has aligned himself with political violence, promoted falsehoods that undermine our democracy, and tried to twist intelligence to serve a political agenda,” Warner said in a speech on the Senate floor.

Kent thanked Trump and Gabbard on the same social media account where he frequently shares conspiracy theories following his confirmation.

“It's an honor to serve our nation again & to be back in the fight against terrorism. Thank you President Trump & DNI Gabbard for your confidence in my leadership,” Kent posted on X. “In honor of our fallen, we fight on.”

The National Counterterrorism Center did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast.

People have armed themselves and are assembling night patrol parties in several villages in Uttar Pradesh after reports of drone sightings fueled paranoia and fear. Cinspiracy theories are being shared with videos, too, as messages are forwarded across social media.

This fear has spread across Rampur, Amhroha, Sambhal, Moradabad and the villages of Ghaziabad, TOI reported. Unverified viral videos on social media show blinking objects flying in the sky, with residents insisting it is a drone “scouting” the area, ANI reported.

In Kumhera village of Ghaziabad, suspected drone sightings began a week ago and announcements are being made stating, ""Agar kisi ko drone dikhe, turant police ko khabar karein, ya humein batayein” (If anyone spots a drone, report to the police immediately, or inform us), the TOI report said.

According to the report, residents of Amirpuri Gharhi have begun asking for verification from those entering the village. Members of the group, some armed with axes, said, “We need to be sure who we are letting in.""

In Moradabad, villagers have armed themselves with sticks and flashlights at night to keep an eye on the sky for drones. 

Talking to ANI, the additional SP of Moradabad said that the police have been getting reports from rural areas about an object which blinks and is being spotted at night. 

People of the village suspect that drones are being used by criminals.

“However, when our deployed out teams, we didn't find evidence of criminal activity,” SP said.

He also said that the police are conducting patrols on a regular basis, and the matter is being investigated.

Meanwhile, two people in Muzaffarnagar have been arrested for allegedly spreading rumours about drones flying over Kairana town in Shamli, reported PTI. 

The police received reports of drones flying on Sunday night, but when they reached the spot, no such activity was found.

After this, the police arrested Asif and Mohammad Sahib for making a hoax call to the 112 emergency control room. The police have also appealed to the public not to fall prey to rumours and misinformation.

US President Donald Trump is considering tariffs on BRICS nations and has accused the group of adopting anti-US policies. 

Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, he claimed the group is working to weaken the dollar and strip it of its role as the world's reserve currency.

“They have BRICS, which is basically a group of countries which are anti the United States, and India is a member of that if you can believe it,” Trump said. “It's an attack on the dollar, and we're not going to let anybody attack the dollar.”

Trump earlier warned that any attempt by the group to challenge the US dollar would be met with harsh economic measures. BRICS members targeted by his latest sanctions, such as India and Brazil, said they would protect their domestic interests.

Trump also announced on Wednesday that India will face 25% tariffs and additional penalties starting on Friday over its continued trade with Russia.

He said the tariffs were imposed partly because of India's membership in BRICS, and partly because of what he called a “tremendous” trade deficit with New Delhi.

Trump also imposed a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil effective August 1, claiming the country poses a threat to “the national security, foreign policy, and economy” of the US.

BRICS was established in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Over the past year, it has extended membership to Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia. BRICS partner countries include Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said BRICS countries are seeking alternatives to the dollar to shield themselves from Washington's “arbitrariness,” calling the shift irreversible.

Last year, Russia's Finance Ministry said national currencies made up 65% of BRICS trade, with the dollar and euro falling below 30%. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said BRICS is not a rival to the US, but warned that “the language of threats and manipulation… is not the way to speak to members of this group.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is signalling that the U.S. is working with Ottawa on the punishing metals tariffs that are harming the U.S. auto industry. 

Ford Motor Co. F-N earlier this week said that tariffs cost it US$800-million in its latest quarter with tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum responsible for a significant portion. 

U.S. President Donald Trump in March imposed 25-per-cent tariffs on global imports of both aluminum and steel, citing national security concerns over the U.S. not producing enough of the metals domestically. He doubled the levies in June.

The body of Ford's F-150 pickup, one of the biggest-selling vehicles in the U.S., is made from military-grade Canadian aluminum manufactured in Quebec. 

Speaking on CNBC on Thursday, Mr. Bessent said he is aware that Ford's F-series trucks are made from aluminum, which is currently subject to a 50-per-cent tariff. 

“I think maybe the aluminum tariffs hit them harder,” he said. “We will be negotiating with Canada on those.” 

Mr. Trump in recent days has indicated that he is willing to relent on some of his tariff threats. 

After threatening to tariff the global copper industry, on Wednesday he limited the levy to only some copper products, such as pipes, wires, and rods. Mr. Trump spared a broad swath of the industry, including miners that extract copper concentrate as well as anodes, cathodes, and semi-processed materials.

Jim Ritchie, owner of Vancouver-based metals distribution company Cascadia Metals Ltd., said that Trump's tariffs on copper are a “net win for Canada.”

“It is however still a hardship for American manufacturing, as now they will have to pay higher prices for finished copper products, either because of the 50-per-cent tariff or higher domestic prices.” 

The existing Trump tariffs on aluminum, and steel have taken a heavy toll on both Canadian and U.S. industry.

Canadian steelmaker Algoma Steel Group Inc. is seeking around $500-million in funding from Ottawa to bolster its finances, and this week it suspended its dividend. 

U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa Corp., which operates three smelters in Quebec, incurred US$150-million in tariff costs in its latest quarter. 

Bill Oplinger, the chief executive officer of Alcoa told The Globe and Mail last week that he is seeking a carve out for Canada in aluminum tariffs because of the heavy hit the company is taking. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney has been targeting Aug. 1 to reach a trade deal with the U.S. 

But he has said that a tariff-free pact is unlikely, and he has indicated that the timeline to reach a deal may be pushed out. 

While Mr. Trump has recently reached preliminary trade deals with several countries and trading blocs, including the EU, pacts with many other nations have not yet materialized. 

Mr. Trump on Thursday pushed out the deadline to reach a deal with Mexico by three months.

The U.S. on Wednesday set the import duty for a range of copper products at 50 per cent starting Aug. 1, citing national security concerns as he attempts to bolster the country's manufacturing sector.

Pierre Gratton, president of the Mining Association of Canada, said that by being exempted from the Trump tariffs, copper miners are in a similar position to iron ore, nickel, and metallurgical coal companies that produce steel inputs. 

“Our end of the business is largely untouched,” Mr. Gratton said. “But steel is being hammered.”

The decision to drop the case comes days after the Justice Department fired two of its top antitrust officials.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

The U.S. Justice Department this week dropped an antitrust case against a company represented by the lobbying firm that employed Pam Bondi before her confirmation as attorney general earlier this year.

American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) has paid the lobbying giant Ballard Partners hundreds of thousands of dollars this year to pressure Bondi's Justice Department on “antitrust issues,” according to federal disclosures.

The DOJ's decision to drop the antitrust lawsuit, which was initially filed during the final days of the Biden administration, allows Amex GBT's acquisition of rival CWT Holdings to move forward despite concerns that the merger would harm competition in the travel management sector. Amex GBT said it was “pleased” the DOJ dropped the case ahead of trial, which was set to begin in September.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the anti-monopoly American Economic Liberties Project, called the Justice Department's move “so so so corrupt” and urged observers to “follow the money.”

Amex GBT paid Ballard Partners $50,000 in the first quarter of 2025 and $150,000 in the second quarter to lobby the Justice Department. Jon Golinger, democracy advocate with Public Citizen, said last week that “the American people deserve to know whether Attorney General Bondi has been involved with her former firm's lobbying and if the red carpet is being rolled out for these clients by the Department of Justice because of her former role at Ballard.”

“If Bondi has been involved with the Ballard firm's lobbying, she has likely violated the ethics pledge,” Golinger added. “The American people deserve an attorney general who always puts their needs above the special interest agendas of former business associates.”

Scrutiny of the Justice Department's decision to drop the Amex GBT case comes amid allegations of corruption surrounding the DOJ's merger settlement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks last month. It also comes days after the Justice Department fired two of its top antitrust officials.

The American Prospect's David Dayen noted Tuesday that the Justice Department's voluntary dismissal of the Amex GBT lawsuit means the case — unlike the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper settlement — doesn't have to face a Tunney Act review.

In a statement to the Prospect, a Justice Department spokesperson denied that Bondi had any involvement in the antitrust division's decision to drop the Amex GBT case.

“The smell of corruption has gotten bad enough that they're trying to shape the information environment,” Dayen wrote in response to the DOJ statement.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

            Dangerous torrential rainfall and flash flooding are underway in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Thursday with millions at risk along the Interstate 95 corridor. It's shaping up to be another serious flood event in a summer that's been full of them.
    


            Heavy storms developed in the afternoon and will last through the evening. Some could dump several inches of rain in a few hours, flooding roads and threatening public transit during the busy afternoon and evening commute.
    


            Flash flood warnings were active in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia by mid-afternoon with more drenching storms to come. There have already been reports of flooded roads and stranded vehicles in Maryland and Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service and local officials.
    


            The Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding rain from Washington, DC, to New York City and the southernmost part of Connecticut. This threat level means numerous flash floods are likely, some of which could threaten life and property in vulnerable urban areas. Philadelphia and Baltimore are also included in this risk area.
    


            New Jersey is under a state of emergency due to the potential for intense rainfall and flash flooding, according to a news release from acting Gov. Tahesha Way.
    


            “I urge all New Jerseyans to remain alert, follow all safety protocols, and monitor the proper channels for the duration of these storms,” Way said in the release. “Residents should remain off the roads and indoors unless absolutely necessary.”
    


            Gov. Kathy Hochul also announced she is declaring a state of emergency for New York City and its surrounding counties due to the potential flooding.
    


            Travel disruptions could be severe as the heaviest rain continues through the evening commute. Subways could also see serious flooding, as New York saw earlier this month, when intense rainfall in the span of hours sent water gushing onto platforms and into subway cars.
    


            Air travel woes were growing late Thursday afternoon, with ground stops in effect at Newark International, LaGuardia, Dulles International, Baltimore-Washington International and Philadelphia International airports, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport was experiencing average delays of around three hours. Thousands of flights within, into and out of the US have been cancelled or delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    


            Some storms are expected to train, or continue moving or redeveloping over the same areas, raising rainfall totals considerably. A few locations within the Level 3 of 4 area could get up to 8 inches of rain in a short amount of time.
    


            The rain is due to a cold front that is breaking a long-lasting, punishing heat dome that has been keeping the East sweltering during the day and simmering at night.
    


            After a summer of frequent rain and flooding, the water simply has no place to go. And even if the region wasn't soaked, extreme rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour could overwhelm areas that typically drain well. Cities often struggle to handle heavy rain as pavement and asphalt keep water from soaking into the ground and instead head for drains that are prone to clogging or simply incapable of handling the volume of water.
    


Flash floods are most common in summer, as warmer air can hold more moisture and intense daytime heat helps fuel potent storms. But overwhelming rainfall is becoming more prevalent due to climate change, as rising global temperatures drive weather toward extremes. Hourly rainfall rates have grown heavier in nearly 90% of large US cities since 1970, according to a study from the nonprofit research group Climate Central.
    


            Rainfall across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast has already been above normal this summer — especially in parts of eastern Pennsylvania, central New Jersey, northern Maryland, and the DC suburbs — leaving soils saturated and primed for rapid runoff and flooding even without extreme amounts of rain.
    


            Nearly all of New Jersey is in the risk area. The state has been slammed by flooding this summer, including when at least two people were killed two weeks ago. The increased risk also includes parts of Virginia that have flooded multiple times this season.
    


            Flooding can be extremely dangerous at night, when it's harder to see water covering roads. “If you encounter a flooded roadway, turn around and find another route,” the National Weather Service advises. “It only takes six inches of fast‑moving water to knock over an adult and just 12 inches to sweep away most vehicles.”
    


            Less than two weeks ago, on July 19, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency — the highest level of flood alert — for the Washington, DC, area with rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches in 30 minutes raising rivers and sending water over roadways. Dozens of people had to be rescued from floodwaters after heavy rain struck parts of Virginia, Maryland and Washington, DC.
    


            Heavy storms will come to an end Thursday night for much of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The flood risk shifts south into the Carolinas and part of Georgia on Friday, more states all too familiar with serious flooding this summer. Tropical Storm Chantal's flooding rainfall killed at least one person in North Carolina in early July.

Russia says its forces have captured the key town of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine after nearly 18 months of fierce fighting in the area.
    


            The Ukrainian military confirmed Thursday that Russian forces had attacked locations near Chasiv Yar, which lies several miles west of Bakhmut. But it denied the town had been lost. “Chasiv Yar remains under the control of the 11th Army Corps,” the Corps said Thursday.
    


            The Russian Defense Ministry published drone footage showing its troops in parts of the town and said more than 4,200 buildings and structures had been cleared, with about 50 Ukrainian soldiers taken prisoner.
    


            Chasiv Yar had a pre-war population of 12,000 but is now in ruins after two years of airstrikes and artillery attacks.
    


            Russian forces began an assault on Chasiv Yar in April last year, after driving Ukrainian forces out of Bakhmut. Analysts estimate that they have since suffered thousands of casualties in trying to overcome Ukrainian defenses.
    


            DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source mapping site that charts the war's front lines, showed Kyiv's forces still present at the western edge of the town. It added that video from the Russian Defense Ministry showed its troops planting flags in two neighborhoods, but said the Russians had no control over those areas.
    


            If confirmed, the seizure of Chasiv Yar would provide high ground for the Russians, and threaten what is known as Ukraine's fortress belt of cities in Donetsk region, including Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka.
    


            These cities are periodically struck by Russian missiles and glide bombs launched by aircraft. On Thursday, one person was killed and about a dozen injured by a strike that destroyed part of a five-story building in Kramatorsk, according to the local military administration.
    


Russia's summer offensive is turning into an escalating crisis for Ukraine



            Across Donetsk region, Russian troops have edged forward this year despite taking heavy casualties. The strategic town of Pokrovsk is surrounded on three sides and Russian units have advanced to the border of Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk region.
    


            Analysts say Russian forces have adapted their tactics, moving in smaller groups on foot or on motorbikes to evade Ukrainian drone defenses.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia launched another major missile and drone attack on the capital Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday. A six-year-old boy and his mother were among at least 16 people killed, according to local officials. Another child was also killed in the attack, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said.
    


            At least 159 people were injured, city officials said. Of those wounded, 16 were children, according to the country's emergency service.
    


            One Russian missile made a “direct hit” on an apartment building in the western district of Sviatoshynskyi, according to Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the military administration in the Ukrainian capital.
    


            One man was rescued from the rubble after being trapped for more than three hours, while relatives of others unaccounted for waited anxiously as rescue crews tried to remove debris. One woman at the scene told CNN that her mother and sister were in the building when the missile struck.
    


            Iryna Tsymokh, 53, said she and her family had just returned from a shelter when there was another attack. “The doors were blown out. My child was screaming so loud… We all just jumped out as we were, in night clothes,” she said.
    


            Zoya Onishenko said her apartment had been destroyed. She was still alive only because she had spent the night at her country dacha.
    


            Zelensky said Russian forces had launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles at the capital, describing it as an insidious attack deliberately calculated to overload the air defense system.

Singer says on social media living with disease can be ‘relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically'

Justin Timberlake has said he is suffering from Lyme disease, a serious illness usually contracted after being bitten by a tick and that has seen an upsurge in prevalence across a swathe of the US in recent years.

In an Instagram post, the pop singer wrote: “I've been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease – which I don't say so you feel bad for me – but to shed some light on what I've been up against behind the scenes.”

He added: “If you've experienced this disease or know someone who has – then you're aware: living with this can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically. When I first got the diagnosis I was shocked for sure. But, at least I could understand why I would be on stage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.”

Timberlake's post came at the end of more than a year of him being on tour, which kicked off in April 2024, about one month after he released the album Everything I Thought It Was.

The singer faced scrutiny following perceived lackluster performances on the road, with some who bought tickets criticizing the concert on social media. Recently, some fans and commentators have pointed out what they felt were signs of fatigue or ill health during his performances.

Timberlake addressed the concerns, saying: “I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going.”

He added: “Not only did I prove my mental tenacity to myself but, I now have so many special moments with all of you that I will never forget. I was reluctant to talk about this because I was always raised to keep something like this to yourself. But I am trying to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren't misinterpreted.”

His statement on social media was met with an outpouring of support from fans. “You are so loved, and we'll be here supporting whatever you decide to do next,” said one. Another added: “Justin you are so appreciated. Thank you for showing up for us time and time again. Take care of yourself. We love you and will continue to ride for you.”

According to Billboard, the Forget Tomorrow world tour pushed Timberlake to the 10th spot of Billboard‘s midyear Boxscore report of touring artists, with the tour grossing $73.2m across 41 shows as of late May.

Timberlake is not the first famous musician who has spoken out publicly about their struggles with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, a condition which can cause a rash and symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue and muscle and joint aches. Avril Lavigne, Justin Bieber and Shania Twain have also revealed they have suffered from the illness.

Lyme disease can last many months or even years. Potentially disease-bearing ticks have been flourishing recently in the US, especially as climate change leads to warmer summers that encourage tick populations to thrive.

This year, as compared to recent years, there has been an increase in the reported number of ticks and visits to the emergency room because of bites from the tiny parasitic arachnid, according to data from universities and the US federal government.

In May and June this year, the US has seen the highest number of emergency room visits during those months for tick bites since 2019, according to the CDC.

Timberlake began his career as a “Mouseketeer” on the All-New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993, where his cast mates included fellow singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. He rose to fame in the popular boy band ‘NSync, before going solo in 2002 and going on to become one of the best-selling pop artists of the 2000s.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: The story was updated with a statement from an SBU source.

Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) drones struck a Russian radio electronics plant in the western city of Penza that manufactures military-grade equipment, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent on July 31.

 ""At least 11 explosions were recorded"" following a large-scale fire at the JSC Radiozavod plant, a sanctioned facility owned by the Russian state-owned Rostec defense corporation, the source claimed.

The statement comes after Russian officials and media reported mass Ukrainian strikes across multiple regions overnight on July 31, including against an industrial facility in Penza and energy infrastructure in Volgograd Oblast.

Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, said the Radiozavod plant specializes in equipment for mobile command units, automated combat control systems, and military-grade radio stations.

""It is a key enterprise of the Russian military-industrial complex,"" Kovalenko said.

According to the SBU source, the automated combat control systems produced at the facility are used across multiple Russian military branches, from air defenses to artillery.

""Preliminary reports indicate that the plant's new production facility and warehouses with components were hit,"" the source said.

Without disclosing the nature of the facility, Penza Oblast Governor Oleg Melnichenko confirmed the attack, saying that a fire had occurred at an industrial plant.

""There is a fire at the plant, which is being extinguished,"" he said.

Two pro-government Russian Telegram channels, Shot and Baza, posted footage of the fire and reported widespread mobile service disruptions.

Melnichenko later acknowledged the outages, attributing them to ""safety reasons,"" and said mobile internet restrictions were temporarily in place across the city.

Penza lies roughly 625 kilometers (388 miles) southeast of Moscow and about 600 kilometers (373 miles) from the nearest Ukraine-controlled territory.

Farther south, in Volgograd Oblast, regional officials confirmed that drones targeted transportation and energy infrastructure in Kotelnikovo and nearby districts. 

Governor Andrei Bocharov said gas supplies to 65 homes were cut off, and train traffic was restricted near the Tinguta station in the Svitloyarsky district due to drone debris.

""A massive drone attack on transportation and energy facilities in the Volgograd Oblast has been repelled,"" he said. ""To remove drone debris found on the railway tracks near Tinguta station in the Svetloyarsky district, train traffic has been temporarily restricted.""

A video published by independent Russian outlet Astra shows a large fire burning at the site of the strike in Kotelnikovo. The Russian Telegram channel Shot reported that residents in the suburbs of Volgograd heard up to five explosions.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that air defenses shot down 31 Ukrainian drones over six regions, including 11 over Volgograd Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify all the claims.

The strikes come amid Ukraine's intensified campaign targeting Russian military, industrial, and logistical infrastructure deep inside Russia. 

Kyiv has increasingly relied on long-range drones to disrupt Moscow's war effort and force resource redeployments far from the front lines.

The same night, Russia launched a mass aerial strike against Kyiv, collapsing a residential building while killing at least seven people and injuring dozens more. 

Russia launched a massive attack on Kyiv overnight, killing at least 16 people and injuring 159 in one of the heaviest attacks in recent weeks. A total of 12 children were injured, in what Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said was the highest number of child casualties in the city since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.

If formalized, Nicaragua could become the first country to officially recognize Russia's annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts — territories Moscow declared part of Russia in 2022.







Three police officers and 12 children were among the injured. Thirty people, including five children, remain hospitalized as of 2:40 p.m. local time, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

""What bothers the president the most is he has these great phone calls where everyone sort of claims, 'we'd like to see this end...' And then he turns on the news and another city's been bombed,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. 



Russia has been using the ""extremism"" label to target anything that contradicts the Kremlin's narrative, including the official version of global or Russian history.

Nearly one in five car dealerships in Russia could shut down by the end of the year as the country's auto market struggles from plummeting sales and a worsening economic outlook, the Moscow Times reported.



""President Trump has made clear this must be done by Aug. 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,"" senior American diplomat John Kelley told the United Nations Security Council.

One of the main targets was a radio factory in the western city of Penza, which produces advanced communications systems for the Russian Armed Forces, according to Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation. 

""There is preliminary information that there were rocket-powered Shahed-type drones,"" said Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.

The bill aims to reverse legislation passed last week that effectively destroyed the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor (SAPO).","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Donald Trump has warned that Canada's decision to back a Palestinian state puts a trade deal between the two countries at risk.

On Wednesday night, Canada joined the UK in announcing that it would recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September.

“Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a trade deal with them. Oh Canada!!!” Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

His trade threat comes a day before higher tariffs on countries without a US trade deal are set to come into place. Canada will face 35 per cent tariffs on most goods it sells to the US from Friday, unless an agreement is reached on Thursday.

Canada's decision to recognise a Palestinian state follows similar announcements first by France and then by the UK.

Western nations have been under pressure to recognise Palestine as Israel continues its relentless assault in Gaza, which has contributed to a deepening hunger crisis in the war-torn enclave.

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said there was “real starvation” in Gaza, telling Israel to allow “every ounce of food” into the Palestinian territory.

The US president also criticised France and the UK's decision to recognise Palestine, with Mr Trump saying of Emmanuel Macron: “What he says doesn't matter. He's a very good guy. I like him, but that statement doesn't carry weight.”

Mr Trump also issued a rare rebuke to Sir Keir Starmer while speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on his return to Washington from his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland.

“We never did discuss it,” the US president said, in reference to the Prime Minister's announcement, which came hours after his press conference with Mr Trump. “You're rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don't think they should be rewarded.”

However, it does not appear that the UK and France's decision to recognise Palestine will affect their respective trade deals.

The UK was the first country to announce a trade deal with the US, meaning they will pay a 10 per cent tariff on most goods. France, meanwhile, will pay 15 per cent as part of a separate deal agreed with the European Union.

Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, told reporters in Ontario that Canada would recognise Palestine under certain conditions, including that the Palestinian Authority commits to reforming its governance and holds elections without Hamas.

The Israeli foreign ministry responded: “The change in the position of the Canadian government at this time is a reward for Hamas and harms the efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of the hostages.”

An anonymous White House official told Reuters: “President Trump's focus is on getting people fed.”

Canada had previously said it would only recognise a Palestinian state once peace talks had concluded with Israel, though it shifted its stance due to the situation on the ground.

Mr Carney said the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza meant the “prospect of a Palestinian state is literally receding before our eyes”.

“We are working ourselves, with others, to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution, to not allow the facts on the ground, deaths on the ground, the settlements on the ground, the expropriations on the ground, to get to such an extent that this is not possible.”

Meanwhile, British lawyers have warned Sir Keir that recognising a Palestinian state would break international law.

In a letter to Lord Hermer, the Attorney General, 40 members of the House of Lords – many of them lawyers – wrote: “Palestine does not meet the international law criteria for recognition of a state, namely, defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.

“This is set out in the Montevideo Convention, has become part of customary law, and it would be unwise to depart from it at a time when international law is seen as fragile or, indeed, at any time.”

On Thursday, Sweden called on the EU to suspend the trade section of its association agreement with Israel over its conduct of the war in Gaza.

“The situation in Gaza is absolutely appalling, and Israel is failing to fulfil its most basic obligations and agreements on emergency aid. Sweden therefore demands that the EU freeze the trade section of the association agreement as soon as possible,” Ulf Kristersson, the prime minister, said in a post to X, calling on the Israeli government to allow “unhindered humanitarian aid into Gaza”.

Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip continue to kill and injure hundreds of Palestinians each day, including many people seeking aid amid deepening starvation across the territory. Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that there is “no starvation” in Gaza, a U.S. doctor who just returned from Gaza says the reality is undeniable. “It was evident to me, in my firsthand experience, that what I was seeing was malnourishment in my patients,” says Dr. Ambereen Sleemi, a urogynecologist and the executive director of the International Medical Response Foundation based in New York. “We also saw it in our hospital staff. … Everybody would sit and talk about how hungry they were.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: As we continue our coverage of Gaza, a Palestinian medical organization reports Israeli forces are increasingly abducting doctors across Gaza, with some 28 doctors currently held in Israeli prisons. Among them is Dr. Marwan al-Hams, head of Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital. He was last seen 10 days ago, when an Israeli undercover unit seized him at a field hospital of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Rafah.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, our next guest is a U.S.-based surgeon just back from Gaza, where she treated patients at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where she says malnutrition cases are everywhere, in newborn babies, pregnant women, even among the hospital staff. Dr. Ambereen Sleemi is a urogynecologist who's the executive director of the International Medical Response Foundation based here in New York City, has provided medical services in numerous countries, including Pakistan, Nigeria and Ukraine. She's joining us here in New York.

Thanks so much, Doctor, for joining us. You are just back this week from Gaza. Talk about what you found on the ground and the evidence that the prime minister of Israel is denying, that there is starvation in Gaza.

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: Good morning. Thank you for having me here in New York.

Yeah, I just got back two days ago, and I spent about three-and-a-half weeks there, and primarily in the maternity hospital on the grounds of Nasser Hospital. And it was evident to me, in my firsthand experience, that what I was seeing was malnourishment in my patients, which were pregnant patients, but also those needing gynecologic care. And it was evident by the numbers of babies and their birth weight that was coming out, that they were being born to malnourished women. It was evident in the decreased ability to breastfeed when the newborns were born by the moms, and also in the way that pregnancies had complications, that had increased in number, and remarkably so, in the last few months of the siege. So, there was ample evidence just clinically by, you know, numbers in cases of complications, by birth weights of babies, by preterm babies, and also just being able to look at our patients, you know, to see bones that normally we wouldn't see.

And we also saw it in our hospital staff, because not only were those being taken care of in a hospital starving with lack of access to good, nutritious food on a regular basis, but also the caregivers were also feeling the same lack of food, feeling the same hunger pains. And it was openly discussed, because everybody would sit and talk about how hungry they were, in the break room and when they were leaving, that they had to go now and find food for their families. So, you know, I think it was — it was very clear, in my experience and those I was working with, that this was really a starvation crisis that was occurring.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Dr. Sleemi, you spent most of your time there in operating rooms. If you could talk about the intersection, the pregnant women that you dealt with, who were also suffering from traumatic injuries?

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: Yeah.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: What were the principal things that you were treating and the surgeries you were performing?

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: I'm really glad you asked that, because I think when we talk about pregnancy in a war zone, we really need to address the issue of trauma in pregnant patients. And actually, just before coming here, I found out that one of our pregnant patients who was in the ICU had passed away yesterday. And she was five months pregnant and sleeping in a tent, and a bomb was dropped in the area, that's supposed to be a safe zone. So she ended up coming in with, you know, extensive burns and explosive injuries with shrapnel and required major surgery for the burns, with skin grafts, major surgery, abdominal surgery, to get rid of the shrapnel. She had lost vision in one eye, and she was intubated. She couldn't breathe on her own because of inhalation from the smoke and fire. So, there was a thought that she would be able to pull through. Oh, and by the way, she was also five months pregnant, which was really hard to even notice because she was so malnourished. So, I, you know, was consulted to come in and at least do an ultrasound and make sure that the baby was alive. And before I left, it was. And so, I just found out yesterday as I was checking up on her — I found out this morning that she had passed away.

And there's always hope that somebody will pull through. But the situations with the sanitation in Nasser Hospital, we also just heard, as we were leaving on Monday morning, that the clinical wound services for over 400 patients had to be suspended because the supplies had run out. So, we're already dealing with, you know, malnutrition and starvation because of the Israeli siege on food and supplies, affecting healing on a heavily traumatized patient population, including pregnant women. And now the services that were going to be withheld were the one thing that could get them to some healing with appropriate wound care.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to play for you the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Yechiel Leiter, who claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was flooding food into Gaza. As we know, Netanyahu has denied outright that there's starvation in Gaza. This is the Israeli ambassador.

YECHIEL LEITER: We feel the same way. The prime minister feels the same way. And that's why he's taken every decision possible to have food flood into Gaza. As a matter of fact, right now as we speak, there's 636 trucks, semi-trailers, waiting to enter Gaza, and U.N. agencies are not picking them up, because of their argument with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. … I appeal to the international community and to the media. I mean, look, there have been pictures that have been broadcast, even on CNN — I got to say this, excuse me, but even on CNN — pictures of children who are suffering from cerebral palsy or cystic fibrosis, not from hunger, and yet we're condemned for it. This has a long history of pointing the finger at the Jewish state. It really has to stop.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, that was the Israeli ambassador speaking earlier. So, you know, the reference is to a New York Times cover story which showed the image of a child who appeared — in fact, was — starving. But the Israelis said the story was misleading because the child actually had cerebral palsy. Now, Dr. Sleemi, if you could explain, you know, that argument, respond to what was said now, but also the fact that that child had cerebral palsy? But first of all, cerebral palsy patients don't necessarily look so enormously emaciated. And, you know, the claims that Israel is making about what's actually going on in Gaza?

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting point, that the government, on one hand, is saying one thing, and then, in our experience, what we've seen firsthand as clinicians on the ground are seeing something completely different, that there is, you know, widespread starvation caused by the siege. We see it every day. We see it in our patients and in children, not just with other conditions, but including cerebral palsy. They shouldn't be starving to death. So, we have other children who don't have any other conditions, who were also clearly starving from lack of nutritional food, and adults, and, like I said, the caretakers that are supposed to be taking care of those who come in for care. I mean, how is this possible that they also are not getting nutritional food and starving and hungry?

AMY GOODMAN: And just to be clear, I mean, if you're suffering starvation, and you get food, that doesn't mean you're going to be OK for the rest of your life.

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: Right.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the effect of starvation on children, on adults?

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: Sure. Based on what I know — again, it's not my area of expertise, but we know that many adults and children right now are in a stage five of the famine and starvation, and reintroducing food to a body that's been starved for months has to be done very carefully, and it can actually lead to somebody dying if it's not done appropriately, because you have lack of not just food. I mean, you can eat bread every day, but that's not enough to sustain development, a healthy, you know, brain development, body development. And I think that's the thing that you'll see even in kids now, after being deprived for months.

The siege that's happening in the last few months is an acute event on top of a chronic, already malnourished population. So, it's, you know, insult to injury. And again, these long-term effects of developmental delay for kids, we see that. We know that's a possibility. How is it going to affect the adults long term, when they do eventually get a steady supply of food? And I think that we know that there's going to be chronic health conditions.

AMY GOODMAN: You've also worked in Ukraine. We just have 30 seconds, but the comparisons?

DR. AMBEREEN SLEEMI: I mean, they're both tragic situations. But one thing I'll say is I have worked in both and, as a humanitarian physician, feel that it's important that we work where we can, where the populations need it. But the one thing I can say for Gaza that is different is that there's no safe place in Gaza. We hear it all the time. Being there, it was absolutely — it was completely evident that there is no safe place in Gaza.

AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Ambereen Sleemi, urogynecologist, executive director of the International Medical Response Foundation, just back this week from volunteering for several weeks at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, in Gaza.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

            If Carlo Zanella, president of the Alto Adige Alpine Club, had his way, travel influencers would be banned from the Dolomites.
    


            He blames them for the latest Italian social media trend, which has lured hundreds of thousands of tourists to the mountain range in northern Italy, with many traipsing across private land to get that perfect shot.
    


            In response to the influx, frustrated local farmers have set up turnstiles, where tourists must pay 5 euros (nearly $6) to access several “Instagrammable” spots, including the Seceda and Drei Zinnen (Three Peaks) mountain ranges.
    


            Photos showing lines of up to 4,000 people a day, have been popping up on social media in recent weeks. But rather than deter people from coming, the images have acted as a magnet.
    


            “The media's been talking about the turnstiles, everyone's been talking about it,” says Zanella. “And people go where everyone else goes. We're sheep.”
    


            Italian law mandates free access to natural parks, such as the Alps and Dolomites, but the landowners who set up the turnstiles say they have yet to receive any official pushback from authorities.
    


            Georg Rabanser, a former Italian national team snowboarder who owns land in a meadow on Seceda, told the Ladin-language magazine La Usc he and others started charging tourists to cross their land to make a point.
    


            “So many people come through here every day, everyone goes through our properties and leaves trash,” he says. “Ours was a cry for help. We expected a call from the provincial authorities. But nothing. We only read statements in the newspapers. Gossip; nothing concrete. We haven't even received warning letters. So we're moving forward.”
    


A secret tunnel city hidden under Rome's ancient heart is being revealed



            Zanella, who says he avoids his once beloved alpine hiking trails during the summer months, supports the landowners charging admission to cross their property. He thinks the government should pay for the upkeep of the entrance system, likening the overtourism to Venice, where visitors have to pay a 10-euro entrance fee (around $12) on busy weekends.
    


            “I would increase the price from 5 to 100 euros,” he tells CNN. “And close the accounts of travel influencers.”
    


            Beyond the public nuisance of overcrowding, he fears the naivete of social media tourists puts them at risk.
    


            “Once upon a time, those who came up to the mountains were prepared, dressed for the mountains, and came for hiking. Especially the Germans, who had maps and knew where to go. The Italians, on the other hand, set off, go, and take a cable car,” he says in a statement shared with CNN. “Now I've seen people go up to Seceda with sun umbrellas and flip-flops and get stuck because the cable car closed and they hadn't checked the lift schedules (…) This isn't what the mountains should be,” he says.
    


            The local tourism body has petitioned authorities to close the turnstiles, insisting the issue is being overblown. The Santa Cristina Tourist Board, which oversees part of the area where the turnstiles have popped up, says they have hired four park rangers to ensure that tourists stay on the trails, don't cross the meadows and don't fly drones.
    


            “Things have improved significantly,” Lukas Demetz, president of the Santa Cristina Tourist Board, said in a statement shared with CNN. “And even the litter problem isn't as serious as people say. It's significantly reduced.”
    


            Still, across the Aosta Valley, parking lots have popped up to stop people from driving up the mountainside, and hikers are required to take the paid shuttle bus to Monte Rosa. At the Pian del Re peat bog in Piedmont, only 150 cars are allowed to park in the closest parking area to discourage visitors. Some regions, including Lake Braies, now charge 40 euros a car to access the area to try to deter people from coming in to take pictures. Arno Kompatscher, the governor of South Tyrol province, which includes part of the Dolomites range, has called on the national government to set restrictions to protect the fragile alpine ecosystems and dissuade local residents from renting out their chalets to tourists.
    


This hilltop town is one of Europe's smallest — and most unusual — countries



            The mountain residents aren't the only Italians clamping down on badly behaved visitors. Across the country, new ordinances have been a hallmark of the 2025 summer.
    


            Wearing just a swimsuit or going bare-chested in some Italian towns will attract more than a few looks. Semi-nudity could also land you a 500-euro fine — in the name of decorum. The Tuscan island of Elba and the Ligurian city of Diano Marina have both introduced summer ordinances that prohibit shirtless and swimsuit-only strutting — for both men and women — anywhere but the beach.
    


            And if your attire is deemed vulgar or “indecent” in the eyes of any beholder, authorities can levy smaller fines starting at 25 euros.
    


            In Livorno, walking barefoot is prohibited. On Sardinian beaches, you'll get in trouble for digging holes for umbrellas, smoking, or lying on the sand without a mat. At the ever popular La Pelosa beach area, only 1,500 bathers are allowed at a time to prohibit overcrowding.
    


            In San Felice Circeo, a party town south of Rome where having an aperitivo on the beach is a way of life, take-away alcohol is banned both in town and on the beach. Loud music can only be blared during certain hours across much of the country, and in the southern region of Puglia, boaters risk a fine if they play music within 500 meters of the coast.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Appellate court judges expressed broad skepticism Thursday over President Donald Trump's legal rationale for his most expansive round of tariffs.

Members of the 11-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington appeared unconvinced by the Trump administration's insistence that the president could impose tariffs without congressional approval, and it hammered its invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so.

“IEEPA doesn't even mention the word ‘tariffs' anywhere,” Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna said, in a sign of the panel's incredulity to a government attorney's arguments. 

Brett Schumate, the attorney representing the Trump administration, acknowledged in the 99-minute hearing “no president has ever read IEEPA this way” but contended it was nonetheless lawful.

The 1977 law, signed by President Jimmy Carter, allows the president to seize assets and block transactions during a national emergency. It was first used during the Iran hostage crisis and has since been invoked for a range of global unrest, from the 9/11 attacks to the Syrian civil war.

Trump says the country's trade deficit is so serious that it likewise qualifies for the law's protection.




In sharp exchanges with Schumate, appellate judges questioned that contention, asking whether the law extended to tariffs at all and, if so, whether the levies matched the threat the administration identified.




“If the president says there's a problem with our military readiness,” Chief Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore posited, “and he puts a 20% tax on coffee, that doesn't seem to necessarily deal with (it).”

Schumate said Congress' passage of IEEPA gave the president “broad and flexible” power to respond to an emergency, but that “the president is not asking for unbounded authority.”

But an attorney for the plaintiffs, Neal Katyal, characterized Trump's maneuver as a “breathtaking” power grab that amounted to saying “the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants so long as he declares an emergency.”

No ruling was issued from the bench. Regardless of what decision the judges' deliberations bring, the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump weighed in on the case on his Truth Social platform, posting: “To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America's big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE “DEAD,” WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!''

In filings in the case, the Trump administration insists that “a national emergency exists” necessitating its trade policy. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, was unconvinced however, ruling in May that Trump exceeded his powers.

The issue now rests with the appeals judges.

The challenge strikes at just one batch of import taxes from an administration that has unleashed a bevy of them and could be poised to unveil more on Friday.

The case centers on Trump's so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs of April 2 that imposed new levies on nearly every country. But it doesn't cover other tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum  and autos, nor ones imposed on China during Trump's first term, and continued by President Joe Biden. 

The case is one of at least seven lawsuits charging that Trump overstepped his authority through the use of tariffs on other nations. The plaintiffs include 12 U.S. states and five businesses, including a wine importer, a company selling pipes and plumbing goods, and a maker of fishing gear.

The U.S. Constitution gives the Congress the authority to impose taxes — including tariffs — but over decades lawmakers have ceded power over trade policy to the White House.

Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, the highest rate since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.

The Senate rejected an effort Wednesday from Sen. Bernie Sanders to block the sale of U.S. bombs and firearms to Israel, though the vote showed a growing number of Democrats opposed to the arms sales amid widespread hunger and suffering in Gaza.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate rejected an effort Wednesday from Sen. Bernie Sanders to block the sale of U.S. bombs and firearms to Israel, though the vote showed a growing number of Democrats opposed to the arms sales amid widespread hunger and suffering in Gaza.

Sanders, an independent from Vermont, has repeatedly tried to block the sale of offensive weapons to Israel over the last year. The resolutions before the Senate on Tuesday would have stopped the sale of $675 million in bombs as well as shipments of 20,000 automatic assault rifles to Israel.

They again failed to gain passage, but 27 Democrats — more than half the caucus — voted for the resolution that applied to assault rifles, and 24 voted for the resolution that applied to bomb sales. It was more than any of Sanders' previous efforts, which at a high mark in November last year gained 18 votes from Democrats. 

The vote tally showed how the images of starvation emerging from Gaza are creating a growing schism in what has traditionally been overwhelming support for Israel from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

Sanders said Democrats are responding to “a significant majority of the American people who are tired of spending billions and billions of dollars on an Israeli government which is currently starving children to death.”

As the war approaches its second year, the leading international authority on food crises said this week that a “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip.” International pressure, including from President Donald Trump, has led Israel to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. But the U.N. and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm delivery trucks.




The Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, argued that Hamas was to blame both for the conflict and the current situation in Gaza. All Republican senators voted against Sanders' resolutions.

“They use the people of Gaza as human shields, and they steal the food that the people of Gaza need,” Risch said. “It is in the interest of America and the world to see this terrorist group destroyed.”

Known as joint resolutions of disapproval, the measures would have had to pass both houses of Congress and withstand any presidential veto to become binding. Congress has never succeeded in blocking arms sales with the joint resolutions.

Democratic senators spent an hour on Wednesday evening with a series of floor speeches calling attention to the children who have starved to death in Gaza. They are also calling on the Trump Administration to recalibrate its approach to the conflict, including a large-scale expansion of aid into Gaza channeled through organizations experienced working in the area.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement following the vote that the Trump administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “have a responsibility to urgently” surge food and other aid into Gaza. Still, he voted against the resolution.

“I have also long held that security assistance to Israel is not about any one government but about our support for the Israeli people,” said Schumer, a New York Democrat.

Other senior Democrats were breaking from that standard.

Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who voted against similar resolutions from Sanders in the past, voted in support of the legislation this time.

“As a longtime friend and supporter of Israel, I am voting yes to send a message: the Netanyahu government cannot continue with this strategy,” she said in a statement.

Another Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said it was still “painful” to support the resolution.

“For many of us who have devoted our congressional careers to supporting Israel, standing by them through difficult times, it is impossible to really explain or defend what is going on today,” Durbin said. “Gaza is starving and dying because of the policies of Bibi Netanyahu.”

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas police on Wednesday charged a 28-year-old man in the killing of a married couple who were hiking with their children at Devil's Den State Park, finding him in a nearby town after a five-day search and public pleas for trailgoers to look through their photos. 

State Police arrested Andrew James McGann, of Springdale, at a barbershop in the town, said Col. Stacie Rhoads, commander of the department's criminal investigation division. McGann was charged with two counts of capital murder. Police would not say what the motive was. 

McGann had recently moved to the area and was working at a school, according to authorities, though they did say not in what job. 

A lawyer couldn't be located for McGann, and a message was left for a number listed for him. He was being held in the Washington County jail Wednesday. It was not immediately clear when his first court appearance was. 

“If you commit a violent, senseless act here in our state, our law enforcement will hunt you down and bring you to justice, because that's what the people of Arkansas frankly deserve,” Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a news conference Wednesday night.

Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, were found dead Saturday on a walking trail at Devil's Den. Their daughters, who are 7 and 9, were not hurt and are being cared for by family members, authorities have said.




Police had released a composite sketch and photo of a person of interest they were searching for in the attack. Along with the drawing, police released a statement saying the suspect “likely sustained an injury while attacking the couple.” It did not go into further detail.

The State Police have released few details, including how the couple was killed. The FBI has said its Little Rock field office is assisting in the investigation. The head of the State Police praised the cooperation among law enforcement on catching McGann.

“Because of their hard work and investigative skill, we were able to take a monster off the streets, and bring relief to those two precious girls, and the rest of our citizens,” Col. Mike Hagar said.

Rhoads said the public's help and video footage they received was instrumental in capturing McGann. Tips came in from as far away as Washington state, she said. 

“It was overwhelming,” she said.

Clinton and Cristen Brink had just moved from South Dakota to the small city of Prairie Grove in northwest Arkansas. Their water had been connected less than two weeks ago, Mayor David Faulk said.

Clinton Brink had been scheduled to start a job as a milk delivery driver Monday in the nearby Fayetteville area, according to Hiland Dairy, his employer. Cristen Brink had been licensed as a nurse in Montana and South Dakota before moving to Arkansas.

The Brink family said the couple died “heroes protecting their little girls.”

“Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place in this area,” Sanders said.

Devil's Den is a 2,500-acre (1,000-hectare) state park near West Fork, about 140 miles (220 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock, the state capital. 

The park is known for its hiking trails and rock formations, and it is a short drive from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and Walmart's Bentonville headquarters. It was selected as a state park site in the 1930s.

The park's trails, which lead to the surrounding Ozark National Forest, remained closed Wednesday.

Trump tells reporters Iran wants to negotiate, but he's 'in no rush to talk.'

A joint statement issued by the U.S., U.K. and a dozen other Western nations on Thursday called out Iran's attempts to ""kill, kidnap and harass"" foreign citizens by working with criminal networks abroad. 

The Western nations highlighted that dissidents, Jewish citizens and journalists, as well as current and former government officials, were being targeted by Iranian intelligence agents in countries across Europe and North America in a direct violation of national sovereignty.

""We are united in our opposition to the attempts of Iranian intelligence services to kill, kidnap, and harass people in Europe and North America in clear violation of our sovereignty,"" the statement, also backed by Canada, Germany and France, said.

IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER DENIES CALLS TO WIPE ISRAEL 'OFF THE MAP,' ASSASSINATION PLOTS TO KILL TRUMP

""We consider these types of attacks, regardless of the target, as violations of our sovereignty,"" the statement, posted by the U.S. Virtual Embassy of Iran, added. ""We are committed to working together to prevent these actions from happening and we call on the Iranian authorities to immediately put an end to such illegal activities in our respective territories.""

More than a dozen nations condemned Iran's actions as ""unacceptable,"" including Albania, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.

The statement, which served not only as an international rebuke, was also an alert to citizens across the European and North American continents of the hostile activities Tehran is pursuing. The warning comes as geopolitical tensions remain high following the Israeli-U.S. strikes on Iran last month.

Trump said that the United States had completed a ""very successful"" strike against Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, saying that Iran's nuclear enrichment installations have been ""obliterated.""  (Fox News)

IRANIAN CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN CLAIMS TO RAISE $40M AS REWARD FOR ASSASSINATING TRUMP

Reports have long suggested that Iran has increasingly engaged in covert malign behavior to target foreign citizens.

Not only was Iran found to be behind an attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election, but it was also found to be behind a slew of Europe and US-based attacks last fall, reported Reuters. 

The U.K. has also reported more than 20 incidents since 2022 of Iran-linked plots to kill or kidnap British nationals or individuals on British soil – the majority of whom were Iranian dissidents.

Journalists and activists have been targeted in the U.S. by Iranian murder-for-hire schemes and kidnapping plots for years, particularly in the wake of the 2022 mass protests that broke out following the death of Mahsa Amini, who was killed following her arrest in Iran for allegedly improperly wearing her hijab. 

Tehran has repeatedly denied its involvement in the murder-for-hire and abduction plots.

Former Counselor to the President Steve Ricchetti arrived for his closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.

Michael Donilon, a longtime aide to former President Joe Biden, is sitting down with House investigators in Oversight Committee Chair James Comer's autopen probe on Wednesday.

Donilon is one of Biden's most enduring confidantes, with a working relationship that began in 1981 when the former president was a U.S. senator from Delaware.

He's also no stranger to Washington, D.C., having earned both his Bachelor's Degree and Juris Doctor from Georgetown University.

Donilon later worked on both Biden's 2020 and 2024 campaigns as a chief strategist and is one of the key people to have gone on the offensive against his fellow Democrats after they cast Biden out following his disastrous June 2024 debate against now-President Donald Trump.

""Now, lots of people have terrible debates,"" Donilon said during a Harvard University event. ""Lots of people have terrible debates. Usually the party doesn't lose its mind, but that's what happened here. It melted down.""

It earned him rebukes from fellow left-wingers, including ex-Obama advisor and CNN political commentator David Axelrod, who called Donilon's comments ""delusional"" on X.

And while his work for Biden made him a national-level figure, Donilon spent years working on other notable Democratic campaigns. 

He played a role in the electoral successes of both former President Bill Clinton in 1992 and ex-Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder in 1989, among others.

But it's the four-year period during which Donilon served as senior advisor to the Biden White House, and then his stint on Biden's short-lived 2024 campaign, that's captured the attention of the House Oversight Committee.

He was dubbed a member of Biden's ""Politburo"" by Axios reporter Alex Thompson and CNN host Jake Tapper in their book ""Original Sin"" – described as a small group of insiders who reportedly helped run the White House while covering signs of Biden's decline from others.

""The president valued Mike Donilon's advice so much that aides would later joke that if he wanted, he could get Biden to start a war,"" the authors wrote.

Donilon was also paid $4 million to work on Biden's re-election bid, according to the book.

The Wall Street Journal reported in Dec. 2024 that Donilon was also a key intermediary between Biden and his pollsters during that short-lived campaign.

And he was with Biden until the very end of his administration, reportedly as one of the aides in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, joining the then-president when he drafted the explosive letter that ended his campaign.

Since that ended, Donilon took up a role as a Spring 2025 Resident Fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses the multi-million dollar deal that President Donald Trump made with Brown University on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

Brown University, the Ivy League institution in Providence, Rhode Island, has agreed to shell out $50 million over a decade to state workforce development organizations as part of a deal struck with the U.S. government, which has agreed to restore grant funding and close probes into the school.

President Donald Trump congratulated the school in a post on Truth Social.

""Congratulations to Brown University on the settlement made with the United States Government. There will be no more Anti-Semitism, or Anti-Christian, or Anti-Anything Else! Woke is officially DEAD at Brown. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" the president declared in the post.

Trump-appointed Education Secretary Linda McMahon also addressed the deal in a statement.

""The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions. Because of the Trump Administration's resolution agreement with Brown University, aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex. Brown has committed to proactive measures to protect Jewish students and combat Antisemitism on campus. Women's sports and intimate facilities will be protected for women and Title IX will be enforced as it was intended,"" she asserted.

""Restoring our nation's higher education institutions to places dedicated to truth-seeking, academic merit, and civil debate—where all students can learn free from discrimination and harassment—will be a lasting legacy of the Trump administration, one that will benefit students and American society for generations to come.""

Brown president Christina Paxson, who discussed the agreement in a lengthy message to members of the Brown community, indicated that the school entered the agreement ""voluntarily.""

She pointed out that it does not involve making any payment to the federal government.

""Beyond the financial stresses of terminated and unpaid research grants and contracts, we have observed a growing push for government intrusion into the fundamental academic operations of colleges and universities, and with the stated purpose of compelling a commitment to comply with laws focused on prohibitions against antisemitism and discrimination,"" she claimed in part of the long note.

The two top intelligence officials in former President Barack Obama's administration denied Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's assessment that they and others politicized the Russia election interference investigation.

Former CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper, who held Gabbard's position under Obama, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times thoroughly rejecting that they engaged in “treasonous conspiracy” to undermine President Donald Trump.

FACT-CHECKING BRENNAN AND CLAPPER'S FALSE RUSSIAGATE NARRATIVE IN NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED

“That is patently false,” they wrote. “In making those allegations, they seek to rewrite history. We want to set the record straight and, in doing so, sound a warning.”

While the pair admitted that some critics say the investigation could have been handled better, “multiple, thorough, yearslong reviews of the assessment have validated its findings and the rigor of its analysis.”

The two cited a bipartisan Senate assessment of Russian election activities, which featured a sign-off by Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he served in the Senate. The assessment found that the intelligence officials were “under no politically motivated pressure” when they made the Russia report.

Clapper and Brennan also misleadingly claimed that Justice Department special counsel John Durham, who was appointed during Trump's first term, found no evidence of an “Obama administration conspiracy against Mr. Trump.” Durham found significant wrongdoing at the start of the Russia investigation.

“Every serious review has substantiated the intelligence community's fundamental conclusion that the Russians conducted an influence campaign intended to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election,” they wrote.

Clapper and Brennan also sought to defend themselves on three issues: the discredited Steele dossier, whether their intelligence assessment on Russia made a judgment about Russian interference in the election, and alleged “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The Steele dossier is a series of memoranda written by a former British intelligence agent about the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia at the behest of Democrats and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's campaign. Clapper and Brennan opposed the idea that the Steele dossier played a significant role in the intelligence assessment, instead noting “the dossier was not used as a source or taken into account for any of its analysis or conclusions.” Documents declassified by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Gabbard show Brennan pushed aggressively for the Steele dossier to be presented with the intelligence community assessment about Russian meddling.

Clapper and Brennan said the dossier was only used as a “separate annex only to the most highly classified version of the document that contained the assessment,” with the annex explaining why the dossier was not used in the assessment. Documents revealed by the Trump administration suggest the dossier was, in fact, used as evidence to support the conclusion that Russia wanted to help Trump win.

The pair also said the intelligence assessment did not conclude anything about Russian cyberattacks affecting the outcome of the 2016 election. “Russian influence operations might have shaped the views of Americans before they entered the voting booth, but we found no evidence that the Russians changed any actual votes,” they wrote.

Lastly, the pair wrote that there was “no mention of ‘collusion'” in the intelligence assessment, “nor any reference to the publicly acknowledged contacts that had taken place.” The ICA did, however, conclude that Russia aspired to help Trump win, and Gabbard and Ratcliffe have declassified records that suggest  Brennan and Clapper did not have credible evidence to support that conclusion.

The two former intelligence officials said they “did everything we could” to prevent the report from being leaked and politicized. “We knew such reports would be political dynamite,” they wrote.

They argued that the Trump administration officials are the ones politicizing the reports to attempt a “calculated distortion of intelligence.” Clapper and Brennan called on the Trump administration to take bipartisan action in stifling Russia's efforts to interfere in U.S. elections.

“We find it deeply regrettable that the administration continues to perpetuate the fictitious narrative that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election. It should instead acknowledge that a foreign nation-state — a mortal enemy of the United States — routinely meddles in our national elections and will continue to do so unless we take appropriate bipartisan action to stop it,” they concluded.

Ratcliffe said earlier this week that Brennan and Clapper could face charges regarding the intelligence assessment. “We're gonna continue to share the intelligence that would support the ability of our Department of Justice to make fair and just, bring fair and justice claims against those who have perpetrated this hoax against the American people and this stain on our country,” he said.

GABBARD REFERS OBAMA FOR PROSECUTION BUT STOPS SHORT OF SUGGESTING ‘TREASON' CHARGES

Gabbard referred Obama and other senior DOJ aides for prosecution last week, but stopped short of slapping them with treason charges.

“There is irrefutable evidence that details how President Barack Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew that was false,” Gabbard claimed. “The evidence that we have found and that we have released directly point to President Obama leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment. There are multiple pieces of evidence and intelligence that confirm that fact.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Who's afraid of Sydney Sweeney‘s double-decker décolletage? Apparently, vast chunks of elite left-wing media, given its widespread apoplexy in response to the Emmy-nominated actress's new denim campaign for American Eagle.

MSNBC deemed Sweeney “disappointing” for starring in a “dangerous” American Eagle advertising campaign that embraces “an unbridled cultural shift towards whiteness.” The style correspondents of the Washington Post debated whether Sweeney's ad promoted “eugenics” or if it was just a part of a pattern of “thinness, whiteness and unapologetic wealth porn.” NPR equated the 27-year-old's commercial to the infamous Calvin Klein campaign starring a 14-year-old Brooke Shields, while USA Today said the very product itself was the problem.

“That the controversy stems from a denim ad, and one from a company with ‘American' in the name, further complicates the reception,” writes entertainment reporter Anna Kaufman. “Americana and denim go hand in hand, the stiff fabric harkening back to cowboy culture, workmen's uniforms and other mythologized aspects of the national identity.”

Perhaps the chattering class ought to keep their shirts on, as it is what is underneath them that the American Eagle ad is really about.

The ad in question features a fully clothed Sweeney buttoning her jeans as she suggestively intones for the camera.

“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color,” says Sweeney as the camera pans from her distinguished derriere to her indigo eyes. “My jeans are blue.”

Unlike the notoriously exploited Shields at the time of the Calvin Klein campaign, Sweeney is an almost-30-year-old woman who looks and acts like a fully grown woman. Unlike plenty of her Hollywood peers who have surgically distorted their visages into the frighteningly homogenous “Instagram face,” Sweeney's face is more or less au naturel, as is her blonde hair. But literally the whole point of the ad — the good “genes” to which she's referring — is her famously authentic figure.

The rest of the ads in the series play on the obvious fact that Sweeney is as famous for her acting prowess (which is genuinely impressive across a diverse range of genres) as her bodacious bosom. One ad zooms in on her chest as she mockingly chastises the cameraman to bring his “eyes up here.” Sure, her “genes” in the form of her eyes may be blue, and the “jeans” she's modeling are blue, but all advertisements aim to do, the “genes” in question are aspirational for the audience: buy these American Eagle jeans and tops, and you too will gain Sweeney's conspicuous curves.

Or at least, I should say, until the last five to 10 years, commercializing aspirational attributes is what advertisements used to do. In the past decade, Victoria's Secret dumped its statuesque Angels and flattering lingerie for Megan Rapinoe in a sports bra. The high-contrast and intentionally posed pictorial styles of American Apparel and Abercrombie and Fitch have died alongside artistry as an advertising virtue. Even the hyper-chiseled gay men famous for frequenting Tom Ford campaigns have been replaced by his polar opposite: the straight but utterly emasculated youth.

MARRIAGE MEANS BETTER SEX AND MORE OF IT

The irony of the outrage over Sweeney is that, other than her pose and playful embrace of her own sex appeal, the American Eagle ad otherwise embraces the contemporary aesthetics of soft lighting, natural makeup, and a comfortable, fully clothed model, rather than the edgy and aggressive mood of prior generations of jeans ads.

The problem, for the anti-aspirational Left, is that a naturally blonde-haired, blue-eyed bombshell cannot be allowed to luxuriate in her own looks. It's identity politics brewed with a bevy of resentment and more than a dash of the Left's increasing vilification of normal and libidinous heterosexuality. The most subversive model in today's fashion industry is not the obese one, the transgender one, the blue-haired one, or the hijab one, but the natural beauty with good jeans and an even better bust.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Scientists have found that, millions of years ago, spuds evolved from tomatoes.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The annals of evolutionary history are full of ill-fated unions. Many plants and animals can and do sometimes reproduce outside of their own species, but their offspring—if they come to be at all—may incur serious costs. Mules and hinnies, for instance, are almost always sterile; so, too, are crosses between the two main subspecies of cultivated rice. When lions and tigers mate in zoos, their liger cubs have suffered heart failure and other health problems (and the males seem uniformly infertile).

For decades, evolutionary biologists pointed to such examples to cast hybridization as hapless—“rare, very unsuccessful, and not an important evolutionary force,” Sandra Knapp, a plant taxonomist at the Natural History Museum in London, told me. But recently, researchers have begun to revise that dour view. With the right blend of genetic material, hybrids can sometimes be fertile and spawn species of their own; they can acquire new abilities that help them succeed in ways their parents never could. Which, as Knapp and her colleagues have found in a new study, appears to be the case for the world's third-most important staple crop: The 8-to-9-million-year-old lineage that begat the modern potato may have arisen from a chance encounter between a flowering plant from a group called Etuberosum and … an ancient tomato.

Tomatoes, in other words, can now justifiably be described as the mother of potatoes. The plant experts I interviewed about the finding almost uniformly described it as remarkable, and not only because dipping fries into ketchup just got a little more mind-bending. Potatoes represent more than the product of an improbable union; they mark a radical feat of evolution. Neither of the first potato's parents could form the underground nutrient-storage organs we call tubers and eat in the form of sweet potatoes, yams, and potatoes. And yet, the potato predecessor that they produced could. Tubers allowed the proto-potato plant to flourish in environments where tomatoes and Etuberosum could not, and to branch out into more than 100 species that are still around today, including the cultivated potato. It's as if a liger weren't just fertile but also grew a brand-new organ that enabled it to thrive on a vegan diet.

Scientists have spent decades puzzling over potatoes' origin story, in large part because the plants' genetics are a bit of a mess, Ek Han Tan, a plant geneticist at the University of Maine who wasn't involved in the study, told me. Researchers have struggled to piece together the relationships among the 100-plus potato species found in the wild; they cannot even agree on exactly how many exist. And when they have tried to orient the potato in its larger family, the nightshades—which includes tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, and Etuberosum—they have found mixed clues. Some evidence has seemed to point to the potato being a tomato derivative: Large stretches of their genomes resemble each other, and the two crops are similar enough that they can be grafted together into a plant that produces both foods. But other patches of the potato genome look more similar to that of Etuberosum, which bears flowers and underground stems that are far more potato-esque than anything that the tomato sports. “We couldn't resolve the contradiction for a long time,” Zhiyang Zhang, a biologist at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and one of the paper's lead authors, told me.

Read: Tomato + potato = TomTato

To settle the potato paradox, Zhang and his colleagues amassed more than 120 genomes from dozens of species spanning the potato, tomato, and Etuberosum groups and tried to piece together a narrative. One explanation for all of the shared genes, for instance, might have been that the potato lineage originally split off from the tomato one, then crossbred with Etuberosum later on. If that were the case, the genomes of more ancient potato species would be expected to look more tomato-like, and more modern ones should carry more of Etuberosum's genetic baggage. Instead, the researchers found that all of the potato genomes they sequenced had about the same tomato-Etuberosum split. That points to a possibility that potato researchers hadn't really considered before, Helen Tai, a plant geneticist with the Canadian government's agricultural department, told me. The entire potato lineage must have sprung from the same ancient source: a fusion between tomato and Etuberosum that persists, in a multitude of forms, into the modern day.

The key to that success seems to have been the hybrid's newfound ability to tuberize, a feat that neither of its parents managed, because each lacked the necessary genetic accoutrement. Only the proto-potato had the proper combination: underground stems from Etuberosum that provided a structural scaffold for the tubers, and a genomic switch from the tomato that told the tubers to grow there. Many hybrids struggle to sexually reproduce, but the proto-potato one didn't have to: The plant's underground storage organs (that is, the potatoes) allowed it to propagate asexually. (Potatoes can still be cloned today—just bury bits of one in the ground—but sometime in the past 8 to 9 million years, the plants gained the ability to reproduce sexually, too, a shift that scientists are still puzzling through.) Ancient tomatoes and Etuberosum were native to different stretches of the western coast of South America. But the proto-potato was able to colonize colder, higher, drier environments, allowing it to spread as far north as Arizona and west, out to the coasts of Argentina, Uruguay, and parts of Brazil. “That's what a tuber does for you—it allows you to survive better in stressful conditions,” C. Robin Buell, a plant-genomics expert at the University of Georgia who wasn't involved in the study, told me.

Hybridization in nature still, more often than not, ends in tragedy—“offspring that are sterile, inviable, maladapted, or mixed up in some negative way,” Robin Hopkins, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard who wasn't involved in the research, told me. But through the sheer power of mixing genes into new combinations, the risky gamble of interspecies pairings has also sometimes majorly paid off. Hybridization among East African cichlids seems to have triggered an explosion in the diversity of certain genes important for eyesight, helping the animals navigate waters of varying murkiness and depth. Certain frogs have been documented soliciting mates outside of their own species to up the chances that their offspring will survive periods of drought. Our own ancestors mingled with Denisovans and Neanderthals, equipping modern humans with traits that may have helped us adapt to new environments. Today, farmers frequently breed different species of crops together to boost yield or hardiness against extreme weather and disease. The potato's innovations, though, are still exceptional. Rather than just collapsing its parents' various traits together, this ancient hybrid struck out on its own evolutionary path.

Although that proto-potato is long gone, understanding its origins could still keep fries and hashbrowns on modern tables. Cultivated potatoes are prone to disease, and—thanks to their four-copy genomes—a pain to breed and genetically manipulate. Some scientists are trying to address those issues by developing a two-copy-genome potato. But the past could offer another avenue toward sustainable spuds, Yiyuan Ding, a biologist at Huazhong Agricultural University and one of the paper's lead authors, told me. Perhaps, with some genetic help from Etuberosum, scientists might someday coax tomato plants into producing edible underground tubers of their own.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The eerie, baby-eyed figurines are divisive on purpose.

Some creatures only come out at night: vampires, werewolves, and now the latest member of the after-hours club: hopeful Labubu collectors.

If you're not already in the know, that last group might feel as mysterious as mythical creatures. It only adds to the toys' mystique that the window when you can officially purchase the mega-popular trinkets — sold in limited drops, like fashion collabs and sneakers — only opens for a brief time on seemingly random nights (usually at 10 pm Eastern). Enthusiasts say that successfully getting your hands on one of the approximately half-foot tall plastic-and-vinyl bunny-eared ghouls with a rictus grin feels like doing the impossible, or at least something more impossible than spending $27.99.

With their faces illuminated by the glow of their smartphones, credit card numbers locked in, fingers at the ready to click and add to cart, for Labubu hunters, there is no duty, no bedtime, sometimes no supper — only Labubu.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

According to lore, Labubus are a tribe of mythical female elves called The Monsters that live in Nordic forests. According to Pop Mart, the toy and design company that produces the dolls, Labubus are a character-driven franchise, largely consisting of plushies, figurines, and accessories, that brings in over $400 million in revenue. And according to their most fervent fans — the people who have made Labubu a success in the hundreds of millions of dollars — Labubus are pure joy…if you somehow manage to get your hands on one.

If only the other things we spend roughly $30 on could bring us such glee.

Yet, many others do not find any delight in that idea. Some assert that the Labubus craze represents capitalism in its latest stage, thanks to a perfect storm of technical uselessness, jacked-up reseller prices, celebrity endorsement, and forced scarcity. Others think the little goblins are aesthetically ominous, even ugly.

But that division — and the strong feelings on both sides — might just be exactly how Labubus became such big business. Understanding why some people can't get enough of the toys (and the chase), gives us a window into bigger questions about what makes us happy, what makes us feel in-the-know, and what someone's really buying when they purchase a monster of their own.

When people talk about Labubus, they're likely referring to the mega-popular “pendant” versions that come with a sewn-on ring that's designed to clip onto bags and belt loops. These sell out in minutes. But if you do get your hands on a Labubu — from one of Pop Mart's limited drops or on the secondhand market at a serious markup — you'll find their bodies are soft, and small enough to fit in a fist. They come in a variety of colors, and often sell as sets.

Other pieces in the Labubu line include bigger dolls (retailing for $299), accessories like phone charms, and all types of figurines and plushes. No matter the size or brand collaboration, all Labubu products have one thing in common: They exist to be seen and displayed. Labubus don't actually do anything, which may add to some of the general perplexity surrounding them.

“I've always been drawn to creatures that live in the space between fantasy and reality — characters that feel both familiar and mysterious,” Kasing Lung, the original artist who created Labubu, tells Vox. Growing up in the Netherlands and around Nordic and European folklore, Lung wanted to reflect those inspirations — mischievous, endearing, strange — in Labubu.

“She's not overly detailed or complicated, she has a big smile, wide eyes, and a little bit of mischief in her expression,” Lungs says of his original design. “Labubu is playful but not perfect — she has sharp teeth, messy fur, and a bit of wild energy. She's cute but also a little weird, a little unpredictable.”

The duality of Labubu has turned the playful imp into a bit of a Rorschach test; humans are wired to have a strong reaction when they see a Labubu.

Some people feel intense love. Its big eyes and big head are reminiscent of what researchers call “baby schema,” traits that appear in infants and toddlers that trigger parental synapses, and euphoria in our brains.

But no matter how much baby schema Labubu employs and whatever brain receptors they set off, some may still find Labubu unappealing. They have mouths that almost stretch from one end of their faces to the other, which give the toys a sinister edge. They have prominent, protruding brow bones, tiny claws, and sometimes bare their jagged teeth. In combination, these slightly alarming characteristics may explain why some people find them to harbor dark energy.

“They're so cute-ugly,” says Tyler Renner, a man in possession of two Labubus, living in California. Renner, 34, was initially drawn to Labubus, but for a while kept his desire for them a secret. They're divisive, he reasoned. Not everyone understands how something so menacing could come back around to being so adorable. But the more Renner posted his dolls, showing off their custom-made clothes and freaky little faces, the more support he got. He received secretive DMs from closet Labubu-lovers, wanting to know how they could procure their own.

Elizabeth Mitchell, a mom from the Washington, DC, area, echoes Renner's so-ugly-it's-cute horseshoe theory and clandestine love affair. “It's goth meets Hello Kitty,” says Mitchell, who sees her devotion in terms both anthropological and biochemical. “Either you have the ‘Tribe Labubu' brain parasite or you don't.”

According to a Pop Mart spokesperson, Labubu tends to be most popular with women between the ages of 18–30. During the current popularity boom, though, Labubu's fan demographic has aged up and its gender appeal has broadened. While children certainly enjoy Labubu and want them, they are probably not the ones logged into Pop Mart's app with credit card security codes at the ready. And because one doesn't really “play” with Labubus aside from displaying them, possibly in festive outfits, toy designers consider Labubus as much an object of design than a traditional kids' toy.

Still though, there are people who might be able to better resist baby schema, who don't succumb to brain parasites, who find them not “cute-ugly,” but just plain ugly. On TikTok, a corner of the internet brimming with Labubus, Labubu lovers, and Labubu haters, their creepiness is often a popular subject (a sore one for fans).

Being so intensely polarizing is what makes Labubus so successful, says Vincent Scala, a toy designer and illustration professor at the School of Visual Arts. If Labubus themselves were ignorable, if the reactions they elicited were simply lukewarm, they wouldn't command such a deep yearning.

Some may not care one way or another about the way the dolls look, but simply hate the idea of an unavoidable mania brought on by cute junk. Scala and other experts I spoke with pointed out that Labubus may remind a lot of people (especially millennials and Gen Xers of a certain age) of Tickle Me Elmos, Furbys, and Beanie Babies; toy fads that burned hot and bright and died out just as fast because people got bored with them. These core viral toy memories — coupled with millennials historically preferring experiences over material objects — might elicit an ennui or confusion about the Labubu obsession, if not an outright hostility.

“Furby, I think, is probably the closest — as so many people loved it, just as many people hated it,” Scala says, noting that “the amount of hatred just sort of feeds into the craze” and that all the attention “makes people want it more.”

One would think that producing something everyone generally wants would be better for business than creating something only some people want. But that misses something important about human desire.

Jared Watson, a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business who studies the extensive subject of consumer behavior, attributes part of Labubu's success and its virality to its volatility.

If everyone wanted and had a Labubu, the average person would have some kind of idea of its value. But fans and experts say that when buyers push past uncertainties about worth or childishness, they are rewarded with social status, or at least belonging. When complete strangers compliment the Labubu on the street, owners experience a unique kind of joy.

“You don't get the same sort of rush when everyone is in on the secret,” Watson says, comparing it to the euphoria of sharing a love for a new movie, an undersung TV series, or an emerging musician that the general public hasn't hopped on yet. “But once everybody's there, it's not as exciting anymore.”

That mass adoption isn't a problem for Labubus though: Pop Mart has set up the market so they're not so easy to get your hands on.

Buying a Labubu requires either a lot of time or a bunch of money. If you're willing to pay more than its retail asking price, you can find $27.99 Pop Mart Labubus on resale sites like Stock X or eBay going for $60, $120, even $280. If you want to purchase them from the parent company, it requires strategy and luck.

Pop Mart's checkout process is something of an obstacle course. Go too slow and faster clickers will gobble up the stock. Go too fast and Pop Mart's system might flag you as a reseller bot, like the kind that scoop up all the best concert seats on Ticketmaster.

If you make it through the digital gauntlet, you obtain what's known as a blind box — there's a Labubu inside, but you don't know which one is yours until you open it. Those individual blind boxes usually belong to Pop Mart's three main Labubu pendant collections — Sweet Macaron (Labubus are named after desserts and drinks), Have a Seat (Labubus are all in sitting poses), and Big Into Energy (Labubus are named after emotions) — each collection has six different Labubus, and each one has a rare, secret Labubu that appears in 1/72 boxes. That makes for 21 regular attachable Labubu characters in circulation, not counting special series and collaborations (Pop Mart's entire Labubu line is expansive, if not overwhelming).

For first-time buyers, this means any box will contain a fun, random surprise, but for collectors, the more Labubus you buy, the more likely you are to end up with duplicates. If you're lucky, though, there's a small chance of scoring the special “secret,” the plush equivalent of Willy Wonka's golden ticket without any chance of dying at the hands of a maniacal candy tycoon. Some fans will purchase box after box chasing the secret.

Carmin Newman believed herself to be one of these lucky people; and indeed she has procured over 30 Labubus since committing herself to the cause.

To get the first of her Labubus, Newman researched when new stock would drop. She recruited “a little team” to converge on the app. Her squad had their clicking fingers ready in the seconds right before Pop Mart's replenishment, and scored a complete set of six, then another, then one more.

Yet Newman says she doesn't like any of the Labubus she's obtained.

Labubus are a hit with kids in Newman's neighborhood, and those kids' parents were ready to pay resellers double or more for the little ghouls. That waste activated her. No one was going to spend more than $30 for a Labubu on Newman's watch.

“It's totally a game now,” Newmans tells me, explaining that scoring Labubus feels like winning. The rush of getting one retail and not paying a reseller is, in her eyes, better than actually owning one. She swears her goal is one more set, from one more drop. “Then I'll be done,” Newman promises, before admitting with a laugh that she might need “Labubus Anonymous.”

Ginger Pennington, a professor at Northwestern University who studies consumer psychology and human motivation, points out that Labubus tap into many of the same psychological and emotional mechanisms that gambling does, from the company-induced scarcity, to the randomness of the blind box, to the instant gratification or disappointment of acquisition.

She explains that the drop process and blind boxes actually take advantage of the dopamine hit with a negative outcome.

“Even though it's super, super disappointing,” to not get a Labubu, or to get one you already have, “it actually doesn't dampen your motivation,” Pennington says. “It just makes you want to go and try again.” Instead of dwelling on the disappointment — or giving up — collectors focus on the part that felt good.

For nearly a decade, we've heard about how millennials have driven an economy that values “experiences” over “stuff,” and that doesn't seem to be changing. Perhaps the fact that millennials (and Zoomers) are loving Labubus isn't a contradiction; maybe it's the high of the chase that makes these dolls so desirable.

Or maybe it's all about those big baby eyes, the unnerving smile underneath them, and the satisfaction in knowing some people just don't get it.

One thing is for sure, Labubus are not for everyone. Pop Mart, to massive profit, is making sure it stays that way.

In this article

Roblox stock soared 16% on Thursday after the company reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations amid strong user growth.

The gaming platform saw $1.44 billion in net bookings, up 51% over the year prior. Analysts polled by LSEG expected $1.24 billion in net bookings for the quarter.

User and engagement numbers were also strong for the company, with daily active users at 111.8 million, up 41% year over year, and hours engaged at 27.4 billion, up 58%.

StreetAccount expected 106 million DAUs.

""Our year on year growth this quarter is a reflection of our strategic investments in infrastructure and performance, discovery, and the virtual economy, which continue to create fertile conditions for creators to thrive as part of a healthy, interconnected ecosystem,"" said CEO David Baszucki in a release.

Baszucki added that the company is looking to grab 10% of the global gaming content market.

Roblox raised its booking guidance for the third quarter and now expects between $1.59 billion and $1.64 billion. FactSet expected $1.42 billion in third-quarter bookings.

The gaming platform did report a net loss of $279.38 million, or 41 cents per share. Roblox had a net loss of $205.88 million, or 32 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

The platform rolled out new age verification tools two weeks ago, as the broader gaming industry and app stores have faced regulatory pressure to improve safety for young users and limit access to certain types of content.

Roblox Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman said the age estimation tools will help keep younger users from accessing ""something that should be limited to an older audience — 13 and over.""

Kaufman said having more mature content opportunities will help teens and adults stay on Roblox instead of moving to other platforms.

In a post shared on TradingView, crypto analyst Xanrox argues that the current bullish cycle is nearly over, pointing to a potential downtrend that would see the Bitcoin price crash to $60,000. This analysis comes as Bitcoin is trading within a very quiet phase, prompting many crypto traders and crypto analysts to start reassessing its next direction.

Xanrox Predicts Bitcoin Top At $122,000 And Crash To $60,000

The world's largest cryptocurrency has been hovering just above the $118,000 price level for several days now, struggling to break decisively above this zone but also showing no major signs of a breakdown. Despite this consolidation, market sentiment remains upbeat. 

The crypto fear and greed index continues to flash “greed,” and most analysts still argue that Bitcoin is setting up for another leg upward. However, an interesting technical outlook challenges this bullish consensus and issues a crash warning.

Notably, crypto analyst Xanrox identified a sell signal on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart after Bitcoin reached the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and touched the long-term 2017–2021–2025 trendline, with the latest touch of the trendline aligning to Bitcoin's recent all-time high at $122,800. 

According to him, the most recent touch of this trendline might be the top of the current cycle. Furthermore, he noted that the Elliott Wave structure has now completed Wave 5 of a rising wedge and a larger Wave 5 impulse move. As such, a corrective phase is about to start.

What's Next For Bitcoin?

As shown in the chart below, the next major move could be at least a 50% decline, with Bitcoin dropping to around $60,000 by 2026. This projection is based on previous price action, where Bitcoin embarked on 84% and 77% price crashes after touching the trendline in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

The technical setup also aligns with statistical data that shows August and September historically bring increased selling pressure. Xanrox noted that while traders can wait for further confirmation, such as a break below the 50-week moving average, he personally believes the top is already in. Large institutions and professional investors pay close attention to the 20, 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages.

Xanrox's outlook is a sharp contrast to the prevailing sentiment among crypto investors. Bitcoin's current structure is still showing strength on higher timeframes, and several other analysts see the recent consolidation between $117,000 and $119,000 as a base for continuation toward $130,000 and beyond. 

The lack of major sell-side volume, the firm hold above the $118,000 price level and the 50-week moving average, and bullish indicators across altcoins like Ethereum are on-chain signals that the Bitcoin price still has more room to run before it reaches a peak price this cycle.

He added that his bank “will have” a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar.  “There are things that stablecoins maybe can do that your traditional cash can't,” Dimon said, adding later: “It's what the customer wants. It's not what JPMorgan personally wants.”





Dimon has long drawn a distinction between the technology of blockchain, or decentralized ledgers, and Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency. His Wednesday comments with CNBC are in line with his prior thinking, but his disavowal of Bitcoin was softer than his previous takedowns.





In 2017, he said that he would fire JPMorgan Chase employees who were trading Bitcoin because it was evidence that they were “stupid.” In 2023, he said Bitcoin was “hyped-up fraud,” compared the token to a “pet rock,” and said that cryptocurrencies are a “waste of time.” Still, he conceded that blockchains were useful.





“Blockchain is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We've used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo, we've used it to move money, right? So that's a technology ledger that we think will be deployable,” he said.




Dimon heads the largest bank in the U.S and his comments on stablecoins add further legitimacy to the fast-growing crypto industry, especially after the landmark passage of GENIUS Act in Congress, a bill that regulates stablecoins.





JPMorgan Chase has long had its own blockchain division. The team, originally called Onyx, has rebranded to Kinexys and has started to expand beyond the bank's “walled garden,” an industry term for blockchains that are private.





In May, the bank settled its first transaction on a public blockchain. And, in June, Kinexys announced that it was piloting what it called JPMD, a stablecoin-like asset known as a tokenized deposit. The token will represent a dollar of deposits into JPMorgan Chase.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Blockstream debuts Simplicity as Bitcoin's answer to Ethereum's Solidity","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:4a018da50094b:0-blockstream-debuts-simplicity-as-bitcoin-s-answer-to-ethereum-s-solidity/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Blockstream, the developer of Bitcoin's layer-2 protocol Liquid and led by Bitcoin cypherpunk Adam Back, has launched Simplicity, a new smart contract language designed for Bitcoin.

According to a Thursday announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Simplicity smart contracts will be integrated into Liquid. The company said the move marks a step forward in transforming Bitcoin (BTC) from a secure store of value into a programmable foundation for decentralized finance.

The company also introduced SimplicityHL, a higher-level implementation of the language that facilitates easier development with increased abstraction.

A Blockstream representative told Cointelegraph that this version of the language “is here and usable today,” with a web-based integrated development environment also available.

A different approach for a different architecture

Simplicity differs from Ethereum's Solidity language, largely due to the different underlying architectures of the two blockchains. 

This stems from different approaches and different architectures of the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, with Solidity developed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. State is the network's agreed-upon snapshot of all account balances and stored data at a given block.

Bitcoin utilizes the unspent transaction output (UTXO) architecture, whereas the Ethereum network employs a network-wide state. This difference manifests itself in how Simplicity smart contracts work, with a Blockstream representative saying that “not relying on the global state is a big shift.” “Every bit of state your contract needs has to travel with the transaction.”

Blockstream's researchers said Solidity developers will need to break their habit of reading from globally accessible variables and instead provide all necessary information at every step. In such a system, two smart contracts cannot share state or reference the same variables; everything must be explicitly passed within transactions. Still, the firm's representatives explained that this approach also has a positive impact:

Developers also won't be able to use recursion or unbounded loops, which Blockstream claims aren't necessary for onchain logic.

The rise of domain-specific smart contract programming languages

Simplicity joins a growing list of domain-specific smart contract programming languages.

Noir, a programming language released in 2022 for writing and verifying zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), was adopted in 2023 by the developers of the upcoming privacy-first Ethereum layer-2 Aztec.

Noir has become a smart contract programming language specifically built for privacy-preserving applications that integrate ZK-proofs deeply into their architecture. 

Another example is Leo, a smart contract programming language that also creates ZK-proof systems with closely related syntax and privacy in mind. 

Ethereum's Vyper is an EVM-compatible language designed to reduce the attack surface, which is now used by some leading Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP tumble on shocking inflation report originally appeared on TheStreet.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.6% on a year-to-year (YoY) basis in June.

Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, in June was up 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.8% on an annual basis.

The crypto market immediately dipped in reaction to the news.

Bitcoin fell 0.11% in an hour to $118,327.92, Ethereum fell 0.75% to $3,815.08, and XRP fell 0.81% to $3.11.

BNB fell 0.56% to $795.14 and SOL also fell 1.25% to $177.94.

Join the discussion with CryptosRUs on Roundtable here.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis defines the PCE price index as a key inflation indicator that measures the prices that people living in the U.S., or those buying on their behalf, pay for goods and services. The index is known for capturing inflation across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflecting changes in consumer behavior.

The Federal Reserve decided to keep the interest rates unchanged at 5.25%-5.5% at its July 30 meeting, and Chair Powell didn't indicate any potential cut in interest rates in September, saying the central bank will factor in more data and information until it makes the rate decision in the next Sep. 16-17 meeting.

Since PCE is one of the most closely watched inflation indicators by the Fed, the June hike seems to have dented any hope for a potential cut in interest rates in September.

The total crypto market cap stood at $3.88 trillion at the time of writing.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

A U.S. federal appeals court has overturned the conviction of Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at OpenSea, who was found guilty in a 2023 trial for wire fraud and money laundering related to NFT trading using nonpublic information [1]. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the jury was improperly instructed, potentially leading to a conviction based on unethical behavior rather than a clear violation of property rights under federal fraud law [3]. Chastain's defense argued that the information he used—related to which NFT collections would be featured on OpenSea's homepage—did not constitute “property” under the law [4]. The court agreed, stating that the district court's instructions lacked sufficient legal grounding [6].  

Chastain was originally charged in 2022 for allegedly exploiting insider knowledge to buy NFTs before they were highlighted on the platform and then selling them at a profit. He was sentenced to three months in prison and a $50,000 fine [5]. However, the appeals court's 2–1 decision highlighted the legal ambiguity around the classification of NFTs as property and the difficulty in applying traditional fraud laws to digital assets [7]. The case was the first of its kind to attempt to apply securities fraud principles to NFT trading and had drawn significant attention from regulators and legal experts [5].  

At the time of the trial, OpenSea was one of the largest NFT marketplaces, with monthly trading volumes reaching nearly $5 billion. Although activity has since declined, the platform has still generated over $1 billion in cumulative revenue [9]. The overturned conviction raises broader questions about the enforceability of insider trading laws in the context of NFTs, which remain a relatively new and rapidly evolving asset class [8].  

The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet announced whether it will pursue a retrial. In its appeal, the government argued that Chastain's actions should be treated under the same legal framework as traditional stock market insider trading, a stance the court found lacking in legal support [10]. The ruling underscores the challenges regulators face in adapting existing financial laws to digital assets, which often function outside conventional market structures [11].  

Separately, Binance recently suspended a member of its wallet division following allegations of insider trading tied to a token launch [1]. The unnamed employee was accused of using confidential information from a previous role at BNB Chain to front-run trades in a token before its public announcement. The individual reportedly used multiple linked wallets to purchase large amounts of the token and then sold part of the holdings immediately after the launch to secure profits [3].  

The incident has drawn speculation about the identity of the employee, with online accounts linking the trades to Freddie Ng, a former operations manager at BNB Chain who recently joined Binance Wallet. The trades allegedly netted over $82,000 in profit [4]. Binance confirmed the suspension and stated the employee could face further disciplinary action, though no specific jurisdiction or legal process has been disclosed [5].  

The cases involving both Chastain and the Binance employee highlight the growing scrutiny of insider trading practices in the digital asset space. As the sector matures, courts and regulators continue to navigate how to apply traditional financial regulations to emerging technologies and decentralized markets [7].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","New guidance on disclosing documents to the public","https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/07/new-guidance-on-disclosing-documents-to-the-public/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 09:02:16 GMT","

We have today published new guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely.  

From public authorities handling Freedom of Information requests to organisations responding to Subject Access Requests, many need to regularly disclose documents containing large amounts of information to the public.  

Personal information can be hidden or not immediately visible in documents. If they are not checked properly, it may be disclosed by accident – sometimes with serious consequences.  

Our guidance includes practical steps and how-to videos to help organisations understand how to check documents, including spreadsheets, for hidden personal information and reduce the risk of a data breach.  

Emily Keaney, Deputy Commissioner at the ICO, said:

“We have seen a number of serious data breaches, including at the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Defence, which have involved documents being disclosed without proper checks for hidden personal information – this crucial step cannot be missed.  

“All organisations must have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. We are committed to providing clear guidance to help organisations get this right, reducing the margin for mistakes and making it second nature to check documents for hidden personal information.”  

The new guidance is the regulator's most current and comprehensive resource on avoiding accidental data breaches when disclosing documents to the public, replacing an advisory note issued in the immediate aftermath of high-profile data breaches in 2023.  

It includes simple checklists and how-to videos, covering topics such as:  

We are engaging directly with key stakeholders, including Government, to increase visibility of the guidance amongst those who need it.  

While the guidance is designed to support organisations with disclosing documents to the public, the practical advice will also help all organisations avoid accidental data breaches in any situation where they are disclosing or sharing documents.  

The regulator also has a wealth of guidance on data sharing, including a Code of Practice, to help organisations sharing personal information.

Key Points

The third time may not be the charm for those invested in XRP.

Though artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest trend on Wall Street for the better part of the last three years, it's not the only trend that's turning heads and raising eyebrows. The emergence of cryptocurrency treasury strategies has put some serious pep in the steps of the world's leading digital assets.

Over the trailing-three-year period, as of this writing in the early evening on July 28, XRP (XRP -0.43%), the third-largest digital currency by market value, had risen just shy of 800%. Meanwhile, respective No.'s 1 and 2 in market value, Bitcoin (BTC 0.15%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.57%), have galloped higher by 421% and 136%.

Numerous factors have played a role in the outperformance of this crypto trio, including the election of Donald Trump, whose administration has taken a favorable view of the digital asset landscape, as well as positive sentiment in the investment arena. With two of Wall Street's three major stock indexes blasting to new highs, investor confidence is soaring in the emotion-driven digital currency space.

But there's no mistaking the demand-side boost Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed from the adoption of corporate treasury strategies involving these tokens. The question is: Will Ripple's XRP be the next target for corporate America?

Instead of carrying cash or other marketable securities on their balance sheets, some businesses are choosing to use their cash, or issuing stock and/or some form of debt, to purchase digital assets.

The concept of the Bitcoin treasury strategy kicked off with Strategy (MSTR 1.88%)(formerly known as MicroStrategy), which began purchasing Bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet in August 2020. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor has been adamant for years that Bitcoin is a superior form of money, especially when compared to the U.S. dollar, which devalues over time as the U.S. money supply increases.

Strategy, which anointed itself the first ""Bitcoin Treasury Company,"" has spent about $43.6 billion to acquire 607,770 Bitcoin. Since only 21 million Bitcoin are set to be mined, Strategy owns close to 2.9% of the lifetime supply. The perception of a fixed peak circulating supply is why Bitcoin is typically viewed as a phenomenal inflationary hedge.

A number of companies have followed in Strategy's footsteps by adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, many of which are micro- and small-cap businesses that are attempting to drum up hype for their respective companies.

Recently, a handful of public companies began shifting their attention to Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin's top-selling point is its perceived scarcity, Ethereum's is its functionality. Ethereum's blockchain is the backbone for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and decentralized finance that removes the middleman from the equation.

Two notable public companies have dived head-first into the Ethereum treasury strategy: Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR -1.25%) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET -3.17%). Bitmine, whose board is chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, holds 566,776 Ether (ETH), with a goal of gobbling up 5% of the circulating supply. Meanwhile, SharpLink holds 360,807 ETH, worth about $1.36 billion at the time of this writing.

Considering XRP's ninefold ascent over the last three years, as well as its numerous near-term catalysts, it would appear there's certainly momentum, on paper, for public companies to add XRP tokens to their balance sheet. But if investors dig below the surface-scratching headlines, they'll discover it's unlikely that XRP will be a sought-after digital asset for corporate America.

There's no question that XRP has enjoyed a stellar run-up. President Trump's November victory cleared the way for the eventual resignation of now-former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, who was a constant thorn in the side of digital currencies. Gensler's exit led to the resolution of litigation clouds that had hung over Ripple, whose payment network leans on XRP as its bridge currency for cross-border transactions.

Additionally, there's plenty of excitement surrounding the possibility of the SEC approving a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). A spot XRP ETF would likely follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum and see sizable cash inflows in the weeks and months following approval.

XRP investors also remain optimistic about the ongoing adoption of XRP as a cross-border payment intermediary. North of 300 financial institutions are utilizing RippleNet to facilitate transactions that can validate and settle in three to five seconds. If adoption continues, Ripple's payment network could lead to a demand surge in XRP tokens.

But herein lies the rub.

While XRP has been firing on all cylinders in recent months due to a confluence of positive factors, it lacks the perceived stand-alone value brough to the table by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin has its limited supply as a catalyst, and Ethereum stands tall as the premier smart contracts blockchain, XRP is simply a bridge currency for Ripple's payment network.

What's more, XRP isn't the only bridge available to financial institutions using Ripple's cross-border payment solutions. In select overseas markets, financial institutions aren't using XRP at all to complete transactions.

Furthermore, the adoption rate for Ripple's payment platform and XRP remains relatively tame. Though having more than 300 financial institutions using RippleNet globally sounds great on paper, it's a far cry from the 11,000-plus financial institutions relying on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which has been the standard for cross-border payments spanning decades.

Although one publicly traded micro-cap company with a market cap of less than $2 million recently unveiled an up-to-$20 million XRP treasury reserve strategy, investors shouldn't expect XRP to be actively held for any sustained period by nonfinancial (or financial-based) public companies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Jamie Dimon just gave a thumbs up to stablecoins—but still won't say anything nice about Bitcoin","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/31/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-bitcoin-stablecoins-blockchain/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:21:00 GMT","

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The CEO of JPMorgan Chase gave a shout out on Wednesday to stablecoins, one of the buzziest sectors in the crypto. “I'm a believer in stablecoins, believer in blockchain, not personally, a believer in Bitcoin itself,” Jamie Dimon said in an interview with CNBC.

He added that his bank “will have” a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar.  “There are things that stablecoins maybe can do that your traditional cash can't,” Dimon said, adding later: “It's what the customer wants. It's not what JPMorgan personally wants.”





Dimon has long drawn a distinction between the technology of blockchain, or decentralized ledgers, and Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency. His Wednesday comments with CNBC are in line with his prior thinking, but his disavowal of Bitcoin was softer than his previous takedowns.





In 2017, he said that he would fire JPMorgan Chase employees who were trading Bitcoin because it was evidence that they were “stupid.” In 2023, he said Bitcoin was “hyped-up fraud,” compared the token to a “pet rock,” and said that cryptocurrencies are a “waste of time.” Still, he conceded that blockchains were useful.





“Blockchain is a technology ledger system that we use to move information. We've used it to do overnight repo, intraday repo, we've used it to move money, right? So that's a technology ledger that we think will be deployable,” he said.




Dimon heads the largest bank in the U.S and his comments on stablecoins add further legitimacy to the fast-growing crypto industry, especially after the landmark passage of GENIUS Act in Congress, a bill that regulates stablecoins.





JPMorgan Chase has long had its own blockchain division. The team, originally called Onyx, has rebranded to Kinexys and has started to expand beyond the bank's “walled garden,” an industry term for blockchains that are private.





In May, the bank settled its first transaction on a public blockchain. And, in June, Kinexys announced that it was piloting what it called JPMD, a stablecoin-like asset known as a tokenized deposit. The token will represent a dollar of deposits into JPMorgan Chase.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins said his agency is launching ""Project Crypto"" with an aim to make a quick start on the new crypto policies urged by President Donald Trump.

Atkins announced the new initiative in a Thursday speech at the America First Policy Institute, saying the effort will be rooted in the recommendations of the President's Working Group report issued Wednesday by the White House.

""While the commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America.""

Atkins offered a rhetorical reversal from the days when predecessor SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said the vast majority of cryptocurrencies were likely securities that needed to be overseen by the agency.

""Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities,"" Atkins said. ""But confusion over the application of the 'Howey test' has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such.""

Even as Congress continues to work on complex legislation that will define crypto securities under new law, Atkins suggested his agency will move to begin answering those questions now, working on ""clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract.""

Even when projects get a securities label, he argued that it should not be a ""scarlet letter.""

For crypto securities, he said he's ""asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called 'initial coin offerings,' 'airdrops' and network rewards.""

Atkins underlined Trump's goal to establish a ""golden age"" for digital assets in the U.S.

""We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration's regulation-by-enforcement crusade and 'Operation Chokepoint 2.0',"" he said.

The chairman, who began work this year after his appointment by President Trump, also argued in favor of people's self-custody of crypto assets.

""I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking,"" he said. ""However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so.""

He also seemed to push back on a routine criticism from Gensler that crypto firms offered too many often-conflicting services within a single business. Atkins said he means to ""allow market participants to innovate with 'super-apps'"" that offer a ""broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license.""

That would include allowing multiple types of assets to trade on a single platform, offering:

""A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses.""

While the SEC under Gensler and his predecessors seized ground as the most important regulator and enforcer in U.S. crypto trading in the past years, the future oversight structure contemplated by Congress would likely elevate the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to a prominent role. 

It's possible, then, that Atkins' Project Crypto will be of lesser urgency as the sister agency assumes some responsibilities.

Atkins added a defense of software developers — a point of particular interest in the week in which Tornado Cash's developer, Roman Storm, was defended in a criminal trial.

Atkins argued the importance of ""protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems.""

 The initiative aims to modernize the SEC for 21st-century finance and was formed in response to recent policy recommendations from the White House. 

US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins has announced “Project Crypto,” an initiative to modernize the agency for the digital finance age and establish clear regulations for digital assets in the United States.

Atkins said Project Crypto was in direct response to recommendations in a recent report by the President's Working Group on Digital Assets.

Atkins proposed easing licensing rules to allow for multiple asset classes or instruments to be offered by brokerages under a single license, while also creating a clear market structure separating commodities, which most cryptocurrencies fall under, from securities.

Regulatory exemptions or grace periods should be afforded to early-stage crypto projects, initial coin offerings, and decentralized software to allow these projects enough room to innovate, without crushing them under the weight of litigation or fear of reprisal by the SEC, Atkins said.

Additionally, the SEC chair said crypto business shouldn't be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to avoid regulation. He also said the right to self-custody must be protected by law. Atkins wrote:

Outfitting the SEC for internet capital markets and onchain finance has been a stated goal of the new SEC chair and a way to cement US leadership in crypto. 

Related: Trump's crypto working group pushes for clearer rules as adoption grows

Since Atkins became head of the SEC, the commission has shifted its posture toward the crypto industry by ending so-called regulation by enforcement, making pro-crypto regulations a priority and approving several crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications.

In May, the SEC released guidance clarifying that income earned from staking on proof-of-stake blockchains does not qualify as a securities transaction because the income is through providing validation services.  

The agency also approved in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs in July. This long-sought feature primarily affects how large institutions move assets in and out of the funds.

The recommendations outlined in the recent White House report, titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” included establishing a clear market structure, interdepartmental coordination between agencies, stablecoin policy, countering illicit finance, banking regulations and taxation.

Per the recommendations made in the report, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will share joint oversight of the crypto industry, with the CFTC having sole authority over spot crypto markets.

 Naoris has launched a $120,000 bounty incentivising researchers to break key cryptographic algorithms underpinning Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. 

Naoris, a cybersecurity firm focused on safeguarding digital assets from quantum computing threats, is offering bounties to anyone who can break the encryption algorithms that secure major blockchain networks.  

In an announcement shared with Cointelegraph on Thursday, Naoris said it has set a bounty of $120,000 — equivalent to approximately one Bitcoin (BTC) — for successfully compromising key cryptographic algorithms used in the crypto industry.

The largest bounty, $50,000, is for anyone who can break secp256k1, the cryptographic standard that underpins Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other protocols. A $30,000 reward is available for breaking Ed25519, which is used by Solana, as well as encrypted messaging services like Signal and WhatsApp.  

Naoris is also offering $20,000 for a successful attack on NIST P-256, the elliptic curve used in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which secures internet traffic. Another $10,000 is set aside for breaking other elliptic curves, including P-224, P-384 and P-521.

The bounties are set for breaking elliptic curve parameters, which are values or sets of values that define a specific elliptic curve used in cryptography, thereby determining the security and functionality of the cryptographic system. 

Related: Quantum computers could bring lost Bitcoin back to life: Here's how

The modern world heavily relies on cryptography, and the consequences of its being compromised would be dire and far-reaching.

If secp256k1 were compromised, Bitcoin and multiple other blockchains, the Lightning Network, many Ethereum layer-2 protocols and others would break. Current estimates suggest breaking this algorithm would require around 10 billion trillion years using today's GPU technology.

A successful attack on Ed25519 would compromise the OpenSSH protocol used for secure server access, disrupt Git version control systems and threaten portions of the DNS security layer.  

NIST P-224 is mostly used in legacy systems, such as old smartcards, and is set to be deprecated after 2030 by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is about 30,000 times easier to break than 256-bit curves such as secp256k1.

Related: Bitcoin's quantum countdown has already begun, Naoris CEO says

While quantum computers are unlikely to break modern cryptography anytime soon, many experts believe that it is a question of when rather than if. Consequently, despite quantum computers being estimated to need tens of millions of qubits to break those systems, the crypto community has started preparing.

Bitcoin, in particular, is taking its first steps. A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) introduced this month aims to tackle the threat posed by quantum computers by phasing out Bitcoin's legacy signature schemes.

“A successful quantum attack on Bitcoin would result in significant economic disruption and damage across the entire ecosystem,” the proposal reads. “Beyond its impact on price, the ability of miners to provide network security may be significantly impacted.”

During a mid-April interview with Cointelegraph, early cypherpunk Adam Back, cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, suggested that quantum computing pressure may reveal whether the blockchain's pseudonymous creator is alive. 

He explained that quantum computing could make the Bitcoin held by Satoshi Nakamoto vulnerable to being stolen, forcing him to move it to preserve it.

Researchers are also looking for more blockchain-agnostic solutions. Earlier this week, Sui Research introduced a cryptographic framework that could provide protection against quantum computing threats to multiple blockchains without requiring hard forks, address changes or key updates.

Still, while that particular solution boasts compatibility with all EdDSA-based blockchains, this requirement excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum. Compatible blockchains include Sui, Solana, Near and Cosmos.

 The White House's crypto report did not provide updates to the March 6 executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. 

The White House released its long-awaited report on crypto on Wednesday, detailing a number of policy recommendations that omitted a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. 

The 166-page document provides recommendations for multiple aspects of the crypto industry, including banking policy, stablecoins and countering illicit finance. The report does mention the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, insofar as it was established back in March, but makes no mention of further development.

Bitcoin maximalists have stated that the Bitcoin reserve order should allow the government to actively purchase the asset in a strategy more akin to El Salvador.

While the crypto industry has largely welcomed the report and its potential effect on blockchain policymaking, others believe the lack of action on a Bitcoin reserve is a missed opportunity. 

On Jan. 23, just three days after taking office, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. He set a 180-day deadline for policy recommendations. 

The US government has been in pro-crypto overdrive, leading many observers to expect significant updates to the so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Following news that the White House would include an update to the reserve, Bitcoin historian and advocate Pete Rizzo advised followers to “buckle up.”

The report contains dozens of references to Bitcoin and its status as the seminal cryptocurrency that sparked the entire crypto industry, but the strategic Bitcoin reserve is mentioned only once at the very end.

Even here, the “recommendation” presented by the White House is a simple restatement of the terms laid out in the March 6 executive order, which established the reserve and its concomitant digital asset stockpile. 

The Bitcoin community expressed its disappointment. CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer of Compass Mining — a US-based crypto mining hosting firm with operations in Ohio and Texas — told Cointelegraph, “The absence of any mention of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in today's White House report is a missed opportunity. Markets were watching for leadership and instead got ambiguity.”

Burnett said that the lack of progress on a Bitcoin reserve creates “unnecessary uncertainty” and risks putting the US behind other countries.

Related: Who's running in Trump's race to make US a ‘Bitcoin superpower?'

Bitcoin influencer George Bodine characterized the lack of action on a Bitcoin reserve as another betrayal of trust by the government. 

Others were more optimistic. Canadian blockchain and Web3 investor Calvin Ayre said that the mere mention of Bitcoin in the report was already progress: “While many are disappointed at the lack of ‘Bitcoin reserve' details in the White House report, give them credit for creating a document that at least attempts to explain in detail how all this stuff works.”

Bitcoin journalist Susie Violet Ward said the report “represents a clear policy shift. For the first time, Bitcoin is treated as something distinct, quoted, cited, and understood on its own terms.”

She said that, while there are scant details on the Bitcoin reserve, “the fact that Bitcoin is being considered a strategic asset, separate from other digital assets, indicates a clear shift in policy tone.”

Bitcoin reserves aside, the report presents detailed policy proposals for how crypto regulations should be updated. 

Bo Hines, executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said that the policy proposals laid out in the report are already being implemented in three phases. 

Demolition phase — where lawmakers get rid of rules implemented during the administration of former President Joe Biden. 

Construction phase — where lawmakers work with the industry to create laws that would help the industry thrive.

Implementation phase — passing the laws.

One of the primary goals of the report was to create a “taxonomy” for digital assets to determine which could be securities or commodities. In this regard, it also recommends that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission should share oversight over crypto, with the CFTC regulating spot crypto markets.

The report also suggested that banks be allowed to custody crypto and provide crypto-related services to clients. It also stated that the process of getting a banking charter should be easier, with more transparent requirements. 

Tax, which has long been a sore spot for crypto holders in the US — different agencies all classify crypto differently and recommend it be taxed differently — was also included in the report.

The administration recommended that “legislation should be enacted that treats digital assets as a new class of assets subject to modified versions of tax rules applicable to securities or commodities for federal income tax purposes.”

Overall, the administration is aiming to enhance crypto adoption through its policies and subsequent legislative efforts to such a degree that a backslide into a more restrictive regulatory environment could never happen, said Hines. 

The crypto industry gave the moniker “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” to the regulatory environment during the Biden administration. Hines said, “There's no way that we're going to face an Operation Chokepoint 3.0. I think one of the greatest ways to prevent that is through adoption.”

Adoption of an active Bitcoin reserve, though, will still have to wait, at least for now.

The Potato's Mysterious Family Tree Revealed—And It Includes Tomatoes

About nine million years ago, a hybridization involving the lineage of another farmers market star gave rise to the modern-day cultivated potato

Nine million years ago, in the shadow of the rising Andes Mountains, a key ancestor of the beloved modern-day potato was born. And now new research shows this pivotal event—and the mashed, baked and fried bounty it routinely delivers today—only happened with crucial help from another treasured kitchen staple: the tomato.

According to a study published on Thursday in Cell, the prehistoric potato precursor was a hybrid of nearby-growing plants in the lineages of the tomato and Etuberosum, a section of species in the genus Solanum. The latter visually resembles the modern-day cultivated potato plant, which is part of the lineage of the Solanum section Petota. But it lacks the ability to produce the distinctive tubers that store all that useful nutrition in a convenient, fist-sized underground package,

“We have always thought that these three lineages were closely related,” says study co-author Sandra Knapp, a research botanist at the Natural History Museum in London. “But what the relationships between those three lineages were [was] not clear; different genes told us different stories. Our group came together to look into the why!”

The potato is one of the world's most widely used staple crops (along with corn, wheat and rice). But until now, its genetic backstory had been elusive to scientists. Though potatoes resemble Etuberosum and were known to share some genes with tomatoes, scientists hadn't managed to pin down the evolutionary story that somehow tied these plants together.

Knapp and her international team of researchers began by analyzing more than 100 genomes from modern-day potatoes and tomatoes, as well as the largest collection of Etuberosum genomes ever analyzed. The scientists found that each potato genome carried a balanced mosaic of genes from the tomato and Etuberosum lineages. Team members pieced together all the possible phylogenetic trees that could have related the three lineages—and they found strong evidence that the potato was likely not a sister of either the tomato or Etuberosum. The team could then conclude that the potato was a result of a hybridization between the two.

But another mystery remained: neither the tomato nor Etuberosum have tubers, thick parts of the stem that burrow underground and store nutrients for plants such as potatoes, yams and taros. So how did tubers develop in potato plants?

The researchers found that each ancestral parent contained one key gene that—when combined—allowed tubers to grow. Tomatoes contributed the SP6A gene, which acts like a master switch to begin tuber formation. And from the Etuberosum side, another gene called IT1 controls the growth of stems that become tubers.

“We are aware that hybridization generates new traits and new species,” says the study's senior researcher Sanwen Huang, an agriculturist at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. “However, this study is the first to show that hybridization generated a new type of organ, the tuber, which later became [a key part of] one of the staple foods of humanity.”

Tomatoes and Etuberosum likely hybridized during a period of rapid uplift in the Andes range. The resulting tubers enabled the potato's ancestors to reproduce asexually and thus survive in new, higher-elevation habitats. Today tubers allow potatoes to grow resiliently in a range of environments and climates, supporting our ever growing assortment of potato-based foods.

“Now we have a story to tell about potato origins,” says Walter De Jong, a plant geneticist at Cornell University, who was not involved in the study, “another addition to our growing understanding of what makes a potato a potato.""

The Brain Fires Up Immune Cells When Sick People Are Nearby

When people viewed virtual avatars with coughs or rashes, their brain triggered an immune response

By Katie Kavanagh & Nature magazine 

Brain areas that help to monitor the envelope of space close to a person are involved in firing up immune cells when infection threatens.

The brain activates front-line immune cells in response to the mere sight of a sick person, mimicking the body's response to an actual infection, a study shows.

The results required the use of brain scans and blood tests, as well as less conventional technology: gaming kit. Study volunteers donned virtual reality (VR) headsets to view human avatars with rashes, coughs or other symptoms of illness — avoiding the need to expose volunteers to pathogens.

The results illustrate the power of the brain “to predict what is going on [and] to select the proper response”, says study co-author Andrea Serino, a neuroscientist at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland.

The study was published 28 July in Nature Neuroscience.

The immune system reacts promptly to infections, but it can't always move fast enough to prevent serious illness. That means it would be useful for the body to realize that an infection is possible and mount a pre-emptive response.

To study humans' ability to anticipate a pathogen attack, Serino and his colleagues outfitted healthy volunteers with Google's Oculus Rift headsets and showed them avatars that approached closer and closer, although the avatars never ‘touched' the participants. Some avatars showed signs of having an infectious illness; others were controls that looked healthy.

Another group of volunteers did not see the avatars but received an influenza vaccination, representing exposure to an actual pathogen.

The scientists found that the approach of an infectious avatar fired up brain areas linked to personal space — the region immediately surrounding the body. Next came a surge of activity in the brain's ‘salience network': a collection of regions that is involved in recognizing important events, including threats, and responding to them.

That brain activity triggered an increase in the frequency of immune defenders called innate lymphoid cells, which are part of the body's first line of defence against invaders. The frequency of these cells was higher in participants approached by infectious avatars than those approached by controls. The immune activity in those approached by infectious avatars mirrored that of participants who received an influenza vaccine.

“The virtual-reality aspect of this is really interesting,” says Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not involved in the study. The results are an example of the teamwork between “two of the most complex systems of the body”, Chiu says. “They coordinate responses with each other because both systems interface with the environment and establish protection against potential dangers like pathogens.”

The researchers say that the findings could help to improve vaccines: VR might be able to increase activation of the immune cells that are targeted by vaccines, the authors say. That could boost the immune response to vaccines, and, therefore, their efficacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A New Statue Suddenly Appeared on Easter Island. That Doesn't Make Sense.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a65562836/new-statue-discovered-on-easter-island/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:40:00 GMT","

Scientists thought they found them all.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Just when experts thought they knew every moai on Rapa Nui, otherwise known as Easter Island, a dried-up lakebed kept them on their toes. These statues—largely made of a stone formed from volcanic ash and dust called tuff—pepper the island, with more than 1,000 already found and logged. 

Finding a new one came as a surprise. And a bit of a mystery.

“We think we know all the moai, but then a new one turns up, a new discovery, and in this case, in the lake, at the statue quarry,” Terry Hunt, professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, told Good Morning America. “There have been no moai found in the dry bed or in what was previously a lake, so this is a first.”

And it may not be the last. 

As the area undergoes drying, the lakebed in question has given up its moai. And this opportunity may occur again. “Under the dry conditions that we have now, we may find more,” Hunt said. “They've been hidden by the tall reeds that grow in the lakebed and prospecting with something that can detect what's under the ground surface may tell us that there are in fact more moai in the lakebed sediments. When there's one moai in the lake, there's probably more.”

The newly discovered moai is also one of the smallest found, leading experts to believe that hidden within these reeds is the potential for a bounty of new moai. 

Created by the Rapu Nui people, moai have a mythical legend attached to them and have gained worldwide renown for their appearances. Some believe these moai were given special powers to walk across land and end up in their resting place. Whether or not the legend has legs, there are many theories regarding how these statues moved from building sites to various locations. 

While the largest of the statues weighs 86 tons and rises 32 feet tall, most of the moai average about half that size. About 95 percent are carved from the volcanic tuff, but a few are made from basalt. Each one is unique, created by carvers to represent the characteristics of the person it resembled, often a chieftain or key leader. 

The finishing touch on moai was the inclusion of special stones for the eyes, not carved or placed  until the statue found its home. 

Even though experts thought they knew the locations of all of these moai homes, finding this new, small one in the lakebed proves some had remained a complete mystery.

“It's here in the lake and nobody knows this exists,” Salvador Atan Hito, vice president of Ma'u Henua, the group that oversees the island's national park, told Good Morning America, “even the ancestors, our grandparents don't know [about] that one.”

Popular GLP-1 drugs help many people drop tremendous amounts of weight, but the drugs fail to provide a key improvement in heart and lung function essential for long-term good health, University of Virginia experts warn in a new paper.

The researchers emphasize that weight loss associated with GLP-1 drugs has many clear health benefits for people with obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart failure, including improving blood-sugar control, short-term cardiorenal benefits and improvements in survival outcomes. But doctors may need to consider recommending exercise programs or develop other approaches, such as nutrition supplements or complementary medications, to help GLP-1 patients get the full cardiorespiratory benefits of substantial weight loss over the long-run, the researchers say.

""Some patients literally told me that they felt that they were losing muscle or muscle was slipping away from them while they were on these medications,"" said researcher Zhenqi Liu, MD, Professor of Medicine and James M. Moss Professor of Diabetes at the University of Virginia School of Medicine and former chief of UVA Health's Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism. ""This is a serious concern. Muscle, especially axial muscle, is essential for posture, physical function and overall well-being. Losing lean body mass can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality and diminished quality of life. We need to make sure that patients prescribed these medications aren't already at risk for malnutrition or low muscle mass.""

About GLP-1 Drugs

While GLP-1 drugs help people lose fat, this comes with loss of fat-free mass, of which muscle makes up 40% to 50%. In fact, fat-free mass lost accounts for 25-40% of the total pounds lost, while age-related declines in fat-free mass are only 8% per decade.

Liu and his collaborators, graduate student Nathan R. Weeldreyer and Siddhartha S. Angadi, PhD, Associate Professor of Kinesiology at UVA's School of Education and Human Development, wanted to better understand the potential long-term consequences of this muscle loss, so they reviewed available data on the drugs' effects on cardiorespiratory fitness, or CRF.

CRF (or VO2max) is a measure of how well the body can use oxygen during exercise. It is a handy way for doctors to assess how well the heart, lungs, muscle and blood vessels work together, and it is used to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (risk of death).

Patients with obesity often have low CRF. In some cases, this is because the person lacks muscle mass; in others, a person may have enough muscle, but the quality of that muscle is compromised by fat that has penetrated it.

""Cardiorespiratory fitness is a potent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk across a range of populations, including obesity, diabetes and heart failure,"" said Angadi, a cardiovascular exercise physiologist with UVA's Department of Kinesiology. ""In a recent study by our group that examined mortality outcomes from almost 400,000 individuals across the world, we found that CRF was far superior to overweight or obesity status for predicting the risk of death. In fact, once CRF was factored in, body weight failed to predict the risk of mortality. This is why it's so important to understand the effects of this new class of drugs on it.""

In their review of the available medical literature, the researchers found that GLP-1 drugs improve certain measures of heart function, yet those improvements don't translate into significant improvements in VO2max.

Some small studies, they note, have suggested that exercise can help improve VO2max for patients taking GLP-1 drugs, but these had poor controls and larger, well-designed studies are needed to bear that out.

Ensuring Healthy Weight Loss

The researchers ultimately conclude that GLP-1 drugs ""significantly reduce body weight and adiposity, along with a substantial FFM [fat-free mass] loss, but with no clear evidence of CRF enhancement."" They remain concerned that this could take a toll on patients' metabolic health, healthspan/frailty and overall longevity. They are urging additional research to better understand the effects of the drugs and ensure patients get the best possible outcomes.

They note, however, that there are promising signs that we may be able to develop medications to help, such as a monoclonal antibody already in the pipeline that may be able to offset lean-muscle loss.

""This is an area of active research, and we are hopeful that better solutions are coming soon,"" Liu said. ""But for now it is important that patients prescribed GLP-1 drugs have conversations with their healthcare providers about strategies to preserve muscle mass. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for malnutrition and low muscle mass risk before starting these medications and promoting adequate protein intake and regular exercise throughout treatment.""

""Finally,"" Angadi added, ""exercise training during GLP1 therapy remains to be assessed in its ability to preserve or improve VO2max during GLP1 therapy.""

Findings Published

The researchers have published their findings in JCEM, the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, grants R01DK124344 and R01DK125330.

The AI system AlphaEarth Foundations integrates satellite images, such as this one of irrigated cropland, with other types of map to offer a data-rich picture of Earth.Credit: USGS

The technology giant Google has released an artificial intelligence (AI) model that acts as a ‘virtual satellite' to weave together trillions of disparate observations — satellite images, radar and more — to track changes in land and shallow waters across Earth. Researchers are lauding the sheer scale of the effort while also calling on Google for more information about its tests, and warning that it will be up to individual scientists to verify any maps they obtain from the tool.

Google tapped billions of mobile phones to detect quakes worldwide — and send alerts

The model, called AlphaEarth Foundations, maps the world “at any place and time”, Christopher Brown, a research engineer at Google DeepMind in New York City, said at a press briefing on 28 July. Scientists might use it to identify the best places for clean-energy projects, study the ecological impacts of climate change, track deforestation and more.

Alongside the model, which was released yesterday, Google and its DeepMind AI unit have posted a paper, ahead of peer review, to the arXiv preprint server1. The manuscript describes the creation of the model, its initial testing and baseline data sets covering Earth during the years 2017–24. It says that AlphaEarth beats similar AI models in terms of both accuracy and data density, and that the model saves users computing time and reduces energy use.

Nicholas Murray, a conservation biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, is the lead scientist for Global Ecosystems Atlas, an initiative to map the world's biodiversity and environments. Murray says that his team often spends “tens to hundreds of days” processing satellite data before it can even begin to make products such as maps describing changes in tidal wetlands over time. He hopes that Google's latest model — which the team is familiar with — will make that process more efficient.

Moving forward, Google says, it will regularly update AlphaEarth's data sets, which come fully processed. They are available through the company's Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that already hosts separate repositories of data covering topics such as agriculture, deforestation and weather. AlphaEarth weaves together many of these data sets to create an integrated product that scientists can explore more easily.

Torpor is a naturally occurring state of metabolic suppression that enables animals to adapt and survive extreme environmental conditions. Inspired by this adaptation, researchers have pursued synthetic torpor—an artificially induced, reversible hypometabolic state with transformative medical potential. Achieving synthetic torpor has been pursued for over a hundred years, with earlier work focused on identifying drugs for systemically suppressing metabolism. Breakthroughs in 2020 identified key torpor-regulating neurons in mice, opening new opportunities for neuromodulation-based metabolic control. Synthetic torpor has been applied in animal models for various medical applications, including ischaemic protection, organ preservation, radiation protection and lifespan extension. This Perspective examines the fundamental concepts of natural torpor, advances in approaches to induce synthetic torpor and medical applications of synthetic torpor. The capability of synthetic torpor to suppress whole-body metabolism has the potential to transform medicine by offering novel strategies for medical interventions.

Two years ago I called Raycast the launcher Apple wishes it made. Apple, it seems, agreed—it's adding all kinds of features to macOS later this year that duplicate a number of Raycast features.

Tahoe—which is currently in a public beta and will be widely available in the fall—includes a number of new features. One stands out: an overhauled version of Spotlight that adds a lot of new functionality. A few of these capabilities overlap directly with things that Raycast does. You can do things like write text messages or reminders without leaving Spotlight, for example. Eventually you'll be able to interact directly with third-party apps. There's also a clipboard manager, which is one of the nicer features.

As a longtime Raycast user, I couldn't help but wonder how this new Spotlight compares with Raycast, so I installed Tahoe in a virtual machine and gave it a spin. Here's what I found.

Spotlight is launched from the menu bar or by using the keyboard shortcut Command + Space, same as always. But the initial launch screen you see the first couple of times is a little different; it's telling you what the new Spotlight can do.

You can just type a search query and ignore these instructions if you want to (and I'm sure many users will). You can start typing to find files, applications, and information from the internet, the same as before.

But there are four modes outside this default: Applications, Files, Actions, and Clipboard. You can switch between these modes by using the right and left arrow keys or by using the Command key in combination with a corresponding number. You'll see a simpler overlay when you do so.

The first two modes limit your search to only files or applications installed on your computer. Neither of these are new features, exactly, but using them filters your results, meaning things like internet links and word definitions won't show up. They reduce clutter, basically.

It's the third and fourth tools that are the most interesting. Let's break them down.

The third tab in the new spotlight is Actions, which is understandably the one that people are most excited about. From here you can interact with macOS applications without leaving Spotlight.

So, for example, you could write an entire email using the “Send Email” action. Just type the message, who you want to send it to, and the subject line, then hit enter—the email will go out.

There are all kinds of actions included out of the box. You can add calendar appointments and reminders and set timers. You can send text messages or start FaceTime calls. You can even set dedicated keyboard shortcuts for any of these actions.

It's also the exact kind of thing that, until now, Raycast did that Spotlight could not. The difference is one of implementation. Apple's approach currently only works with Mac applications that implement the Spotlight feature. Right now, it's basically limited to just Apple's own tools, but that is going to change; according to Apple's presentation for developers, third-party applications will also be able to add actions that are executable from within Spotlight. I couldn't find any non-Apple applications that currently implement this, but I'm sure that will change as we get closer to the fall.

Raycast, meanwhile, can be enhanced by user-built extensions that you can easily install from the built-in store. This has a downside, mostly that if you want to connect an application, you're going to have to install and configure the extension yourself. That's not hard, though—the built-in store offers hundreds of these extensions, and you can install them with a few keystrokes. These extensions also can connect with any service, not just those that have Mac apps, meaning web-only services like Google Docs are supported. Many of these extensions offer features that Spotlight never will, such as custom menu bar icons for things like calendar appointments or the currently playing song in Spotify. I could go on; Raycast's approach is simply more flexible.

Right now, for power users, I think Raycast is the better choice. That might change as more applications add support for Spotlight, though, especially given the fact that users don't need to install anything or set anything up to get new capabilities in Spotlight.

Windows has had a clipboard manager for years—just press Windows-V and you'll see a list of everything you've copied lately. There have always been many third-party applications that give you a more powerful clipboard on the Mac, including Raycast.

The new macOS update adds this feature to Spotlight, making it easy to go back and find that thing you copied earlier today. It's the kind of feature you don't realize you need until you start relying on it, and I'm glad macOS finally offers it.

With these new features, Spotlight is a great deal more powerful than before, but it isn't a one-for-one Raycast replacement. The biggest advantage Raycast has over Spotlight, at this point, is the Raycast store, which makes the launcher compatible with way more applications and services than Spotlight will have for a long time.

But there are other features. Raycast can manage windows, allowing you to set keyboard shortcuts for things like docking a window to the left or right side of the screen. It has a built-in snippet manager, allowing you to save things that you find yourself retyping constantly, so you can quickly paste them. There's also a distraction blocker tool called Focus. Raycast has, over the years, added all kinds of features that were previously popular bits of dedicated software, and Apple isn't likely to copy all of them.

The Raycast team, for their part, isn't worried about the newly enhanced Spotlight. In a post on X the company's CEO, Thomas Paul Mann, said the new features will give users a taste for an application like Raycast. “People will run into limitations and want more from a launcher, which is where we step in,” he wrote.

I'm not sure how true that is, but I look forward to seeing how everything develops. I, for one, will probably use both options for a while and see which I prefer.

Google is testing a machine learning-powered tech in the U.S. to determine the age of users and filter content across all its products accordingly.

The company said it will consider data from Google accounts, including types of details users have searched for or categories of videos they have watched on YouTube, to determine the age. If the company's tool decides that a user is under 18, they would get an email with details about how Google products might change for them.

For these users, Google will disable the timeline in Maps, stop personalized ads, restrict age-restricted ad categories, and bar them from accessing adult-themed apps on the Play Store. The company will also turn on digital well-being features on YouTube, such as break reminders and “go to bed” notifications when consuming videos late at night. Plus, it will prevent underage users from accessing certain kinds of content — such as content that could trigger body image issues — repeatedly.

If users think they have been tagged as an underage account by mistake, they can appeal the decision and prove their age using a photo of their government ID or a selfie.

Google rolled out similar measures for YouTube earlier this week, and now the company is experimenting with machine learning-based age gating in the U.S. for Google accounts at large. The company said that it has experimented with age-estimation tech in some markets (without specifying which ones), and it worked well.

“Age assurance helps us ensure that adults can access the information and services they need, while also applying the right protections for our younger users. Our approach to age assurance uses a combination of age estimation and, when necessary, age verification,” Google said in a post. 

Other platforms, including Instagram and Roblox, have also started using AI to estimate the age of their users. Lawmakers have been at work to put in rules related to serving appropriate content to minors. In the U.S., several states have existing or proposed laws around age gating. Meanwhile, platforms have also started age verification in the U.K. following the passing of the Online Safety Act.

Autonomous vehicles have long been touted as “just around the corner,” but the reality of what it takes to bring self-driving cars to the streets is anything but simple. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana joins the Disrupt Stage for a wide-ranging conversation on the current state of AVs — and where the industry goes from here.

While the headlines often focus on crashes, controversies, or overblown promises, Tekedra has spent years navigating the real-world path to autonomous mobility. At Disrupt, she'll dig into what it actually takes to scale AV deployment — from rider safety and public trust to the nuances of regulation, operations, and competitive pressure from Tesla and others.

This session isn't about vague timelines or flashy demos. It's about what's working, what still needs work, and what it means to bring truly autonomous vehicles to life at scale. Whether you're a founder, investor, or just curious about the road ahead, you won't want to miss it.

Tekedra Mawakana brings over two decades of experience shaping global strategy for some of the world's biggest tech companies. As co-CEO of Waymo, she guides the company's long-term mission to bring the Waymo Driver to the masses and lead the next generation of autonomous innovation. She also serves on the board of Intuit, advises Boom Technology, and supports a number of social impact ventures through her work as an investor and LP with Operator Collective.

OpenAI said Thursday that it plans to launch Stargate Norway, its first AI data center in Europe, in partnership with British AI cloud infrastructure provider Nscale and Norwegian energy infrastructure firm Aker. 

Nscale will design and build the site, and it will be a 50/50 joint venture between the two companies. OpenAI will be an “off-taker” in the project, buying capacity from the data center. 

The announcement comes as Europe races to achieve AI sovereignty and invest in data centers and compute power. Earlier this week, the bloc unveiled details of its multibillion-dollar investment into AI infrastructure, including €10 billion ($11.8 billion) to set up 13 AI factories and €20 billion as an initial investment in the factories. Data sovereignty is key to that mission, due to the sensitive nature of business and government data. 

Nscale and OpenAI told TechCrunch that Stargate Norway isn't a part of the European Union's plans to scale AI at home. Nscale CEO Josh Payne told CNBC that part of the purpose of this project is to “leverage European sovereign compute” for the benefit of the continent. Norway's AI ecosystem, like startups and scientific researchers, will get priority access to the center.

CNBC also reported that Nscale and Aker have each committed around $1 billion to the initial 20 megawatt (MW) phase of the project. OpenAI says Stargate Norway will initially deliver 230 MW capacity, with plans to expand to 290 MW, and will run on 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026.

The site will be located near Narvik, a small town in northern Norway. OpenAI said in a blog post the region is notable for its access to hydropower, a cool climate, and a “mature industrial base.”

“The facility will run entirely on renewable power and is expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure maximum cooling efficiency,” said OpenAI. “Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will be made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region.”

Per the EU AI Act, which took effect in August 2024 and bans systems with “unacceptable risk,” companies building data centers must take steps to protect the environment and be transparent about the energy consumption of AI models. Additionally, the bloc's Energy Efficiency Directive emphasizes energy efficiency in the ICT sector, which includes data centers. The directive also directs data centers exceeding certain energy input thresholds to recover waste heat. 

The Stargate Norway announcement comes seven months after OpenAI announced it would invest $500 billion into 10 gigawatts of AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. The deal also follows the launch of Stargate UAE earlier this year, and a recently signed deal with the U.K. government to accelerate AI adoption and boost infrastructure.

This article was updated to clarify that Stargate Norway is separate from the EU's investment into AI infrastructure.

I would hope for something more explicit, where you get a connection object and then open streams from it, but I guess that is fine for now.https://github.com/microsoft/msquic/discussions/4257 ah but look at this --- unless this is an extension, the server side can also create new streams, once a connection is established. The client creating new ""connections"" (actually streams) cannot abstract over this. Something fundamentally new is needed.My guess is recvmsg to get a new file descriptor for new stream.

Network stacks were moved to userspace because Google wanted to replace TCP itself (and upgrade TLS), but it only cared about the browser, so they just put the stack in the browser, and problem solved.

OTOH, you want to be in user land on the client, because modifying the kernel on clients is hard. If you were Google, maybe you could work towards a model where Android clients could get their in-kernel protocol handling to be something that could be updated regularly, but that doesn't seem to be something Google is willing or able to do; Apple and Microsoft can get priority kernel updates out to most of their users quickly; Apple also can influence networks to support things they want their clients to use (IPv6, MP-TCP). </rant>If you were happy with congestion control on both sides of TCP, and were willing to open multiple TCP connections like http/1, instead of multiplexing requests on a single connection like http/2, (and maybe transfer a non-pessimistic bandwidth estimate between TCP connections to the same peer), QUIC still gives you control over retransmission that TCP doesn't, but I don't think that would be compelling enough by itself.Yes, there's still ossification in middle boxes doing TCP optimization. My information may be old, but I was under the impression that nobody does that in IPv6, so the push for v6 is both a way to avoid NAT and especially CGNAT, but also a way to avoid optimizer boxes as a benefit for both network providers (less expense) and services (less frustration).

Ossification doesn't apply (or it shouldn't, IMHO, the point of Open Source software is that you can change it to fit your needs... if you don't like what upstream is doing, you should be running a local fork that does what you want... yeah, it's nicer if it's upstreamed, but try running a local fork of Windows or MacOS); you can make congestion control work for you when you control both sides; enterprise switches and routers aren't messing with tcp flows. If you're pushing enough traffic that this is an issue, the cost of QUIC seems way too high to justify, even if it helps with some issues.

reply

As very few server administrators bother turning on features like MPTCP, QUIC has an advantage on mobile phones with moderate to bad reception. That's not a huge issue for me most of the time, but billions of people are using mobile phones as their only access to the internet, especially in developing countries that are practically skipping widespread copper and fiber infrastructure and moving directly to 5G instead. Any service those people are using should probably consider implementing QUIC, and if they use it, they'd benefit from an in-kernel server.All the data center operators can stick to (MP)TCP, the telco people can stick to SCTP, but the consumer facing side of the internet would do well to keep QUIC as an option.

Jesus, that's bad. Does anyone know if userspace QUIC implementations are also this slow?

reply

To be fair, the Linux kernel TCP implementation only gets ~4.5 Gbps at normal packets sizes and still only achieves ~24 Gbps with large segmentation offload [2]. Both of which are ridiculously slow. It is straightforward to achieve ~100 Gbps/core at normal packet sizes without segmentation offload with the same features as QUIC with a properly designed protocol and implementation.[1] https://microsoft.github.io/msquic/[2] https://lwn.net/ml/all/cover.1751743914.git.lucien.xin@gmail...

- having a lower latency handshake- avoiding some badly behaved ‘middleware' boxes between users and servers- avoiding resetting connections when user up addresses change- avoiding head of line blocking / the increased cost of many connections ramping up- avoiding poor congestion control algorithms- probably other things tooAnd those are all things about working better with the kind of network situations you tend to see between users (often on mobile devices) and servers. I don't think QUIC was meant to be fast by reducing OS overhead on sending data, and one should generally expect it to be slower for a long time until operating systems become better optimised for this flow and hardware supports offloading more of the work. If you are Google then presumably you are willing to invest in specialised network cards/drivers/software for that.

This could be achieved by encapsulating TCP in UDP and running a custom TCP stack in userspace on the client.   That would allow protocol innovation without throwing away 3 decades of optimizations in TCP that make it 4x as efficient on the server side.

reply

It could still be faster in real world situations where the client is a mobile device with a high latency, lossy connection.

reply

reply

Surely badly behaving middleboxes won't just ignore UDP traffic? If anything, they'd get confused about udp/443 and act up, forcing clients to fall back to normal TCP.

reply

QUIC is basically about taking all of the information middleboxes like to fuck with in TCP, putting it under the encryption layer, and packaging it back up in a UDP packet precisely so it's either just dropped or forwarded. In practice this (i.e. QUIC either being just dropped or left alone) has actually worked quite well.

reply

OTOH, TCP is like a quiet guy at the gym who always wears baggy clothes but does 4 plates on the bench when nobody is looking. Don't underestimate. I wasted months to learn that lesson.

reply

reply

Secondary you have the reduced RTT, multiple streams (prevents HOL blocking), datagrams (realtime video on same conn) and you can scale buffers (in userspace) to avoid BDP limits imposed by kernel. However.. I think in practice those haven't gotten as much visibility and traction, so the original reason is still the main one from what I can tell.

reply

reply

reply

QUIC getting hardware acceleration should close this gap, and keep all the benefits. But a kernel (software) implementation is basically necessary before it can be properly hardware-accelerated in future hardware (is my current understanding)

reply

It does save 2 round-trips during connection compared to TLS-over-TCP, if Wikipedia's diagram is accurate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC#Characteristics That is a decent latency win on every single connection, and with 0-RTT you can go further, but 0-RTT is stateful and hard to deploy and I expect it will see very little use.

When Google announces its new family of Pixel 10 phones next month on August 20, there will likely be one bit of news that will surprise—or perhaps not surprise—everyone. And that's the fact that its third-gen book-style foldable, currently dubbed the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, will almost certainly still start at a whopping $1,800.

Android Headlines is exclusively reporting that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will come in three storage capacities, including a new 1TB version. A 256GB model will reportedly cost $1,800; 512GB for $,1919; and 1TB for $2,149. At a time when the cost of everything from eggs to toilet paper has shot through the stratosphere, that's a lot of bones for a phone that folds in half and opens up to provide an expansive tablet-like experience.

More than anything, the leaked pricing reveals the bleak reality of book-style foldables: they're not getting cheaper. In the six years since Samsung launched the very first Galaxy Fold, the price for this kind of form factor has only shot up. Samsung's latest Z Fold 7—the best book-style foldable in my opinion—starts at $2,000 compared to the $1,980 the OG Fold retailed for back in 2019.

Rumors heavily suggest that Apple will finally release its first-ever book-style foldable iPhone next year. It may fall short of being as thin and light as the Z Fold 7, but it'll run iOS (or will it be iPadOS, or perhaps a hybrid of both?) so there will be hordes of fanatics who will line up. The biggest hurdle to a foldable iPhone's success, however, might be the price. JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee predicts the foldable iPhone could start at $2,000, according to CNBC. Consumers already hate paying $1,000 for an iPhone 16 Pro, and almost nobody pays $1,600 (before tax) for a 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max, so $2,000 for a foldable iPhone is going to be a hard pill to swallow even if you split that price up over monthly installments.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple sold it for even more. A foldable iPhone would basically be two iPhone Pros bolted together—you get a regular bar-style cover screen and then an iPad mini-sized inner foldable display. And then, there's the fact that book-style foldables have more cameras than regular phones—usually a hole-punch camera for the cover screen and the foldable display, and then a separate dual- or triple-lens camera system on the backside. Not to mention, book-style foldables often require larger capacity batteries to power the larger folding screen. You pay more for more gadget.

When you break it all down, it's no wonder prices for book-style foldable phones have not come down in just over half a decade. If anything, they could get more expensive. The OnePlus Open was a hell of a deal for a book-style foldable when it retailed for $1,700, and an even better value at $1,500 if you took advantage of its “trade-in any phone” promo. OnePlus currently sells the Open discounted to $1,500, and you can slash up to $100 off with an eligible trade-in, but outside of this kinda promo, you won't find a flagship-level book-style foldable that's available worldwide (and especially compatible in the U.S.) for under $1,500.

I'm suddenly reminded of former Sony PlayStation boss, Ken Kutaragi, infamously telling consumers they should want to “work more hours” so that they can afford a PS3. Maybe we'll all need second jobs to afford book-style foldable phones. Or just stick to our non-folding ones; they work just fine too.

After spending months without eating, drinking, or moving, hibernating mammals must rebound from extreme physiological changes. Two new studies suggest that the genetic “superpowers” underlying this incredible resilience may also be present in the human genome.

For these studies, published Thursday, July 31, in the journal Science, researchers at the University of Utah honed in on the specific DNA regions that help hibernators rapidly recover from muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, and brain damage. They found strong evidence to suggest that the human genome shares these genetic regions, which function as control switches for hibernator adaptations. Finding and harnessing them could lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and other disorders, the researchers say.

“Humans already have the genetic framework,” said Susan Steinwand, a neurobiology and anatomy researcher at U of U Health and first author of one of the studies. “We just need to identify the control switches for these hibernator traits.”

During hibernation, mammals enter a state of torpor, or physiological dormancy. This allows them to survive months without food and water, but at great cost to their health. Their muscles deteriorate due to lack of nutrition and movement, Christopher Gregg, a professor of neurobiology at U of U and senior author on both studies, told Gizmodo. Proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease build up in their brains, and upon awakening, the sudden reperfusion of blood can cause further neurological damage, he explained. What's more, they become insulin resistant due to the amount of fat they gain to sustain them during months of starvation.

Hibernating mammals have evolved remarkable adaptations to reverse this extensive physiological damage. The genes that underlie these adaptations are likely also present in humans and other non-hibernators, Gregg explained. The fact that hibernation has evolved independently in multiple animal species suggests that its basic genetic ingredients are present across the mammalian genome. Therefore, non-hibernators may still carry them.

“We mostly all have the same genes across species,” Gregg said. “The big change is in the 98% of the genome that does not encode for genes.” Non-coding DNA is largely responsible for gene regulation. In hibernators, specific regions of non-coding DNA act as “master switches” for controlling functional gene responses to starvation and refeeding, he explained.

Finding these master switches in the mammalian genome is like searching for needles in a DNA haystack. To accomplish this, the researchers made whole-genome comparisons across mammals to identify conserved DNA regions that are stable in most species but show accelerated change in hibernators. These hibernator-accelerated regions are regulators that turn genes on in specific cells at specific times, Elliott Ferris, a data analyst in Gregg's lab at U of U and first author of one of the studies, told Gizmodo.

To understand the biological processes that may be linked to these hibernator-accelerated regions, the researchers identified genes that get turned up or turned down during fasting in mice. Hibernation is an adaptation to survive food scarcity, so fasting triggers similar metabolic changes. This led them to “hub genes” that act as master regulators for fasting-induced changes to gene activity.

“The really surprising discovery that was very exciting was that the hibernation-linked elements are disproportionately affecting those key hub genes,” Gregg explained. “The implication is that hibernators changed the regulation and activity of these core hub genes to have big downstream effects on the whole program for responding to food scarcity and food deprivation. That's important as we think about translating this knowledge into the real world.”

Gregg is co-founder of Primordial AI, a Utah-based biotech startup that leverages AI to uncover master regulator gene drug targets. Through this company, he aims to develop drugs that mimic the genetic advantages hibernators have, such as boosting neuroprotection in Alzheimer's patients or reversing insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics. “Those hub genes are the ones that we think are a really good starting point to design medicines to affect those genes,” Gregg said.

It's been over a decade since The Conjuring hit theaters and terrified audiences enough to spark what's now an ever-expanding cinematic universe, with Annabelle and The Nun spawning adjacent series. But the supernatural adventures of Ed and Lorraine Warren—based on the real-life paranormal investigators and played in the Conjuring movies by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga—are coming to an end in The Conjuring: Last Rites.

We now have a second trailer for the fourth Conjuring movie, directed by Michael Chaves (The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It), and it teases more about the case that'll be featured—and why it's the one that stopped the Warrens from continuing their work. The demon they encounter is not just especially evil and angry… it knows them. They've met before, you see.

We also get a glimpse of what appears to be yet another haunted object for the Warrens' collection—a spooky music box would fit right in—as well as a particularly chilling riff on that old horror standby, the multiple mirror illusion.

As you can see in the trailer, The Conjuring: Last Rites also stars Mia Tomlinson as an older version of Judy, the Warrens' daughter, a character who's appeared in previous installments. Steve Coulter is also back as Father Gordon.

Here's the official synopsis: “The Conjuring: Last Rites delivers another thrilling chapter of the iconic Conjuring cinematic universe, based on real events. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reunite for one last case as renowned, real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in a powerful and spine-chilling addition to the global box office-breaking franchise. Farmiga and Wilson star alongside Mia Tomlinson and Ben Hardy, who portray Ed and Lorraine's daughter Judy Warren and her boyfriend, Tony Spera, as well as Steve Coulter returning as Father Gordon, Rebecca Calder, Elliot Cowan, Kíla Lord Cassidy, Beau Gadsdon, John Brotherton, and Shannon Kook.”

The Conjuring: Last Rites hits theaters September 5.

Voice assistants are… not perfect. That's me being nice. But if I were to cease being nice, I'd probably say something more like “voice assistants suck,” and I think most would agree I'd be justified in saying so. While no voice assistant really manages to escape that criticism, I usually opt for Google Assistant, which—in my experience—is the least sucky. Or it used to be, but after some recent hiccups, I may have to start rethinking that dishonorable distinction.

See Google Speakers at Amazon

Last week, Google Assistant users reported that the voice assistant was bordering on broken. Those complaints across Reddit and X were so loud, in fact, that Google itself decided to get out there and address them. Here's Google's Director of Product Management, Google Home & Nest, Anish Kattukaran, doing some damage control on X last week.

Hey everyone, I want to acknowledge the recent feedback about Google Assistant reliability on our home devices. I sincerely apologize for what you're experiencing and feeling!

— Anish Kattukaran (@AnishKattukaran) July 23, 2025



Pretty bad, right? Well, unfortunately, those attempts at getting out ahead of problems appear mostly rhetorical, because things somehow have gotten worse, and now Google Home is at the center of what I would describe as a reputation shitstorm. According to way too many people on Reddit, Google Home is so broken that some people are actually unable to even turn their smart lights on and off properly. And it's not just lights; if Reddit complaints are anything to go off of, it looks like all kinds of smart devices are affected by problems with Google Home, including other speakers and even (disconcertingly) cameras and smart doorbells.

While Google has apparently promised to fix the issues, it looks like, for lots of people, they've persisted. A quick scan of the Google Home subreddit reveals that connectivity issues and general issues are still pouring in, with no official announcement from Google. Mileage may vary, but if you're one of the many unlucky Google Home users having issues with third-party devices, you can pull open your Google Home app and navigate to the settings and see if the connecting app is still synced. To do that, go to Settings in the bottom-right corner, then tap “Works with Google,” and a list of your synced apps should show up. If they're no longer synced, re-sync the app by finding it under “Add new.” If they're still synced and not working, unsync the app by tapping on the icon and then tap “Unlink account.” After that, you can try syncing once more and hope that it works.

Obviously, having to do any of this is annoying for lots of reasons. For one, people use the Google Home app and smart products on a daily basis to do things like turn their freaking lights on and off. It's also frustrating from a more general standpoint, given Google Assistant's slow erosion over the past few years to the point where some of its core functions have basically broken. To me, this is the clearest indication that voice assistants are in a very bad place, and something needs to be done. That something, if Google, Apple, and Amazon have anything to do with it, will probably be a much-needed dose of AI chatbots like Gemini, but it remains to be seen whether an infusion of a large language model will be enough. The bittersweet news is that it looks like it can't possibly get any worse, though. On the bright side, Apple must feel pretty good about delaying its promised next-gen Siri. Better late than broken, I say.

At one point, this king of gaming processors was almost impossible to get your hands on; now, with the benefit of time and ample stock of the 9800X3D on retailer shelves, it's more about how good a deal you can find on this magnificent gaming CPU. At Amazon, you can grab hold of AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D for just £399, the lowest price it's ever been available for at Amazon. This is also the lowest price in the UK at the time of writing. If you have Amazon Prime, then the shipping is also free, so there are no hidden extra costs.

AMD has dominated the gaming CPU space for a while now, overshadowing Intel in gaming sales. especially the top-end gaming sphere, with their X3D line of processors that use a massive 3D V-cache of memory to enhance the processors' performance in gaming applications. If you're playing esports titles such as Counter-Strike 2, Rainbow 6: Siege, or Valorant, then that's where you can really see the difference in a gaming CPU like the 9800X3D. Using lower resolutions to enhance framerates to insane levels for less graphical latency. The benefits fall off as you creep towards 4K gaming, where the graphics card takes over as the primary source for enhancing framerates and graphical fidelity.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D uses AMD's successful 3D V-cache technology, which provides the 9800X3D with its pure gaming prowess. The large cache boosts performance, and along with design changes to the CPU, such as moving the cache chiplet underneath the die to alleviate the thermal insulation of previous designs, the compute die is now closer to the thermal interface material (IHS). With this increased thermal headroom comes 500 MHz higher base clocks and 200 MHz higher boosts than the previous-gen Zen 4-powered Ryzen 7 7800X3D.

AMD's latest gaming king, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, uses AMD's successful 3D V-Cache technology, which provides the 9800X3D with its pure gaming prowess. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D comes with eight cores and 16 threads and has a 120W TDP.

In our 13-game average with resolutions set to 1920 x 1080 pixels, the 9800X3D topped the charts. Outperforming the 7800X3D which it replaced.

Records from millions of patients at UC health centers found correlations between endometriosis, one of the most common diseases in women, and a bounty of other diseases. 

Scientists at UCSF have found that endometriosis - a painful chronic disease affecting 10% of women that often goes undiagnosed - often occurs alongside conditions like cancer, Crohn's disease, and migraine.

The research could improve how endometriosis is diagnosed and, ultimately, how it is treated; and it paints the sharpest portrait yet of a condition that is as mysterious as it is prevalent.

The study, which appeared in Cell Reports Medicine on July 31, used computational methods developed at UCSF to analyze anonymized patient records collected at the University of California's six health centers. 

We now have both the tools and the data to make a difference for the huge population that suffers from endometriosis. We hope this can spur a sea change in how we approach this disorder.""

Marina Sirota, PhD, the interim director of the UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute (BCHSI), professor of pediatrics, and senior author of the paper

Endometriosis, often called 'endo,' occurs when the endometrium, the blood-rich tissue that grows in the uterus before being expelled each month during menstruation, spreads to other nearby organs. It causes chronic pain and infertility. It is estimated that nearly 200 million women worldwide suffer from it.

""Endo is extremely debilitating,"" said Linda Giudice, MD, PhD, MSc, a physician-scientist in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at UCSF and co-author of the paper. ""The impact on patients' lives is huge, from their interpersonal relationships to being able to hold a job, have a family, and maintain psychological wellbeing.""

The gold standard to diagnose endometriosis is surgery to find endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, and it is mainly treated with hormones to suppress the menstrual cycle, or surgery to remove the excess tissue. 

But not everyone responds to hormonal therapy, which can have debilitating side effects. Even after surgery, the condition can flare up. Removal of the uterus is a last-ditch measure that is usually reserved for older women; but some women continue to experience pain even after a hysterectomy.

Giudice partnered with Sirota to leverage the UC health system's anonymized patient data against endo, which can vary dramatically across patients. Both Giudice and Sirota are principal investigators at the UCSF-Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (ENACT).

""This data is messy; it was not collected for research purposes but for the real, human purpose of helping women who need care,"" Sirota said. ""We had the rare chance to rigorously assess how endometriosis presents across UCSF's patient population and then ask whether these observations held true with patients seen at the other UC health centers.""

Using algorithms developed for the task, Umair Khan, a bioinformatics graduate student in Sirota's lab and first author of the paper, hunted for connections linking endometriosis with the rest of each patient's health history. 

He compared endo patients with patients who did not have it, and categorized the patients with endo into groups based on shared health histories. He mapped his findings from the UCSF data against the rest of the UC's health data to see if they held up across California.

""We found over 600 correlations between endometriosis and other conditions,"" Khan said. ""These ranged from what we already knew or suspected, like infertility, autoimmune disease, and acid-reflux, to the unexpected, like certain cancers, asthma, and eye-related diseases.""

Some patients had migraines, bolstering previous studies suggesting that migraine drugs might help treat endometriosis. 

""In the past, studies like this would have been nearly impossible,"" said Tomiko Oskotsky, MD, an investigator at ENACT, associate professor in UCSF BCHSI, and co-author of the paper. ""It was only 12 years ago that de-identified electronic health records became available at this scale.""

The study supports the growing understanding of endometriosis as a ""multi-system"" disorder - a disease arising from dysfunction throughout the body. 

""This is the kind of data we need to move the needle, which hasn't moved in decades,"" Giudice said. ""We're finally getting closer to faster diagnosis and, eventually, we hope, tailored treatment for the millions of women who suffer from endometriosis.""

In this interview, we spoke with Associate Professor Diana Mechtcheriakova about how lymphoid structures and germinal centers are unlocking new prognostic insights into colorectal cancer, and with Anastasiia Marchuk of TissueGnostics about the imaging technologies powering this research.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: I am Diana Mechtcheriakova, affiliated with the Institute of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research at the Medical University of Vienna, where I serve as head of the research group Molecular Systems Biology and Pathophysiology.

My recent presentation, titled ""Unlocking the Lymphoid Structures with Germinal Centers: Architectural Complexity, Functionality, and Clinical Relevance,"" reflects the core themes of our research.

Our group operates within a conceptual framework that transitions from systems biology to systems medicine, aligning with the broader vision of personalized medicine. This approach is based on the Aristotelian principle that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” and emphasizes a holistic methodology for deciphering biological complexity through a hierarchical flow from data to information to knowledge.

Our primary research areas include the development of systems biology approaches applied to various projects, with a focus on B-cell biology, immune oncology, lymphoid structures, AID/APOBEC-associated biological events, and the cellular sphingolipid/lysophosphatidate system in immunity and cancer.

In addition, I lead the Tissue Image Cytometry Unit at Austrian Bioimaging and serve as head of the Basic and Translational Research Module at the Austrian Platform for Personalized Medicine.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: My recent work focuses on the biology of lymphoid structures, which are highly organized formations characterized by dense cellular interactions and functional cooperation among various immune cell types. These include B-cell subsets, follicular helper T cells, and follicular dendritic cells.

When fully developed, these structures contain germinal centers, which are functional niches where B cells proliferate, differentiate, undergo affinity maturation, and switch antibody classes. A key marker of active germinal centers is activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which can be visualized through tissue staining, such as in tonsil samples.

The germinal center reaction results in the production of plasma cells and memory B cells. These lymphoid structures are typically located in secondary lymphoid organs; however, they can also be assembled in ectopic locations within chronically inflamed tissues, including tumors. In such cases, they are referred to as ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) or tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS).

A particularly important aspect of this research is the clinical relevance of B cells and ELS in cancer. It has been demonstrated—an insight I consider one of the major breakthroughs of recent years—that the local presence of B cells and ectopic lymphoid structures correlates with favorable patient prognosis in more than ten cancer types. Notable examples include non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer with liver metastases.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: In the context of colorectal cancer with liver metastases, our research group was among the first to demonstrate the accumulation of B cells assembled in ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) with active germinal centers in the liver. These ELS were observed forming a ring-like pattern around the metastases.

To investigate this further, we conducted a precise quantification of B cells and ELS at the tumor-liver interface, using defined zones extending both toward the tumor and into the adjacent liver tissue. This analysis was performed through quantitative tissue image cytometry, utilizing TissueFAXS-based computerized microscopy. Our findings revealed that a higher density of B cells and ELS at the tumor-liver border correlated with improved clinical outcomes, particularly in terms of patient survival.

This prognostic value exceeded that of conventional clinicopathological parameters. Based on these observations, we proposed the hypothesis that the anti-tumor immune response at the metastatic site in the liver may be pre-instructed either at the primary colorectal cancer site or potentially within the non-tumorous colon mucosa, where isolated lymphoid structures (ILS) are normally present.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: The main objective of our study was to determine whether specific characteristics of lymphoid structures across three distinct tissue entities influence the pathobiology of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). To investigate this, we developed a multi-modular approach called DIICO, which stands for Digital Immune Imaging to Clinical Outcome.

The first module of the DIICO strategy involved immunostaining tissue samples using a defined set of immune markers. These included CD20 as a general B-cell marker, AID to identify functionally active germinal centers, Ki67 for proliferating cells, CD27 for memory B cells and plasma cells, CD138 for plasma cells, and CD3 as a general T-cell marker.

We applied these markers to both colon cancer specimens and tonsil tissues to characterize the immune cell composition and assess the functional activity of lymphoid structures.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: The second module of the DIICO strategy focused on assessing the immunological imprint using quantitative tissue image cytometry. Stained specimens were digitized through the automated microscope-based TissueFAXS platform, and quantitative analysis was performed using the HistoQuest and TissueQuest software packages.

Lymphoid structures were defined as distinct objects, and the analysis was carried out at the single-cell level with marker-positive cell detection based on specific expression profiles.

We have had the TissueFAXS platform at our institute since 2008, and in 2022, we were recognized as a Center of Excellence for Quantitative Digital Microscopy. For this project alone, we analyzed more than 700 colon cancer tissue slides and over 120 tonsil samples.

This analysis transformed tissue-encoded information into numerical variables, categorized by anatomical region and staining characteristics for each patient. These variables were then aligned with clinicopathological parameters to generate insights into disease mechanisms and patient outcomes.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: In our study, we identified 24 variables related to lymphoid structure characteristics. These included parameters such as anatomical site, number and size of lymphoid structures, cellular density, and the percentage of marker-positive cells for each defined immune marker.

A central question we addressed was the clinical relevance of these variables in characterizing the immune phenotype of lymphoid structures. Notably, in non-tumorous (NT) tissue, we found that variables reflecting the percentage of CD20-positive B cells and Ki67-positive proliferating cells—individually and in combination—demonstrated strong prognostic value.

This was supported by statistically significant patient stratification into low- and high-risk groups using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. One of the most significant findings was that B-cell-enriched and highly proliferative isolated lymphoid structures (ILS) located in the non-tumorous colonic mucosa had a pronounced impact on patient survival outcomes.

This discovery indicates that the immunological imprint of lymphoid structures in normal colon tissue encodes valuable prognostic information for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases.

Diana Mechtcheriakova: Building upon our systems biology-based, multi-modular analysis strategy, we are now expanding our approach beyond quantitative tissue image cytometry—powered by the TissueFAXS platform—and transcriptomic data analysis through the GENEVESTIGATOR tool.

We have recently integrated two additional modules into our framework. The first is spatial transcriptomics using 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression, which enables mRNA profiling directly within FFPE tissue sections, preserving spatial context.

The second is the application of artificial intelligence in biomedical research, introduced through our new ongoing project, LymphoidStructureMiner, in collaboration with AI specialists from Danube Private University in Austria.

Through the combined power of these technologies, we aim to develop advanced analytical models to further unravel germinal center biology. Our ultimate goal is the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to enhance precision in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Anastasiia Marchuk: My name is Anastasiia Marchuk, and I represent TissueGnostics, a company headquartered in Vienna, Austria. We have been active in the field for over 20 years, specializing in whole slide imaging and image analysis. Our core focus is on a method we refer to as tissue cytometry, which involves detecting and phenotyping cells within their native tissue microenvironment.

The foundation of tissue cytometry is single-cell analysis, where individual cells—typically identified by nuclear staining—are detected and quantified. To define cell phenotypes, specific detection profiles are applied, allowing for quantification and characterization through spatial phenotyping. This process not only identifies cell types but also analyzes their spatial distribution within the tissue.

Tissue cytometry supports multicellular structure detection, enabling the analysis of anatomical features such as colon crypts, blood vessels, or glomeruli. It also facilitates the quantification of cellular pathogens and the detailed characterization of intracellular content.

We offer custom analysis solutions in the form of pre-configured, application-specific pipelines designed to address targeted research questions. For whole slide imaging, we provide TissueFAXS modular systems, which are fully automated platforms capable of processing immunofluorescence (IF) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained tissues or cells on glass slides, well plates, or tissue microarrays.

These systems are available in both upright and inverted configurations, with support for brightfield, fluorescence, or combined modalities, depending on research needs. Once a slide is placed and acquisition settings are selected, the automated system generates a fully digitized image, allowing researchers to focus on other tasks while the imaging is completed.

Anastasiia Marchuk: TissueGnostics provides flexible and powerful imaging solutions designed to support a wide range of research needs. Users can define their own analysis pipelines and customize imaging settings, which can be saved and reused to ensure consistency across experiments.

As a modular and fully automated system, we also offer configurations for confocal, multispectral, and automated slide loading, depending on specific requirements. One of our most advanced image analysis platforms is StrataQuest, which includes modules for single-cell analysis, multicellular structure detection, neighborhood analysis, and more. Researchers can develop and save custom analysis workflows and reuse data for future studies.

To illustrate, in one example involving colon tissue stained with several immune markers, nuclei are detected using DAPI staining, followed by immune cell phenotyping and colon crypt detection. A distance map is then generated, which supports neighborhood analysis—examining the spatial proximity of immune cells to epithelial structures. This type of analysis yields critical insights into both cell identity and spatial organization.

In the latest version of our software, we have integrated advanced visualization and data interpretation tools, including 3D diagrams, violin plots, and manifold learning techniques such as SONG, UMAP, and t-SNE plots—all accessible directly within the platform.

Looking ahead, we are preparing to launch Colubris next year, an all-in-one acquisition and analysis system. Colubris will feature real-time AI-assisted image analysis and data mining, and is specifically engineered to handle high-volume data, delivering comprehensive solutions for modern biomedical imaging needs.

Assoc. Prof. Diana Mechtcheriakova is the head of the research group Molecular Systems Biology and Pathophysiology at the Medical University of Vienna. Her research interests include development of systems biology approaches, AI-powered solutions, with major focus on B-cell biology, immuno-oncology, lymphoid structures in immunity and cancer with translational perspectives.

TissueGnostics (TG) is an Austrian company focusing on integrated solutions for high content and/or high throughput scanning and analysis of biomedical, veterinary, natural sciences, and technical microscopy samples.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Sources: Lyon to loan USMNT's Turner to Revs","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45869894/lyon-loan-usa-goalkeeper-matt-turner-new-england-revolution-sources","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 18:09:00 GMT","

Stewart Robson believes the USMNT might struggle at next year's World Cup after its poor performance in the Gold Cup final. (1:04)

United States men's national team and Lyon goalkeeper Matt Turner is poised to join the New England Revolution on loan through June 30, 2026, multiple sources confirmed to ESPN.

L'Equipe first reported news of the loan, while local New England outlet The Blazing Musket first reported New England's interest in Turner.

Turner, 31, will likely count as a Designated Player for the remainder of the 2025 season sources confirmed, though he will be eligible to not count as a DP for 2026. An official announcement could come before the end of this week, with a news conference happening as soon as Monday.

If the deal goes through as expected, it will conclude a bizarre journey over the last few months for the American keeper. Turner has been in desperate need of playing time at club level after having made just four appearances -- all in cup competitions -- while on loan with Crystal Palace last season from Nottingham Forest.

The lack of playing time saw him reduced to an understudy role for the USMNT at the recently concluded Gold Cup, behind New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese.

In a bid to turn his situation around, Turner initially secured a transfer to Lyon this past June for $9.1 million, sources said.

But in the upheaval in the club's ownership ranks as well as doubt over whether the club would be relegated to Ligue 2 due to financial issues, Lyon tried to back out of the deal and it was never officially announced.

Ultimately, Michelle Kang took over as president for John Textor, and Lyon successfully appealed to the Direction Nationale du Controle de Gestion (DNCG) -- which governs the finances of soccer teams in France -- to maintain its top-flight status.

But now it appears that Turner will return to MLS to New England with which he made his professional debut back in 2016.

The move will please U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, who earlier this summer said the starting goalkeeping job with the USMNT was ""open"" due to Turner's lack of playing time, and that he would be looking at other options.

""I think it's true that [Turner is] not playing and we were talking with him and we translate the idea that for the future, in one year time, I think he needs to find the way to compete every week,"" Pochettino said last month.

Turner seemingly came out of nowhere in terms of his rise through the professional ranks, beginning his career with the New England Revolution in 2016 after playing collegiately at Fairfield University.

By 2018, he was the starting goalkeeper for the Revs, and he was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year in 2021.

He moved to Arsenal in February of 2022, but a lack of playing time there saw him secure a move to Nottingham Forest the for the 2022-23 season.

Turner began the campaign as Forest's starting keeper, but a series of shaky performances saw him lose his spot in the lineup. The loan to Palace was secured in August of last year.

The Park Ridge, New Jersey, native made his international debut in 2021 and has gone on to make 52 appearances with the U.S., including four at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Gio Reyna has 'concrete' lifeline to save USMNT and soccer future","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/arsenal-parma-gio-reyna-usmnt-1302751","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 18:27:00 GMT","

With the FIFA World Cup less than 12 months away and a spot on the U.S. Men's National Team lineup having proven tough to come by under Mauricio Pochettino, Gio Reyna is on the lookout for a new team.

Largely a bit part player for Borussia Dortmund in recent seasons, the 22-year-old attacker is free to leave the Bundesliga giants, six years after joining from MLS side New York City FC's academy.

After being linked with a potential move back to the U.S., via Los Angeles FC, Italian side Parma emerged as a possible landing spot for the former Nottingham Forest loanee, although, according to USMNT legend Alexi Lalas, any side looking to bring Reyna in will need to be wary of the ""inherent risk"" he represents.

Currently under the leadership of former Arsenal assistant Carlos Cuesta, who replaced Christian Chivu after he departed to take charge of Inter Milan, the Serie A side represents “probably the most concrete at the moment” for Reyna, according to Fabrizio Romano.

“There are also other clubs calling, but Parma is very concrete,” he said on the Men In Blazers podcast. “They've already discussed with Borussia Dortmund over a €6 million package for Gio Reyna. I'm told the player is quite open to the move too, in Parma.

“In Parma is a very young coach in Carlos Cuesta who was the right hand [man] of Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, and he loves this sort of quality players. This is kind of the Arsenal mentality brought now to Italy as the Parma coach. Gio Reyna is a player he would love to have.

“Let's see what is going to happen here, because the negotiations are ongoing, still no agreement club to club, but I think there is a chance for this one to happen in August.”

Reyna would bring with him both talent and risk in arguably equal quantities. Having broken through at Dortmund at just 17, Reyna quickly cemented himself as a regular starter before injuries derailed his career, failing to find his footing under numerous different coaches in the following years.

An underwhelming loan spell in the Premier League in 2024 failed to spark life in his stuttering young career, as he returned to Germany to continue his role as an option off the bench.

This past season, Reyna played just 627 minutes across all competitions, scoring two goals and providing a single assist. At the recent Club World Cup, which was held in the U.S., and meant he was unable to represent the USMNT at the CONCACAF Gold Cup, he made just one appearance off the bench in their 1-0 group stage finale against Ulsan HD.

As for his aforementioned international career, Reyna has appeared just once since Pochettino's appointment in September, coming off the bench in their 2-1 Nations League third-place play-off defeat to Canada in March.

His next opportunity to impress Pochettino will come in September when the U.S. hosts South Korea and Japan in back-to-back friendlies, before Ecuador and Australia also make their way Stateside the following month.

Congratulations Pouring In For Women's Tennis Player Genie Bouchard originally appeared on The Spun.

Prior to the start of this year's National Bank Open, former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard announced that she'd retire once her run in Montreal comes to an end.

Bouchard sent the home crowd into a frenzy on Monday, defeating Emiliana Arango 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 in the first round. That victory set up a showdown with No. 17 seed Belinda Bencic, who is coming off a semifinal run at Wimbledon.

The former world No. 5 played some of her best tennis on Wednesday night, but it wasn't enough to defeat Bencic. Following her career-ending loss, Bouchard delivered a heartfelt message to the Montreal crowd.

""I think it's so special to play my last match here in Montreal on this court in front of you guys,"" Bouchard said. ""I remember being a little kid sitting in these stands, hoping and dreaming that I can play on this court one day. … It feels like such a full circle moment to finish my career here.

""Tennis has given me so much. I'm filled with so much gratitude for this sport and the people along the way.""

Immediately after Bouchard lost a three-set thriller to Bencic, tennis fans celebrated the 31-year-old Canadian's career.

""Genie Bouchard was the first Canadian to reach a Grand Slam singles final - paving the way for Milos, Bianca, and Leylah,"" Bastien Fachan wrote on X. ""She was huge in popularizing tennis in Canada, and she was a bona fide star of the sport in the 2010s. I'm gonna miss her on tour. Salut.""

""Thank you Genie. Loved watching you play,"" Emma Raducanu said.

""Congrats on a great career and inspiring us all Canadians wishing you all the best for what's next,"" former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu added.

""Great career @geniebouchard,"" Nick Kyrgios wrote on X. ""Enjoy whatever is next.""

""One of the best Canadian players of all time. The first Canadian player, male or female, to reach a Grand Slam singles final. She left her mark on this sport and paved the way for so many other young Canadians to chase after their dreams. The way she played tonight was incredible & took you right back to when she was at her best. Once just a young girl from Montreal dreaming of becoming a professional tennis player. Today, she ends it where it all began. Congratulations on an incredible career, Genie,"" a social media user added.

Bouchard finished her career with one singles title and a lifetime of memories.

We wish Bouchard all the best as she enters the next chapter of her life.

Alex de Minaur picked up his first title of the season last time out, as he began his US Open preparations.

Travelling to DC, De Minaur defeated Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in a three-set thriller to clinch the Washington Open title.

The title was De Minaur's 10th of his career, as the Australian returned to the top ten following the tournament.

Carrying that momentum forward to the Canadian Open, De Minaur eased into the third round with a straight-sets win over Francisco Comesana.

Playing some of the best tennis of his ATP Tour career, De Minaur will no doubt be hoping to make a deep run in New York next month.

Assessing his US Open chances, one former Aussie tennis star has said what will need to happen for De Minaur to win the title at Flushing Meadows.

During the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', 2020 Australian Open doubles finalist Luke Saville responded when asked if De Minaur can win the US Open.

“It is definitely tough,” he said.

“I think I saw a clip the other day that he just keeps rocking up, every Grand Slam, and he is making the fourth round, quarterfinal.

“I think if we are honest, we probably just need a little bit of a draw opening because those top two [Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz], especially, are pretty unreal right now, and if they keep going, he has to beat both of them to win a Slam.

“It is difficult, to say the least.

“So we need a little bit of love, but he is definitely showing up at every Grand Slam and getting into that second week consistently, so it's great to see.”

De Minaur certainly won't be the favorite to win the US Open, but could well enter the tournament as a ‘dark horse', having picked up several good results at the event over the years.

The 26-year-old has won more matches at the Australian Open and US Open (18) than at any other Grand Slam event.

On two occasions, De Minaur has qualified for the quarterfinals in New York, and he'll likely be a contender to reach a third in 2025.

Entering his fourth US Open tournament in 2020, De Minaur qualified for his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, picking up four impressive wins en route to the last 16.

Looking to advance to the semifinals, De Minaur took on Austria's Dominic Thiem, but came up short, losing out to the eventual champion in straight sets, 1-6, 2-6, 4-6.

Returning to the US Open quarterfinals four years later, De Minaur met British star Jack Draper.

Unfortunately for De Minaur, injury issues prevented him from playing his best tennis on Arthur Ashe Stadium as he fell in straight sets.

He'll be hoping for a better showing this time around, and could be well placed to do so if he can maintain his current level.

There's still work to be done before he heads to New York, however, as De Minaur prepares for his Canadian Open third-round clash with his countryman Christopher O'Connell on Friday, August 1.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Alex Michelsen earned his second Top 10 win on Thursday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, where he upset World No. 6 Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 to reach the fourth round at an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time.

The 20-year-old American lost the first set and was being outplayed by the dynamic Italian for the first 90 minutes of action on Centre Court. However, Michelsen began to land bigger blows off the forehand wing to trouble Musetti, who also coughed up 16 unforced errors in the third set.

""I am a big guy, I have got to play offensive tennis,"" Michelsen said. ""Especially today, you can't give a guy like Lorenzo time to bully you around from the baseline, so I was trying to bully him around and I think in the second and third sets I did a really good job.

Michelsen squandered two match points on the Musetti serve at 3-5 and then blew a 40/0 lead on his own serve, with the Italian saving the final match point in that run with a scorching backhand winner. However, the World No. 34 stayed composed, saving two break points before sealing victory on his seventh match point.

With his two-hour, 32-minute win, Michelsen improved his Top 10 record to 2-6, having defeated the then-No. 9 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Alex de Minaur in Los Cabos last season. Into the fourth round, the 26th seed Michelsen will next meet #NextGenATP American Learner Tien or Reilly Opelka.

""The first time in the fourth round feels really good. I have put a lot of hard work in and it is finally starting to pay off a little bit. I was wondering when it would happen and I guess it is starting to happen right now,"" Michelsen said. ""I returned really, really well today.""

Musetti has earned more Masters 1000 wins than anyone else on Tour this year (17), highlighted by his final run in Monte-Carlo. The third-seeded Italian was not at his best against Michelsen, though, and has now lost three of his past four matches following his semi-final showing at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Musetti is currently sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is aiming to make his debut on home soil at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. The 23-year-old will look to rediscover the winning formula in Cincinnati in August.
In other early action, Karen Khachanov downed American qualifier Emilio Nava 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-1 in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting to reach the fourth round at a Masters 1000 event for the second time this year. The 29-year-old, who is 10-1 against players outside the Top 20 this season, will next face Casper Ruud or Nuno Borges.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Jolyon Palmer dissects Lewis Hamilton's topsy-turvy weekend in Belgium, which gave signs of more positive things to come.

Lewis Hamilton was extremely downbeat throughout Friday and Saturday in Belgium having exited both Qualifying sessions at the first hurdle, before his starring cameo launched him up the field in the wet phase of the Grand Prix to an eventual P7 finish.

But, actually, this wasn't as disastrous a weekend as it might have seemed on the outside for Lewis.

His Qualifying performances were what left him understandably disheartened, failing to make the second part of Qualifying for either the Sprint or Qualifying proper. This – at a circuit he's had a lot of success, including winning last year and on the back of a more encouraging run recently – was a set back, but it's not necessarily the shocker it looks.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Formula 1 heads to Budapest with plenty to look forward to in the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix.

The trip to Hungary marks not only the end of a double-header of races, but also the first part  of the season as teams face a mandatory two-week shutdown during August. With a break ahead, there's still plenty at stake during this weekend's race in Budapest.

Oscar Piastri arrives at the venue of his first victory in Formula 1 with a 16-point advantage over McLaren team mate Lando Norris, following the Australian's win at Spa-Francorchamps on Sunday.

That was Piastri's first win in four races, and a strong response to Norris' back-to-back successes in Austria and Great Britain. Piastri was quick on both occasions, but had seen his main title rival cut the gap between the pair to single figures in the championship battle.

As the final race before the summer break, it sometimes feels like there is a tiny bit of added significance to a result that will be the lasting outcome until the end of August, but Hungary this weekend really does offer an opportunity for the two McLaren drivers to leave with different outlooks over the shutdown.

Should Piastri secure another victory, he will move at least 23 points clear of Norris – almost an entire race win – and take real momentum into the break. But for Norris, he can quickly change that impression if he's able to hit back with a win of his own, which would reduce the deficit to nine points at most.

It's a title battle that looks set to ebb and flow throughout the rest of the season, but the outcome of the latest instalment will hold for just a little longer than usual.

Much of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend was extremely disappointing for Lewis Hamilton, as he struggled to get to grips with an upgraded Ferrari and suffered two early exits from the qualifying sessions.

A spin in Sprint Qualifying was attributed in part to settings on an upgraded component, while Hamilton exceeded track limits in Q1 on Saturday and lost his best lap time to be eliminated.

The seven-time World Champion fought back impressively in Sunday's race, though, making a number of thrilling overtakes in the first part of the race before timing his pit stop perfectly to climb from the pit lane to finish seventh. Hamilton said afterwards that he felt he was making progress with the new Ferrari parts – including a new rear suspension – and starting to fine-tune it over the weekend.

With a chance to build on that immediately in Budapest, Hamilton and Ferrari could be on for a strong performance, as Charles Leclerc showed the potential of the updated car with his podium at Spa-Francorchamps.

Both Leclerc and Team Principal Fred Vasseur referenced how the team was getting more out of its new set-up with each session, which bodes well for the next race.

While Hamilton was able to fight back and score points from his pit lane starting position on Sunday, the same can't be said of the driver who replaced him at Mercedes.

Kimi Antonelli endured a tough weekend, also dropping out in the first part of Qualifying on both occasions, and only being able to recover to 16th place in the race, although he did also score the fastest lap.

The Italian says he has been struggling for confidence in recent races, and really felt it on Saturday in Belgium. But, like Hamilton, there were also more positive signs during the race itself. Antonelli had a higher-downforce wing on and felt he could rebuild some of that confidence during the race, even if he couldn't always show his improved pace because of the straight line speed deficit it left him with.

At the final weekend before the break, the 18-year-old says he wants to target an improvement in Qualifying to allow him to run nearer the front and utilise better race pace more effectively, and the usual format of three practice sessions should offer him a chance to find his rhythm.

The second seat alongside Pierre Gasly at Alpine has been a tricky place to be so far this season, with Jack Doohan occupying it for the first six rounds of the year before being replaced by Franco Colapinto.

Both drivers have failed to score so far – each has a best finish of 13th place – while Gasly has picked up all 20 of Alpine's points. After a strong top-six result in Silverstone, the Frenchman made it back-to-back point-scoring results at Spa with P10.

Executive director Flavio Briatore showed he wasn't afraid to make a change before the start of the European season, and similarly suggested that Colapinto would keep the seat for as long as he is performing, but a further change could come if he struggles.

The Alpine is clearly not the most competitive car this season, but the team are at risk of slipping further adrift at the bottom of the standings if only one driver is scoring points, so Colapinto knows he needs cleaner weekends to cement his place.

Budapest is a track that the Argentine goes well at, having been on the podium twice in his junior career, and a more competitive outing would allow him to enjoy the shutdown with a little bit more confidence that his seat is safe.

If you watched any coverage of last year's Hungarian Grand Prix, you are set to notice some major differences to the circuit this time around.

Those changes do not relay to the track layout itself – meaning drivers will face the same test as they have in the past – but the pit straight will look markedly different thanks to some impressive work over the past 12 months.

Since that last race at the Hungaroring, the circuit has torn down both the pit building and the main grandstand that sat opposite, and have replaced both with state-of-the-art new facilities.

Despite having to work through the winter, a new, modern pit building and garages have been completed that will give teams and race organisers more space to work in, while the large new main grandstand offers an impressive view of the action on the pit straight.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

The weather forecast is in ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix from the Hungaroring in Budapest.

Hungary will host the final race of the first part of the F1 season, with Round 14 coming from the Hungaroring in Budapest. After two wet-dry races at Silverstone and Spa, will the sun shine on the drivers this time around?

It is often hot at the Hungaroing and, as things stand, it looks like warm temperatures could again be on the cards for this year's event.

However, the forecast currently suggests that there may be cloudy conditions in store as the weekend progresses, as well as a possibility of rain.

Last year's race threw up plenty of drama, with an intra-team fight at McLaren dominating the headlines. In the end, Oscar Piastri won the Grand Prix for his maiden victory, finishing ahead of team mate Lando Norris.

Those two look set to dual once again, with both citing this as a track they enjoy racing at. But does the weather favour one driver more than the other, and if it is hot, will that hamper or help their competitors?

Scroll down for a more detailed look at the forecast for the weekend.

FRIDAY, AUGUST 01 – FP1 AND FP2
Conditions: Mainly sunny and likely dry day expected. Still a slight chance of one shower in the afternoon under a cloudier sky. Light westerly wind with gusts up to 30 kph. FP1: 28°C // FP2: 28°C
Maximum temperature expected: 28 Celsius
Minimum temperature expected: 16 Celsius
Chance of rain: <20%

SATURDAY, AUGUST 02 – FP3 AND QUALIFYING
Conditions: Sunny at first becoming cloudier and unsettled from the afternoon. Gradually increasing chance of showers up to level 3 from noon. Light southwesterly wind in the morning veering westerly in the afternoon. FP3: 27°C // Q: 28°C
Maximum temperature expected: 28 Celsius
Minimum temperature expected: 16 Celsius
Chance of rain: 20%

SUNDAY, AUGUST 03 – RACE
Conditions: High chance of rain the night before. Mostly cloudy day with a moderate to high chance of rain in the morning decreasing a bit for the race (30%). At this range, the confidence in the forecast is low. Light northwesterly wind. Race start: 27°C
Maximum temperature expected: 27 Celsius
Minimum temperature expected: 17 Celsius
Chance of rain: 60%

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

There are plenty of talking points ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the F1 TV crew here to run through them all.

Formula 1 returns this weekend for the Hungarian Grand Prix and despite a three-week summer break beckoning, there were plenty of talking points from the paddock on Thursday.

The most pivotal was Max Verstappen confirming he would remain with Red Bull for 2026 after months of speculation that he might jump across to Mercedes.

Also confirmed as staying put for next season is Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur, with drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton thrilled by the news.

The title battle between McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris looks set to rage again this weekend in Budapest, with the former confident in his abilities to claim his maiden Drivers' Championship after victory last time out in Belgium.

Join Nicki Shields, Ruth Buscombe, James Hinchcliffe and Lawrence Barretto on Weekend Warm-Up for all the talking points ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

McLaren is chasing its 200th Formula 1 Grand Prix victory this weekend in Hungary.

Lando Norris is determined to write his name in the history books by clinching McLaren's 200th Formula 1 Grand Prix victory in Hungary this weekend.

On Sunday, 9 June 1968, at Spa-Francorchamps, Bruce McLaren stood on the top step of the podium for the first time for his eponymous team. Since then, a rollcall that sounds more like a list of F1 legends than simply McLaren drivers have added a further 198 successes.

Denny Hulme followed the team founder, winning on six occasions, with Emerson Fittipaldi (5), James Hunt (9), Ayrton Senna (35), Alain Prost (30), Mika Hakkinen (20), and Lewis Hamilton (21) among the standout performers for the Woking-based squad.

Like team mate and championship rival Oscar Piastri, Norris' personal tally for the team stands at eight, but the battle to reach nine has an added tinge of significance.

“I would like to be, yeah,” said Norris when asked about his desire to be the driver to clinch the milestone result. “Of course, you always want to be whatever number you can be, but 200 is a big achievement for the team.”

Explaining his pride at representing the team, he added: “When you look at the history of who has been in McLaren, the drivers, the championships that have been won, all of these things, then it's always been an honour for me to be a part of McLaren.

“I'm lucky to have been part of McLaren since I joined Formula 1. It's special. I think it's something I'll look back on in many years and be very proud of. It's an amazing team.

“We've improved a lot over the years, and it's nice that we can start these cool stats again and we can make some history, and add to what McLaren was once achieving many years ago.

“It's special, but of course, the number 200 is even more special, and that's something I would like to be.”

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

The Hungarian Grand Prix is no stranger to chaos, strategy curveballs, and unexpected standout performances. So, who's set to thrive in Budapest, and which drivers could quietly rack up points while others struggle? Let's take a closer look.

Known as “Monaco without the walls”, this tight and twisty circuit makes the Hungaroring one of the more technical weekends on the calendar. With overtaking hard to come by, our F1 Fantasy Strategist will help guide you towards the smart picks – those that are strong qualifiers and expected to perform well in the slower-speed corners.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Don't forget, the McLaren mini league is still open to enter a team until the Hungarian Grand Prix too. There are exciting new prizes on offer, which includes the winner receiving a tour of McLaren Plus Technology Centre for two guests and gift bag with a signed cap from drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Keep your eyes peeled for other exciting mini leagues opening later in the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more opportunities to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that will aid you in succeeding in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

The Hungarian Grand Prix puts a premium on Qualifying, driver skill, and tyre management. At a track that is in the bottom half for total overtakes among all circuits over the last two years, prioritising those drivers that have a reputation for performing well on Saturday is essential.

Catch up on the Spa highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying starts on Saturday, August 2 at 1600 local time (1400 UTC).

Max Verstappen may not be the first name on everyone's mind when it comes to premium-priced assets in F1 Fantasy, but his single-lap performance speaks for itself.

The Dutchman has the equal-highest number of pole positions (four) in 2025, tied with the McLaren duo of Lando Norris ($31.1m) and Oscar Piastri ($26.1m).

His average finishing position (2.3) in Budapest in the last three seasons is the highest of all drivers on the grid over this period of time.

For a differential premium asset that will defend like a lion, look no further than Verstappen.

Alex Albon was back to his best in Belgium, recording his best result (P6) since Imola on his way to 14 F1 Fantasy points.

The Williams racer averages 13 game points over the last two race weekends and requires exactly that score to attain a $0.6m price rise in Budapest.

The Thai driver recorded his best Qualifying result of the season (P5) last time out and has made it to Q3 eight times this season.

Albon has finished in the top-10 in nine out of the 10 Grands Prix he has completed this season, and has the best average Qualifying record among those priced under $16.5m – exceptional omens at a track such as the Hungaroring.

Nico Hulkenberg may not be the strongest qualifier on the grid this season but is a safe pair of hands at a challenging circuit.

His weekend average of 23.8 F1 Fantasy points over the last five races is good for third among all drivers.

However, what is most compelling about Hulkenberg is that he needs to score greater than -19 F1 Fantasy points in Hungary, thanks to his heroics in Silverstone still factoring into his three-race rolling average for one more weekend.

The German is very likely to gain $0.6m in Budapest, which makes him an intriguing asset to build budget.

The Hungarian Grand Prix may be a weekend where many drivers under $18m lose $0.6m in value given the limited opportunities to overtake and score points in F1 Fantasy – enter Gabriel Bortoleto.

The rookie both qualified and finished inside the top-10 in Austria and Belgium and is building more confidence with each passing weekend.

Although the Brazilian may lose $0.2m from his value in Hungary, he should be well set up to rise $0.6m after the summer break once his Silverstone retirement falls off his trailing average.

For lower-budget teams, Bortoleto is enticing as a longer-term hold.

Liam Lawson has had a mixed last few race weekends but has bottomed out at $4.5m – the price floor in F1 Fantasy.

Despite his retirements in Canada and Silverstone, the New Zealander averages 9.5 fantasy points in the four most recent races that he has seen the chequered flag.

Across the last three race weekends, the Racing Bulls driver has the seventh-best Qualifying record on the entire grid and has three top-10 finishes in his last six Grand Prix outings.

As a $4.5m asset who cannot lose any additional value in Budapest, Lawson is on the bubble as an asset to own this week.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Lando Norris

At a circuit where a strong result in Qualifying is imperative, McLaren has that potential in spades.

Since Imola, both drivers have qualified inside the top three in every race weekend except one (Norris – P7, Canada).

In addition, the impressive joint Qualifying performances across the season mean that McLaren have scored all 130 of the available Qualifying teamwork points on offer so far this season (a maximum of 10 points is awarded to teams each weekend when both drivers make it into Q3).

Piastri and Norris have taken pole position four times apiece this season, and it is widely expected one of them to repeat this on Saturday.

Red Bull arrive on the Strategist's radar this weekend after a 55-point showing in Spa – their best F1 Fantasy score since Imola.

For the second weekend running, the Milton Keynes outfit set the fastest pit stop time, accruing 15 points each in Great Britain and Belgium for their performances in the pit box.

Spa was also the first Qualifying session since Miami that both Max Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda appeared in Q3, good for an extra 10 fantasy points.

The momentum Red Bull currently have amongst the premium Teams in F1 Fantasy puts them in good stead for the trip to Budapest.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Mercedes

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the earlier sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

Norris 'in a better place' now after 'pretty average' start to the season

Hamilton coming from 'a better starting point' ahead of Hungarian GP

Yuki Tsunoda's future at Red Bull is far from assured, but the Japanese racer's performance in Spa offered some encouraging signs.

""I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong to be honest. I have to look harder. It's really, really hard to find the reason for what I'm doing so wrong to drive this slow.""

That was Yuki Tsunoda after he finished last in the Austrian Grand Prix earlier this month. Up until that point, the Japanese racer had shown flashes of pace, like his P6 in the Miami Sprint, but his best finish for Red Bull in a Grand Prix  since stepping in for Liam Lawson from Suzuka onwards is P9.

In that same period, his team mate and reigning world champion Max Verstappen had secured two wins and two second places.

Sources say Strong could portray Mark Zuckerberg, replacing Jesse Eisenberg who played the Facebook CEO in the 2010 movie.



		By Borys Kit, Mia Galuppo 

	July 31, 2025 9:47am	




	Add Jeremy Strong to the list of bold-faced names circling Aaron Sorkin's The Social Network Part II.


	Sorkin, who won an Academy Award for penning the 2010 original movie, wrote the script and will direct the Sony drama that is inspired by a series of articles Jeff Horwitz wrote for The Wall Street Journal known as The Facebook Files.




	Strong joins Mikey Madison and Jeremy Allen White as the select few master thespians who have been meeting with Sorkin as he packages a cast and budget that he will then show to the studio for final approval.

	Insiders stress that no offers have been made and that the film is still in the development process, although the project is a top priority for the studio and moving fast.

	While the acclaimed 2010 drama focused on the making of the Facebook, now known as Meta, the story of the new feature will focus on how the company's own reporting pointed to the negative effects the company's social media was having on teens and kids, how it knew misinformation was proliferating and causing violence, and how it contributed to the coup attempt of Jan. 6, 2021.


	If offers and, indeed, dealmaking closes, Madison would play Frances Haugen, the data engineer-turned-whistleblower who went to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Wall Street Journal with her information. White would play the former WSJ tech reporter who leads the breaking of the Facebook files.

	











	The big question is who could Strong be playing. Sources say there is a role for a WSJ editor, but the other option is a doozy: Facebook/Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.


	One source said that Jesse Eisenberg, who earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Zuckerberg has passed, at least at this time, on reprising the part. Whether that is a negotiating tactic or not remains to be seen.


	Sony had no comment.  


	Sorkin, Todd Black, Peter Rice, and Stuart Besser are producing the sequel.


	One source said the project would have shades of The Insider, the 1999 movie from Michael Mann that told of a whistleblower blowing the lid off the tobacco industry by talking to 60 Minutes. Another source offered comparisons to Spotlight, the 2015 movie that centered on reporters from the Boston Globe investigating child sex abuse by the city's Roman Catholic clergy.


	A winner of Tony and Emmy awards, Strong may be best known for his work on HBO's critical darling Succession, where he played the eldest son of Logan Roy, the patriarch of the Murdoch-like family played by Brian Cox. He previously worked with Sorkin on Netflix's The Trial of the Chicago 7 in which he played anti-war leader Jerry Rubin.


	Last year, Strong portrayed as Donald Trump mentor Roy Cohn in The Apprentice, a performance that netted him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.

The comic and content creator debuted the popular podcast in 2023 and interviewed Drake, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Cuban, Offset, Shaquille O'Neal and Charlie Puth, among others.

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Bobbi Althoff has signed off from The Really Good Podcast.


	Her latest episode, which dropped on Thursday, had the comedian and content creator, dressed in dark glasses and funeral black, kicking off with the solemn announcement: “All right guys, I don't really think there's any good way to say this. But this is the last episode of The Really Good Podcast.”




	Her podcast debuted in April 2023 and included interviews with Scarlett Johansson, Mark Cuban, Offset, Shaquille O'Neal and Charlie Puth. “It has been a dream, every second of it,” Althoff added in her last episode and as ever with deadpan delivery as she struggled to be upbeat.

	During her final episode, Althoff offered her own rendition of Leonard Cohen's “Hallelujah” and recalled highlights of the podcast during its two and a half years run. The Really Good Podcast gained notoriety when Althoff interviewed Drake in July of 2023.

	Althoff and her podcast drew comparisons to Zach Galifianakis' Between Two Ferns and Amelia Dimoldenberg's Chicken Shop Date due to putting guests in awkward positions. 


	Althoff launched the popular podcast after establishing herself on TikTok in 2021, with her videos showcasing her dry persona and humor. She eventually got to 8.2 million followers on TikTok and 3.9 million on Instagram. 

	











	Althoff is also working on a new TV comedy series, after striking a development deal to produce, write and star in the show. She is repped by 3 Arts.

The performance took place at the Changing of the Guards ceremony outside of Buckingham Palace.

	Charles III might be the King of England, but Ozzy Osbourne will always be the Prince of Darkness. And in honor of the rock legend's life and legacy following his death July 22, the Royal Family's official army band put its own spin on one of Black Sabbath‘s biggest hits.


	In a video filmed during a recent Changing of the Guard ceremony, the red-uniformed musicians stand in an arc outside of Buckingham Palace. With a conductor keeping time, the brass and woodwind instrumentalists play the melody of “Paranoid” — which reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1970 — over the sound of brash snare drums.

	











	The tribute comes after Osbourne died at the age of 76 just weeks after playing his final concert, as announced in a joint statement from his family. “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” it read. “He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	In the days since, posts honoring the icon have flooded social media, including condolences penned by all of his former Black Sabbath bandmates. On Wednesday (July 30), Osbourne's funeral procession took place in his home city of Birmingham, England, where fans lined the streets to pay tribute. His wife, Sharon, and his children Aimeé, Kelly and Jack laid flowers on the Black Sabbath bridge, which was adorned with countless other offerings from mourners.


	Charles has been putting the army band to good use since he took the throne in May 2023 following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Earlier in July, for instance, the ensemble performed Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” in honor of Pride.


	The performances align with the king's love of music, which he showcased earlier this year with the launch of his Apple Music radio show, The King's Music Room. “Throughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me,” he said in a March statement. “It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories, comfort us in times of sadness and take us to distant places. But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration.”

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


	A day after announcing that she wouldn't be running for California Governor, Kamala Harris is heading back to late-night.


	The former Vice President will appear on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight (Thursday July 31). It marks her first interview since the 2024 Presidential election.


	Harris' last visit to the Ed Sullivan Theater was on Tuesday October 8, 2024, just ahead of the election, which she lost to President Donald Trump.


	The former Veep also announced earlier today that she was writing a book – 107 Days – about her campaign for the presidency.




			Watch on Deadline		







	It's interesting timing for Colbert, whose show was unceremoniously canceled by CBS earlier this month. CBS said it was purely for financial reasons, but there has also been the specter of Trump, whose lawsuit The Late Show's parent company Paramount Global settled in order to get its deal with Skydance over the line.

	











	Last time she was at The Late Show she shared a Miller High Life with the host, while also noting that Trump “openly admires dictators and authoritarians”.


	It marks her eighth appearance on The Late Show, having first sat down with Colbert in April 2018.


The Late Show is produced by The Late Show Inc. and CBS Studios in association with Spartina Productions with Colbert, Tom Purcell and Jon Stewart as exec producers.

if Colbert had any balls at all he'd have some right wing guests on.

If the goal is to go out with a zero rating….well done

This is shameless. She all but abandoned the American people after losing the presidency to a vile autocrat who has spent all his time since making life miserable for all decent human beings, and now she conveniently pops up with a book to sell. It's gross and needs to be called out. This is a prime example of why Democrats don't trust their own leadership anymore.

Ummmm… I'm not miserable! And most Americans are not, either!

Can't wait to see her beautiful face that inspired so many of us with hope and joy! It will be a wonderful sight after having to watch and listen to that guy in the White House every second of every day for the past six months.

Turn off the TV. Don't watch politics videos on the Internet. You're welcome.

LOL. Enjoy the next 3 1/2 years.

I say this as a democrat — Kamala: go away. And stay away.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	CBS' The Late Show franchise lasted 33 years, but Bobbi Althoff‘s absurdist The Really Good Podcast is signing off after 2 1/2 years. 


	And, no, costs aren't to blame, nor are anti-Trump jokes. Rather, Althoff has simply decided to pull the plug.


	Althoff, who started as a vlogger on TikTok providing advice to new moms, made a 180-degree turn to doing sit-downs with prolific guests on The Really Good Podcast including Jimmy Kimmel, Shaquille O'Neal, Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Alba, Jason Derulo, Meghan Trainor, Mark Cuban, Offset, Peso Pluma, Michael Cera and more. Her deadpan-uncomfortable Valley Girl shtick had her asking fearless questions that made her guests bristle. Often, part of the bit was being rather clueless of her guests' feats.

	











	Her interview with Drake, conducted in his bed, put her on the map. Overall, that episode racked up 1 billion views and 300 million likes. The media was baffled as to how she landed the interview; Althoff has insisted that like she simply reached out to Drake on social media with her request.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Althoff didn't have any stupid pet tricks like David Letterman, but she'd engage in myriad activities, i.e., painting and arguing with Office star Rainn Wilson, getting sass lessons from social media influencer Ari the Don, and playing tennis with stand-up Bobby Lee. There was also the time she quizzed Nick Cannon on the names of his 12 children — and he failed.


	There were also some clever ad-supported stunts: In a clever promotion for L'Oreal's CeraVe, she had Barbie and Arrested Development star Cera on her podcast, claiming he was the architect of the skin care line. It was all a paid stunt that Althoff unveiled at SXSW 2024.

	











	“Guys, I don't think there's any really good way to say this, but this is the last episode of The Really Good Podcast,” Althoff, clad in black funeral dress, said today at the beginning of the podcast. “I think I should take my glasses off to say it, too.”


	Althoff, standing next to her sister Lexi, her Harpo Marx if you will in her online shenanigans, then launched in to an out-of-tune rendition of Leonard Cohen's “Hallelujah.”


The Really Good Podcast regularly topped podcast charts and, in 2024, won Best Emerging Podcast at the iHeart Podcast Awards. Drawing comparisons to Zach Galifianakis' Between Two Ferns, the podcast put Althoff on the map as a comedic talent to watch. In 2024, she inked an exclusive distribution, ad sales and marketing agreement for the podcast with global media company Studio71.


	“This podcast started off with just a girl with a dream to make more money,” Althoff says, reflecting on its unlikely rise. “I'm proud of the accomplishments I've had … It has been a dream, every second of it.”


	We've reached out to find out what's next for Althoff. In the meantime, you can find her on Instagram and TikTok, with reruns of the podcast on YouTube.


	Here's the farewell episode:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Mikey Madison, Jeremy Allen White reportedly in the mix for The Social Network Part II","https://www.avclub.com/the-social-network-ii-mikey-madison-jeremy-allen-white","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:34:00 GMT","

[Update, July 31 at 2 pm ET]: The Hollywood Reporter now suggests that Jesse Eisenberg will not return for play Mark Zuckerberg again, and that Jeremy Strong is eyed to replace him. Again, Sony declined to comment, and the movie will likely not be officially greenlit until Aaron Sorkin finishing assembling the primary cast.

[Original story:] 15 years ago, The Social Network was led by two up-and-coming actors whose biggest credits up until that point were Zombieland and being cut out of The Other Boleyn Girl and a pop star making a push toward legitimate acting. Now, in 2025, its sequel is attracting the most recent—and first gen Z—Best Actress winner and the lead of perhaps the most awarded series of the decade. Perhaps the real Facebook has only dropped in esteem in the past decade and a half, but an Aaron Sorkin-directed sequel about the tech company's troubles is still a prospect that can attract top talent. 

This is per Variety, which reports that Mikey Madison and Jeremy Allen White “are circling the lead roles” for the follow-up to The Social Network. No word yet on whether Jesse Eisenberg will return to play Mark Zuckerberg, but fear not—White is not in the running to replace him. Deadline reports that White would “ideally” portray Jeff Horowitz, who wrote “The Facebook Files” in The Wall Street Journal and which the sequel will be based upon. Madison would likely portray the whistle-blower behind the articles., Frances Haugen. The articles highlighted the social network's detrimental effects on teens (Meta also owns the self-comparison machine Instagram) and its knowing dissemination of misinformation.

Both trades are very careful to note that no formal offers have yet been made, and the movie itself has not even been officially greenlit yet. But if Sony needed any more proof of interest before they give Sorkin the go-ahead, having Madison and White's attention certainly can't hurt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Villagers reap what they sow in the compellingly metaphorical Harvest","https://www.avclub.com/harvest-review","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

“He means to throw a halter around our lives,” whispers a Scottish villager to Walter (Caleb Landry Jones), a close friend of the local ruler, Master Kent (Harry Melling). The small community of gleaners are celebrating their harvest, feasting on the fruits of their labors as a new way of life encroaches in on them. While the peasants are all “goat drunk and lecherous,” the Master proposes his plan to shift the village's production from diverse agriculture and livestock cultivation to primarily producing sheep's wool in order to earn greater profit. While Master Kent's pitch has a certain democratic benevolence to it, engaging in profit sharing for those who labor on the land, it would fundamentally change everyone's way of life. Unbeknownst to them, this change is not optional, and out of the darkness of the loch a small boat emerges carrying with it people already displaced by this strange new world of maps, fences, and optimization. 

Adapted from the novel by Jim Crace, Greek filmmaker Athina Rachel Tsangari‘s Harvest is her most stylistically ambitious film since her debut The Slow Business Of Going, rendering the anarchic and naturalistic rhythms of rural feudal life into a meditation on the displacement of culture. Shot on what feels like living, breathing 16mm film by the typically textured Sean Price Williams, Harvest is a film where the people are shaped by the land even more than they would willingly shape it back. 

The film opens with Jones' freckled hands picking up a bug from dense layers of grass, gently observing in it the sunlight as the audience in turn observes the dirt under his fingernails. Jones runs his hands along the moss on a branch, biting into the bark and fingering a tree hollow before sticking his tongue in. It is at once a base defilement and a simple curiosity by one of the land's stewards. It suggests the contradiction at the heart of Harvest: The people of the village both have a reverence for their way of life, and an impulsiveness which will not help them to maintain it.

The inciting incident comes from a barn, which burns after an apparent theft of the Master's doves. Walter immediately knows that it is a particular group of hooligans who have caused the arson, although none are willing to come forward and take responsibility. When a group of displaced vagrants are discovered on the edges of the village, they are immediately blamed, with the men thrown in stockades and the woman having her hair cut as punishment. 

The village is genuinely threatened by forces outside of it, yet they have mistaken where it is coming from and placed their fears onto outsiders. More dangerous to them is someone who at first seems benign: Mr. Earle (Arinzé Kene), or “Quill” as the villagers call him because of his constant scribbling. Quill is a cartographer, hired by Master Kent to chart the landscape. Quill's curiosity matches that of Walter's, making them fast friends but also foils—while Walter tends to the land out of love, Quill maps it, and in doing so makes a physical space subject to new ideas of borders. The villagers themselves have a concept of their own boundaries, even hitting children's heads upon their border stones in order to hammer in the idea of where they are from, but these are not the same as the modern fences that will come with things like inclosure acts, cutting off the continuity of the landscape and delineating their homes not as places to merely reap and sow but as strict property. “Your account of our land is not as honest as you hoped,” Walter tells Quill. “You flattened us.”

Straddling the line of history and a feeling of surreal atemporality, Tsangari's film is particularly striking in 2025, calling to mind current crises of immigration still derived from imperialism-driven political unrest back at home, or the colonial displacement of Palestinians by Israeli landgrabs which have culminated in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Harvest is a film about capitalism, at first quietly and then like a blunt object to the skull. Simmering beneath that ultimate disruption, though, is a sense of communal collapse that is already creeping under everything. 

This is what makes Harvest more abstract than a simple metaphor for current events, and turns the film into what Tsangari has called a “fable, almost a children's spooky story, about being passive and gullible observers to all this catastrophe that's going on around us.” This point will likely (sadly) maintain the film's prescience well into the future—before the community resigned to its outside forces, it had already stopped stewarding itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Platonic returns with an amusing and breezy season 2","https://www.avclub.com/platonic-season-2-review-apple-tv","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Platonic‘s title suggests that the main theme it tackles is whether men and women can just be friends. Various characters on the show often broach the subject, too. However, at the heart of Apple TV+'s comedy lies a far more interesting dilemma: Is nostalgia enough to keep a companionship—this one happens to be between a man and a woman—thriving for people in their early forties who yearn for youth and dread growing old? Series co-creators (and husband-wife duo) Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco have an affinity for this topic, as seen in their previous midlife crisis show, Netflix's Friends From College. In comparison, Platonic is less prickly and more enjoyable and well-crafted, thanks to a tighter focus on two people (not a group) striving to evolve the unshakable bond they made during their younger days.  

The show centers on Will (Seth Rogen) and Sylvia (Rose Byrne), former besties who reconnected at the start of season one after being estranged for five years. (His ex-wife didn't gel with her, and as soon as she learned of his divorce via Instagram, she reached out.) This reunion unleashes upheaval in their personal lives and careers because Will and Sylvia indulge in their worst habits together, as if desperately clinging to younger, freer versions of themselves. But they're also endlessly understanding and honest in a way they can't be with anyone else. Free of romantic feelings, sexual tension, or family ties, they are goofy and real with each other by choice (one that they make over and over, arguments and ego clashes notwithstanding). Isn't that how all friendships stay intact, by choosing to spend time with someone simply because you want to and it brings you joy? 

Stoller and Delbanco rely almost exclusively on their Neighbors collaborators to anchor this tale. Without the commitment from Rogen and Byrne—who excel at physical-comedy hijinks, electric banter, and sincere conversations—Platonic wouldn't make as much of an impact. Their natural chemistry makes it easy to root for Will and Sylvia's messy dynamic even when they're being utterly insufferable. And the pair is quite toxic, to be clear. Sylvia, a stay-at-home mom of three who gave up being a lawyer to raise her children, seeks more than her mundane routine. In Will, she unexpectedly finds the opportunity to let loose again. Meanwhile, Will is a brewmaster who doesn't get along with any of his colleagues at the hip bar he co-owns. In Sylvia, he finds a camaraderie that's been missing from his life. But is their friendship rooted in “for old time's sake.” Can it be mature to reflect their age and experiences? 

The ten new amusing but repetitive episodes make it clear the answer is still unknown. Will now lives in San Diego, works a corporate job, and is about to marry his chic boss, Jenna (Rachel Rosenbloom). But he still acts like a 20-year-old trapped in a 40-year-old's body. His laid-back outfits and attitude are solid proof, as is the way he reacts to getting cold feet during his engagement party in the season premiere. To help him through everything is his pal. Will and Sylvia's misadventures continue to throw a wrench in their respective romantic relationships. Jenna is as understandably unnerved by their closeness, just like Sylvia's sweet husband, Charlie (Luke Macfarlane), seemed to be in season one. They aren't afraid of potential infidelity but of the idea that their partner is more open with another person than with them. No amount of double dates can fix this. 



This all forces Will and Sylvia to try to establish boundaries, at least to whatever extent two annoying people can. But their back-and-forth feels familiar already: The two of them do ridiculous things (like a bachelor party and golfing trip gone wrong), yell about it, eventually make up, and do the whole act all over again. They're like Broad City‘s Ilana and Abbi, except they're not traipsing around Brooklyn without a care in the world. Sylvia often talks about the struggles of managing her work calendar and organizing her kids' schedules, leaving her with five free minutes to herself. Yet she'll jet off with Will for silly diversions like kayaking down the L.A. River or driving him two hours away for an errand. Platonic doesn't care to fully delve into Sylvia's life as a mother, which requires a certain suspension of logic to believe her shenanigans with Will. 

Putting a bit of space between the two leads to some intriguing developments (Will and Charlie bond more, and Sylvia's event planning gigs become successful) and some frustrating ones, like Will's half-baked new friendship with Katie (Carla Gallo). (New cast additions like Beck Bennett and Aidy Bryant don't add much to Platonic either.) As for Sylvia and Charlie, the script is flipped on them when she becomes the stable earner and he tries to figure out his place in the law firm. Their partnership is tested with lies and secrets, with Charlie well within his rights to question how much Sylvia prioritizes his needs. Byrne doesn't fit together as seamlessly with Macfarlane as she does with Rogen, but Platonic is richer whenever it devotes time to this marriage. 

The series ultimately moves at a breezy pace and is rooted in laughs, crafting a chill, low-stakes story along the way. It can be tough to watch Will and Sylvia act selfishly, but they're also charming, sincere, and relatable, making the pair worth sticking with.    

Platonic season two premieres August 6 on Apple TV+

Reader, you have been lied to! Film history is littered with unfairly maligned classics, whether critics were too eager to review the making of rather than the finished product, or they suffered from underwhelming ad campaigns or general disinterest. Let's revise our takes on some of these films from wrongheaded to the correct opinion.

When Paramount released “We're No Angels” as its 1989 Christmas movie (and final film of the decade), reviews were mixed and the box office weak. Hard as it may be to believe in the post-“Fockers” era, audiences just weren't interested in seeing Robert De Niro in a broad comedy, even (especially?) one co-starring Sean Penn and written by David Mamet.

As years passed, the movie's reputation never really improved, with even its makers acknowledging its flaws. In his 2023 Hollywood memoir, “Everywhere an Oink Oink,” Mamet blamed director Neil Jordan for ruining his script; in an interview with The Observer, Jordan seemed to agree, saying, “I should not be allowed to make comedies.”

Now, “We're No Angels” is newly available in a beautifully assembled special edition Blu-ray package by boutique label Cinématographe. Watching the film removed from its time — and from the divorce proceedings of Penn and Madonna that vacuumed up whatever attention the media was prepared to allot the movie — its middling reputation is baffling. Elegantly structured, gorgeously mounted, and anchored by De Niro and Penn's hilarious performances, “We're No Angels” comes close to being a kind of classic.

The movie it remade, a 1955 comedy directed by ace craftsman Michael Curtiz (“Casablanca”), wasn't exactly a classic despite the presence of Humphrey Bogart. Still, it had a premise Mamet could run with: Three prison escapees (quickly narrowed down to two in Mamet's retelling as James Russo splits off from Penn and De Niro) find themselves in a quaint village where they pose as upstanding citizens and gradually get absorbed into the local community.

That premise is pretty much the beginning and end of the similarities between Curtiz's film and Jordan and Mamet's, which introduces the ingenious idea of De Niro and Penn having to pose as traveling priests to hide out from the law. A lot of the comedy in “We're No Angels” derives from the disconnect between a pair of Mamet tough guys (though Penn is more of a hapless doofus) and a spiritual environment. Whether Mamet and Jordan would have gotten even more mileage out of this premise had Paramount not decided it had to be a PG-13 release late in the game, we'll never know.

 










As funny as the movie is, Mamet doesn't really push for the laughs, often veering away from the obvious comic possibilities in favor of a genuine consideration of spiritual questions. In its admittedly goofy way, “We're No Angels” asks the same question as Kurt Vonnegut's “Mother Night”: If you spend all your time pretending to be someone else, are you in fact that person?

For De Niro's Ned, the answer is pretty clearly no (though he does end up saving a life with some seemingly divine help at the movie's climax), but Penn's Jim is, in his way, a seeker. Even before the prison break, he annoys Jim in their cell by pondering spiritual issues as Russo's character is prepped for the electric chair. As the film progresses, he becomes more and more comfortable among the other priests — leading to some very funny exchanges between him and De Niro, who just wants to get out of town.

Despite his image as one of film and theater's great cynics, Mamet treats the spectrum of religious beliefs in the movie — from John C. Reilly's wide-eyed pious monk to sex worker Demi Moore's well-earned atheism — with open-minded respect, honoring the contradictory viewpoints he weaves together in a construction nearly as meticulous as his far more lauded screenplay for “The Verdict.” This is a silly comedy that takes its characters seriously, which makes them all the funnier as the situations become absurd.

 










That said, the biggest laughs in the movie don't come from Mamet's screenplay. They come from De Niro and Penn's more-is-more approach to physical comedy, in which both actors swing for the fences with mugging that critics widely derided upon the film's initial release. Dismissing De Niro and Penn's performances for being too hammy is like criticizing “The Red Shoes” for having too much color, or “John Wick” for being violent; the excess is the source of the pleasure.

Luckily for De Niro, the same audiences that weren't in the mood for his comic mugging in 1989 ate it up 11 years later when he revived the approach for “Meet the Parents.” But one doesn't even need to think “We're No Angels” is funny to appreciate its other considerable virtues; Jordan may not have thought he was very good at comedy, but he was inarguably the right guy to play up the fable-like qualities of Mamet's story.

Jordan beautifully calibrates the spiritual component of Mamet's script, subtly heightening it to provide a sense of Christmas magic without ever making it too overt or explicit. The film's beauty is unsurprising given collaborators like cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (“Dangerous Liaisons,” “Interview with the Vampire”), composer George Fenton (a Jordan favorite), and production designer Wolf Kroeger (“Casualties of War,” “Last of the Mohicans”).

 










Kroeger is particularly important, and the creator of the one inarguably great thing in “We're No Angels”: its location, a border town between America and Canada that Kroeger built from scratch. Kroeger was an ace at builds like this — his set for the town in Robert Altman's “Popeye” is another example of a vivid fictional community fully realized on location. 

The town in “We're No Angels” recalls another Altman film, “McCabe and Mrs. Miller,” in its detailed, lived-in quality, and it's emblematic of the movie's overall greatness. The filmmakers may have turned on their own creation after it flopped, but there's no question that every single actor and department head on “We're No Angels” treated it with utmost commitment during production.

There's none of the slapdash filmmaking that so many comedies have, where the filmmakers think (not entirely inaccurately) that as long as they get the camera aimed in the general direction of something funny, the audience will be satisfied. From the elaborate prison break set piece that opens the film to its lyrical finale that expertly weaves the story's strains of romance and cynicism together, “We're No Angels” is a movie of supreme artistry and craftsmanship.

Cinématographe's Blu-ray, with its beautifully assembled booklet (containing several thoughtful analyses of the film) and illuminating special features (including a candid new interview with Jordan), is itself a finely crafted artifact — and a great way to encounter a movie that always deserved far better than it got.

 










Cinématographe Blu-ray of “We're No Angels” is now available at the label's website.

After receiving Academy Awards and becoming an icon of Hollywood, Francis Ford Coppola just wants to have “fun.” The auteur's version of playing around? Directing a self-funded $120 million epic. 

The making of Coppola's controversial “Megalopolis” is captured in documentary “Megadoc” by filmmaker Mike Figgis (Figgis previously helmed the Oscar-nominated “Leaving Las Vegas” and is known for directing episodes of “The Sopranos” and “The Affair.”) “Megadoc” is billed as an “unfiltered” look into Coppola's “Megalopolis” and his creative process as a whole. The official synopsis for “Megadoc” reads: “A raw, fly-on-the-wall documentary about Francis Ford Coppola's decades-long journey in creating his self-financed passion project, ‘Megalopolis.' The bold and unrelenting epic returns in Mike Figgis' portrait of Coppola's creative process – weaving together archival material, unfiltered cast interviews, and a close-up view of how the legendary filmmaker drew from Roman history, political allegory, and his own singular vision to shape the world of ‘Megalopolis.' This isn't a record of a production on the brink, it's a personal memoir unfolding in real time.”

“Megadoc” will debut at Venice 2025. “Megalopolis” actors Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza, Nathalie Emmanuel, Dustin Hoffman, Giancarlo Esposito, Chloe Fineman, Shia LaBeouf, Laurence Fishburne, Jon Voight, and Talia Shire appear in the documentary, as well as Coppola collaborator Robert De Niro.

“Megadoc” is produced by Tara Li-An and James Mockoski. 

Coppola previously said in a press statement that “Megadoc” showcases a variety of perspectives about what it really was like to film “Megalopolis” in Georgia. “The great filmmaker Mike Figgis shot the making of ‘Megalopolis' as he saw it,” Coppola said. “Interestingly, there are many interpretations of what really happened and it's all in the documentary although the documentary doesn't always say which is what. It is for the viewer to behold and interpret.”

Figgis added that Coppola gave him “access to everything, including the amazing archive material he's accumulated of the many readings of the script as it went from one version to another. I was more or less free to go where I wanted. The cast were open about the working situation and how they were dealing with the idiosyncrasies of Francis and his very individual working methods. What a privilege to be a witness to such a moment in film history.”

Utopia will release “Megadoc” in September. Check out the teaser below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","How to Dig for Music Without Spotify","https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/how-to-dig-for-music-without-spotify/","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Let's get this out of the way: There's no right or wrong way to appreciate music, good taste doesn't necessarily make you a superior person, and Sabrina Carpenter can hit just as hard as a SoundCloud account with 1,137 followers expelling abrasive experiments. But it's undeniable that some of the main channels people use to discover music are destroying the culture. Spotify has irrevocably devalued music and locked people in for keeps while its CEO now slings money at defense contractors like a kid throwing money at Pokémon cards. Bands like Xiu Xiu, Deerhoof, and King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have already pulled their music from the platform, with more surely to come.

For many people, Spotify is the limit to their musical foraging—but there's so much more you can do. As AI pollutes social media and algorithms silo people into tidy bubbles, listeners will need to deploy canny tricks to escape the force-feed apparatus. Here are some methods for scraping good music from the data wasteland, organized in a hierarchy from bottom-feeder basics to more sophisticated and ultimately, uhh, harebrained strategies.

This is you: Hi, my name is MusicLover46. I LOVE Music! Kai Cenat is my favorite critic. My favorite genres are RapCaviar and New Music Friday. Whenever I get sick of Post Malone and Phonk Mix to Mew To, I ask Spotify's AI DJ for recs. Or I let the algorithm recommend me something. It's usually so efficient that I don't even notice the music changing! So seamless!

If you're ready to venture beyond the lazy river of the Spotify algorithm and “Made for You” playlists, the car radio and Billboard charts… those ouroboros of context-collapsing, frictionless gluttony, read on.

Try gleaning music from other platforms. TikTok's musical spawn isn't as outrageous as it was during the golden pandemic years, when dissonant rap and digicore conquered white girl FYPs, but I still get startled by some of the things that breach the mainstream. Scroll for a bit and you'll find Bella Poarch testing filters to the tune of Jxxl3s and taconiel's “MP3PSYCHOSIS,” which throttles like a Bionicle flamenco-footworking all over your face. Maybe you'll discover 2hollis thanks to some Chobani on My Jeans edits, or perhaps hemlocke springs' jaunty chirps will seize you from the screen and you'll have a new artist to base your identity around.

Elsewhere on the front page of the internet, you can watch Anthony Fantano, who's basically the Oprah of music journalism, and munch on popular Reddit threads like r/hiphopheads.

My go-to basic method for finding new music, without technology and apps, is leaving the confines of my house. I can't recall how many times I've found something sweet after hearing it cannonball out of a car or a street party and asking for the name or quickly Shazaming it. Similarly, the baristas-cum-tastemakers at my local coffee shop have unknowingly put me on to lovely stuff—I don't know where else I would've found Bruce Haack's Preservation Tapes.

OK, so you've widened your horizons, what next? If you're still not ready to really swing the pickaxe, you can sample from the cottage industry of influencer-critics with curated selections.

There's “Professional Music Fan” Derrick Gee, who runs the show Solid Air, which involves the former 88rising creative director trading faves with guests like MJ Lenderman and Lorde. Former Pitchfork video producer Margeaux Labat, who interviews and solicits recs from artists like Ichiko Aoba and Nilüfer Yanya and drops a slew of listening logs. Professor Skye, who provides rambling, philosophy-laden meditations on albums that might at first seem out of the wheelhouse of an aging French lecturer, if that benevolent teacher vibe is your thing. Emmuel Reyes, aka Emwell, the interviewer-creator who forces rappers to reflect on their social media inanity on his YouTube show Well Well Well....

No one under the age of 35 uses Facebook, but joining Groups might deliver you some recs depending on the genre. I'm in a hauntology group and one for Tom MacDonald diehards (for research purposes only).

Keeping an eye on Genius' monthly anticipated albums list can put you on to new projects.

Bandcamp offers a nice way of both supporting artists and ambling through small-scale DIY projects and local scenes. Album releases pages include recs for other similar albums, and you can sort by both genre and amorphous vibey tags.

An easy way to stumble on cool shit with minimal effort: Type in NTS.LIVE. The 24/7 global radio has a remarkable hit rate, with offerings to satisfy basically any taste palate. There's plenty of just OK episodes better suited for background listening than blissful headbanging, but if you're lucky you'll hit a spasmodic set by Vietnamese outsiders Rắn Cạp Đuôi, an Arcadian idyll of a mix from Danish oddball Astrid Sonne, or a rerun of Jane Remover's furious Wait Watch This.

This is also where you can start molding your social media algorithms. Watch enough 2hollis Chobani clips and TikTok will whoosh you down the Abercrombie & Twitch rabid hole—start with Snow Strippers and nate sib, dip down to Bassvictim and MGNA Crrrta, before finally landing on EQ and real witch house respecters like E_DEATH. Lock in on enough Playboi Carti “RANKING ALL THE SONGS FROM WHOLE LOTTA RED” videos, and the app will open the gates to Edward Skeletrix and Che; then Lucy Bedroque and Xaviersobased; until you finally descend into the holy and heavenly caves of OsamaSon leaks, boolymon shitposts, and whatever the hell this is.

Time to imbibe the Music Pill and escape the major label matrix. USE THE CODE KPRABBITHOLED FOR A 40% DISCOUNT.

While Spotify offers a few handy discovery features (my favorite is checking out the weird user-made playlists) they are limited to songs officially uploaded to the platform. It's way more fun to playlist hop and, even better, like hop in the anarchic swirl of SoundCloud. Sorting through the public Likes of artists lets you see the smaller acts they co-sign and who they were listening to a decade ago. I've recently been peering into the Likes of left-field producers like serpuline and Julek ploski, where practically every other song sends me down a wonderful new path till I end up with 80 tabs open. Try bopping from artist to artist, deeper and deeper, until you reach ground zero of a microgenre on the platform. You might just map out the next gen of off-the-wall dubstep designers and nu-gazers. SoundCloud Likes offer a glimpse into the soul—and also the limits of the algorithm vortex. It's not a black box; it's just trashwave.

This is also the stage where, if you're nerdy and online enough, you'll start perusing RateYourMusic. The site has its issues—Why so few women in the top 50? Why do they all worship Quadeca?—but it's got a passionate community of music lovers and a mammoth of a rating archive. Dip an ear into their Charts, which you can toggle between different release formats and years, and you'll find a wealth of killer releases from artists you've never heard of.

At this point, you've certainly gone past the influencer-critic A-listers, and you're dangerously hooked on the niche lords who have PhDs in Nettspendology and know every smidgen of lore about World Music and West Mineral Ltd. Your Instagram timeline convulses with the latest info-puke from SADPRT, Tubman Underground and co. You've seen Josh Bae's video essay about the KPOPIUM iceberg, you go back to read old CCRU and K-PUNK blogs, you've bookmarked Hardstyle2001's Tumblr and Pinterest on your browser.

This is when you really take an active (and definitely unhealthy) step forward in your digging, intentionally following YouTube repost pages like karma archives and AtRiskMediaArchive that inundate you in little-known curios. You keep up with the labels and individuals passionately championing certain scenes: the Japanese netlabel Lost Frog Productions for dariacore and hyperflip; user crimedawgbylaw's MIlwaukee rap lists; the RYM blogger santurce's ridiculously comprehensive genre genealogies spanning “chetiji” and “diary plugg.” You subscribe to region-specific Substack newsletters and researchers like gg albuquerque. You respect NTS, but you're also knee-deep in Hong Kong Community Radio and other niche broadcasters.

There's a swarm of heavily populated Discord channels you can solicit recs in, but there's also a slew of micro-spaces dedicated to certain scenes full of people posting goodness. You can even discover shards of unfinished songs by joining private channels, like the one for producer collective StudyGroup, which is regularly flooded with tantalizing drafts.

Congratulations: You're officially an obsessive-compulsive obscurantist.

If you've reached level five, turn back. Log off, tryhard. Everything from here will have titles you can't type with your plebeian English keyboards, with music that defies all sense and logic. At parties, you talk about “SlimeTok” and “GifTok” and your daily news intake centers around the latest developments in this cursed underworld: SpinningTok, DiagnolTok, 3dTok, 67Tok, BlurTok.

Not really, but here are some of my strats for deep digging: reverse-engineering scenes by approaching them via oblique hashtags. Looksmaxxer keywords like “mewing,” “huntereyes,” “mogged” contain (unfortunately) a goldmine of jump- and hardstyle audios on TikTok. This is especially helpful for foreign languages—once you find a certain Cyrllic audio or hashtag, you can leapfrog off of it to unravel entire digital enclaves of Eastern European posters and musicians. This process eventually landed me in Telegram channels for artists like Dj trippie flameboy, Dayerteq, and voidvoice717, who have basically never been mentioned in Western media despite their sizable fanbases. I can't understand a word but the concert clips are cool.

Other methods that border on stalking include: tunneling into the list of who an artist follows on Instagram; searching up a cool record on RYM that isn't out yet, seeing who put the project on their “Anticipated Releases” list, and marking down everything else they're excited about.

I'm also talking about hubs like Music Place, which I covered in my last column, and resources like the Yabujin Masterdoc, which catalogues every release by the mysterious Lithuanian artist. If you've made it here, you're probably familiar with timeline characters like Peter Grimbeek, a SoundCloud obsessive who comments things like “Stutter going steady with bass hum, somewhere in the smog there is a real person (at least one) lost in the purple haze,” on fried rap frags by artists with 21 followers. Or bakuwara, a mysterious Japanese producer who seems to operate a ring of blistering dariacore accounts differentiated by numbers and first names.

Maybe the most underrated digging strategy is what I call “Professional Leaking Under the Guise of Gainful Employment,” or PLUGGË, which involves going to school to become an engineer/marketer/creative director and landing a job at a DSP like Spotify; once you've Trojan Goated yourself into the backend, you can listen freely to every artists' unreleased uploads. We also can't forget about deep-state file fracking, the process by which you can use Inspect Element to reveal every single media file on a webpage and right-click to download them.

Once you've mastered those methods, move on to the holy grail of dig strats, which I call blank dreck: Simply keymash gibberish into the SoundCloud search bar until you find something. There will be an tedious excess of “Sorry we didn't find any results for ‘asnasncana.'” Eventually, you'll hit. And chances are, it will be uploaded by mistake, a teenage embarrassment tossed off into the ether and promptly forgotten about by its creator, and the best thing you've ever heard.

	Senators could vote on a bill as soon as Thursday to allow members of Congress and their staff to demand that websites take down information about their houses and details about their travel. 


	Watchdogs and media advocates have objected to the member security legislation and similar measures in the past, arguing the provisions would block reporters from doing their jobs and prevent necessary accountability. 


	The legislation was introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Republican and Democratic congressional leaders are fast-tracking the bill, according to an internal Senate communication transmitted Wednesday. The vote could be held imminently. It would be held by unanimous consent, meaning any one senator present can block the bill if they choose. 


	Cruz, of course, has faced two embarrassing travel-related episodes in recent years. First, he traveled to Cancún, Mexico, as Texas faced severe winter storms and power outages in 2021. Cruz was slammed for the trip, which he later called a “mistake.” Earlier this month, Cruz was spotted vacationing in Greece as Texans grappled with deadly floods. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In 2023, Klobuchar and Cruz attempted unsuccessfully to attach the member security measure to the annual must-pass defense authorization bill.


	The legislation comes as political violence and threats against lawmakers have become increasingly commonplace. On Tuesday, for instance, federal agents arrested and charged an Ohio man with threatening to kill a member of Congress. Days earlier, a supporter of President Donald Trump was arrested and charged with threatening Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.). The U.S. Capitol Police's 2024 threat assessment report noted that the agency investigated nearly 9,500 concerning statements against members of Congress. The number was less than 4,000 in 2017, and has been steadily rising ever since.

	











	The most heinous act of political violence in recent memory came last month, when Melissa Hortman, a progressive leader in the Minnesota state legislature, and her husband were killed at her home in what Governor Tim Walz (D) said appeared to be a “politically motivated assassination.” The assailant also shot state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who both survived, the same night.

	Klobuchar was among the many Democratic officials included on a list compiled by the alleged Minnesota assassin. Last month, she cited those attacks to push for the legislation. 


	“This murderer, he went to the addresses that he knew. He had some names without addresses; he didn't go there,” Klobuchar said last month. “Sen. Cruz and I have long advocated for some changes. I believe we have growing support for that.”


	Watchdogs, however, argue the legislation is overly broad and would limit necessary transparency and efforts to hold lawmakers accountable. The Senate Appropriations Committee has separately reported out legislation that would provide additional protections for members of Congress as well as a funding boost for congressional security. That provision was set for a vote this week until Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) objected.


	While the member security bill includes a carve-out for journalists reporting on matters of public concern, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and three dozen major media outlets previously spoke out against a similar version of the bill, arguing it would interfere with their jobs and raises “serious First Amendment concerns.”  


	“While we acknowledge language that attempts to limit its scope, the legislation, if passed, would pose a threat to lawful newsgathering and reporting about members of Congress and their families, and raise serious First Amendment concerns,” they wrote in a letter to senators in 2023.

	They explained that, under the measure, “representatives, senators, and certain relations could still request that a news organization delete stories containing what they claim is covered information or file a lawsuit seeking injunctive or declaratory relief requiring that the news organization do so, arguing that the stories are not in the public interest or not of public concern.”

	Daniel Schuman, executive director of the American Governance Institute, tells Rolling Stone the bill would give Congress new censorship powers.


	“Members of Congress and congressional staff should be protected against violence,” says Schuman. “The Cruz-Klobuchar bill, however, would not provide them the protection they seek but would create a powerful new tool that would result in censorship of public discussion and press accountability for their actions. They should go back to the drawing board to write a bill that protects the privacy of all Americans without undermining accountability for public officials.”

	It's very tough to pick out the most accomplished member of MTV's vast Real World/Road Rules/Challenge universe, considering Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, podcast giant Theo Von, and WWE icon Mike “The Miz” Mizanin all got their start there. But speaking purely about the world of reality television, Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio undoubtedly takes the crown, even if giants like Christopher “CT” Tamburello, Wes Bergmann, Cara Maria Sorbello, and Trishelle Cannatella all have very impressive resumes.


	Devenanzio is not only the all-time Challenge champion with seven titles to his name, but he's also appeared on Traitors, House of Villains, Worst Cooks in America, and he spent five years as the host of NBC's 1st Look. And even though he's now 43 years old and would be quite justified in declaring himself too old for this shit, he's still willing to spend several months a year trapped in an overseas Challenge house filled with maniacs in pursuit of his elusive eighth ring.












	He's one of many veteran players on The Challenge: Vets & New Threats, which premiered in late July. The twist this season is that every Challenge mainstay is paired with a newbie from another reality show. In the first episode, Bananas joined forces with Survivor 45 winner Dee Valladares. Unsurprisingly, the other teams correctly sussed out that they were a major threat.

	During a whirlwind press New York press tour, shortly after coming back from Rome, where he attended the wedding of the Challenge's Kyle Christie, Devenanzio stopped by the Rolling Stone offices to chat about the new season, his short stint on Traitors, how he keeps his aging body in shape, and his hopes for Challenge 50.

	











You got all the way to the end on Challenge 40, and that was a grueling season. Did you give any thought to simply taking this season off?Nah. I took my little break. I took my little Season 36/37 break. And I say this every season, but I mean it. You never know when it's going to be your last one. I'm all about keeping the franchise rolling. And I think now they need the OGs more than ever to hopefully keep the torch going. And once we found out the location, and when we found out who some of the cast members who were going were, we realized we were going to need a pretty strong veteran contingency in order to hold down the fort.

	I'm like a protective father, man. I literally look at The Challenge as a child of mine, and I want to make sure it has the best care. And sometimes the best care is not bringing in a bunch of — as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar put it — a throbbing scum of fame-hungry desperados.


	We're like the Alamo. That's how I felt on 40. I felt like the reason why I really dug my heels in the way that I did on 40 was because I felt like I was the last line of defense. If I go down, then basically these new kids are going to run roughshod over our franchise. I couldn't let that happen.


Speaking of 40, a lot of fans hated the karma points.Who are you telling? You're talking to a guy who hated the karma points more than anyone.


The entire point of the game is to outsmart and outcompete the others. It's not to make them love you after you kick them out.It shouldn't even be called karma because it has nothing to do with karma. It was more of a popularity contest. The problem is that people don't look at my body of work and go, “You know what? You've done well, therefore you deserve this.” It's more like, “You've done well, therefore you don't need any more.”


	That's what happened with me. My best friend Leroy [Garrett] gave me one karma point. Laurel…and I was the only one that had this girl's back and went to bat for the entire season…she gave me one karma point. And both of them were like, “Oh, it's nothing personal. We just feel like you've won enough and you don't need any more.” And I think that's just wrong.

	There were a few people who obviously deserved getting one karma point from us because we had it out. But that's what it all kind of boiled down to. It had nothing to do with karma; it just had to do with who was the most popular. It wasn't even who they wanted to see do well; it was who they wanted to see not do well.

	











The final was really heavy on swimming, which strongly favors people with that one skillset.Yeah, it was unfortunate, dude, because that season that I put together…I really had my back against the wall the entire time. Those are always the ones that give you the most satisfaction winning, because as the saying goes, “The most beautiful view is after the toughest climb.” And some of my most difficult seasons, like Free Agents, Rivals One, were my favorite wins because of the road that I had to get to in order to win at the end.


	I always feel like if you don't see an elimination, if you don't have to get dirty throughout the season, and then you win a final, those are the wins that I've considered in the past, the ones that aren't as satisfying, but not everyone sees it like that.


You don't want to coast.I've never been able to. I always think it's so unfair for other people to get a chance to coast and then go to a final. And for me, it really has nothing to do with my game. I could show up…You'll see what happens this season on 41. It doesn't matter if these people know me, don't know me, have read about me, have no fuckin' clue who I am. I'm the one that everyone wants to get out day one.


	This happened on Challenge USA on CBS. Many of them had no idea who I was until I walked in the house. Yet, day two, it was like, “We've got to get Bananas out.” I had the most votes stacked up against me. This season's no different, these new threats, [they have] no clue who I am. You'll see night one whose name's already getting tossed around for being eliminated.


	But that's kind of like the bed that I've made for myself. I am totally fine sleeping in it. I just wish people, fans too, would give me a little more credibility where it's like, “Oh man, why he didn't really do this well this season? Or how'd you not win?” It's like, “Do you understand the road that I've had to forge to get to this point? It's 10 times harder than anyone else.”


That happened on Traitors as well. You were murdered first.There was nothing I could even do about that. At least on The Challenge, it's like, “All right, you want send me in? Guess what? I'm probably going to go [into elimination] and I'm probably going to win and I'm probably going to come back, and then I'm coming for you.” 


Traitors is like in the dead of night, they give fuckin' Dan [Gheesling] carte blanche authority to just make this unilateral decision to murder me, which had nothing to do with the strategy of the game. It had to do with his tiny little ego.

	











After 40 ended, did you patch things up quickly with Tori Deal and Michelle Fitzgerald?Yes. And 40 was funny because…I don't want to say that I was “acting,” but I felt like there was a role that I created for myself that I had to see through. I became the heel. I became the anti-establishment. There was this alliance, and I became the antithesis of that alliance. And what happened then was that anyone who was associated with Tori was fair game. Olivia [Kaiser], Michele, Jordan [Wiseley], anyone in that little group. So even once things kind of mellowed out and it was getting close to the final, I'm like, “I have to continue this storyline on.”


	Now, once the show was wrapped and even kind of before…I mean, I'm not going to sit here on camera and have this big apology, like, “Okay, let's be best friends again, Tori.” I would rather just wait until after the season. But yeah, we're good now. I love Tori to death. I love Michele too. Devin and I were actually just in Rome for Kyle's wedding, so we've kind of squashed it, too.


	But I really do try as hard as I can to not take my work home with me, although sometimes it's more difficult than others. But you'll see there's a very, very noticeable carryover effect going into this season from last season with Olivia. For some reason, she still harbors resentment toward me for her going home. I don't know why.


How do you train differently for a Challenge season at age 43 than you did at 23?I like to compare myself to a pitcher who, when he was new to the league, had a fastball that nobody could hit, but has lost his velocity, so now he has to be good at throwing dirty pitches and has more junk in his arsenal. I've just gotten a lot better at the political manipulation type game and the social game.


	It's not that I haven't always had a strong social game, but I used to rely purely on my athleticism and my physical skill sets. I'd walk in the house, put a middle finger up to everyone, and be like, “If you want to get rid of me, go ahead.”


	But I just train, man. I stay in shape. I own a gym, Rumble in South Florida. That's literally what I do. Six days a week, I'm in there for cardio and for strength training.


	I've also entered the world of biohacking. I'm not sure if you're familiar with peptides, but peptides are essentially like a cheat code, man. They're a fountain of youth. I've been on a peptide regimen now for the last three years. They're amino acids that aid in cellular regeneration. And that's what, as we age, starts to slow us down. So I'm able to keep up with the younger guys.

	











Every veteran is paired up with a rookie this season. What are the upsides and downsides of that?They don't know what they're doing, so that's difficult. And it's funny because even though people have never done The Challenge, they think that because they've done another reality show, they know how to play the game. The Challenge is a whole different animal. And it's funny when you see people from Survivor or from Big Brother, Reindeer Games, whatever the hell, come in and try and play the game that they played on that show on The Challenge because it doesn't translate.


	On The Challenge, you are in the open with your game playing, with decisions you're going to make, because it will get exposed. If you're not exposed this season, the next season, you're going to have to deal with it. So it's almost better to just deal with it now. Whereas Survivor and Big Brother are much more like cloak and dagger. You can hide in the corner and lie to everybody and keep secrets because it's not going to get exposed until the person's gone, and you're never going to see them again.


You are paired with Dee in this new season. How much did you know about her going into this?A little bit. I wish I knew a little more because I wasn't totally familiar with her body of work. We'd met once or twice before. We actually met the first time at the Season 40 finale party. She'd already known that she was going on The Challenge, didn't even tell me. Once I found out she was going, I was like, “Why? We both live in South Florida. You couldn't have given me a heads-up?”


I was familiar with how she played in Survivor, and what I liked about her game on Survivor is that she almost, kind of like me, has no remorse in the way that she plays. She is there to win and doesn't care who she has to bulldoze in the way to get there. So I was almost like, “Probably better to be paired up with you so that way you can use these powers of deception and manipulation against other people.” It's been a few seasons since I've had a showmance. So why not?


She said she was hesitant to be your partner since it puts a target on her back.That's the way they made it look. That's the way it's edited. That is not reality. And here's the thing: I like to be upfront, whether it's a relationship outside of the show or anything. I want people to know what they're getting into. I want to let them to know that there will be some upsides to this, but there's also going to be a lot of downsides that come along with either partnering with me or dating me. And with her, I told her both ways.

	











	I told her, “Listen, I have a tremendous amount of knowledge of how the game works. I've got a lot of relationships here that we're able to leverage. However, you've already seen coming in how much attention has already been placed on me. Being my partner, then you are going to be kind of tied to that.” She's like, “I wouldn't have it any other way.”


	That's the conversation that we had because I was going to have the first pick. I was going to be able to choose who I wanted as my female partner. And I told her first, I was like, “If I choose you, I don't want you to feel like I've now just compromised your game by being your partner.” And she was like, “I wouldn't have it any other way. This is what I want. I want to be kind of like the villain. I want to be the heel.”


	But then in the interview, it made it look as if it was like, “I don't know, this guy's kind of liability.” You know how it is. For a storyline, it's much better for her to be worried about being a part of me than owning it.


Did you clock Yeremi Hykel as a big threat from the moment he came into the game?Right from the beginning. Right from the jump. Everyone's like, “This motherfucker ran up this mountain faster than anything you've ever seen.” He was on the way back down before half the people who've made it to the top. The guy's an ultramarathon runner. Jordan's not here this season. We've basically gotten a new and improved Jordan.


	Usually, it's like if you have some really impressive skill set, you want to keep it in your back pocket. The guy's got no problem talking about how he runs 75 miles for fun. I'm like, “Buddy, I'm done after four.”


	I've never seen a rookie class, or threats we're calling them, that are this confident. Usually, a lot of times, the threats will come in, they'll look up to us as the vets, like, “What do we do? How do we play the game?” These people didn't care. They were going to come in, and they were going to play their own game. Sydney [Segal] is another one, dude. She came in with two middle fingers up to everyone. She's going to be great. She's doing really good.


This is very random, but why did Nia wear jeans when you climbed that mountain?Okay, here's the thing. You know what we were told that morning? We get out of the hotel. We're like, “What should we wear?” They were like, “Oh, just wear something casual, like something you'd wear to the airport.” I'm like, “All right.” I wear Crocs. Luckily, they gave us other shoes, but I did the first half of that first episode literally on a mountain wearing Crocs. And then out of nowher,e TJ's like, “All right, we got some shoes for you guys. You're just going to run. Follow this trail to the house,” making it sound like it's going to be like an afternoon little jog. It couldn't have been any different than that. But yeah, I felt bad for Nia wearing pants, and C.T. wearing another human being.

	











He did show back up in dad bod mode again. Did that surprise you?Nah, it doesn't surprise me one bit. That's what the guy does. He's like a yo-yo. It's almost like he looks at The Challenge as fat camp. I've never seen anyone lose weight faster than him in my entire life. The guy will just fast for like a week straight. It's like, “Where'd you go?” But yeah, he's kind of owned it at this point.


Watching him get picked last by the threats was pretty shocking since he's a Mount Rushmore Challenge figure.This is what I'm saying. I think that the rookies this season came in, and it wasn't about folklore. It wasn't about what you've done in the past. It's like, “What are you doing right now? How are you going to compete in this game right now?” And I think a lot of these guys were just hip to the game right out of the gate. I think that initial charge up that mountain showed everyone where everybody stood.


	It ranked us. And I think they saw how horribly, other than myself, the rest of the male vets did. And they were like, “I do not care about beating this guy in the final now.” We're going into this season without the benefit of intimidation or the threat factor. It's just not there.


Who is your number one? Nany? Leroy?It's always Leroy. Leroy's my guy. And Nany, obviously. Aviv [Melmed] is obviously one of my closest friends outside of the show as well, one of my angels. So yeah, pretty much the same crew I usually go into every season with if they're there.


I love seeing Aviv back in the mix after all these years.Yeah. What's happened with a lot of Challenge people who have stepped away, they have a very difficult time adjusting and adapting back to the flagship show, which is why most of them are more comfortable in All Stars, which is basically the retirement camp for The Challenge. Because the game's just different. The game moves so fast, it changes so fast, and the competition gets so much better. Not just the competition; just kind of the way you have to be, the way you have to move, the way you have to act changes all the time.


	One of the things I attribute my success to on The Challenge over the years is the fact that I've never stepped away. I've never stepped away and started a family. I've never stepped away and gotten married. Now, obviously, there's some drawbacks to that as well. I'm one of my only friends in my age bracket of my friend circle who isn't married and doesn't have a kid. But then it's like, they're looking at me and they're like, “Take your time, dude. You're not missing out on anything. Trust me, what you're doing is way more fun.”

	











	But because I have never stepped away and because I've stuck with this entire time, it's then enabled me to stay on people's TV screens, be in front of their faces for the last 19 years. You don't know when you're going to have one of these epic viral moments. I've been on the good or bad side of almost every viral moment that's taken place on The Challenge over the years, and I think that's what's really enabled me to separate myself from the rest of the pact and use the same platform that we've all been given to launch podcasts, clothing lines, spinoff shows, other opportunities for other shows. So I think that's kind of been the blueprint for me.


When you read the fan forums, the names of players they want again are usually Landon Lueck, Coral Smith, Eric Nies, Evelyn Smith, and Svetlana Shusterman. Do you hope to see them all back someday?So here's the thing. I would like to see them back. The question is, what are they going to contribute? Here's what people don't understand. When you talk about a Landon, freak athlete. The guy is arguably one of the best athletes who has ever played the game. Boring as fuck to watch, dude. Like literally like watching a candle melt. Same with Horacio [Gutiérrez].


	These guys are great at the athletic part, but The Challenge is so much more than that. The Challenge is the social aspect. Ninety percent to 95 percent of the show is what you're going to do in the house. That's who I always look at as the people that are going to be the most fun to watch coming back, would love to see.


	But also, a lot of them have moved on. They have families. They have careers. And there's a certain way if you have a 9:00 to 5:00 corporate job in America, you can't come on reality TV and do what you need to do in order to be entertaining. Because you do have so much more. I don't have that.


	I don't have a corporate job back home or a boss that's going to get mad if I act a certain way or whatever. So I'm able to just kind of be the unhinged version of myself and do what I need to do. But would I like to see some of them back on? Yes. Would they? It's just difficult to see after this much time has passed. Like, Evelyn's a lawyer now. Evelyn went to Harvard and is a lawyer. She can't come on and be like Evelyn of the past. So I don't know.


Some fans want to see you and Sarah Rice as partners. Could that ever happen?That'll never happen. There's not a snowball's chance in hell. And the reason why has actually nothing to do with the fact that I don't want to be on a show with her. I wouldn't mind. Here's the thing. The way The Challenge works is there is a tier system, and it's the way to keep it fair. You get paid based on the number of shows you've been on. Sarah wants to come on and get paid the same as someone who has done 25 seasons, and she's done four or five or whatever. So it's never going to happen from that perspective.

	











	Plus, especially at this point in my career, I'm not the Salvation Army. I've worked very, very, very hard. I've spilled a lot of blood and a lot of mud to get the branding and the notoriety that I have. And I am very cautious of who I interact with. Because, okay, Wes and I, for example, that rivalry or that banter, that back and forth, benefits both of us. This is the way that I've always seen it. That's even true about me and Devin to an extent now. I feel like he's put himself in a position where it's like, “All right, we kind of both benefit from the back and forth.”


	Sarah and I, at this point, there's only one person who benefits from us going back and forth, and it's her. And I am not going to donate any more of my social capital to her podcast or whatever to try to get attention from me. I moved on from that. She got the shit end of stick on Rivals 3. She's never wanted to come back to have a shot at redemption up until, for whatever reason, now. And it's too late.


How did you and Devin squash it?Actually, in Italy, in Rome. After 40, he obviously had his reasons to dislike me, and vice versa. I guess I meddled in his relationship a little bit. But I'm not going to lie, and I will say this on record, and I said this before…I was, I think, a little bit misguided in what I thought the intentions of his relationship [with Michele] were. I saw it as a game move. If it is, then this is the longest play I've ever seen in my entire life. I was like, “If they stay together after 40, it's simply to prove me wrong. Because if they break up, then they're both going to have to admit that I was right.”


	But they're still together. I was just with him in Rome. He speaks so highly of her. They're actually moving to South Florida, near me in Delray. They're getting a place together. So I mean, it seems like they're in it for the long haul.


	I think Devin just wants to occupy the same space that I do, and there's just not enough room, Devin. There's just not. He also wants to wear my skin as a coat, so I think that's part of it as well.


I'd love to see Kyle back. I really miss him.I miss him too. I think he was supposed to actually be on All Stars 4 or something. But he was filming on Geordie Shore, and there was a conflict there. The guy has not changed one bit. I love him to death. I mean, he's still a total maniac. I think he's the best UK addition that the show's ever had.


I would love to see you back on Traitors and actually play the game. Do you think that's possible?I do think it's possible. I do think it's in the cards. It's actually potentially been in the cards over the past one or two seasons. But due to creative changes or my scheduling, we weren't able to make it happen. But a little birdie told me there may be an All-Star season on the horizon, and if there is, then that might be the best way for me to make it back. Because I agree.

	











	The thing about Traitors that I love… House of Villains, great show. Loved it. There's no gamers there. So I literally felt like I was playing with children. My reality television IQ was so much higher than everyone else in the house. I'm like, “This almost isn't fair.” But I love the show. I love being able to be on and be my total. They almost lean into the messiest version of who you are. That show's amazing, but it's not a competition.


	And the thing is with Traitors is there's always this debate out there in the television game world like, “All right, could someone on Survivor survive on The Challenge? Could someone on The Challenge survive on Survivor? Could someone on Big Brother? This is the best to ever do it. This is the best. Big Brother Legend, Survivor Legend.” Challenge never gets mentioned in the mix, even though we've done it harder, longer, faster, fuckin' better than anyone else out there. But whatever.


Traitors is the first time saying, “We're going to put you all in this format that none of you are familiar with, and then we're going to see who does the best.” So I was really looking forward to taking the skill set that I had acquired over the years on The Challenge and applying that to a whole new realm, and I didn't even get the opportunity to do it.


	And even though I wasn't there for the win, I took so much pride in Trishelle and C.T. being the sole winners of Traitors because I felt like this is proof that we are fuckin' good. The Challenge never, ever, ever gets the love and the credit that it deserves for not just the space that we've created, but we've maintained.


Road Rules just had its 30-year anniversary. We're on Season 41. The fact that we have done it for this long, the show is still around, the show is still relevant, the show is still groundbreaking, the show is still evolving. We were the first ones to start cross-pollinating from different shows and bringing other cast members in. So the fact that we're still doing it, and then we go on a show like Traitors where you're building up all these Big Brother and Survivor legends, and guess what? The Challenge people beat all of you.


If you could design the format for Challenge 50, how would you design it?Please go back to an old school format. Keep it fuckin' simple. I want you to put this in bold at the top of the article. The rest of this interview can just go away. What they need to understand, if they want this franchise to survive, is that we've got to keep it simple. We don't need explosions. We don't need spies and lies.












	Dude, the best seasons in my opinion were the old school, The Duel, The Gauntlet, the Inferno, Exes, Rivals. You know why? Because it's so easy to understand. It's like two teams, badasses, good guys, exes. And we don't need a curveball every challenge. Maybe one throughout the season. But for fans, this is why fans have such a hard time following. If I'm sitting here and I'm in the game and TJ's explaining the rules and I'm lost. what's the casual fan going to do?


	I feel like in this day and age, it's almost like, “Dude, you know the fans, you know what they want. Just, please, go back to old-school formats.” Nostalgia is in now, all right?


I want a hall brawl where you guys aren't holding pillows.I bet you do! I wouldn't hall brawl at this point. I'd be like, “Nope, my neck is too important. TJ, I will see you later.”


To wrap up here, do you want to still be doing this in your fifties?If I stay on these peptides, I'm going to be an infant in six months. So yes. Here's the thing, as long as it makes sense for what I'm doing in my life and the projects that I have going on, The Challenge is such an important part of who I am.

	And it may sound weird, but I understand now why growing up, when you hear these [older] athletes, and it's like, “Dude, fuckin' retire already, man. Walk away from the game.” I know why it takes so long, it's because you get institutionalized, and it really does become a part of you. And it's like there's so much nostalgia and there's so much reminiscing, and some of the best and worst moments of my entire existence took place on The Challenge. It's almost like an emotionally abusive relationship that's really just difficult to get out of.


	I want to do it for as long as I can. I want to keep the torch burning for as long as I can. I want to show my haters, as much as they hate me, that there's still a whole lot more for them to get ready to hate.

It is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Warhammer 40,000 universe — at least, it was. Via a new codex, Games Workshop has finally revealed the true nature of the much-debated Terminus Decree — and some Warhammer 40,000 lore fans really wish it hadn't.

The Terminus Decree, for the uninitiated, is the final order issued to the Grey Knights, perhaps the most mysterious chapter of Space Marines in the setting, before the Emperor was placed within the Golden Throne following his mortal wounding by the Warmaster Horus at the end of the Horus Heresy.

(For more on the Emperor's current... situation, check out this article here.)

The idea is that only the Supreme Grand Master of the Grey Knights can open The Terminus Decree and discover what, exactly, this final order entails. Essentially, it's a ‘break glass in case of emergency' Pandora's box — and Warhammer 40,000 fans have wondered what was inside for years.

Now, with the release of the new Grey Knights codex (a book packed with background lore, pictures of miniatures for use on the tabletop game, and fresh rules to play around with), Games Workshop has for the first time revealed what The Terminus Decree actually involves.

Warning! Spoilers for Warhammer 40,000 lore follow:

A single passage in the new Grey Knights codex has lit up Warhammer 40,000 lore fans, as it reveals the ultimate duty of the Grey Knights is to either kill or re-entomb the Emperor within the Golden Throne, should he ever attempt to leave, be reborn, or ascend to godhood. This is The Terminus Decree: an ultra-secret doomsday device, a contingency box left by the Emperor himself that would have the Grey Knights force him back onto the Golden throne, should he ever recover and dare to leave it.

Interestingly, the passage reveals The Terminus Decree offers no guidance for how the Grey Knights should do this, if they ever have to, and that they might have to cut through the Adeptus Custodes to do it. The Custodes are the Emperor's super powerful bodyguard — even more powerful than the Space Marines — so good luck with that!

This is a huge amount for any Warhammer 40,000 lore fan to take in. It is a major revelation, one that puts an end to years of debate at this point. Whether you take it as the Emperor being smart because he knew that if he were ever to return it simply wouldn't be him but something else entirely (this development would potentially tap into ongoing The Dark King plotline), or Games Workshop planting seeds for something big they're building towards (Chief Custodian Constantin Valdor looms large over the setting, and it does seem like the Emperor is… stirring), the inescapable truth is now we know, whether we like it or not.

And that's a big issue for some Warhammer 40,000 lore fans, who have since expressed their frustration that Games Workshop has explained this mystery at all. Warhammer 40,000 is packed full of unexplained mysteries, hanging plot threads, and tantalizing puzzles that it may never get around to explaining. Take, for example, the mystery of the II and XI, the Forgotten and the Purged, the two lost primarchs and their two lost legions. Games Workshop has danced around revealing this part of Warhammer 40,000 lore for years, and many hope the truth is never revealed. Speculation is, after all, part of the fun. There is much to be said for leaving things to the imagination.

And that was the case with The Terminus Decree, until now. So what gives? Why reveal it now? Why take the speculation and imagination away from fans on this lore point in particular? There is much vehement reaction from the community. Here's a snippet:

“I don't really like this,” redditor aposi said. “It both spoils the mystery and changes the concept from a weapon of last resort in a doomsday scenario (which is cool to speculate about) to just trying to restore the status quo in the event one of those cool speculative things happens.”

There has never been a case where GW filled in lore that was better than just leaving it up the the players imagination.But this is by far the most atrocious example. Not even close.

“Dislike... outright annoyed by it,” added Drxero1xero. “Huge mystery, leave it unknown or make a novel or three out of it... Nope throw it away in text box in a codex.

“GW are little by little sucking the fun out of warhammer's settings, flat and colorless... no mystery, all little bites of lore…”

GW is lost, they're just going to explain everything and take the mystery out of things aren't they?

“I feel like this not only completely undermines the whole mystery, but it doesn't even work. At all,” said TheVoidDragon.

“The cool thing about the lore was not quite knowing what it was, what it would do, or what it was even about. The mystery and speculation on what it could be was what made it intriguing for so many years. To now just outright define it takes all that way completely, it's just plainly stated exactly what it is as if it doesn't matter.”

Leaving mysteries is essential to the mystique of 40k. If a mystery must be revealed, it must be a magnificent piece of writing. In this case, they marble brained one of the most foreboding and cool things the grey knights had. FFS GW

The next obvious question is, will The Terminus Decree come into effect any time soon? Will we see, perhaps in a novel, another codex, or a blog post, the Grey Knights actually fight the Custodes because the Emperor has somehow revived himself? Or is this just an odd spike of activity in Warhammer 40,000 lore that causes a kerfuffle now, but won't lead to anything for years to come?

Like the Warp itself, Games Workshop sometimes feels unknowable.

I have suffered immensely in the name of alleviating suffering. 

In today's spiritual-industrial complex, enlightenment is no longer a quiet inner unfolding—it's a product, packaged and sold with the urgency of a miracle cure. Like many seekers, I spent years chasing its promises, convinced I was healing, evolving, and waking up. 

But my story doesn't follow the familiar arc of someone raised in a conventional religious household, quietly questioning doctrine until skepticism finally wins out. I wasn't dragged to church on Sundays or made to sit through sermons that clashed with an emerging rational mind. I didn't grow up chafing against the confines of Abrahamic faith, searching for truth outside its dogmas. 

My path was different—not a rebellion against inherited tradition, but a wholehearted plunge into the spiritual fringe, because that's the culture I was born and raised in. I wasn't escaping rigid dogma; I was further drawn to teachings that promised hidden knowledge, inner awakening, and cosmic truth that had been taught to me as a child. In my world, doubt wasn't something to investigate or resolve—it was something to transcend. You were encouraged to distrust mainstream science, question Western medicine, and reject “limiting beliefs,” but not in the service of rational and real understanding. Instead, skepticism was rerouted into a spiritual superiority: if you doubted what “they” (scientists, doctors, the media) told you, you were simply and joyously waking up. The more disillusioned you became with conventional knowledge, the more enlightened you were becoming—or so you were told. 

It wasn't doubt in pursuit of truth; it was doubt weaponized as identity, a badge of higher knowing. Critical thinking was encouraged only to the extent that it led you away from consensus reality and deeper into the echo chamber of cosmic certainties. 

I was raised immersed in New Age spiritual slop—no, I was waterboarded with it. 

From the time I was nine or ten, Tibetan lamas wandered through my living room, playing flutes or reciting poetry, their shaved heads and russet robes testament to their monastic paths. Shamans, psychics, astrologers, and mediums were a part of daily life. My mother, raised Mormon, had rejected her own rigid upbringing and headed for Big Sur and the Esalen Institute—ground zero for all things New Age Human Potential—from Washington state, in a VW van, looking to break free from her evangelical upbringing, eventually raising me in her idealistic post-adolescent vision of enlightenment. 

Bedtime lullabies were replaced with mantras. Lunches came packed with sprouted seed bread and tempeh. Friday nights weren't for movies—they were for goddess circles under the moon, sometimes featuring naked dancing women invoking divine feminine energy. 

Then, my mother “got serious.” And by serious, I mean she fell into one of the more dangerous corners of Eastern spiritual philosophy: Advaita Vedanta. 

(Side note: If you're a nondualist and a parent, and you catch yourself thinking, “This is so beautiful—I want to raise my child in the liberating knowledge that they are no one, nothing, and that nothing is real…” please report immediately to Child Protective Services. You can collect your child when you've reconnected with reality.) 

Advaita, in its Westernized, and very misunderstood form, became the most destabilizing force in my young life. It taught that “the self is an illusion,” that “reality is maya,” and that “what you truly are was never born and never dies.” These concepts, introduced to me as a child without a stable psychological framework, led me straight into dissociation, anxiety, and a profound inability to feel grounded or attached to reality. I was mushy and unformed and told by Ramana Maharshi devotees that I was “no one,” “no name,” “no form.” I was terrified and confused, and in this liminal state, I was bypassing my life, not living it. 

So, I did what I had always seen modeled: I kept seeking. 

I chased wellness through yoga teacher training with Bikram Choudhury at age 18 (cough), dabbled in quantum quackery with Joe Dispenza, and earnestly “worked on myself” through Byron Katie's The Work—a spiritual Mad Libs exercise where you gaslight your own suffering into nonexistence. I even made the pilgrimage to Esalen myself decades after my mom made her first trip for several retreats ranging from disembodied-entity channeling to psychedelic breath bonanzas. I got sucked into the wellness culture's detox trap and endured cruel and unusual cleanses (i.e., 90-minute daily colonics followed by herbal flushes) that left me frail and faint and passing out in the middle of a Hawaiian jungle. 

Then I met my guru. 

She was raw, funny, and embodied, unlike any spiritual teacher I'd encountered. She assigned mantras for prosperity, prescribed cleanses to “raise vibrational energy,” and encouraged hours of daily chanting. I wore white and meditated on a sheepskin rug for hours each day. This was it, I found my purpose, my teacher, my community. 

And then—suddenly—she died. 

Her death shattered me. It jolted me into looking more closely at the pattern of my life: this compulsive, untethered quest for transcendence. So, as a last-ditch effort, I spent a week in a sensory deprivation cave trying to access endogenous DMT (dimethyltryptamine—a psychedelic that is naturally produced in humans and other mammals present in brain and body tissue, but whose exact roles and origins, especially in the pineal gland [René Descartes' “seat of the soul”], is yet to be determined)—but all I accessed was a full-blown existential crisis and an irrational fear of my own breathing. 

I was haunted by remnants of Advaita: None of this is real. You are no one. What you truly are was never born. This duality—nothingness alongside the weight of needing enlightenment—created unbearable cognitive friction. I wasn't living; I was striving for something that required me to deny the life I actually had. 

Simone de Beauvoir once wrote of such teachings: “They have denied life, considering it a veil of illusion beneath which is hidden the truth of Nirvana.” I wish I had read her sooner. 

But it took many more years of wandering through the spiritual marketplace before I began to see the depth of the problem. One of the most insidious elements is the way neo-Advaita's nihilistic “we are nothing” message gets tangled with New Age affirmations of the “divine universe.” One moment: “The Great Spirit is telling me…,” the next: “I am one with everything.” Pick a side. 

Nietzsche captured the contradiction well when he criticized Vedanta for its “double lie,” a supposedly nondualistic philosophy that's essentially dualistic at its core. If we are all already enlightened, who exactly is seeking? If we are one, what is this flaw that needs fixing? This contradiction is what the Buddha pushed back on with his doctrine of anatta—no self. His teaching wasn't: Follow me. It was: See for yourself. 

So, I did. 

And what I saw, was that I had been really stupid. I had been gullible. Naïve. Easily manipulated. But I also wasn't alone. Our entire culture—especially in America—is scientifically illiterate, primed for magical thinking and longing for metaphysical quick fixes. 

I started reading the work of scientists and skeptics. I retrained my brain to ask questions, demand evidence, and validate claims. Carl Sagan's principle shot ice through my veins, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” I had subscribed to outlandish and extraordinary claims my entire life without a shred of evidence. So, I began a different type of quest—one for answers: 

No. At least there is no demonstrable, repeatable, credible evidence. Not for ghosts, gods, karma, psychic abilities, reincarnation, or cosmic messaging. Nada, Zip, Zilch, the Square Root of Zilch, the nth Root! 

The divine, I came to realize, is a human invention. Those mythologies that we still quote today, ancient wisdom from prescientific cultures, are no match for what we now know from neuroscience and cosmology. 

But science is hard. It's rigorous. It doesn't conform to your deepest wishes, comfort you with simple answers, or tell you that everything happens for a reason. Ancient wisdom, on the other hand, is easy. It wraps itself in mystery and metaphors and demands only faith. It's also deeply outdated. 

And yet science, in all its complexity, has brought me to the most grounded peace I've ever known. I have divorced myself from the fantasy that the universe is a conscious entity with a plan for my life. From the idea that I have an immortal soul, that stars guide my fate, that disembodied spirits have messages for me, or that I was born with a divine purpose. 

When I say I don't believe in God, or souls, or an afterlife—at all—I often hear: “Then what's the point? Isn't that depressing?” 

No. It's liberating. 

I no longer live tethered to a cosmic daddy or a mystical mommy or a supernatural overseer of any kind. My life is my own. My purpose is derived from my own meaning, my own choosing. I am a fallible, biological brain inside of a body—mortal, material, real. Simply a part of nature and of this earth. 

And that's good enough for me!

            Dangerous torrential rainfall and flash flooding are underway in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Thursday with millions at risk along the Interstate 95 corridor. It's shaping up to be another serious flood event in a summer that's been full of them.
    


            In New York City, heavy rains have halted traffic along a major east-west thoroughfare in Queens, east of Manhattan. At least two cars are submerged on the expressway, a law enforcement official told CNN. Video from the area shows cars and a semi-truck stranded in the water, with one man seen sitting on the roof of his car while he waits to be rescued.
    


            Heavy storms developed in the afternoon and will last through the evening. Some could dump several inches of rain in a few hours, flooding roads and threatening public transit during the busy afternoon and evening commute.
    


            Flash flood warnings were active in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia by mid-afternoon with more drenching storms to come. There have already been reports of flooded roads and stranded vehicles in Maryland and Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service and local officials.
    


            The Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 3 of 4 risk for flooding rain from Washington, DC, to New York City and the southernmost part of Connecticut. This threat level means numerous flash floods are likely, some of which could threaten life and property in vulnerable urban areas. Philadelphia and Baltimore are also included in this risk area.
    


            New Jersey is under a state of emergency due to the potential for intense rainfall and flash flooding, according to a news release from acting Gov. Tahesha Way.
    


            “I urge all New Jerseyans to remain alert, follow all safety protocols, and monitor the proper channels for the duration of these storms,” Way said in the release. “Residents should remain off the roads and indoors unless absolutely necessary.”
    


            Gov. Kathy Hochul has also declared a state of emergency for New York City and its surrounding counties due to the potential flooding.
    


            Travel disruptions could be severe as the heaviest rain continues through the evening commute. Subways could also see serious flooding, as New York saw earlier this month, when intense rainfall in the span of hours sent water gushing onto platforms and into subway cars.
    


            Air travel woes were growing late Thursday afternoon, with ground stops in effect at Newark International, LaGuardia, Dulles International, Baltimore-Washington International and Philadelphia International airports, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport was experiencing average delays of around three hours. Thousands of flights within, into and out of the US have been cancelled or delayed, according to FlightAware.com.
    


            Some storms are expected to train, or continue moving or redeveloping over the same areas, raising rainfall totals considerably. A few locations within the Level 3 of 4 area could get up to 8 inches of rain in a short amount of time.
    


            The rain is due to a cold front that is breaking a long-lasting, punishing heat dome that has been keeping the East sweltering during the day and simmering at night.
    


            After a summer of frequent rain and flooding, the water simply has no place to go. And even if the region wasn't soaked, extreme rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour could overwhelm areas that typically drain well. Cities often struggle to handle heavy rain as pavement and asphalt keep water from soaking into the ground and instead head for drains that are prone to clogging or simply incapable of handling the volume of water.
    


Flash floods are most common in summer, as warmer air can hold more moisture and intense daytime heat helps fuel potent storms. But overwhelming rainfall is becoming more prevalent due to climate change, as rising global temperatures drive weather toward extremes. Hourly rainfall rates have grown heavier in nearly 90% of large US cities since 1970, according to a study from the nonprofit research group Climate Central.
    


            Rainfall across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast has already been above normal this summer — especially in parts of eastern Pennsylvania, central New Jersey, northern Maryland, and the DC suburbs — leaving soils saturated and primed for rapid runoff and flooding even without extreme amounts of rain.
    


            Nearly all of New Jersey is in the risk area. The state has been slammed by flooding this summer, including when at least two people were killed two weeks ago. The increased risk also includes parts of Virginia that have flooded multiple times this season.
    


            Flooding can be extremely dangerous at night, when it's harder to see water covering roads. “If you encounter a flooded roadway, turn around and find another route,” the National Weather Service advises. “It only takes six inches of fast‑moving water to knock over an adult and just 12 inches to sweep away most vehicles.”
    


            Less than two weeks ago, on July 19, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency — the highest level of flood alert — for the Washington, DC, area with rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches in 30 minutes raising rivers and sending water over roadways. Dozens of people had to be rescued from floodwaters after heavy rain struck parts of Virginia, Maryland and Washington, DC.
    


            Heavy storms will come to an end Thursday night for much of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The flood risk shifts south into the Carolinas and part of Georgia on Friday, more states all too familiar with serious flooding this summer. Tropical Storm Chantal's flooding rainfall killed at least one person in North Carolina in early July.

For years, mad and disabled people have been asking Americans to fight the criminalization of disability. Will they?

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Americans love a Victorian asylum. As paranormal entertainment, they offer thrill-seeking with the assumption that the days are long gone when almost anyone could have you committed for almost any reason, often for life. 

Yet for decades, academics, pundits, and politicians across the political spectrum have been openly calling for a return to the asylum. Now, a new executive order signed by Trump on June 24, 2025, proposes that states use civil commitment laws to disappear unhoused people, mad and disabled people, and (some) people who use drugs into long-term congregate institutions and coercive programs. Welcome back to the asylum.

Deploying a punitive approach to houselessness, substance use, and psychiatric disability, the executive order, aptly titled “ENDING CRIME AND DISORDER ON AMERICA'S STREETS,” paints a familiar picture of dangerous and undesirable vagrants that must be purged from society and forcibly cured for the sake of order. It reproduces a long-perpetrated false narrative that the root causes of houselessness are “serious mental illness and addiction,” rather than skyrocketing housing costs. The executive order ends federal support for harm reduction programs and the Housing First model, instead incentivizing states and localities to adopt or expand the law-and-order approach. It would also allow police to access the protected health data of unhoused people, contributing to the growth of carceral AI beyond its already expansive reach on disabled and mad people and their caregivers.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

While the publication of the executive order has led to panicked coverage in the media and online, mad, disabled, and unhoused people have been sounding the alarm for years. “Disabled people have been telling you that the weaponization of disability against you was coming,” said disability advocate Imani Barbarin in a post calling out the overwrought reactions of those who have previously been largely silent on the ongoing scapegoating, abandonment, confinement, and social murder of people with psychiatric and other disabilities. 

Online, this executive order has already been compared to the earliest chapters of the Nazi Holocaust, with some commentators drawing parallels to the “Aktion Arbeitsscheu Reich,” or Operation Work-Shy, which began in 1938 and targeted “anti-social elements” including alcoholics, the unemployed, and vagrants, among many other categories. This operation preceded Aktion T4, the Nazi euthanasia program that in 1939 ushered in the holocaust with the mass murder of disabled people.

Public health educator Azrael Mae Ní Mháille, who is active in PWUD organizing (harm reduction activism led by people who use drugs), posted on July 25, 2025, in response to the executive order, saying: “Calls for a return of the violently ableist asylum system, or the continued restrengthening of the deeply racist post-emancipation anti-vagrancy laws, stop just short of calling for a return to legalized chattel slavery, or for a new Aktion T4.” 

In the U.S., the birthplace of the eugenics movement that inspired Adolf Hitler, the rounding up and confinement of “undesirables” in asylums, institutions, and detention centers is what scholar Jess Whatcott terms carceral eugenics. 

While the historical parallels are chilling, we need not look that far back. Efforts to bring the asylum into the community have been underway in the U.S. since the late 1990s, in the form of states' involuntary outpatient commitment laws. These laws create civil courts that mandate treatment, with the threat of psychiatric incarceration for noncompliance with orders. 

The provisions in the new executive order will be familiar to anyone tracking “anti-camping” legislation that has emerged in a number of states and over 100 cities over the last several years, with an involuntary psychiatric intervention component. At the forefront of these efforts is the Koch-funded Cicero Institute, a right-wing think tank led by venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir along with Peter Thiel. 

Regressive measures like California's Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Act signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2022 enacted the CARE Court system, which compels people with psychiatric disabilities into treatment, and as Disability Rights California noted, creates a “new pathway to conservatorship.”

In New York, Mayor Eric Adams' involuntary removals policy promotes similar approaches that disappear people with mental health differences from public and private spaces under the guise of treatment. 

And little over a year ago, the Supreme Court's ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson further criminalized houselessness, giving cities the go-ahead to fine, ticket, and detain unhoused neighbors even when no shelter is available.

The executive order's dystopic vision has always been here, driven by “carceral sanism” and “racial criminal pathologization” — language that Liat Ben-Moshe, one of the authors of this piece, coined to describe the varied ways in which the state pathologizes madness, disability, race, and class to justify disappearing and mandating people into prisons, psychiatric facilities, and other coercive systems that are simultaneously branded as care and public safety. 

With housing and health care still considered privileges for the deserving and not rights in the United States, the scapegoating of disabled and unhoused people continues.

The various bans on sleeping outside have been described as a war on the unhoused, reminiscent of past wars on drugs and the war on poverty. They are about building out racial criminal pathologization infrastructure, alongside other forms of capture and confinement (the prison-industrial complex, ICE, and immigration detention). 

It's therefore important to consider the executive order alongside the budget reconciliation megabill that became law on July 4, 2025. This legislation advances a death-making necropolitics that is distinctly all-American. The megabill's eugenicist provisions include $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid that will strip 17 million Americans of health insurance and food assistance, leading to hunger, disablement, chronic illness, and preventable death. Hand in hand, it includes unprecedented funding for state-sponsored violence over the next four years: $75 billion for ICE and $150 billion for the military — the largest defense budget in U.S. history. Then there are the billions annually that successive administrations have pumped into the Israeli military machine to enable occupation, apartheid, and mass disablement and genocide in Palestine. 

With public dollars pouring into the hands of the billionaires and the jaws of the military, police, and surveillance states, and with housing and health care still considered privileges for the deserving and not rights in the United States, the scapegoating of disabled and unhoused people continues.

This executive order deploys well-worn fascist tactics designed to instill fear and confusion into the populace. Critically, such orders only apply to the actions of the federal government. While the feds can give or withhold resources to incentivize states to follow certain carceral federal policies, many states are already pushing back on these new orders.

We can look to history for parallel horrors, but we can also find analogues for resistance. Prior to the early 1970s, most folks could be put away in an institution for life with virtually no due process. Deinstitutionalization was the outcome of decades of multi-faceted organizing and analysis by mad and disabled people and movements, and the activist parents, attorneys and policymakers connected to them. They successfully pushed through reforms that fundamentally altered a century of mental health policy, granting disabled people legal protections from arbitrary confinement. For now, the federal government cannot simply erase these momentous achievements, censor the lessons learned from closing down asylums, or eliminate states' existing civil commitment laws and standards, eroding as they may be, at the stroke of a pen. 

Prior to the early 1970s, most folks could be put away in an institution for life with virtually no due process.

Despite the well-worn argument  that deinstitutionalization, or the closure of large institutions beginning in the mid-1950s in America and continuing through the 1980s, was a colossal failure, abandoning people in the streets and in prisons, it is important to remind that it was one of the largest decarceration movements in U.S. history — a success of activism, not its failure. Rather, a well-organized campaign of political haranguing and media narratives steeped in neoliberal racism  has driven policies and priorities over decades that scapegoated this activism against criminal racial pathologization and have culminated in the present moment.

Time will tell how the ongoing dystopia unfolds. Will venture capitalists and private equity firms  snake into “cradle to grave” services, as they have already done with other forms of carceral sanism and the prison industry? For example, GEO Care, the subsidiary of the for profit prison company GEO Group, already operates residential psychiatric treatment hospitals in such states as Florida, South Carolina, and Texas. Alternatively, perhaps billions will be extracted from taxpayers and spent on programs that provide no housing and little discernable on-the-ground impact, as with Newsom's CARE Court — enacting the true “waste, fraud, and abuse” (as opposed to the false claims of waste, fraud, and abuse that Trump has been circulating). 

When a war is declared, it is not only about the money but the dispersal of weapons and the creation of scapegoat targets. This is why it is vital to heed what activists in the housing justice, mad justice, disability justice, abolitionist, and harm reduction movements have to say about this new executive order, and what this means for our movements now.

“We are not helpless to prevent the worst of this,” wrote Ní Mháille. “In spite of the many who will willingly collaborate, there are those of us who will resist what is coming at the cost of our salaries, our reputations, our freedom, and our safety. We have seen what this leads to. We must refuse to be collaborative, compliant, nor complacent.”

Mad and disabled organizers have long been building and preparing for times like these, showing us how to build and deepen diffuse networks of collective care.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday plans to reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test for American schoolchildren, a program created in 1966 to help interest young people in following healthy, active lifestyles.

Children had to run and perform situps, pullups or pushups and a sit-and-reach test, but the program changed in 2012 during the Obama administration to focus more on individual health than athletic feats.

The president “wants to ensure America's future generations are strong, healthy, and successful,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, and that all young Americans “have the opportunity to emphasize healthy, active lifestyles — creating a culture of strength and excellence for years to come.” 

In a late afternoon ceremony at the White House, Trump intends to sign an order reestablishing the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, as well as the fitness test, to be administered by his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The council also will develop criteria for a Presidential Fitness Award.

In 2012, the assessment evolved into the Youth Fitness Program, which the government said “moved away from recognizing athletic performance to providing a barometer on student's health.” Then-first lady Michelle Obama also promoted her “Let's Move” initiative focused on reducing childhood obesity through diet and exercise.

Reinvigorating the sports council and the fitness test fits with Trump's focus on athletics.




The Republican president played baseball in high school and plays golf almost every weekend. Much of the domestic travel he has done this year that is not related to weekend golf games at his clubs in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia was built around attending sporting events, including the Super Bowl, Daytona 500 and UFC matches. 

The announcement Thursday comes as Trump readies the United States to host the 2025 Ryder Cup, 2026 FIFA World Cup games and the 2028 Summer Olympics. 

The Youth Fitness Test, according to a Health and Human Services Department website last updated in 2023 but still online Thursday, “minimizes comparisons between children and instead supports students as they pursue personal fitness goals for lifelong health.”

Expected to join Trump at the event are several prominent athletes, including some who have faced controversy.

They include Trump friend and pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau; Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker; Swedish golfer Annika Sorenstam; WWE chief content officer Paul “Triple H” Levesque, the son-in-law of Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon; and former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, a registered sex offender.

The NFL distanced itself from comments Butker made last year during a commencement address at a Kansas college, when he said most of the women receiving degrees were probably more excited about getting married and having children than entering the workforce and that some Catholic leaders were “pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America.” Butker also assailed Pride Month and railed against Democratic President Joe Biden's stance on abortion.

Butker later formed a political action committee designed to encourage Christians to vote for what the PAC describes as “traditional values.”

Sorenstam faced backlash for accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump on Jan. 7, 2021, the day after rioters spurred by Trump's false claims about his election loss to Biden stormed the Capitol in Washington. 

Taylor, who has appeared on stage with Trump at campaign rallies, pleaded guilty in New York in 2011 to misdemeanor criminal charges of sexual misconduct. He was sentenced to six years of probation and ordered to register as a sex offender. He was arrested in 2021 in Broward County, Florida, and charged with failing to report a change of residence as a sex offender. He later pleaded no contest to an amended charge, was ordered to pay $261 in court fees, and the case was closed, court records show. 

The return of the exam brought mixed reactions from some who study exercise.

Trump is putting a welcome focus on physical activity, but a test alone won't make America's children healthier, said Laura Richardson, a kinesiology professor at the University of Michigan. The exam is only a starting point that should be paired with lessons to help all students improve, she said.

“It's not just, you get a score and you're doomed,” said Richardson, whose teaching focuses on obesity. “But you get a score, and we can figure out a program that really helps the improvement.”

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday debuted ""Project Crypto,"" an initiative to modernize securities rules and regulations to allow for crypto-based trading.

""To achieve President Trump's vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one,"" SEC chair Paul Atkins said in remarks to an ""American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution"" conference Thursday afternoon , referring to blockchain technology that enables cryptocurrencies, but has other applications as well.

""I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets ... Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them.""

The announcement comes amid a groundswell of investor interest in tokenization, or the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly-traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value. Holders of tokenized assets don't have outright ownership of the assets themselves. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has said he sees the ""tokenization of every financial asset"" as an important step in ""the technological revolution in the financial markets.""

Crypto trading platforms Robinhood, Gemini and Kraken have all opened tokenized equity offerings to users outside the U.S., and Coinbase has said it's pushing for SEC for approval to offer a similar service.

Atkins, the SEC chair, highlighted ""super apps"" (such as one Coinbase introduced two weeks ago) as a priority of his chairmanship, noting the need to allow the apps to thrive with an ""efficient licensing structure,"" rather than subject to multiple regulatory authorities.

So-called super apps like WeChat and Alipay – which bundle several different services and functionalities into a single mobile app – have long been viewed as the holy grail of financial technology by the industry. They're central to everyday life in China but haven't been successfully replicated in the West. Meta Platforms and X have made attempts to realize that vision, integrating payments, messaging and social content, among other functions. 

Atkins also said the Trump administration will work to prevent ""innovative"" companies from being driven offshore by burdensome regulations, and said the SEC ""will encourage our nation's builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules.""

The SEC proposal comes one day after the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released a long-awaited report with recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to boost U.S. dominance in digital asset markets. Atkins said he has directed the SEC's Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, to work with other parts of the SEC to implement the working group  recommendations.

The Thursday conference was sponsored by the America First Policy Institute, a think tank begun in 2021 to promote President Trump's policy agenda. The institute was founded by Brooke Rollins, the current Secretary of Agriculture, and Larry Kudlow, Trump's former director of the National Economic Council.

When Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the global coffee chain in September, inflation was up and store traffic and sales were down.

On Wednesday, the 50-year-old executive detailed his plan to turn Starbucks around. The company's new ""green apron service model"" — focusing on hospitality and efficiency — will differentiate the company from competitors and boost its sales, Niccol told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

""Starbucks, unfortunately, has been mismanaged for a couple of years,"" said Niccol. ""And we're fortunate that we have such a strong, resilient brand that I think we're going to be able to bounce back with the right programs and the right strategy.""

Last week, Starbucks began training baristas on the green apron model, which includes reducing the number of hours per store with minimum staffing, adding a ""smart queue"" to help customers get their orders in four minutes or less, and encouraging more personalized interactions between guests and employees, and new menu items, Niccol said.

Starbucks' renewed focus on customer service is part of Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy, which he implemented upon becoming the chain's CEO. The company's quarterly earnings on Tuesday were lackluster, with same-store sales falling for a sixth consecutive quarter, dating back to previous CEO Laxman Narasimhan's tenure.

Getting back to the ""operational foundation"" of the business will put them ahead of schedule for a comeback, said Niccol.

Some Wall Street analysts are confident in Niccol's strategy. ""The focus for Starbucks' third fiscal quarter was less on the results (which were below Street expectations) and more on proof points on the pace of the potential recovery ahead,"" Sharon Zackfia, a William Blair analyst wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Another analyst, Andrew Charles of T.D. Cowen, also wrote in a Wednesday research note that he's confident Starbucks' sales will grow because of the company's ""more aggressive innovation agenda.""

Niccol has a reputation for corporate turnarounds. He was CEO of Chipotle for six years before joining Starbucks, and under his leadership, Chipotle swiftly bounced back from food safety scares, improved its annual sales and its stock climbed 773% — a record for the company.

As CEO of Taco Bell from 2015 to 2018, Niccol introduced initiatives including mobile ordering across the U.S. and the brand's ""Live Mas"" slogan.

""We're definitely ahead of schedule on fixing the operational foundation,"" Niccol said on Wednesday. ""[Our strategy] ultimately will result in a better Starbucks.""

Amazon shares slid more than 3% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded expectations, but it gave light operating income guidance for the current period. 

Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Wall Street is also looking at other key revenue numbers: 

Amazon's second-quarter sales grew 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, an acceleration from a year ago, when revenue expanded 10%. 

For the current quarter, Amazon said it expects operating income to land between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. Analysts were looking for $19.48 billion, according to StreetAccount. 

The guidance spooked investors who are eager to see Amazon's hefty investments in artificial intelligence pay off. The company has committed to spend up to $100 billion this year on AI as it races to build out infrastructure and software.

""Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I'm excited for what lies ahead,"" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings release.

Revenue in the third quarter is forecast to be $174 billion to $179.5 billion, representing growth of 10% to 13% year over year. Analysts surveyed by StreetAccount forecast $173.1 billion in revenue.

For the second quarter in a row, Amazon included ""tariff and trade policies"" as factors that could affect its guidance. President Donald Trump's shifting trade policies stand to impact its core retail business the most, though consumer spending has proven to be more resilient than analysts feared. 

Sales in Amazon's online stores unit grew 11% year over year to $61.5 billion during the quarter, topping Wall Street's projected $59 billion.

Best Buy said Thursday it will test mini-showrooms in some of its stores featuring Ikea products to show off kitchen design elements from the home retailer beside home appliances from the electronics store.

Beginning this fall, the program will debut in 10 Best Buy stores across Florida and Texas. Each store will feature a 1,000-square-foot Ikea ""shop-in-shop"" showcasing styled kitchens and laundry rooms.

""By bringing together our home furnishing expertise, products, and services with Best Buy's leadership in appliances and technology, we're creating a one-stop destination where customers can design their dream kitchen, storage solutions or laundry space with ease,"" Rob Olson, chief operation officer of Ikea U.S. said in a Thursday press release.

The companies did not disclose financial aspects of the partnership.

IKEA is the Swedish flat-pack furniture giant, while Best Buy is one of the United States' top consumer electronic stores.

The partnership comes as Best Buy looks for new ways to attract shoppers.

The company has struggled lately with rising tariff pressures, a soft demand in appliances, and a sluggish housing market. Best Buy said this spring that it had increased prices on some items due to tariffs.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifaceted disease associated with several factors, including diet, genetics, exercise, sleep and gut microbiome. Current diagnostic and monitoring methods based on episodic assays like glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) fail to capture its full complexity. Here, in a prospective cohort of 1,137 participants in the United States, we analyzed multimodal data from 347 deeply phenotyped individuals (174 normoglycemic, 79 prediabetic and 94 T2D). We found significant differences in the distribution of glucose spike metrics among different diabetes states, with longer expected time for spike resolution and higher values of nocturnal hypoglycemia in T2D. We identified significant correlations between mean glucose level and gut microbiome diversity, and between expected time for spike resolution and resting heart rate. Our multimodal glycemic risk profiles, validated in 1,955 normoglycemic and 114 prediabetic individuals from an independent cohort, improved risk stratification by highlighting substantial variability among individuals with the same value of HbA1c. Such a multimodal approach provides a detailed phenotype that can potentially improve T2D prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and is more informative than HbA1c.

In the United States, 38.4 million people have diabetes, and 97.6 million people aged 18 years or older have prediabetes1. Despite the multiple factors that may influence an individual's glucose homeostasis, we continue to rely solely on glycated HbA1c and fasting glucose measurements for diagnosis and monitoring2,3,4,5. Previous research indicated a high frequency of postprandial abnormal glucose spikes in healthy individuals6,7,8, but the basis of these spikes is poorly understood. Factors such as age9, diet10, physical activity11, sleep12, gut microbiome constituents13, stress14, comorbidities15,16 and genetics17 are thought to be potential modulators. Taking a holistic approach encompassing multimodal data could greatly enhance understanding of individual variability in glucose spikes. Prior studies established the foundation for multimodal analysis of glucose dynamics, but they are limited in scope as they focused primarily on normoglycemic and prediabetic individuals7,8 and did not place specific emphasis on ensuring adequate representation of all individuals, including those underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR).

We conducted a prospective, site-less clinical trial to collect multimodal data from a diverse group of participants with a range of abnormal glucose homeostasis, from normoglycemia to prediabetes (or intermediate hyperglycemia) to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The PRediction Of Glycemic RESponse Study (PROGRESS) digitally enrolled 1,137 participants in the United States who were asked to provide a unique combination of demographic, anthropometric, clinical, physiological, biological and lifestyle data (Fig. 1) Building on the promising results of previous studies based on continuous monitoring of glucose levels6,7,8,18,19, we remotely collected multimodal data that enabled the development of an advanced model for enhanced risk stratification of prediabetic individuals. The analytical techniques developed in this study were subsequently tested using Human Phenotype Project (HPP) data, including 12,014 deeply phenotyped individuals.

a, Tools for multimodal remote data collection in PROGRESS, including study-provided wearable devices and kits for biosample self-collection. b, Visual representation of the definition of a glucose spike: a rise in glucose level of at least 30 mg dl−1 within 90 min or less. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com.

The aim of this work was to investigate the determinants of abnormal glucose spikes across different diabetes states and to leverage multimodal data to define multimodal glycemic risk profiles that can potentially change our approach to preventing and treating T2D by enhancing early diagnosis and improving monitoring of prediabetes and prediction of T2D.

Between 3 November 2021 and 1 September 2023, PROGRESS enrolled 1,137 individuals, of whom 423 (37.2%) were normoglycemic, 316 (27.8%) were prediabetic and 398 (35.0%) had T2D, based on self-reported data. Among enrolled participants, 463 shared their Fitbit data, 445 shared their food logging data and 412 shared their continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device data during the 10-day period of active tracking; 657 participants shared their electronic health record (EHR) data. For 503 of the enrolled participants, an HbA1c value was available from self-collected blood samples; for 471 participants, probiotic scores and Shannon diversity indices were computed from self-collected stool samples; and, for 506 participants, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for T2D was derived from the analysis of self-collected saliva samples. Of the 1,137 enrolled participants, 73 withdrew from the study. Based on EHR data, we manually excluded 13 participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or taking insulin at the time of enrollment.

For this analysis, we considered participants who wore the CGM device for at least 16 h per day and at least 5 days. We excluded participants who did not report their age or sex or whose HbA1c was not available. We included 347 individuals, of whom 174 (50.1%) were normoglycemic, 79 (22.8%) were prediabetic and 94 (27.1%) had T2D (Extended Data Fig. 1).

The average age of the selected population was 49.1 ± 15.6 years (mean ± s.d.), and 66.9% were females. The average body mass index (BMI) was 27.8 ± 7.0 kg m−2. The differences between the participants included in the analysis and those excluded from the analysis were not statistically significant in terms of age (t-test, P = 0.970) and sex (Fisherʼs exact test, P = 0.200).

Participants were considered UBR if they self-identified as any of the following: race and ethnicity other than White; gender identity other than male or female; age > 65 years; less than a high school diploma; or resides in a rural zip code20. By these criteria, 48.1% of the selected participants were UBR, and 23.3% were UBR for race/ethnicity (Table 1).

We analyzed the following glucose spike metrics: the mean glucose level, the nocturnal hypoglycemia, the percentage of time spent above 150 mg dl−1, the expected maximum spike value relative to the baseline, the expected daily number of spikes and the spike resolution (average time required to absorb 50% of the glucose spike). Statistically significant differences, while controlling for age, sex and PRS, in all glucose spike metrics were observed between individuals with T2D and normoglycemic individuals (P < 0.001 for all metrics, except for the expected daily number of spikes where P = 0.001). Prediabetic individuals showed statistically significant differences compared to individuals with T2D in terms of expected daily number of spikes (partial eta squared (ηp2) = 0.036, P = 0.019) and expected maximum spike relative value (ηp2 = 0.102, P < 0.001). However, these differences were not observed when comparing prediabetic to normoglycemic individuals (P = 0.727 and P = 0.919, respectively). Furthermore, the differences between prediabetic and T2D were more pronounced compared to the differences between prediabetic and normoglycemic in terms of spike resolution (ηp2 = 0.139, P < 0.001 compared to T2D; ηp2 = 0.068, P < 0.001 compared to normoglycemic), percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia (ηp2 = 0.167, P < 0.001 compared to T2D; ηp2 = 0.091, P < 0.001 compared to normoglycemic), mean glucose level (ηp2 = 0.143, P < 0.001 compared to T2D; ηp2 = 0.110, P < 0.001 compared to normoglycemic) and nocturnal hypoglycemia (ηp2 = 0.068, P = 0.001 compared to T2D; ηp2 = 0.061, P < 0.001 compared to normoglycemic) (Fig. 2).

a–f, Glucose spike metrics box plots: mean glucose level, defined as the average of glucose values over the entire tracking period (a); expected maximum spike relative value, defined as the maximum spike value relative to the baseline, averaged across different days (b); percentage of time spent above 150 mg dl−1 (c); spike resolution, defined as the time required to absorb 50% of the glucose spike, averaged across all glucose spikes (d); expected daily number of spikes, defined as the daily number of glucose spikes, averaged across different days (e); and nocturnal hypoglycemia, defined as the average minimum glucose value occurring between 24:00 and 7:00, averaged across different days (f). The glucose spike metrics are reported by stratifying them based on self-reported diabetes status (normoglycemia, n = 174; prediabetes, n = 79; T2D, n = 94). The boxes represent the interquartile range, the vertical lines are the median values, and the whiskers show the 5th and 95th percentiles.

Reference values of the multimodal variables considered in the analysis and the distributions of glucose spike metrics across diabetes states are reported (Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2).

By analyzing the drug exposure table from the EHR data, we discovered that, of the 347 participants included in our study, 78 individuals were prescribed antihyperglycemic medications. Among them, 64 had T2D, 12 were prediabetic and 2 were normoglycemic. We did not find statistically significant differences in glucose spike metrics between individuals with T2D who were taking antihyperglycemic medications and those who were not (n = 30).

To investigate the associations between the glucose spike metrics and demographic, anthropometric, biological, physiological and lifestyle factors, we computed the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) while controlling for age, sex and PRS. The available multimodal factors were divided into three groups (demographic factors, metabolic factors and lifestyle factors) based on their potential for intervention. Age was the only demographic factor that exhibited statistically significant correlations with all glucose spike metrics considered except with the expected daily number of spikes (P = 0.092). Among the metabolic factors, the HbA1c was positively correlated with all the glucose spike metrics; BMI and resting heart rate were found positively correlated with mean glucose level, nocturnal hypoglycemia, percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia and spike resolution; and gut microbiome diversity was negatively correlated with all glucose spike metrics except spike resolution (with which the correlation was found not statistically significant, P = 0.240)—in particular, r = −0.301 (P < 0.001) with mean glucose level and r = −0.288 (P < 0.001) with percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia—indicating that a more diverse gut microbiome is generally associated with healthier glucose spike metrics traditionally used for monitoring purposes. Regarding lifestyle factors, the daily intake of carbohydrates showed statistically significant positive correlations with expected maximum spike relative value and the expected daily number of spikes. Notably, we observed a statistically significant negative correlation between carbohydrate intake and spike resolution, suggesting that a higher daily intake of carbohydrates is associated with a faster absorption of glucose spikes. A negative correlation was observed between activity level and all glucose spike metrics, except for the expected daily number of spikes (with which the correlation was not statistically significant, P = 0.436). This suggests that individuals who engage in higher levels of physical activity tend to exhibit more favorable glucose spike metrics (Fig. 3).

Correlations with expected daily number of spikes, expected maximum spike relative value, nocturnal hypoglycemia and percentage of time spent above 150 mg dl−1 are reported (Extended Data Fig. 3).

We designed a multimodal binary classification model, trained to separate normoglycemic individuals and individuals with T2D in the PROGRESS cohort, which had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 and a confidence interval of 0.94–0.98 (Supplementary Fig. 1). This model was tested also in the external, independent validation cohort (HPP), where we obtained AUC = 0.90 (confidence interval: 0.82–0.97) and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.60 (confidence interval: 0.40–0.77) (Supplementary Results). The feature importance analysis for this binary classification task is reported (Supplementary Fig. 2).

This model proposes a metric that is complementary to HbA1c, improving the identification of prediabetic individuals at risk of progressing into the pathological stage of the disease. We use this model to get multimodal glycemic risk profiles for T2D risk assessment (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Although we observed that the multimodal glycemic risk profiles are, on average, higher for individuals with higher values of HbA1c, we also observed substantial variability, potentially highlighting that our model is considering all available data and provides a tool to assess an individual's potential progression to T2D, beyond observing only one value of HbA1c. To validate the model, we used HPP as an external, independent cohort. As of 1 September 2024, 12,014 individuals were present in the HPP dataset. Using the same selection criteria used for PROGRESS participants, 2,069 individuals were included in the external validation dataset, of whom 1,955 (94.5%) were normoglycemic and 114 (5.5%) were prediabetic, based on self-reported data. The average age was 51.6 ± 8.0 years, and 51.9% were females. The average BMI was 26.2 ± 4.2 kg m−2. A demographic comparison between the PROGRESS prediabetic cohort and the HPP prediabetic cohort highlighted a difference in sex (Fisherʼs exact test, P = 0.003) but no statistically significant difference in age (t-test, P = 0.458). We did not have sufficient information to determine the percentage of UBR individuals in the HPP dataset.

Similar to what was observed in the prediabetic cohort in PROGRESS, the multimodal glycemic risk profiles of the prediabetic cohort in HPP showed a pattern consistent with the HbA1c values. More importantly, we observed substantial variability in the risk profile for the same values of HbA1c, potentially confirming in the external validation cohort that our model provides additional information on the progression to T2D with respect to the value of HbA1c alone (Fig. 4).

a,b, HbA1c values and multimodal glycemic risk profiles for prediabetic participants in the PROGRESS cohort (a) and for prediabetic participants in the HPP cohort (b). The multimodal glycemic risk profiles were obtained from a binary classification model trained on PROGRESS with demographics, anthropometrics, CGM, food intake and gut microbiome as input data modalities. The blue horizontal lines represent the multimodal glycemic risk profile median values after binning the HbA1c with intervals of width 0.4. The red vertical dashed lines mark the boundaries of the prediabetic range, spanning from 5.7% to 6.5%. We limited the x axis to values of HbA1c less than 9% to enhance visualization. As a result, one HPP participant with an HbA1c value of 9.5% and a multimodal glycemic risk profile equal to 0.87 was omitted from the graph.

The same considerations apply to the multimodal glycemic risk profiles of the HPP normoglycemic cohort (Extended Data Fig. 4). A comparison between PROGRESS and the external HPP validation dataset is also reported (Extended Data Table 2).

T2D and prediabetes are currently diagnosed and monitored using episodic assays of HbA1c or fasting glucose21,22. Prior studies indicated that healthy individuals, as well as those with prediabetes, have frequent, variable postprandial glucose spikes that are not detected by HbA1c or fasting glucose measurements6,7,8. We sought to understand the basis for these spikes in a range of glucose homeostatic conditions using deep phenotyping in a prospective cohort. Research has largely focused on predicting the glycemic response to individual meals. However, there has been limited exploration into effectively integrating multimodal data for monitoring and prevention purposes, and it remains unclear to what extent global glycemic patterns, observed over multiple days, can be used to characterize different diabetes states. What remains unknown are the drivers and weights of each driver for these glucose spikes, such as gut microbiome, exercise, sleep, stress, genomics, age, body habitus and comorbidities. To understand the complex relationship across these variables and their association with glucose metabolism, we collected real-world multimodal data from normoglycemic individuals, prediabetic individuals and individuals with T2D and studied how glucose spikes relate to different diabetes states and to demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biological, physiological and lifestyle factors.

We defined metrics capturing various aspects of glucose spike dynamics and demonstrated that, when considering the three groups of normoglycemic, prediabetic and T2D, there are significant differences in their overall distribution. The intermediate stage of prediabetes showed greater similarities to normoglycemia than T2D. The high variability observed within each diabetes status highlights the remarkable heterogeneity of the disease, indicating the need for individual-level analysis to adequately represent its nuances.

The correlations found between lifestyle factors and glucose spike metrics unveiled that interventions targeting dietary habits, sleep patterns and physical activity might have a measurable impact on glucose regulation. Furthermore, in line with prior studies7,8, our findings provide additional support for the critical importance of maintaining a diverse gut microbiome, which we found associated with improved glucose control. We observed a noteworthy decline in glucose spike metrics as individuals age, which emerged as the sole demographic factor exhibiting statistically significant correlations with these metrics. Interestingly, the association between the PRS for T2D and glucose spikes was not statistically significant, suggesting that a combination of environmental and genetic factors may be necessary for onset of disease.

Considering the heterogeneity of T2D, new models of disease have been proposed, such as McCarthy's palette model23, which goes beyond hard categorizations that rely on the oversimplistic view provided by routine episodic laboratory measures of hyperglycemia. Identifying these phenotypes would allow us to risk-stratify individuals to enable targeted interventions, from monitoring high-risk prediabetic individuals to promoting education and support for intensive lifestyle changes in high-risk normoglycemic individuals24. To investigate this more deeply, we designed a multimodal machine learning model for T2D risk assessment, incorporating all glucose spike metrics and multimodal factors other than HbA1c, and we applied it to PROGRESS prediabetic participants. The multimodal glycemic risk profiles generated by our model, while globally consistent with HbA1c values, delineated a more detailed phenotype able to effectively discriminate between individuals with the same HbA1c value but different glycemic patterns. We applied our model to normoglycemic and prediabetic participants from an independent cohort (HPP) for external validation. Despite the multimodal glycemic risk profiles having lower values in the HPP cohort compared to the PROGRESS cohort, there was a consistent pattern with HbA1c values and a substantial variability, albeit reduced compared to PROGRESS, in individuals with the same HbA1c. This external validation, conducted on a large dataset and on a population that is markedly different from the PROGRESS cohort in terms of geographical location, dietary habits, demographics and data acquisition methods, demonstrates the wider applicability of our multimodal glycemic risk profiles. Our findings showcase how a multimodal approach can better capture the nuances of T2D, with respect to the narrower perspective of episodic assays. Our multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model, which includes continuous biosensor data, may be instructive for future analysis of multilayered datasets that include sensors.

This work draws on recent studies exploring the potential of multimodal data, and in particular CGM, for advancing the scientific understanding of T2D and prediabetes. By combining clinical, biological, physiological and lifestyle data, many unknown patterns have been uncovered6,7,18,19,25,26, but it remains challenging to understand how multimodal analytics can change the way we practice and understand diabetes. Notably, the multivariate subphenotyping of the TUEF/TULIP prediabetic cohort (consisting of 899 prediabetic individuals) identified six distinct clusters of subphenotypes, two of which were associated with imminent risk of T2D27. Similarly, in a large cohort of 1,567,636 patients with T2D recruited in Ontario, Canada, adverse outcomes due to diabetes complications were predicted based on physician claims, laboratory results, prescriptions, medication history and other administrative heath data28.

Our study is taking this further by incorporating food intake, CGM, genetics data and gut microbiome data in addition to all the clinical data available from the EHR in both a pathologic and a non-pathologic cohort. Furthermore, digital, decentralized clinical trials, which use mobile technology such as wearable devices and digital platforms to facilitate trial processes, and where all tasks (ranging from enrollment to self-collection of biosamples) can be performed from the comfort of the participant's home, represent a clear shift from the traditional site-centric paradigm to a remote, participant-centric one29,30,31. The PROGRESS study demonstrates how decentralized digital trials allow for continuous capture of contextualized data in real-world settings while ensuring robust representation with a diverse cohort with 48.1% of participants self-identified as UBR. This exceptional representation of underrepresented individuals enhances the importance and value of our analysis, contributing to a more thorough understanding of glucose spikes across different diabetes states.

Using large studies such as HPP and combining variables from multiple sources, the variability in risk for developing T2D or further complications of the disease can be explored within different subphenotypes. Multivariate subphenotyping has already proved to be effective in predicting disease progression27. However, if based on infrequent and expensive laboratory test results, this approach may not be scalable. The PROGRESS study suggests a potential solution by demonstrating the feasibility of passive collection of physiological data through wearable devices, which allows the continuous remote monitoring of an individual's health status at finer temporal resolutions. This monitoring strategy could transform the way individuals are screened and diagnosed and ultimately how care is delivered, especially in a clinically asymptomatic cohort. Acknowledging that the appropriate infrastructure and privacy/security controls would have to be addressed, the implementation of personalized risk assessment in clinical practice would allow clinicians to gain a comprehensive understanding of individuals' health status and the risk of developing T2D, enabling timely interventions and adjustments to treatment plans. The potential impact of this approach on public health is substantial because, after prospective validation, it could effectively assess diabetes risk within primary care settings and deliver crucial information to improve preventive lifestyle programs. Ultimately, this could help reduce the prevalence of T2D and prediabetes.

This study represents the initial step toward the early diagnosis, monitoring and prevention of T2D and prediabetes through the use of multimodal data. We conducted an initial assessment of the correlations between glucose spikes and various demographic, metabolic and lifestyle factors that will inform future interventional studies focused on investigating the causal relationships that underlie these associations. Additionally, our method for multimodal risk assessment of prediabetic individuals, which was validated on an independent cross-sectional cohort, will potentially serve as a foundation for future longitudinal studies that aim to use multimodal data for T2D risk stratification. Our group intends to understand the relevance of these findings on adverse clinical outcomes of diabetes in a longitudinal cohort of a prediabetic and diabetic population. We are actively designing a study to look at the prognostic impact of glucose spike metrics, integrating novel tools such as proteomic organ clocks in our analysis.

Technologies are a key component of remote, real-world data collection in decentralized clinical trials, although they may cause unintentional selection biases due to difficulties for certain groups of individuals to access many of these technologies, resulting in potential discrimination against the low-income socioeconomic class or the elderly. In this study, we attempted to mitigate this bias through study-provisioned devices to all participants. Additionally, the precision of the sensors and the accuracy of self-reported data, such as diabetes status and food intake logging, may introduce limitations in the findings. In particular, accurate reporting of food intake for participants in real-world conditions as part of a decentralized clinical trial proved challenging (in adherence and accuracy) for many. Further studies are needed to develop a more user-friendly application for collecting food intake focused on participant preferences. Additionally, the use of different CGM devices in PROGRESS and HPP might lead to biases in the analysis of the multimodal glycemic risk profiles. In future studies, it would be valuable to investigate potential biases arising from the use of different devices and methodologies for data collection. Raw data from wearable devices, EHRs, self-reported food intake, genomics and gut microbiome were aggregated to derive summary metrics for each participant. The chosen data aggregation methods could potentially impact the multimodal analysis and the assessment of significance for each data modality. Moreover, the use of antihyperglycemic therapies, which are common for individuals with diabetes, might potentially result in underestimated differences in glucose spike metrics between diabetics and non-diabetics. Additionally, before it can be applied clinically, our model should be validated in clinical settings with standardized equipment on larger-scale, collaborative, multi-institutional prospective studies.

The PROGRESS study demonstrated the feasibility of continuous multimodal data collection in a remotely monitored cohort, encompassing a range of glucose homeostatic conditions and with unparalleled representation of individuals historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Our investigation identified the underlying factors associated with abnormal glucose spikes, shedding light on the potential of interventions targeting lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, sleep and physical activity, as well as gut microbiome diversity, to improve glucose regulation and metabolic health. Although the analysis of glucose spikes revealed significant differences among normoglycemic individuals, prediabetic individuals and individuals with T2D, in particular in the expected time for spike resolution (longer for T2D) and in the value of the nocturnal hypoglycemia (higher for T2D), it also highlighted substantial heterogeneity. Most notably, within the prediabetic state, we showed that a multimodal risk profile can vary substantially for participants with the same value of HbA1c. We showed that the collected multimodal data can be incorporated into a comprehensive multimodal risk profile that can stratify the prediabetic population to a finer resolution compared to the unimodal analysis of HbA1c. The inclusion of additional data modalities, such as environmental exposure, into future AI models could further enhance the precision of T2D risk assessment. These findings lay the foundation for alternative approaches that could potentially revolutionize the way complex diseases such as T2D are prevented, diagnosed and treated.

The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved by the Scripps Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (IRB-20-7635). All individuals participating in the PROGRESS study provided informed consent electronically. The HPP study was approved by the institutional review board of the Weizmann Institute of Science.

The PROGRESS study is a digital clinical trial aimed at enrolling a total of 1,000 adults—half with and half without T2D—to monitor their continuous glucose levels, dietary intake, resting heart rate, sleep and activity levels over a period of 10 days. In addition, participants were asked to self-administer biosample collection kits that were used to assay blood for HbA1c, saliva for genomics and stool samples for gut microbiome. Participants were required to connect and share their EHR data for the duration of the study, which is 3 years. All study participants were recruited in the United States. Exclusion criteria included the following: T1D mellitus; inability to participate in or comply with any of the testing modules asked during the study; currently pregnant; prior bariatric surgery; chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer in the past year; inflammatory bowel disease; known skin allergy to adhesives and nickel (or other contraindications to the CGM device); currently taking any oral steroids; currently taking insulin (injected, inhaled or via insulin pump); antibiotic use in the last 3 months prior to the start of the study or planned use during the duration of the study; non-dietary supplemental probiotic use either daily or weekly; hospice or palliative care; and end-stage renal disease. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration identifier is NCT04881019.

The HPP (https://humanphenotypeproject.org/) is a large-scale prospective study that was used as an external validation dataset for our multimodal model. The study enrolled 27,916 participants to date, of whom 12,014 individuals were deeply phenotyped, aged 40–70 years, with the goal of following them longitudinally for 25 years. The collected data span a wide range of data modalities, including blood tests, retinal fundus images, carotid ultrasound, liver ultrasound, gut microbiome, human genetics, glucose levels monitored for 2 weeks with CGM devices and continuous sleep data collected over three nights with home sleep apnea test devices. All participants were recruited in Israel. Major exclusion criteria included pregnancy or currently undergoing fertility treatments, cardiovascular diseases, chronic metabolic diseases, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, chronic kidney diseases and weight loss more than 5% in the recent year without deliberate diet32.

Study recruitment was initiated in February 2021 via social media outreach and partnerships with healthcare provider systems. Paid advertisements on the website Nextdoor in the greater San Diego area drove interested individuals to a study web page (https://progress.scripps.edu/) where they indicated a desire to join the study as well as a brief capture of their diabetes status. Over 1,000 interested individuals from that campaign were then invited to screen for the study beginning in July 2021. Additional social media channels such as Facebook campaigns were used to generate interest nationally. In addition, outreach to patients from our healthcare partners was done via identification of eligible participants based on criteria (for example, diabetes status) via EHR. Individuals who appeared to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria were sent an electronic notification through the EHR with an invitation to participate in the study. All recruitment campaigns directed interested individuals to the study website with an overview of the study and a call to action to either join the waiting list or enroll to screen. Lastly, an email-based campaign leveraging a third-party organization, Research Match, was used where notifications were sent to participants who had registered in the Research Match database and reported having prediabetes or T2D. By focusing on digital campaigns and emphasizing that participants did not need to attend any in-person site visits to fully participate, we were able to recruit a diverse patient population in terms of age, socioeconomic status and geographic location.

A study-specific smartphone app (MyDataHelps; CareEvolution) was developed to facilitate participants in their self-guided completion of the required tasks. Specifically, the PROGRESS app allowed participants to order their BioKit (for the self-collection of blood, saliva and stool samples) and GlucoKit (including a continuous glucose monitor, a wrist-worn fitness tracker and instructions on how to download and use a food logging app) and provided self-guided modules with tips, videos and instructions to facilitate the self-collection and shipment of the biosamples. In addition, the PROGRESS app included a customized data visualization tool that combined real-time CGM data with logged food intake data. From the raw data, we derived summary metrics that are representative of the participant's overall health status and lifestyle as well as other physiological and biological parameters that are thought, based on existing literature, to be associated with T2D.

BMI was computed from self-reported weight and height. To minimize the impact of outliers on our analyses, we considered a participant's BMI of 121.6 kg m−2 as abnormally high and treated it as a missing value. Diabetes status (normoglycemic, prediabetic or T2D) was self-reported. Based on the HbA1c test result, an individual is defined as normoglycemic if their HbA1c value is less than 5.7%, prediabetic if it falls within the range 5.7–6.4% and diabetic if it is equal to or exceeds 6.5% (ref. 33).

Interstitial glucose levels were measured by Dexcom G6 (Dexcom) devices that were self-applied and activated by the participants. Readings collected in the first 12 h after device activation were discarded to maximize data accuracy. The raw CGM signals were collected with a nominal 5-min sampling period, but we observed slight fluctuations in the sampling intervals, resulting in non-uniform sampling. To address this, we used linear interpolation between consecutive 5-min data points to derive 1-min epochs. This approach also provided finer temporal resolution for the analysis of glucose dynamics, which is useful for capturing short-term variations. Missing values were imputed for no longer than 10 min from a valid measurement. We employed peak detection techniques on the CGM signal to identify glucose spikes, which we defined as peaks with a minimum relative amplitude of 30 mg dl−1 within a time window of 90 min or less (Fig. 1).

We then computed six glycemic measures, capturing different aspects of the glucose spike dynamics: the mean glucose level; nocturnal hypoglycemia, defined as the average (across different days) minimum glucose value occurring between 24:00 and 7:00; time spent in hyperglycemia, defined as the percentage of time spent above 150 mg dl−1; the expected maximum spike relative value, defined as the average (across different days) of the maximum daily spike value relative to the baseline; the expected daily number of spikes, defined as the average (across different days) of the number of glucose spikes in a day; and the spike resolution, defined as the average time (across all glucose spikes) required to absorb 50% of the glucose spike. The choice of using a 150 mg dl−1 threshold for the time spent in hyperglycemia was motivated by clinical considerations; because, in this study, we measure glucose levels continuously, we selected a cutoff value that lies between the fasting hyperglycemia threshold (125 mg dl−1) and the 2-h postprandial hyperglycemia threshold (180 mg dl−1)34. The assessment and definition of a glucose spike in the era of CGM is an evolving field. We used metrics provided by other studies in the field coupled with additional exploratory metrics with physiologic relevance18,35.

During the 10-day active tracking period, participants logged their dietary intake through the food diary app Bitesnap (Bite AI). To model participants' dietary habits, we summed up the composition of meals logged on the same day and computed the average value of carbohydrates, fat and protein daily intake over the 10 days of active tracking.

Study-provided fitness trackers (Fitbit Charge 4 or 5; Fitbit), or personal Fitbit devices compatible with the study, allowed for the passive collection of daily resting heart rate, sleep duration and physical activity (based on daily step counts). All Fitbit metrics were averaged over the 10 days of active tracking. For participants who did not meet the minimum wear time (16 h per day for at least 5 days), the Fitbit metrics were not used in our analyses. We observed statistically significant correlations between Fitbit wear time and age (r = 0.186, P = 0.003) and between Fitbit wear time and BMI (r = −0.192, P = 0.003), which might impact the generalizability of findings pertaining to the Fitbit metrics. However, the impact might be limited because the magnitudes of the correlations are relatively small.

Blood samples were self-collected by participants through study-provided Tasso-M20 kits (Tasso). At the time of its use in the study, the Tasso-M20 had received FDA 510(k) Class II Medical Device clearance. The device was internally validated by the manufacturer with comparisons to whole blood control samples, showing strong alignment. The device also met all criteria for intraday precision, interday precision, linearity and specificity, with values within acceptable ranges, even if it has not been validated in peer-reviewed studies. The collected samples were sent to a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory and run on AU680 analyzers (Beckman Coulter) to get HbA1c values.

Saliva samples were self-collected by participants through study-provided Oragene 600 devices (DNA Genotek) and processed with low-pass sequencing at Gencove. The PRSs for T2D were computed using a standard weighted allele-counting approach, under the assumption that loci effects are independent, as defined by the formula: \({\rm{PRS}}_{i}={\varSigma }_{j=1}^{n}{x}_{{ij}}{\beta }_{j}\), where the PRS for each individual is calculated as the sum of the effect allele dosages (\(0\le {x}_{{ij}}\le 2\)) for each variant (j) in the score, multiplied by its respective marginal effect size (\({\beta }_{j}\)), represented as the log odds ratio per effect allele dosage. We specifically constructed a PRS comprising 558 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on a recent study that identified robust T2D risk loci36, with weights derived from the latest large-scale T2D meta-genome-wide association studies, incorporating data from the Million Veteran Program, DIAMANTE and Biobank Japan, among other sources. To adjust the PRS percentile by ancestry, we first estimated genetic ancestry using a pruned set of SNPs selected by linkage disequilibrium pruning with PLINK version 1.9 (parameters: ‘–indep-pairwise 100 10 0.05')37. We then computed the proportional ancestry for each individual across the five continental superpopulations from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) dataset38 using ADMIXTURE version 1.3.0 in supervised mode (‘–supervised 5')39. The raw PRS was then transformed into a percentile score based on a simulated reference population, which was generated by sampling the 1000G dataset in proportion to each person's ancestry composition. For each individual, we conducted 1,000,000 sampling iterations across the five 1000G superpopulations, ensuring that ancestry-specific adjustments to the PRS percentile remained robust and minimizing fluctuations due to sampling variability. Additionally, we performed principal component analysis on genotype data for the participants selected for the analysis and incorporated the first 10 principal components as input features for the multimodal glycemic risk profile model.

Stool samples were self-collected by participants through study-provided gut health tests (Thorne) and processed using whole-genome shotgun sequencing by Thorne. We performed adapter trimming and low-quality reads filtering with fastp version 0.23.4 using default parameters and sliding window from front to tail (that is, ‘cut-right' parameter enabled)40. Host reads were detected with Bowtie 2 version 2.5.2 based on the alignment with the human genome (human reference genome assembly GRCh38) and then removed41. Paired-end reads were merged with fast length adjustment of short reads (FLASH version 1.2.11) using default parameters except for the maximum overlap length, set to 200 base pairs42. Relative abundances were obtained with metagenomic phylogenetic analysis (MetaPh1An version 4.0.6) with default parameters43. The Shannon diversity index was used as a measure of alpha diversity and computed as \(\mathop{\sum}\nolimits_{i=1}^{{n}_{\rm{g}}}{p}_{i} \times \log ({p}_{i})\), where pi denotes the relative abundance of the ith genus and ng denotes the total number of genera. Probiotic scores were obtained by adding up the relative abundances of the following genera: Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc.

Medical conditions documented up to 10 years prior to the enrollment date were extracted from the participants' EHR data. We grouped the medical conditions into eight higher-level categories based on the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) hierarchy: disorders of the cardiovascular system (SNOMED CT concept ID ‘134057'); disorders of the digestive system (‘4201745'); disorders of the respiratory system (‘320136'); disorders of the musculoskeletal system (‘4244662'); disorders of the nervous system (‘376337'); disorders of the genitourinary system (‘4171379'); disorders of the auditory system (‘4176644'); and disorders of the visual system (‘4134440'). Medical conditions marked as resolved were excluded. We determined the number of comorbidities by considering the count of high-level categories that contained at least one recorded medical condition. We used the drug exposure table in the EHR data to extract information on the usage of antihyperglycemic medication. Specifically, we identified entries that included the names of commonly prescribed medications for improving glycemic control in individuals with T2D: metformin, alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, bexagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone44. We classified a participant as someone using antihyperglycemic medications if they had at least one recorded entry within 1 year prior to the start of CGM monitoring and throughout the monitoring period.

From the external validation dataset, we included the data modalities that were also available in PROGRESS—namely, CGM, food intake and gut microbiome, in addition to age, sex, BMI and HbA1c. The diabetes status was self-reported by the participants. Participants without any recorded diabetes or prediabetes condition were considered as normoglycemic. Participants with T1D or with diabetes of unspecified type (as determined by self-report) were excluded from the analysis.

To obtain the HbA1c values, we identified the HbA1c test from the EHR data that was closest in time to the start date of CGM, within a 180-day time window (ranging from 90 days before the monitoring start date to 90 days after). The potential time mismatch between the HbA1c test and the CGM is limited to a maximum of 90 days, but we note that it can potentially cause inaccuracies in the analysis.

Interstitial glucose levels were measured by FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash (Abbott) devices. The raw CGM signals were collected with a 15-min sampling period. Linear interpolation between consecutive 15-min data points was used to derive 1-min epochs. Missing values were imputed for no longer than 15 min from a valid measurement. The glucose spike metrics were calculated by using the same procedure employed for PROGRESS data.

Following the approach used for PROGRESS, we determined the average daily food intake for carbohydrates, fat and protein by summing up the composition of meals logged (through a mobile phone app) in the same day. Stool samples for the analysis of gut microbiome were collected in the clinic and analyzed via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The Shannon diversity index and the probiotic score were computed from the relative abundances (at the genus level) with the same methods used for PROGRESS data.

Adopting the same criteria used for PROGRESS, we selected participants who had sufficient CGM data (at least 16 h per day and at least 5 days), an HbA1c test result and demographic information. It is important to acknowledge that different CGM devices were used for data collection in the two cohorts. Furthermore, some specific data processing steps, particularly regarding the processing of microbiome data, were different in the two studies. These differences can introduce potential confounding factors in the joint analysis of PROGRESS and HPP data.

We conducted ANCOVA tests controlled for age, sex and PRS to compare glucose spike metrics across self-reported diabetes statuses, and we evaluated the effect size with computed partial eta squared (ηp2), which measures the proportion of variance accounted for by the independent variable while controlling for covariates. Furthermore, we investigated the correlations between the glucose spikes and the available anthropometric, biological, physiological and lifestyle variables. We employed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) to assess the strength and direction of the associations while controlling for age, sex and PRS. We used a bootstrap percentile-based method with 10,000 iterations to estimate confidence intervals for correlations (with a confidence level of 95%) and determined the statistical significance by evaluating P values using a two-sided paired bootstrap test. False discovery rate (FDR) Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to account for multiple testing.

We developed a multimodal machine-learning-based model to compute glycemic profiles for T2D risk assessment of PROGRESS prediabetic participants and normoglycemic and prediabetic participants from the HPP external cohort32. We used the collected demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biological, physiological and lifestyle data as input for the multimodal model. We trained binary classifiers based on gradient boosting decision trees (XGBoost) to distinguish between individuals with T2D and normoglycemic individuals. We chose the XGBoost model to capture potentially nonlinear relationships among the variables. XGBoost was selected among other nonlinear models as it is less complex and requires less data for training. We considered different configurations of input features, including age, sex and BMI (‘Base' features), glucose spike variables (‘Spikes'), food intake variables (‘Food'), microbiome variables (‘Microbiome'), genomic variables (‘Genomics'), Fitbit variables (‘Fitbit') and EHR condition variables (‘EHR'). The model's hyperparameters were tuned separately for each input configuration using a preliminary grid search cross-validation loop with five splits. To assess the model's performance, we used a leave-one-person-out scheme, where the data of each participant were excluded from training and used solely for testing. We assessed the models using the receiver operating characteristic curve and the corresponding AUC. We used a bootstrap percentile-based method with 10,000 iterations to estimate confidence intervals with a confidence level of 95%. We determined the statistical significance of the improvements relative to the base model by evaluating P values using a two-sided paired bootstrap test. We acknowledge that this approach does not eliminate the risk of potential residual confounding. Furthermore, to assess the contribution of each feature to the binary classification task, we computed the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) for each test data point45. We considered the normalized absolute SHAP value and computed the median value over the entire test set to get a global feature importance score.

Next, we trained a multimodal classification model on all T2D and normoglycemic participants of the PROGRESS cohort using demographics, anthropometrics, CGM, food intake and gut microbiome as input data modalities. The multimodal model was then applied to the prediabetic group of the PROGRESS cohort and to the normoglycemic and prediabetic groups of the HPP cohort, which were not used for training the model. The objective was to evaluate the glycemic risk profile associated with the individuals being tested and compare it with the HbA1c value. To accomplish this, the model calculated the probabilities of being classified as part of the T2D group, based on the patterns learned from the training data. We considered this probability of belonging to the T2D group as a glycemic risk profile and compared it with the HbA1c value.

Participants selection process from the PROGRESS cohort. T1D, type 1 diabetes.

Distribution of glucose spike metrics: mean glucose level, defined as the average of glucose values over the entire tracking period (a); expected maximum spike relative value, defined as the maximum spike value relative to the baseline, averaged across different days (b); percentage of time spent above 150 mg dl−1 (c); spike resolution, defined as the time required to absorb 50% of the glucose spike, averaged across all glucose spikes (d); expected daily number of spikes, defined as the daily number of glucose spikes, averaged across different days (e); nocturnal hypoglycemia, defined as the average minimum glucose value occurring between 24:00 and 7:00, averaged across different days (f). Continuous distributions were obtained through kernel density estimation with Gaussian kernels, Scott's bandwidth estimation method and bandwidth scaling factor equal to 0.75.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (dots) between glucose spike metrics representing the expected daily number of spikes, defined as the daily number of glucose spikes, averaged across different days (a); the expected maximum spike relative value, defined as the maximum spike value relative to the baseline, averaged across different days (b); the nocturnal hypoglycemia, defined as the average minimum glucose value occurring between 24:00 and 7:00, averaged across different days (c); the percentage of time spent above 150 mg dl−1 (d). Two-sided statistical tests were used. Lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Correlations with statistically significant FDR-corrected p-values are marked with the star symbol. Multimodal factors are divided into three groups: demographic factors (top), metabolic factors (middle), and lifestyle factors (bottom). FDR, false discovery rate; P, p-value; n, sample size.

HbA1c values and multimodal glycemic risk profiles for normoglycemic participants in the HPP cohort. The multimodal glycemic risk profiles were obtained from a binary classification model trained on PROGRESS with demographics, anthropometrics, CGM, food intake, and gut microbiome as input data modalities. The blue horizontal lines represent the multimodal glycemic risk profiles median values after binning the HbA1c with intervals of width 0.4. The red vertical dashed lines mark the boundaries of the prediabetic range, spanning from 5.7% to 6.5%.

Google lost its appeal of a judge's court order requiring the tech giant to revamp its app store in an antitrust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games, Reuters reported on Thursday. 

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Google's argument that the trial judge made legal errors in the antitrust case that unfairly favored Epic Games. 

Epic Games first filed its lawsuit in 2020 and was able to convince a jury in 2023 that Google illegally stifled competition. The trial judge ordered Google last October to open its app store to rivals and give Android users more choice when it comes to downloading apps. The order was on hold pending the outcome of Google's appeal. 

Google argued to the appeals court that its Play Store competes with Apple's App Store, and claimed that the trial judge unfairly prevented it from presenting that argument in defense against Epic's antitrust claims.

Soccer Football - Pre-Season Friendly - Team K-League v Newcastle United - Suwon World Cup Stadium, Suwon, South Korea - July 30, 2025 Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon in action with Team K League's Lee Dong-Gyeong REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

The term ""sportswashing"" refers to politicians and governments trying to use athletic events to improve their tarnished reputations. Although the term emerged during the 2010s, the idea existed long before that: When Italy hosted the 1934 FIFA World Cup, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, a.k.a. Il Duce, tried to use the event for his own political gain.

In a biting article published by the London-based iPaper on July 31, sports reporter James Gray stresses that U.S. President Donald Trump could face a backlash if he tries to use either the 2026 FIFA World Cup in Philadelphia or the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles to promote himself and engage in ""sportswashing.""

""Before the next election,"" Gray explains, ""Trump's America will host the two biggest sport events in the world: the World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. And those will not be the first time Trump has waded into sporting matters for political capital…. The U.S. will not win the World Cup. No one, not even Trump, believes that. But Trump will hope he can win the World Cup. And with his approval rating in the U.S. reaching its lowest ever ebb, he needs a win.""

Dr. Jules Boykoff, a political science professor and former professional soccer player, told the iPaper that if Trump tries to use the World Cup or the Olympics for his own political purposes, that ""fits squarely within the definition of sportswashing.""

Boykoff argued, ""If sportswashing is when leaders use sports and sports mega-events to try to deflect attention from domestic social problems while trying to burnish their reputation on the world stage and thereby legitimizing themselves in the public eye, then yeah, sure. It looks like it to me. In fact, I would say that's one of the blind spots of a lot of the discussions around sportswashing, is that it is easy to waggle a finger at them (other countries) and not point a finger back at ourselves."" Gray notes fears that Trump will use ""the World Cup and the Olympics to overthrow the (U.S.) Constitution and run for an unprecedented third term.""

Dr. Andrei Markovits, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, told iPaper, ""Trump is a guy — and this is an immense advantage — who has no shame. Ignorance is not shameful. Incompetence is not shameful. Saying outrageous things is not shameful. He's not worried about missteps that are not costly to him. The World Cup, there's zero downside to it.

Markovits noted, however, that some MAGA Republicans might be offended if Trump loudly promotes the World Cup.

Although soccer is the most popular sport in the world — from Argentina to Scotland to France to the Netherlands — some far-right pundits attack it as an expression of identity politics. Author Ann Coulter and Fox News' Sean Hannity are known for their anti-soccer statements.

Markovits told the iPaper, ""Trump identifies with Joe Six Pack, who hates soccer and sees it as a completely sissy sport. Soccer's existence in the United States is bifurcated. Yes, it's Latino, which, of course, Trump hates. But it's also upper middle-class white.""

Daniil Medvedev has never hidden his love for hard courts, the surface on which he has enjoyed the most success. The reason behind the 29-year-old's accomplishments on hard is clear.

Despite standing 6'6” tall and showing an ability to dominate with his serve throughout his career, the former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has performed better on hard than clay and grass because of his return. That will be a key area to keep an eye on for the rest of the season, including at this week's National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.

“I'm a specialist in hard court,” Medvedev once said during a match. And although that has proven an exaggeration — he has won an ATP Masters 1000 title on clay and reached two Wimbledon semi-finals on grass — the star's hard-court accolades stand out.

Medvedev has not only performed better on return than on serve, but significantly moreso on hard courts relative to any other surface. The only active players in the same category as him are Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz.

“First of all I like returning in general. I feel like it's somewhere I feel comfortable,” Medvedev told ATPTour.com. “I think in general many guys prefer to return because you have a tiny bit less pressure and you can go for more shots.”

According to Infosys ATP Stats, Medvedev is in the Top 25 among all players since records were kept for three key categories on hard courts: career first-serve return points won (31.6%), second-serve return points won (54.3%) and return games won (28.1%). He is not in the Top 25 in any of those categories when you consider those statistics for all surfaces. 

Medvedev's Returning Stats By Surface (Pos. on leaderboard)




The only active players who have won a higher percentage of return games and first-serve return points on hard courts are Djokovic and Alcaraz. Just Djokovic has been better on second-serve return (54.3%) and the Serbian is widely considered the best returner in history.

Because of his hard-court return prowess, Medvedev has consistently been a threat on the surface. The 2020 Nitto ATP Finals champion has won 20 tour-level titles, and 18 of them have been on hard courts.



There have been times when Medvedev has dominated on serve, too. His career standing in service games won (84.3%) on hard courts is 46th, though. It is the consistency of his return game that has made him a huge threat for opponents, especially in the biggest matches.

In the five hard-court ATP Masters 1000 tournaments Medvedev has won in his career, his return has led the way. In those five finals, he won 31.5 per cent of his return points and broke serve 17 total times.

“What always keeps me motivated [is] also that maybe even in some moments when I [don't] win as many matches or don't play my best, I still have these exceptional numbers on return,” Medvedev said. “Usually I'm probably top five or something, so that's what always keeps me motivated. [If] I just try to play a tiny bit better and I'm going to make it.”

Medvedev will try to maintain that mentality and return success this week in Toronto, where he is pursuing his first title since Rome in 2023.

With the win, Raducanu improved to 5-1 on the North American hard-court swing. Having started the year ranked outside the Top 60, she's surged up the rankings thanks to her semifinal run in Miami and fourth-round showing on clay in Rome. She currently sits at No. 33 and is poised to rise even higher ahead of the US Open—where she famously won the title in 2021.Raducanu credits her strong form to a shift in mindset:“I'm really pleased with how I'm tracking, how I'm building,” she told Tennis.com's David Kane in Washington, D.C.. “My goal, it's kind of gone away from result-oriented goals. I'm just enjoying each day and trying to bank as many good ones as possible in a row. And not let a bad day kind of creep in, or if there's a bad morning session, like trying to regain it straightaway.”Up next, she'll face No. 5 seed Amanda Anisimova, who returned to action with a 6-4, 7-6 (5) win over Lulu Sun in her first match since reaching the Wimbledon final.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The White House unveiled plans for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be built on the East Wing, a project long desired by Donald Trump.


	Trump and other donors will fund the $200 million structure, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. She said Thursday that construction will start in September and be competed well before the end of Trump's term.


	The ballroom stands to be one of the most significant changes to the public rooms in the White House complex since the late 1940s, when the Executive Mansion was gutted as part of a renovation to reinforce the original structure.

	











	Concerts, state dinners and other entertainment events have been held in the East Room or in an outdoor tent. The new ballroom will have a capacity of 650 people, compared to 200 in the East Room.




			Watch on Deadline		







	McCrery Architects will be the lead architect of the White House project. In a statement, McCrery said that they have sought to preserve the “elegance of its classical design and historical importance.” Photos of the planned project show a large space with arched windows, and heavily in gold ornamentation. That has been one of Trump's preferences, as he has added that design to parts of the Oval Office.


	The East Wing, constructed in 1902, with a second story added in 1942, houses the offices of the First Lady, which will be relocated during construction.


	This will be the latest change that Trump will make to the White House complex. The grassy area next to the Rose Garden has been paved over, with space for outdoor entertaining of guests. Trump also installed two large flagpoles on the north and south ends of the complex.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jeremy Strong, Mikey Madison, Jeremy Allen White reportedly in the mix for The Social Network Part II [UPDATED]","https://www.avclub.com/the-social-network-ii-mikey-madison-jeremy-allen-white","Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:34:00 GMT","

[Update, July 31 at 2 pm ET]: The Hollywood Reporter now suggests that Jesse Eisenberg will not return for play Mark Zuckerberg again, and that Jeremy Strong is eyed to replace him. Again, Sony declined to comment, and the movie will likely not be officially greenlit until Aaron Sorkin finishing assembling the primary cast.

[Original story:] 15 years ago, The Social Network was led by two up-and-coming actors whose biggest credits up until that point were Zombieland and being cut out of The Other Boleyn Girl and a pop star making a push toward legitimate acting. Now, in 2025, its sequel is attracting the most recent—and first gen Z—Best Actress winner and the lead of perhaps the most awarded series of the decade. Perhaps the real Facebook has only dropped in esteem in the past decade and a half, but an Aaron Sorkin-directed sequel about the tech company's troubles is still a prospect that can attract top talent. 

This is per Variety, which reports that Mikey Madison and Jeremy Allen White “are circling the lead roles” for the follow-up to The Social Network. No word yet on whether Jesse Eisenberg will return to play Mark Zuckerberg, but fear not—White is not in the running to replace him. Deadline reports that White would “ideally” portray Jeff Horowitz, who wrote “The Facebook Files” in The Wall Street Journal and which the sequel will be based upon. Madison would likely portray the whistle-blower behind the articles., Frances Haugen. The articles highlighted the social network's detrimental effects on teens (Meta also owns the self-comparison machine Instagram) and its knowing dissemination of misinformation.

Both trades are very careful to note that no formal offers have yet been made, and the movie itself has not even been officially greenlit yet. But if Sony needed any more proof of interest before they give Sorkin the go-ahead, having Madison and White's attention certainly can't hurt.

Follow all of our Sean Combs trial coverage


Sean Combs claims in a new court filing that his recent conviction on federal charges of transportation to engage in prostitution was “unprecedented,” so the court should vacate the jury's verdict and fully acquit him – or grant him a new trial “focused solely” on those two counts.


	“To our knowledge, Mr. Combs is the only person ever convicted of violating the statute for conduct anything like this,” the new 62-page motion filed overnight in federal court in Manhattan reads. “Sean Combs sits in jail based on evidence that he paid adult male escorts and entertainers who engaged in consensual sexual activities with his former girlfriends, which he videotaped and later watched with the girlfriends. That is not prostitution, and if it is, his conviction is unconstitutional.”


	Combs and his lawyers claim his case is an outlier under the Mann Act – the federal statute that bars interstate commerce related to prostitution – because Combs “made no money” off the activity, no minors were involved, and the sex workers “chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily.” They argue Combs' acquittal earlier this month on his most serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking proves he did not coerce R&B singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura or a more recent ex-girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” into the so-called hotel freak-offs where he choreographed the sex acts between the women and the male escorts while he masturbated and recorded.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“It is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,” the new filing states. “The proof at trial showed that [Combs] typically hired the services of male escorts or dancers advertised openly through lawful businesses, that the men were paid for their time, and that they enjoyed the activities and had friendships with Ms. Ventura and Jane and were not merely traveling to have sex for money.”

	











	Combs and his lawyers call the videos he recorded “amateur pornography” and say “paying people to film them in sexual performances is protected by the First Amendment.” The filing, signed by Combs' appellate lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, says that the very least, Combs is entitled to a new trial, on the Mann Act charges only, that doesn't include the “severe spillover prejudice” from the “reams of inflammatory evidence” that jurors heard related to the failed racketeering and sex trafficking charges.

	Federal prosecutors are expected to respond to the new motion in writing before U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian considered the matter and makes a ruling. The lead prosecutor who tried Combs' case, Maureen Comey, was fired by President Donald Trump's Justice Department two weeks ago. She handled the New York-based criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, which have returned to dominate news headlines this month amid a MAGA revolt over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein investigation.


	In her closing argument at Combs' trial, Comey told jurors that it didn't “even pass the laugh test” to suggest Combs only paid the escorts for their time, not commercial sex. She said it was “common sense” Combs was paying for sex and not “scintillating conversation.” She cited a text Combs sent to a manager at the escort service Cowboys4Angels in which he complained about having to pay full price for an escort. “He couldn't even perform. He's lucky he got anything,” Combs wrote.

	“And here's another way you know that the defendant knew that he was engaging in prostitution. He told Cassie to be careful to make sure none of the escorts were undercover cops. Remember that? She testified about it, and you saw some texts about it, too. That also tells you what was in his mind. He knows he's hiring people for prostitution. That's why he even texted one of the escorts asking, hey, are you a cop? The only reason to worry about undercover cops is if you know what you're doing is against the law,” Comey said in her final words to jurors on June 30.


	In a separate motion filed Tuesday, Combs and his lawyers asked Judge Subramanian to release the Bad Boy Records founder on a $50 million bond pending his sentencing now set for Oct. 3. Prosecutors are expected to respond to that request today.

Donald Trump lashed out at his longtime ally and prominent MAGA Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in a bizarre Truth Social post on Wednesday. The president pilloried the senator as a “second-tier” lawmaker who had been used as a “pawn” by Democrats, after Hawley broke with Republicans to vote in favor of a congressional stock trading ban that will also apply to future presidents.


	Trump reacted with unchecked rage after Hawley voted to advance the legislation out of committee.“The Democrats, because of our tremendous ACHIEVEMENTS and SUCCESS, have been trying to ‘Target' me for a long period of time, and they're using Josh Hawley, who I got elected TWICE, as a pawn to help them,” Trump wrote. “I don't think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the ‘whims' of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!”


	Hawley defended himself later on Wednesday. The president is “not covered by the PELOSI Act, but Nancy Pelosi is,” Hawley told reporters after Trump's post bashing him. “Listen, I want the president to sign the bill, so I'm happy to do whatever it would take to get him to say, ‘Yes, this is good.'”  

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The legislation was initially dubbed the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whose husband's lucrative stock portfolio has practically become its own trading index. Pelosi has said she supports the trading ban, which has been renamed the HONEST Act. An amendment proposed by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), which would have authorized a review of the Pelosi family's past trading activity, was voted down. 

	











	The version of the legislation that passed out of committee on Wednesday was amended to apply its trading ban to the president and vice president — rather than only members of Congress — as a compromise to win support from Democrats. However, that prohibition would only cover the president and VP starting in 2029. In other words, the legislation still exempts Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance.

	Hawley claimed on Thursday that the president's meltdown had been prompted by a misunderstanding: that Trump had been told the version of the bill Hawley supported would have forced Trump to sell Mar-a-Lago. Two sources familiar with the situation tell Rolling Stone that Trump indeed lashed out at Hawley because he was “confused” or “misunderstood” the details of what Hawley was proposing.


	Hawley had already signed on to a version of the ban that had a carve-out in place for Trump and Vance. The president was convinced that the Hawley-endorsed version didn't have the carve-out and would negatively affect him and his business empire before he left office. Hence, Trump thought it was, in the words of one of the sources, “an attack on him” favored by the Democrats, so he took it out on Hawley, a Trump ally and MAGA devotee. The two sources blamed Hawley and his office, in part at least, suggesting the legislative details weren't made clear to the White House during this process.


	In the end, though, some close to the president are saying that Trump was just yelling at the wrong Republican senator. “The guy he should have been shouting at is Rand Paul,” a White House official says.


	Paul — whom Trump's team is already annoyed with given the Kentucky Republican's opposition to the president's tariff agenda — attempted to drive Democratic support away from the bill by highlighting the fact that, while the legislation will cover the president, it will exempt Trump.

	“I would oppose the substitute change because I think it should apply to everybody or nobody,” Paul said, according to The New York Times.


	Hawley assured reporters on Thursday that he and Trump were back on good terms after he explained that he favored a version of the bill that would exempt Trump from the ban. “He said at the end, ‘Oh OK, great. This is good,'” the senator reportedly said of his call with Trump.
