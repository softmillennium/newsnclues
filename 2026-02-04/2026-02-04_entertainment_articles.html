                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The duo are now re-teaming for How To Survive Without Me, a drama pilot at HBO Max. Jackson is set to star alongside Ray Romano in the project from Berlanti, Bash Doran and Warner Bros TV. Written by Berlanti and Doran from a story the duo co-wrote with Robbie Rogers, How To Survive Without Me is set in the wake of matriarch Beverly's passing. The De Angelis family has begun to drift, unsure how to manage their complicated, evolving lives without her guidance, but in true Beverly fashion, she found a way to keep running the show from the beyond. Should they wish to experience Beverly's final work, the family must find the time — and make the effort — to remain connected, and be there for each other through all of life's challenges yet to come. As a chef about to open a members dining club in Los Angeles, Cooper is literally carrying forward his mother's recipes and approach to food. He presents as confident and a player, but he's suffering in silence — keeping a secret that could destroy both his lifelong friendships and the culinary career he's built in his mother's honor. Berlanti began his career in television as a staff writer on the WB's Dawson's Creek, which starred Jackson in his first lead role, and became an executive producer and showrunner of the series after only one year on staff. Berlanti and Jackson also spent time together at the Dawson's Creek Class Reunion last September honoring fellow star James Van Der Beek. “We are thrilled to welcome Joshua, who joins Ray Romano in the cast of How To Survive Without Me,” Sarah Aubrey, Head of Max Original Programming, said. “It's especially exciting to see him reunite with creator Greg Berlanti on this intimate, family-driven story. We can't wait to peel back the layers of these dynamic, raw, and complex characters.” Doran executive produces alongside Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Leigh London Redman and Rogers via Berlanti Productions and its overall deal with WBTV. “Joshua is a tremendously talented performer who approaches each role with care and range, and we're delighted to have him join Ray, Greg, and Bash on How To Survive Without Me,” Clancy Collins White, President, Creative Affairs, Warner Bros. Television, said. “His presence will beautifully balance the show's emotional depth with uplifting, heartfelt moments that characterize what it means to be a family. It's also a joy to see Greg and Joshua continue their creative collaboration on this deeply personal story.” Jackson recently headlined Ryan Murphy's ABC series Doctor Odyssey. He next stars opposite another Dawson's Creek alum, Katie Holmes, in the movie Happy Hours. He is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The View has lined up a series of guest co-hosts when Alyssa Farah Griffin goes on maternity leave. Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Abby Huntsman will return to the show, with other guest co-hosts including Amanda Carpenter, Sheryl Underwood and Whitney Cummings. Savannah Chrisley will be the first guest co-host, starting on February 17, executive producer Brian Teta told Deadline. Teta said the selections were “all about a different point of view at the table,” as well as people “who are good at this job or who have the potential to be good at this job.” He also said that the choices of different perspectives were not just about politics but the range of topic areas that the show covers. “They are big shoes to fill,” he said. Chrisley spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, alleging that her parents, reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, were “persecuted” by the justice system when they were convicted in 2022 on fraud and tax evasion charges. President Donald Trump pardoned her parents last year. The show threw her a baby shower earlier this week.

Directed by Stephanie Laing (“Your Friends and Neighbors”), the upcoming film follows an impoverished Seattle woman who one days discovers that the 1991 Toyota Camry — where she's been living and is thus the center of her life — just got towed. What follows is not a quick montage of temporary setbacks, but a grinding legal odyssey through an all-too-familiar hell determined to make the already-struggling Amanda pay for someone else's mistake. Related Stories The 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' Is Coming Back to Life — Thanks to A24, JT Mollner, and Glen Powell The Last Dance: Did Distractions Weigh on the Last Sundance Sales Market in Park City? Leaning into Byrne's knack for playing women whose composure clashes with circumstance, “Tow” sees the Best Actress honoree coming off her ferocious and raw turn in A24's “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.” The performance has her currently nominated for Best Actress at the 2026 Oscars. Here, Byrne once again embodies a woman pushed to the brink, although “Tow” promises kinder, quirkier comedy. Dominic Sessa appears as her 24-year-old attorney, Kevin Eggers — while Ariana DeBose, Demi Lovato, and Octavia Spencer play women Amanda meets at a local shelter. Simon Rex, Elsie Fisher, and more round out the cast. Premiering to generally warm but still mixed reception out of Tribeca last summer, “Tow” got a “B-” review from IndieWire's Christian Zilko, who wrote that, despite some narrative shortcomings, the script from Jonathan Keasey and Brant Boivin was intensely relatable. “It's hard to dispute that the film has good intentions,” he wrote. “There are plenty of Amanda Ogles in the world dealing with unimaginable bureaucratic stresses just to get through the day, and perhaps ‘Tow' will make someone be a little kinder to one of them.” From Roadside Attractions and Vertical, “Tow” is in theaters on Friday, March 20.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a time, it seemed that Todd Haynes' sexually explicit gay noir would never make it past the page. Thankfully, that is one nightmare from which we can now wake up. Variety reports this morning that De Noche is back from the dead, thanks to Pedro Pascal stepping into the lead role. The trade describes the film as reminiscent of films like Chinatown, which follows a cop (Pascal) and a boarding school teacher (Danny Ramirez) who flee from Los Angeles to Mexico after becoming targets of the city's corrupt political machine. “This story, with Pedro Pascal and Danny Ramirez in the two leads, arises out of an era — all too relevant to our own — of domestic corruption, racial exploitation and global terror,” says Haynes. “But it emerges as a testament to the inexplicable powers of desire and love to survive and overcome even the most crippling of human barriers.” De Noche has already had a pretty twisty path to production after previous lead Joaquin Phoenix dropped out from the film in August 2024, just five days before it was set to begin production. Phoenix was already at the location in Guadalajara for filming, but reportedly got “cold feet,” despite having developed the script with Haynes. At the time, it seemed unlikely that the film would ever get made given that a bunch of other people needed to be paid for the time they had already sunk into pre-production—time which presumably didn't result in any footage, either.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie has a tight-knit family off air. The journalist is the youngest of Nancy Guthrie and Charles Guthrie's three children and has two kids of her own with husband Michael Feldman. Savannah released a statement at the time, reading, “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Keep scrolling to meet each of Savannah's family members. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Nancy and her husband lived in Melbourne, Australia, when the couple welcomed Savannah in December 1971, with the family relocating to Tucson, Ariz., two years later. Nancy was “sharp as a tack” and of “sound mind” when she did not show up for church on Feb. 1, 2026, and was declared missing. She suffers from physical ailments and was in desperate need of medication as the search progressed. He died when Savannah was a senior in high school, with the former attorney reflecting on the “shocking” tragedy on Hoda Kotb's “Making Space” podcast in 2024. At the time, she remembered her father as “an amazing, magnetic, joyous, charismatic, incredibly loving, warm, kind, forbearing personality.” Camron is a former F-16 pilot, with Savannah praising her sibling's retirement in an August 2018 Instagram post. “I have never been more proud of my big brother,” she told her followers. “He has flown for our country for 26 years, and continues to serve proudly in the ‘Green Mountain Boys' — the Vermont Air National Guard. As for Annie, who published a book of poetry “The Good Dark” in 2015, she appeared on the “Today” show in 2017 and gushed about her bond with Savannah. Savannah's sister is married to Tommaso Cioni, with whom she shares one child. Savannah's first marriage was to former BBC journalist Mark Orchard in 2005. After the former couple called it quits in 2009, Savannah “felt like a failure,” she told Hoda Kotb's “Making Space” podcast listener in January 2026. During an episode of “Reclaiming” the previous year, Savannah admitted it took her “years to recover” from the “horrible and sad” divorce, which “broke [her] heart.” She did not disclose further details about the breakup, saying, “I'm not blaming anyone, but I don't really want to get into it.” The same year Savannah's divorce from Orchard was finalized, she began dating Feldman. The couple got engaged in May 2013 during a Turks and Caicos trip, with Savannah later admitting she dumped Feldman the same day he got down on one knee. Hours later, Feldman surprised his “weepy” then-girlfriend with a proposal. For the pair's 10th wedding anniversary in 2024, Savannah gushed via Instagram that she loves her partner “now and forever.” Vale's baby brother was born two years later, with Savannah tweeting, “We are so grateful.</p>

Despite my initial reservations over “Fallout” Season 2, the finale cobbles together a fitting conclusion for our primary characters. It's reciprocal justice, sure, but foiling Hank's plan to pacify the Wasteland via mind control is a clear win, just as leaving him in New Vegas to start anew — without his memories, surrounded by the very people whose minds he meant to wipe — is the twisted form of comeuppance “Fallout” prefers. Related Stories Josh D'Amaro Named Successor to Bob Iger as Next Disney CEO ‘The Muppet Show' Review: Seth Rogen's Faithful Reboot of a TV Classic Plays the Hits The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), meanwhile, just wanted to find his family, and he did. With an assist from his digitized nemesis, Robert House (Justin Theroux), the cowboy formerly known as Cooper succeeds in locating his wife and daughter's cryogenic chambers… only to discover they already left. A leftover postcard indicates they're in Colorado, so that's where the Ghoul will look next. Withholding their reunion reeks of the kind of water-treading felt throughout the first five episodes, but Cooper's search for his family is a series-long arc, not a seasonal one. When he says, “For the first time in 200 long-ass years, I know my family is alive,” the nihilistic antihero's chosen optimism is enough progress to make his Season 2 journey rewarding. That sounds may sound like a lot of mistakes, but they all come back to the same problem: over-editing. Episode 8 is chopped to shit, bouncing between its trio of stories with momentum-sapping speed and careless, imperceptible logic. The result is that even though all the pieces are in place for a sturdy season-ender, each climax is spread too thin to deliver their deserved impact. It's just the latest example of how Hollywood tries to cater to shrinking attention spans at the expense of sound, emotionally-driven storytelling. But before getting into all that, let's take a look at why the Season 2 finale is easy to watch and easier to forget. You've got Maximus (Aaron Moten) going toe-to-toe with dozens of mutant lizard-monsters. He's wearing a Power Suit equipped with rockets, sure, but he's also trying to protect an unprepared group of innocent Vegas residents, and there are so many Lizard-monsters. As written by Karey Dornetto, the battle is a classic war of attrition: Maximus starts out hot — invigorated by his weaponry, which makes quick, bloody work of the first few Deathclaws — but the sheer number of Bowser-wannabes soon overwhelms him. He needs an assist from his one-armed best friend Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) and only survives thanks to a last-minute save from an unidentified sniper (the NCR Ranger from the game, “Fallout: New Vegas”). Do we feel anything (you know, besides nerd pride in recognizing a scene from the video games)? It's difficult to appreciate the cumulative effects of a lengthy, exhausting fight scene when said scene is divided into four sporadic chunks. The main development in the second segment sees the New Vegas residents placing bets on Maximus' survival, which is decent enough color (good to see Vegas hasn't changed that much), but it never pays off. (Maybe we'll see Thaddeus hauling around a crate of caps in Season 3?) Then the third part ends with a Deathclaw biting down on Maximus' head, a cliffhanger that's resolved when we cut back, 90 seconds later, and the monster is just… dead. Not seeing how, exactly, Maximus survived may not matter in the long run, but it illustrates how “Fallout” treats the finale's climactic action sequence: like it's just there to kill time. Separating the eight-and-a-half minute battle into four parts may help to break up other plot lines and hold viewers' attention via constant changes (more on that in a minute), but it neuters the emotional impact of Maximus' accomplishment. When he's relieved of duty (by the New California Republic), we're supposed to feel as spent and triumphant as he does. Instead, Maximus' big ending (complete with a flashback to his dead dad) only succeeds in fulfilling “Fallout's” gore quota. His story isn't the only one tripped up by distrust. One second, she's being strangled by Hank's mind-controlled thug, then we drift off to visit other characters for a few minutes, and then we return to that same moment, like nothing happened. Why not live in Hank's sick decision to brainwash his daughter into loving him? Why not keep us in that twisted perspective long enough to appreciate being saved from it? I won't pretend to know the answers. Toye, could say why the finale is so jumbled. But they're not alone in making television that prioritizes holding our attention over earning it. The ongoing content era has devolved from Netflix producing TV shows as supplements for social media to something called “vertical dramas,” which gamify serialized stories by making you pay to watch each new episode. Thus is the fear invoked by TikTok: Some studios submit to its power, some conform in the hopes of stealing it. Whether it's choppy editing that steals focus like a flashing light or built-in gimmicks that call for a close eye on elements other than the story, many modern TV shows feel like stimulus delivery devices instead of naturally unfolding narratives. “Stranger Things” fills its feature-length runtimes by creating an Easter egg hunt for '80s movie references. “Landman” falls back on provocation (renewable energy is a scam! when episodes run short on drug deals, explosions, or weirdly sexualized family members. Maybe these choices aren't driven by a fear of ceding audience attention to TikTok so much as by fear of letting a taut story go slack. Maybe fretting over fading attention spans is a self-fulfilling prophecy. After all, even good shows like “The Pitt” rely on the classic protocols of a medical procedural to send new patients careening through the emergency room doors at a realistically rapid rate. It shows immense trust in its own story, as well as in the audience watching it play out. Vince Gilligan's latest hit also shares an idea or two with “Fallout.” Just like Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn) rebels against “happiness” when it means ceding her sense of self, her individuality, her humanity, Lucy rejects her father's plan to achieve post-apocalypse pacifism when it requires turning the Wastelanders into mindless servants. Both characters ask what price is too high for peace on Earth. And both characters decide global harmony isn't worth it if that means losing the chance to really live. Life is worth paying attention to, and life is exactly what's missing from too much of our entertainment. “Fallout” Season 2 is available on Amazon Prime Video.

Yesterday, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos went to Congress to answer for some fairly valid concerns (that the company's potential acquisition of Warner Bros. would put the company too close to being a monopoly) and ended up answering for some completely nonsensical ones. Per CNN, the hearing quickly devolved into culture war mishegoss, with Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt claiming Netflix has “the wokest content in the history of the world,” one that has “made a habit of promoting DEI and wokeness” and “oversexualizes [sic] for kids.” 

He continued, “The overwhelming majority of your stuff is overwhelmingly woke, and it's not reflective of what the American people want to see… Why in the world would we give a seal of approval or a thumbs up to make you the largest behemoth on the planet related to content?” Though Sarandos argued that Netflix “has no political agenda” and offers a wide variety of programming, that, obviously, fell on deaf ears. The other Missouri senator, Josh Hawley, claimed without evidence that “so much of Netflix content for children promotes a transgender ideology,” and in fact that “almost half” of the children's programming on the platform has “this highly controversial, highly sexualized material.” 

As Deadline reported yesterday, this all appears to be part of a coordinated attack from MAGA, Project 2025, and Heritage Foundation-linked think tanks to sink the potential merger. Though the report does not mention Warner Bros. or Paramount, it claims that the streamer behind programs like Tires and The Electric State holds “an outsized role in socially engineering millions of Americans into a predisposition to accept preferred left-wing ideological dogma.” Oversight Project chief Mike Howell, formerly a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, told Deadline, “Our team has been tracking domestic propaganda for some time.” (We're sure!) He continues, “This seemed like an opportune moment to raise this issue in the context of Netflix's ambition plan to build the biggest political and ideology messaging machine in human history.” The 47-page report, distributed to the White House and other political bodies, alleges that “intentional coordination with activist organizations and alignment with progressive political objectives.” 

CNN also reports that influencers with close ties to the administration have been pushing these talking points since at least December, as well. One example its report cited is Benny Johnson, a MAGA podcaster, who claimed that the merger would “push trans ideology, race guilt, and anti-family messaging straight into your living room.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Love means never having to say sorry about the furniture. In a preview clip from Wednesday's (Feb. 4) pre-Super Bowl New Heights podcast, Travis Kelce admitted he did something bad when he laughed so hard at a joke older brother Jason Kelce made about dog shows that he leaned too far back in his chair and snapped some of fiancée Traylor Swift‘s furniture in half. Mark of Cain Singer Comes Out as Trans: 'The Happiness I Feel Outweighs Any Obstacles' The wood-splitting fall caused his camera to shake as the three-time Super Bowl winner was sent tumbling backwards and then covered his blushing face in embarrassment as he busted out laughing and Jason asked, “Oh s–t! While Travis and Taylor are both enjoying some well-deserved time off after, respectively, finishing the roughest season of his NFL career and wrapping up the promotion of promotion of her The Life of a Showgirl album, this isn't the first time the baller has worried that his beloved might get homicidal over one of his slip-ups. When their producer reminded the brothers that the comment was reference to “Wood” — on which Swift sings, “New heights of manhood/ I ain't gotta knock on wood” — Travis laughed. “Taylor's gonna kill me for not knowing that!” This week's New Heights episode featuring former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and Super Bowl-bound Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Cooper Kupp posts at 9:30 a.m. WARNING: This week's episode is dangerously funny TOMORROW.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As authorities scramble to find information about 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, a new report has added another layer of complexity to the ongoing search. More than 66 hours have passed since Nancy, the mother of “TODAY” co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen, as investigators continue working to piece together what happened. TMZ reports that Veteran journalist Ashleigh Banfield reported Tuesday night that a law enforcement source suggested Savannah Guthrie's brother-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, is among the individuals being reviewed as part of the investigation. Banfield emphasized that the information was sourced from police and has not been publicly confirmed by authorities. Cioni is married to Savannah's sister Annie, who was the last known family member to see Nancy Guthrie on Saturday night. Banfield said Annie spent the evening with her mother, though it remains unclear whether Cioni was also present. Please note: Law enforcement has not identified any suspects, and no arrests or charges have been announced as the investigation continues. On February 3, law enforcement officials, including FBI agents, arrived at the property shortly after 2:30 p.m. local time. The home belongs to Savannah Guthrie's older sister, Annie, where Savannah has also been staying as the family continues to hope for Nancy's safe return. As per photos obtained by The Daily Mail, agents were seen carrying files and notebooks as they approached the residence and were greeted by members of Savannah's security team, who have maintained a presence at the home. Investigators have confirmed troubling findings at Nancy's home in Tucson, Arizona, as the case enters its fourth day. Banfield also reported that investigators towed Annie's vehicle, citing a connection between the car and Cioni. She further stated that security cameras at Nancy's home had been smashed, though law enforcement has not confirmed those details publicly. On February 2, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said investigators believe Nancy was taken from her home during the night. The Pima County Sheriff's Office said on X that it is treating the report “seriously” and reviewing all incoming tips in coordination with federal authorities. Officials with both the sheriff's department and the FBI have said they are working jointly to analyze digital evidence, including cellphone data, while pursuing multiple investigative leads. Sheriff Chris Nanos has said she is of “great sound mind” but has limited mobility and was taken without essential medication. NBC has confirmed that Savannah Guthrie has stepped away from her role at the upcoming 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony as she remains in Arizona with her family. In a statement obtained by EntertainmentNow, an NBC Sports spokesperson said, “Savannah will not be joining us at the Olympics as she focuses on being with her family during this difficult time. We will share additional information about our Opening Ceremony coverage plans soon.” Authorities continue urging anyone with information to come forward as the investigation presses on.

A follow-up photo showed his shoulder after surgery, where a screw had been placed to repair it. Last year, he revealed he had injured his leg while shooting “Avengers: Doomsday,” and it led to having his stunt double do a portion of his scenes, including “a big fight” with Robert Downey, Jr. It's knowing I can't take this back. And now I know what the next six months of my life will be like,” Tatum told Variety in an interview published on September 2, 2025. Fans and fellow celebrities quickly flooded the comments section with well wishes. Overcoming obstacles is your superpower,” wrote one person. Jamie Foxx, who starred alongside Tatum in the 2013 film “White House Down,” chimed in and said, “Prayers up let's go champ.” Tatum's girlfriend, Inka Williams, also offered up her own words of support, writing, “Big bad wolf, we got disss.” The “Magic Mike” actor and Williams, 26, were first linked together in early 2025. They were first spotted at a pre-Oscars party in February of that year, and the following month, a source gave People some insight into their relationship. The Australian model confirmed that they were together when she made them Instagram official in April 2025 in honor of Tatum's birthday. Williams posted photos of her and Tatum together via her Instagram Story, including one where the “Roofman” star planted a kiss on Williams. “Happy life to the handsomest, kindest, funniest, stoopidest most gorgeous human ever ! “Merci for making life beautiful and fun.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

He'll be joined by country singers Brantley Gilbert, Gabby Barrett, and Lee Brice. Colbert noted that as of now no one can actually attend the show because it is “unclear what venue will host.” He quipped, “Which I believe is fitting because Kid Rock is often unclear what venue he's in.” Instead, the event will be available to stream on “the actual, real platforms TBN, DW+, Charge!, and Rumble.” “Also, they're negotiating to stream on Crunch, Crumble, Hunkle, Crampus, and Paramount Plus,” Colbert said, making a subtle dig at his parent network. “Hey, he's just looking out for his fans,” Colbert said. “Hey Benito, anyone that thinks it's un-American to have an American perform at the Super Bowl is dumb, right?” Colbert said before playing a clip of Bad Bunny laughing. Kid Rock's halftime show is being presented by conservative organization Turning Point USA. In a statement shared with Fox News, Kid Rock — a longtime Donald Trump booster — sounded extremely confident about the gig, saying, “We're approaching this show like David and Goliath.

The counter-programming was part of a larger conservative backlash to the Puerto Rican superstar's selection, with right-wingers at once livid about Bad Bunny's opposition to ICE and Trump's immigration crackdown, as well as the fact that he sings in Spanish. Trump has criticized not only Bad Bunny, but also Green Day, who are playing a pregame concert. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ricky Martin penned an open letter to Bad Bunny in Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Día after the singer's big Grammys win on Sunday night. “Benito, brother, seeing you win three Grammy Awards, one of them for album of the year with a production entirely in Spanish, touched me deeply,” Martin wrote in Spanish (translation via Billboard). He continued, “I know what it means to succeed without letting go of where you come from. I know how heavy it is, what it costs, and what is sacrificed when you decide not to change because others ask you to. You won without changing the color of your voice. “When you defended the immigrant community, when you pointed out a system that persecutes and separates, you spoke from a place I know very well, that place where fear and hope coexist, where millions live between languages, borders, and deferred dreams.” From the heart, from one Boricua to another, with respect and love, I thank you for reminding us that when one of ours succeeds, we all succeed.” Bad Bunny will deliver the first Super Bowl halftime headlining show in Spanish on Sunday, another historic moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dog the Bounty Hunter's stepson Gregory Zecca has been arrested for accidentally shooting his own 13-year-old son in a tragic accident last year. “This was a heartbreaking and preventable tragedy,” Sheriff Kevin Rambosk told the outlet. “Our detectives conducted an exhaustive and thorough investigation, examining every element of what happened through witness statements, forensic testing, subpoenas, search warrants, and more. Per the outlet, the investigation found that Gregory was allegedly “drinking for several hours” before settling in for a televised UFC match with Anthony at a friend's house. While there, according to authorities, he allegedly consumed both marijuana and alcohol. Authorities alleged he “repeatedly handled a firearm in the child's presence, practicing drawing it from his waistband and dry-firing. “This case underscores that devastating tragedy that can result from mixing firearms, alcohol and drugs,” Sheriff Rambosk said, per the news outlet, adding, “Our hearts are with everyone affected by this loss.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “We are grieving as a family over this incomprehensible tragic accident and would ask for continued prayers as we grieve the loss of our beloved grandson, Anthony,” Dog and Frane told TMZ in a statement last year. Following the July 2025 shooting, Gregory was placed on a psychiatric hold and “heavily sedated” due to concerns the “devastated” father would attempt to take his own life.</p>
