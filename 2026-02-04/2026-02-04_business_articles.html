                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft said Wednesday that top security leader Charlie Bell will take on a new role and that Hayete Gallot will return to the company to run security after a stint at Google. At the time, he was seen as a candidate to become CEO of AWS, but Amazon picked former executive Adam Selipsky to run the market-leading cloud. Bell is moving into a position focused on engineering quality as an individual contributor, or IC, continuing to report to CEO Satya Nadella. "Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer," Nadella wrote in a memo to employees. The changes come as investors worry that generative artificial intelligence models might damage the growth prospects of mature software companies. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that four sales executives were becoming executive vice presidents, in a move the company said was meant to improve its ability to stay close to clients while pursuing growth in AI. Microsoft shares are down 14% this year, and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has declined about 21%. In Microsoft's earnings report last week, the growth rate for Azure was weaker than some analysts expected. When she  departed for Google's cloud unit to be president of customer experience in 2024, she was a corporate vice president working on selling products in a variety of categories, including security, according to her LinkedIn profile. "She brings an ethos that combines product building with value realization for customers, which is critical right now," Nadella wrote. In her new role, Gallot will be an executive vice president reporting to Nadella. Ales Holecek, chief technology officer for Microsoft's Experiences and Devices Group that includes the Windows operating system and other products, will become chief architect for security and will report to Gallot, Nadella wrote. During Bell's tenure, Microsoft had to deal with the fallout from prominent cyberattacks. In 2023, Microsoft said China breached U.S. government officials' email accounts, leading to a critical Department of Homeland Security report. Microsoft made operational changes and started evaluating cybersecurity contributions in employee reviews that influence compensation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States is developing plans with Mexico, the European Union and Japan to implement minimum prices for critical minerals, the U.S. trade representative said Wednesday. The Trump administration is exploring a partnership with Mexico on critical minerals as part of a scheduled review of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, or USMCA, by July 1. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the potential partnership would "address global market distortions that have left North American critical minerals supply chains vulnerable to disruptions." Greer described Wednesday's announcement with Mexico as an "action plan" to be implemented over the next 60 days. The U.S. and Mexico will explore ways to implement price floors for critical mineral imports, and will discuss how to implement those minimum prices in agreements with other nations, an official in the trade representative's office said. Separately, the U.S. is working with the EU and Japan to develop a strategic partnership on critical minerals that could also include price floors. Greer said cooperation with the EU and Japan signals "that the world's largest market-oriented economies are committed to developing a new paradigm for preferential trade in critical minerals." The action plan with Mexico aims to implement coordinated stockpiling of critical minerals and common regulations for their mining, processing and trade. The plan also foresees coordination on investment, geological mapping and rapid responses to supply chain disruptions. The U.S. and Mexico plan to initially focus on a select group of critical minerals, with the exact elements to be decided at a later date. The Trump administration has put critical minerals at the center of its trade and industrial policies in an effort to reduce dependence on China. Beijing dominates the global supply chain and tried to cut off exports of rare earths, a subset of the minerals that are used in everything from munitions to consumer electronics, during trade disputes with the U.S. last year. The administration launched a national critical mineral stockpile on Monday. It has also taken equity stakes in critical mineral companies including MP Materials, USA Rare Earth and Canada's Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals. The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP Materials last July that included a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity position. The Commerce Department announced plans last week to provide USA Rare Earth with financing in exchange for an equity holding, subject to certain conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI startup ElevenLabs announced on Wednesday it had raised $500 million at an $11 billion valuation, as it eyes a potential IPO. Sequoia Capital led the round, with participation from existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Iconiq, as well as new investors Lightspeed Venture Partners, Evantic Capital, and Bond. The raise more than triples the $3.3 billion valuation ElevenLabs hit after a $180 million Series C in January 2025. Founded in 2022, the London-based company initially developed AI text-to-speech models, before expanding into areas such as speech-to-text, sound effects, dubbing, music and conversation. It sells products enabling enterprises to deploy voice and chat agents, as well as a platform for brands and creators to generate and localise audio, used by the likes of publisher Time and chip giant Nvidia. Tech giants like Meta and Salesforce use its voice infrastructure to develop products and experiences, ElevenLabs said. The company closed 2025 with over $330 million in annual recurring revenue, it said, driven by enterprise adoption by companies including Deutsche Telekom and Revolut. "This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether," said cofounder Mati Staniszewski in a statement, adding that the company was building towards an IPO. ElevenLabs said it would continue international expansion. It has offices across Europe, as well as in Brazil, Mexico, India, South Korea, Japan and the U.S. Funding for AI startups hit record levels in 2025, as investors bet big on the tech's transformational impact. European AI startups raised a record $21.6 billion in 2025, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom. Two of the biggest rounds were for French AI model builder Mistral, which raised 1.7 billion euros and UK AI infrastructure company Nscale, which raised $1.1 billion. German defence tech Helsing also picked up 600 million euros in 2025, and UK AI avatar startup Synthesia raised $200 million in January. U.S. AI startups raised $164.6 billion in 2025, per Dealroom, driven by around $70 billion funding for OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su defended the company's lackluster forecast, telling CNBC on Wednesday that the chipmaker has seen a step up in demand over the last two to three months. "What I would tell you from someone on the inside is AI is accelerating at a pace that I would not have imagined," she told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street," adding that demand continues to outstrip compute needs. Su said AMD's data center business has accelerated from the fourth to first quarter and demand for its central processing units is "going gangbusters" as businesses rapidly increase compute for AI enterprise work. The company posted fourth-quarter results Tuesday that topped Wall Street's expectations but were overshadowed by what some analysts viewed as a weak outlook. AMD said it expects $9.8 billion in revenue, plus or minus $300 million, during the first quarter. Some analysts anticipated a far stronger outlook from the company, fueled by heightened AI spending and massive data center buildouts. AMD also had a high bar to clear this quarter following a wave of megadeals in the fourth quarter, including partnerships with OpenAI and Oracle in the fourth quarter. Companies have also been boosting investments as the need for data centers to power AI tools continues to skyrocket. Su told CNBC that AMD will see an "inflection point" in the second half as it begins shipping its new integrated server-scale AI system known as Helios and that the company is on track with the launch.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All-electric vehicle maker Rivian is dealing with a lot: the end of federal support for EVs, a surge in hybrid vehicle sales and a rate of cash burn that still alarms investors, among other things. The company also has relatively low production and delivery numbers, but Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC in a December interview that's not the full story. But the R1S carries a nearly $80,000 starting price. Rivian's hope is that the upcoming, less expensive R2 model can repeat that same success in the far larger midsize, mid-price SUV EV market. Someone sitting inside will notice Rivian's familiar style and design language throughout the interior. And it's much the same shape, with a long, flat roof that lets a 6-foot-1-inch person sit in the rear seat without slouching. One of the biggest differences is that it has five seats, two fewer than the larger R1S. "But I think this is the best vehicle we've developed to date. We're incredibly bullish on this and excited for it. Of course it's cheaper, but it doesn't mean it's not an aspirational product, something that you're really going to enjoy and love to be in." Scaringe took CNBC on a test drive of the R2 near the company's office in Palo Alto, California. It feels low to the ground and agile. "Watch this," Scaringe said as we were driving on the freeway. "It can go out and be on a trail. It's just not going to be doing extreme rock crawling in the way that an R1 can do." Rivian's approach to design and manufacturing has enabled the company to pack a lot into a lower-cost package. Traditional cars have more than 60 computing units in them. By designing the computing architecture differently, the company reduced that down to 17 in its first-generation R1 vehicles and then to seven in the second generation. "So it's key for both enabling the ramp-up in volume because it's so much more accessible in terms of pricing, but it's also much lower cost to build." Lowering costs doesn't mean Rivian skimped everywhere. Customers had complained that there was no glove compartment on R1 vehicles, so the R2 has two of them. They both have a velvet-like lining that costs $11 per car. "We wanted to make it a very nice environment," Scaringe said. "So we spent the money to line them up. But this is a really good example. And we have to do it profitably." Analysts are divided on whether Rivian can pull this off and match or beat Tesla's success. Needham analyst Chris Pierce said the consensus opinion holds that Rivian will sell about 15,000 units of the R2 in 2026, but he thinks the company can top that. He added that Rivian ranks first in Consumer Reports' owner satisfaction survey. "If you have a car and you like that car and you tell people, 'That's a great car,' that's the best form of advertising. It just seems like, for whatever reason, because of EV uncertainty, Trump, etc., people really got bearish on how many cars of this car they could sell." Rivian burned through $3 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, according to the company's financial statements. As of January, the company had about $7 billion in cash. Pierce said he expects Rivian to burn $5 billion in 2026. But company struck a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen to use Rivian software in VW vehicles worldwide, and that arrangement should bring in another $2 billion in 2026, leaving the company with about $4 billion in 2027 if all goes well. "If we can have the type of market share that we have on R1, where it's the market share leader with R2, I mean, we'd have a real challenge of making enough of them," Scaringe said. "So this is the hope, is we can capture that spark that's connected with so many customers and at the flagship price point."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One Post reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a "bloodbath." The impacted journalists include Amazon beat reporter Caroline O'Donovan, Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker and the rest of the Post's Middle East correspondents and editors, according to X posts from Donovan and Parker. "The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company," the Post said in a statement. "These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers." News outlets have struggled for years to maintain a sustainable business model after the internet upended the economics of journalism. "We will be closing the sports department in its current form." The Washington Post last year made changes across several business functions and announced job cuts, saying then that the reductions would not impact its newsroom. The newspaper, owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, had offered voluntary separation packages to employees across all functions in 2023 amid losses of $100 million. "If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then The Post deserves a steward that will," the WaPo Guild said on X. The Post's White House staff said in a letter to Bezos last week that their most impactful coverage depends heavily on collaboration with teams at risk of job cuts and that a diversified newsroom is essential when the paper faces financial challenges. Bezos said in 2013 when he bought the newspaper that he would preserve its journalistic tradition and would not lead its day-to-day operations. But there "will, of course, be change" over the coming years, he had said. In recent years, The Post has clashed with some of its journalists, who have openly criticized Bezos after the newspaper decided not to endorse a candidate in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, leading to more than 200,000 people canceling their digital subscriptions. The newspaper, which appointed William Lewis as its CEO in early 2024, also revamped its opinion section last year, shifting focus on "personal liberties and free markets."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One Post reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a "bloodbath." The impacted journalists include Amazon beat reporter Caroline O'Donovan, Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker and the rest of the Post's Middle East correspondents and editors, according to X posts from Donovan and Parker. "The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company," the Post said in a statement. "These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers." News outlets have struggled for years to maintain a sustainable business model after the internet upended the economics of journalism. "We will be closing the sports department in its current form." The Washington Post last year made changes across several business functions and announced job cuts, saying then that the reductions would not impact its newsroom. The newspaper, owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, had offered voluntary separation packages to employees across all functions in 2023 amid losses of $100 million. "If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then The Post deserves a steward that will," the WaPo Guild said on X. The Post's White House staff said in a letter to Bezos last week that their most impactful coverage depends heavily on collaboration with teams at risk of job cuts and that a diversified newsroom is essential when the paper faces financial challenges. Bezos said in 2013 when he bought the newspaper that he would preserve its journalistic tradition and would not lead its day-to-day operations. But there "will, of course, be change" over the coming years, he had said. In recent years, The Post has clashed with some of its journalists, who have openly criticized Bezos after the newspaper decided not to endorse a candidate in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, leading to more than 200,000 people canceling their digital subscriptions. The newspaper, which appointed William Lewis as its CEO in early 2024, also revamped its opinion section last year, shifting focus on "personal liberties and free markets." Bezos was among the several tech executives seen as making overtures to U.S. President Donald Trump last year. He was seated prominently at Trump's inauguration, underscoring his shifting ties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs. Executive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the "substantial newsroom reductions" would impact "nearly all news departments." Murray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider. "We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section," he added. Murray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs. "A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast," Murray said. The publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said. "These layoffs are not inevitable," the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. Former executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that "there were acute business problems that had to be addressed" during "a period of head-spinning change in media consumption." Baron added that the "Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top." Early last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: "personal liberties" and "free markets." It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May. Last year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump. Over 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were "deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave." Some brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration will draw down 700 federal law enforcement officers from Minnesota "effective immediately," White House border czar Tom Homan said Wednesday. After that partial withdrawal, around 2,000 federal agents will remain in the state — a roughly 25% reduction — with most concentrated in the Twin Cities area encompassing Minneapolis and St. Paul, Homan said at a news conference in Minneapolis. Homan announced the pullback after touting what he said was "unprecedented cooperation" between the federal government and state and local entities. That cooperation boosts efficiency, requiring fewer officers to be sent into communities "to assume custody of a criminal alien target" and freeing up resources, Homan said. "More officers taking custody of criminal aliens directly from the jails, means less officers on the street doing criminal operations," he said. He repeatedly insisted the administration is "not surrendering" in Minneapolis, which has become a hotbed of civil unrest over the administration's aggressive deportation tactics. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Homan's partial drawdown "like a drop in the bucket to the people of Minneapolis." It's "not close to enough," Schumer said on the Senate floor after Homan's comments. "They all have to leave now." Tensions between the immigration forces and protesters exploded after federal agents killed two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, during separate altercations in January. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem initially rushed to defend those killings while accusing both Good and Pretti of domestic terrorism. But as public opinion rapidly soured on ICE, the administration modulated its tone on the deaths, and President Donald Trump sent Homan to Minnesota manage on-the-ground operations, replacing Gregory Bovino Border Patrol commander at large. "We're not surrendering the president's mission on a mass-deportation operation," Homan said Wednesday. But this is about a targeted enforcement operation, and that's what we're going to be doing."

My ride from Vienna to Venice, Italy, in October 2022 was bumpy, cramped, and awkward. During a two-week trip through four European countries, I spent 11 hours bunking with three strangers in an overnight sleeper train. I thought an overnight train would be the best way to travel through Europe so that I could explore more during the day. OBB Nightjet — a rail line that operates overnight routes between Austria, Italy, France, and the Netherlands — can go as fast as 143 miles per hour. Nightjet trains have regular assigned seats, couchette cars (seats that fold out into couches in shared cabins), and sleeper cars with bunks of four or six, which is what I booked. Some routes have private cabins, but mine didn't. To travel by train, I bought a Eurail pass for $477, which gives access to most European trains for a set number of days. I arrived about an hour and a half before my 9:35 p.m. train so I'd have plenty of time to find the platform. I'd need to board my assigned train car; each has a number. The lounge is free for OBB first-class passengers traveling during the day and costs about $10 for all other OBB passengers. I just went to the closest car and asked an attendant for help. An attendant led the way to my shared cabin. Two got off around 5 a.m., and the other stayed past my stop. At 74 square feet, it felt like a tight space — especially with everyone's luggage around. I couldn't imagine six people squeezing in there. Although they weren't as soft and cozy as the sheets on Amtrak trains, they were better than nothing. My fellow passengers and I agreed to turn off the lights once everyone was settled into bed. Some of us watched our devices, while others went right to sleep. According to Nightjet's website, only private sleeper cabins come with a shower. There was no café car or common area on board for passengers. "Offering our passengers a high level of travel comfort is an important concern for us," a representative for OBB Nightjet told Business Insider. That ride was far more comfortable, and I slept easily with no strangers in my cabin.</p>

The next report card you get at work might carry higher stakes. Big-name companies, including Meta, Amazon, and Boston Consulting Group, are adjusting how they evaluate people. The reasons vary, from prioritizing AI use to incentivizing top performers with bigger pay. As AI drives what feels like ever-faster change, and as many workers stay in their jobs for longer, employers are recognizing a need to make their performance evaluations more responsive, workplace observers told Business Insider. The changes include ensuring that workers don't have too many goals — generally two to five — and that it's clear how they can meet them. More frequent feedback is necessary, Seabrook, to keep up with the pace of change in business. In a fast-changing environment, questions of how workers are performing often center on their agility and adaptability, said Allison Vaillancourt, a VP at the HR consulting firm Segal. In other cases, employers benefiting from the tight labor market simply want to squeeze more productivity out of their workers and think they can get there by grading harder, she said. That means getting to say, "I'm going to really ramp up my performance evaluation process, so I'm only keeping my best people," Vaillancourt said. That might sound scary, yet few people loved the old way of doing reviews, which often involved cranking out a self-evaluation, then sitting down with your boss. The process tended to leave even managers feeling nervous, she said, making for a meeting that was awkward at best. There's a recognition, Vaillancourt said, that many of the most effective organizations are those where managers regularly coach their teams. Already, 65% of organizations use a "continuous performance design" that focuses on regular, systematic feedback alongside an annual review, according to a 2025 assessment by the research firm Gartner. It makes sense, Vaillancourt said, that bosses would set goals at the start of the year yet continue to tweak them as needed. Not all adjustments relate to how often bosses give feedback. Business Insider previously reported that Meta is simplifying its evaluation process to better reward top performers, and Amazon is adjusting its reviews to focus more on individual accomplishments. BCG expects workers to use AI as part of their jobs, so the technology shapes how the firm evaluates workers' abilities, such as problem-solving. As part of its overhaul, Adecco Group is adding development goals to guide workers' growth. The distinction between assessment and development is important, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews. Too often, he said, the focus shifts to helping workers grow rather than evaluating their performance. Those appraisals matter, Murray said, because they inform key decisions about things like pay and who gets promoted. Another reason that performance reviews are changing is that some employees' expectations are shifting, said Rajesh Namboothiry, senior vice president at the staffing firm ManpowerGroup. Even when the job market isn't great, workers still tend to prioritize flexibility, job satisfaction, and clarity about career growth, he said. Companies that excel at retention, he said, focus on career development and employee satisfaction. "They understand that lack of growth opportunity is a key driver for attrition," Namboothiry said.

In Anne and Brian Klumpp's 45-foot motorhome is a US map titled "on the road of adventure." Some of the states are filled in with photos of them or their RV, which they've called home for over six-and-a-half years. The blank states will hopefully get their own photos one day, as Anne and her husband aim to see each one by RV. Brian works a full-time gig during the week, Anne has various income streams, and the couple travels to their next spot on some weekends so that they are ready to go for the workweek. Have you sold your house to live in an RV or a boat? Anne finds traveling in an RV the most luxurious way to see the country because you have your own bed, don't have to try to fit everything you need into a suitcase, and don't have to figure out accommodations. "You essentially have all of your stuff with you, and you get to have a nice, easy morning drinking coffee out of your favorite coffee mug sitting on your own couch with the dog curled up beside you," said Anne, who has a nearly eight-year-old Australian labradoodle named Skipper. However, they pivoted to a new plan because Anne confessed she didn't have the same dream. Anne told Brian that when they started dating, she didn't like camping, so she never expected to spend six years and counting visiting campgrounds. The two kick-started their RV lifestyle when Anne's sales job in the wine industry shifted to more travel. She said the increase wouldn't be feasible from a motorhome. They also sold their boat and dinghy for $103,000. Anne left her 15-year career at Vineyard Brands, and the couple hit the road and have been traveling since. In addition to their motorhome, they tow a pickup truck so that they can use a smaller vehicle to run errands and do other activities. Anne said it's also kind of like a garage because they store their bikes and other items underneath a truck topper. "You're definitely talking about a depreciating asset as opposed to a house, which would be an appreciating asset," she said. "We do our appreciation in the form of going and seeing things that help us to appreciate life more." The couple usually budgets $1,200 to $1,500 for monthly rent, including those expenses. "It just makes life simpler when we don't have to think about if we're going to have enough power, what's going to happen if our solar doesn't charge, how are we going to manage water and waste removal," Anne said. Anne said they have several internet providers and "pay a ridiculous amount of money in internet fees to make sure that we are well-connected." She believes her entertainment budget is larger than it would be at a house, and they budget a lot for repairs and maintenance since they move around a lot. Anne said they bought a site in Fredericksburg, Texas. "The quarter-acre lot we purchased is being developed as an RV lot with a large pad, covered outdoor kitchen and patio, and firepit area," Anne said. The couple works different jobs with different levels of flexibility: Anne is a content creator, working with brands. She also writes articles and sells advertisements for RV Destinations Magazine. Brian works for solid-state computer hard drive manufacturer Solidigm as head of governance, risk, and compliance. "I didn't have to tell my company about our lifestyle but I chose not to hide it," Brian said. Their prior experience working from home made the transition to remote work in a smaller space smooth. They use noise-canceling headphones to focus, and Anne's desk is mobile, so she can move around if they need more space. Anne's work isn't full time; sometimes she works 20 hours a week, but can get up to 60 hours. "I do a lot of the management of our lifestyle," Anne said, including figuring out where to run errands, taking their dog to appointments and walks, and the logistics of getting mail and packages. On Wednesday nights, they like to explore, such as dining at local restaurants. "I am willing to drive, but my husband does most of it, but it's physically and mentally very taxing, much more so than just jumping in your car to go drive for a couple of hours," she said. Anne enjoys watching the scenery as they travel to their next destination. "It's so incredible to look out the window, and it doesn't matter if you're in the desert or you're up in northern Michigan with all the pine trees and maples. Anne said the couple is slowing down their travels at least for a bit. She's hoping to redecorate during that time because "when you only have one weekend in between moves, you just don't really want to spend that painting on wallpapering."</p>

The chip giant has implemented a change to its internal email strategy known as T5Ts, or "Top 5 Things." T5Ts are regular emails that Nvidia employees are expected to send, outlining what they're working on or thinking about, or where they're running into challenges. In January, Nvidia substantially reduced T5T distribution within its vast Worldwide Field Operations organization, the team responsible for selling Nvidia's AI technology and helping customers deploy it in the field. This group includes Huang, members of Nvidia's executive staff, and other senior leaders. It could not be learned if the change in T5T distribution is companywide. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. T5Ts have been core to Nvidia's culture for decades, designed to flatten its organizational hierarchy and give leadership visibility into day-to-day operations, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Tae Kim's book "The Nvidia Way." While top executives will continue to receive T5Ts, the narrowed distribution could signal a shift from Nvidia's culture of open communication and public feedback. The change could also limit how easily employees spot overlapping issues across teams. Business Insider has previously reported how T5Ts enable leaders to intervene when issues arise. Top executives like Huang and vice president Ian Buck have stepped in to mobilize responses amid customer complaints about product launches and AI deployment hurdles. Huang maintains a large number of direct reports, Business Insider previously reported. He also eschews one-on-one meetings to aid in the flow of information and prefers to work in conference rooms rather than private offices, The Journal reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A press release shared with Business Insider said that the office was investigating a number of criminal offences, including aiding and abetting the possession and distribution of child sexual abuse material, hosting sexually explicit deepfake content, and denial of crimes against humanity. It said that the initial investigation was expanded following additional reports of Grok disseminating sexually-explicit deepfakes and denial of crimes against humanity on the platform. Elon Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino have both been sent summons for hearings in April, the prosecutor's office said, along with other X employees. X — which was acquired by xAI in March 2025, before itself being folded into Musk's rocket company SpaceX this week — called the raid an "abusive act of law enforcement theater" designed to achieve "illegitimate political objectives." The company said via a Tuesday post on X's global government affairs account that the underlying allegations were "baseless." It also accused the Paris Prosecutor's Office of "attempting to exert pressure on X's senior management in the United States." Musk and Yaccarino also responded to the search on X, with the billionaire describing it as a "political attack" and Yaccarino accusing prosecutors of distorting French law in order to restrict free speech. Last month, the European Union said it had opened an investigation into the spread of illegal images, including possible child sexual abuse material, generated by Grok on X. The UK's media regulator announced a similar investigation earlier in January. X said last month that it had implemented technological measures to stop Grok from editing images of real people into revealing clothing. In July last year, xAI apologized after Grok made antisemitic comments on X and praised Adolf Hitler.</p>

Gold bounced above $5,000 an ounce on Tuesday as investors rushed back into the metal following one of the sharpest selloffs in decades. Spot gold was trading around $5,072 per troy ounce at 11:10 p.m. ET on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, when prices jumped more than 6%. The reversal came after a brutal collapse in gold prices on Friday and Monday, following a record high above $5,500 per troy ounce on Thursday. Warsh is widely viewed as the most hawkish candidate, which drove the US dollar sharply higher and sparked aggressive profit-taking in gold. "The move was largely fueled by a wave of speculative buying from China, from retail traders to larger equity funds rotating into commodities, with fresh flows pushing prices to extreme levels before last week's abrupt reversal," wrote Manthey. Western call options — contracts that give investors the right to buy gold at a set price and are often used to hedge geopolitical and global macro risks — also played a central role in amplifying the rally, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Tuesday. Many analysts still see further upside for gold, arguing that the selloff reflected positioning rather than a deterioration in fundamentals. Key drivers include geopolitical risks, haven demand, and central bank buying. Goldman forecasts gold at $5,400 per ounce by this December. Prices had reached record levels above $121 per ounce on Thursday. "Silver is often nicknamed 'gold on steroids' — it tends to move much more than gold in percentage terms. Its smaller market size and exposure to both investment and industrial demand tend to amplify price moves in both directions," wrote Manthey. Manthey added that silver prices are likely to remain volatile as the white metal is more sensitive to shifts in sentiment and positioning than gold. That's even as medium-term industrial demand continues to underpin the silver market amid tight supplies in London, the hub of global silver trading.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity. I remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me. Between 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give. It wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon. Every time Alexandra publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids. So, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. Skagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner. It's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years. I took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity. Skagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore. I came up with an idea and went for it. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems. The questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? To prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm. In those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity. Then the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening. We pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: "Maybe I like doing it the hard way." The fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees. I'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.</p>

Bahama Breeze, the Caribbean-themed chain known for its "island escape" fare for suburban diners, is closing or converting its remaining 28 locations. Parent company Darden Restaurants, which also owns Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, said on Tuesday that it will permanently close 14 Bahama Breeze locations by April 5. The restaurant's Caribbean-inspired theme offered a casual, getaway dining experience near home. At the time, Darden Restaurants was exploring alternative concepts beyond the company's main profit drivers, Red Lobster and Olive Garden. Darden sold Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, in 2014. Bahama Breeze at its peak had more than 40 locations throughout the East Coast, SEC filings showed, but began to contract its footprint last year. In May of last year, Darden closed down 15 locations. By June, Darden CEO Ricardo Cardenas announced during an earnings call that the company would consider "strategic alternatives" for the Bahama Breeze chain.</p>
