                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last summer, a team of researchers reported using a brain-computer interface to detect words people with paralysis imagined saying, even without them physically attempting to speak. It's a significant step toward helping people with diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, reconnect with language after they've lost the ability to talk. Together, they're exploring how implanted devices can read brain signals and help patients use assistive devices to recover some of their lost abilities. "We can place electrodes in parts of the brain that are related to speech," he said, "and even if the person has lost the ability to talk, we can pick up the electrical activity as they try to speak and figure out what they're trying to say."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conditions that often occur together may share an underlying cause, which can be key to prevention or treatment. The picture of which conditions co-occur is complex, so researchers paired them together, to allow them to identify shared causes more simply. In the largest study of its kind, published in Communications Medicine - Nature, the team led by the University of Exeter Medical School studied 71 conditions which often occur together, such as type 2 diabetes and osteoarthritis, or kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The GEMINI study, funded by the UKRI Medical Research Council and supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), used genetics and healthcare data drawn from a number of large datasets internationally. They also found that obesity explained all of the genetic overlap in ten pairs of conditions, suggesting it is the main driver for why they frequently occur together. Body mass index, or BMI, is a scaled measure of weight – a number over 30 units indicates obesity, while less than 25 indicates "normal" weight. The study quantified how much a reduction in BMI would reduce the risk of both conditions at a population level for people overweight or living with obesity. For example, for every thousand people who have both chronic kidney disease and osteoarthritis, a BMI reduction of 4.5 units would have prevented 17 of them developing both conditions or nine people per thousand with type 2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. We've long known that certain diseases often occur together, and also that obesity increases the risk of many diseases. We found that for some disease pairings, obesity is the major driving force. Our research provides much more detail about the links between obesity and disease, which will help clinicians target specific advice to patients going forward." Professor Jack Bowden, Study Lead, University of Exeter Medical School Study author Professor Jane Masoli, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who is a Consultant Geriatrician and regional NIHR Ageing lead, said: "Currently nine million people in the UK live with two or more long-term conditions. Understanding how to prevent diseases accumulating is a key national research and healthcare priority. Our work shows that this could reduce the risk of accumulating multiple health conditions, supporting people to live longer, healthier lives." This research represents another important publication from the GEMINI (Genetic Evaluation of Multimorbidity towards INdividualisation of Interventions) collaborative. Led by the University of Exeter, GEMINI includes people with multimorbidity, health care professionals including those in primary care and experts in statistics and genetics, and was one of six programmes funded by the UKRI strategic priorities fund, an £830 million investment in multimorbidity research. The GEMINI team are working to further understand why some conditions more frequently co-occur in the same patients. The team are quantifying the role of other, known modifiable risk factors beyond obesity, and are finding novel genes and pathways that could point to new ways to intervene and improve health. Genetics identifies obesity as a shared risk factor for co-occurring multiple long-term conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major new World Health Organization publication sets out, for the first time, a practical, evidence-based package of care to address the mental health impacts of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and the stigma that can prevent people from seeking care and participating fully in society. The Essential care package to address mental health and stigma for persons with neglected tropical diseases responds to growing evidence that people living with NTDs experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, distress and suicidal behaviours than the general population, driven not only by the direct effects of illness but by stigma, discrimination and social exclusion. With more than one billion people affected by NTDs worldwide, the ECP argues that progress towards elimination will be limited unless mental health and stigma are treated as a core part of disease management rather than an add-on. NTDs take a far greater toll on mental and social well‑being than is often recognized. By integrating mental health and tackling stigma head‑on, the Essential care package (ECP) equips countries to confront the full reality of NTDs and move closer to WHO's vision of complete well‑being." Dr. Daniel Ngamije Madandi, Director, WHO Department of Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases The ECP sets out clear, practical actions to integrate mental health care and stigma reduction into NTD services, with defined responsibilities across people living with NTDs, communities, health workers and system leaders. Professor Julian Eaton, Senior Lecturer in Global Mental Health at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: "Integration does not work when it is treated as an extra checkbox for already stretched services. This package is invaluable because it sets out what good integration looks like in practice, from involving people with lived experience in service design, to routine screening and compassionate care, to referral pathways and peer support that reduce isolation and self-stigma. "If we want NTD programmes to succeed, we have to take stigma and mental health seriously as part of meeting overall needs, not as a separate issue." For frontline health workers, the ECP focuses on routine, compassionate, person-centered care. Training is emphasized not only to build clinical skills, but also to reduce stigmatising attitudes within services and ensure that comorbid mental health needs are recorded. At a system level, the ECP stresses that integration requires coordinated planning between NTD and mental health programmes rather than parallel delivery. This includes strengthening community-based supports such as peer groups, incorporating mental health indicators into routine NTD data collection, and exploring collaborative care models such as embedding mental health care specialists within NTD services. Together, these measures aim to make integrated care feasible in resource-constrained settings, improving wellbeing, strengthening treatment adherence and supporting progress towards NTD elimination and universal health coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Journal in which the study was published: Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Background: Ultraprocessed foods can be considered unhealthy because they are often low in essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and the industrial processing methods used to produce them introduce additives, artificial flavorings, preservatives, emulsifiers, and high levels of added sugars and unhealthy fats that the body is not well adapted to handle, Bonaccio explained. With the consumption of ultraprocessed foods on the rise in many countries around the world, Bonaccio said it is important to better understand whether eating less ultraprocessed food could help cancer survivors live longer and healthier lives. "What people eat after a cancer diagnosis may influence survival, but most research in this population has focused only on nutrients, not how processed the food is," Bonaccio said. "The substances involved in the industrial processing of foods can interfere with metabolic processes, disrupt gut microbiota, and promote inflammation. Within this cohort, they identified 802 cancer survivors at baseline (476 women and 326 men) who had provided thorough information about their diet via the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) food frequency questionnaire. The NOVA classification system, which assigns foods into one of four groups based on the level and purpose of processing, was used to classify whether a food was ultraprocessed. Individuals were then divided into three groups based on the weight ratio of ultraprocessed foods consumed. The researchers also adjusted for multiple factors including demographic factors, smoking status, body mass index, leisure-time physical activity, medical history, cancer type, and overall diet quality based on the Mediterranean Diet Score. Individuals in the highest third of ultraprocessed food consumed by weight ratio had a 48% higher rate of death from any cause and a 57% higher rate of death from cancer compared with those in the lowest third. A higher energy ratio of ultraprocessed foods showed similar results for cancer death, but not other causes. "Some foods may weigh a lot but contribute few calories, or vice versa, which is why the results can differ depending on the measure used," Bonaccio explained. "But the fact that the association between ultraprocessed foods and all-cause death persisted even after adjusting for overall diet quality suggests that the negative health effects are not explained solely by poor nutrient profiles, but that the level and nature of industrial food processing itself play an independent role in influencing long-term health outcomes." Among the biomarkers examined, adjusting for inflammatory scores and resting heart rate attenuated the association between ultraprocessed foods and all-cause death by 37.3%. "These results suggest that increased inflammation and elevated resting heart rate may partially explain the link between higher consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased mortality, and help to clarify how food processing itself could contribute to worse outcomes among cancer survivors," Bonaccio said. Some groups were linked to higher mortality, while others showed no clear pattern. However, interpreting individual ultraprocessed foods is challenging, and they are best considered as a dietary pattern rather than isolated items, Bonaccio said. Author's comments: "The main message for the public is that overall consumption of ultraprocessed foods matters far more than any individual item," Bonaccio said. A practical way to do this is by checking labels: Foods with more than five ingredients, or even only one food additive, are likely to be ultraprocessed." Study limitations: Limitations of this study include the fact that, as an observational study, causality cannot be inferred, dietary intakes were self-reported making them susceptible to misreporting, dietary habits could have changed over the course of the follow-up period, and the study was subject to survival bias as diet was assessed an average of 8.4 years after cancer diagnosis.

The Sheet E plug connector recently obtained Japanese PSE approval, joining other Interpower Sheet E plug connector safety agency approvals such as cULus, VDE, and CCC. The rewirable Sheet E angled plug connector carries a UL 94 V-0 flammability rating. The connector plug material is Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) with nickel-plated brass terminals, and is rated 10A (international), and 15A (North American) 250VAC. Loss of electrical continuity could occur to any plug in the industry if improperly disconnected at severe angles over time. One advantage of a rewirable plug is having access to "rewire" the conductors, which can be inspected or repaired by simply removing the four screws from the PBT housing. For 50 years, Interpower has manufactured electrical cable, power cords, cord sets, and components such as the recently approved Japanese Sheet E plug connector. Our videos, e-newsletters, blogs, and whitepapers make that knowledge readily available."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multidisciplinary team of University of Cincinnati Cancer Center researchers has received a $40,000 Ride Cincinnati grant to study a delayed release preparation, or wafer, of an immunostimulatory molecule to stimulate the central nervous system (CNS) immune system after surgery to remove glioblastoma, a form of primary brain cancer. Only 5% to 7% of patients with a glioblastoma survive five years after diagnosis. - The blood brain barrier that usually protects the brain from harmful bacteria also prevents high-molecular weight agent medications from reaching tumor cells. - The CNS is associated with a "cold" immune microenvironment, making it harder to stimulate an immune response to kill cancer cells that infiltrate the normal brain and are not able to be removed with surgery. Currently, neurosurgeons can use wafers that release either radiation or general cell-killing agents, but Forbes said these treatments are nonspecific, expensive and not found to provide much benefit to improve patient outcomes. "After surgery to remove the tumor, we have unencumbered access to a resection cavity that we know microscopically is invaded by tumor cells," said Forbes, associate professor and residency program director in the Department of Neurosurgery in UC's College of Medicine and a UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute neurosurgeon. Medical student Beatrice Zucca explained the first step of the project was to determine what immune-stimulating molecule was safe and powerful enough to activate the brain's immune system. "IL-15 is exceptionally effective at activating immune populations that are critical for recognizing and killing cancer cells," said Zucca, who worked as a neurooncology research fellow under Forbes' mentorship last fall. "It improves their survival, expands their numbers and enhances their cell-killing function, making it an ideal candidate for driving a coordinated immune attack against a highly-resistant cancer like glioblastoma." "An organ-on-a-chip is a miniaturized model of a living organ engineered to incorporate the minimal biological elements needed to recreate specific disease conditions," said Barrile, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in UC's College of Engineering and Applied Science. "Instead of testing drugs on flat plastic dishes or relying solely on animal models - which often fail to predict human results due to genetic disparities - we use 3D bioprinting and microfluidics to build a living model of a human organ." Barrile's lab was the first-ever to build a model that integrates human brain cells with glioblastoma cells via a combination of 3D printing and bioprinting. These cells are typically lost during in vitro cell culture." By using a patient's own cells on our chip, we can identify the best therapeutic approach for that specific individual before treatment even begins," Barrile said. "It's very exciting that we're actually working on both fronts at the University of Cincinnati, trying to find better treatments for glioblastoma," Forbes said. Zucca said the multidisciplinary research has been deeply meaningful, both scientifically and personally. "It brings together molecular immunology, biomedical engineering and clinical neurooncology in a way that has profoundly influenced my development as a researcher," Zucca said. "Most importantly, it represents a tangible step toward therapies that leverage the patient's own immune system to combat one of the most aggressive cancers known." Other collaborators on the project include Kevin Haworth and David Plas. Brain microphysiological systems are reshaping in vitro neurotoxicity testing through functional validation and advanced disease modeling. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the cognitive health implications of these adaptations have long been overlooked - until now. A new study led by UCLA anthropology professor Molly Fox has found that pregnancy and breastfeeding are linked with stronger long-term cognitive ability in postmenopausal women. Published this month in the scientific journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, the study found that an increase in cumulative time spent pregnant and time spent breastfeeding correlated with greater cognition, verbal memory and visual memory later in life. Researchers used data from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study and the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging, which annually assessed more than 7,000 women aged about 70 for up to 13 years. Women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease, something that has not been fully explained by the length of life span. Fox's study aimed to address this question by examining the relationship between reproductive histories and cognitive function in a large group over a long period, something previous studies had not yet accomplished. "Any ways in which we can focus public health outreach or clinical interventions toward higher-risk populations leads to more effective and efficient efforts," Fox said. As the team began their research, they hypothesized that longer breastfeeding, more pregnancies, and a greater ratio of the two would correspond with better cognitive function in postmenopausal women. The results matched the theory: Researchers found that women who were pregnant for an average of 30.5 months, compared with those who had never been pregnant, were expected to have a 0.31% higher global cognition score. A woman who breastfed for an average of 11.6 months in their lifetime would be expected to have a 0.12% higher global cognition score if everything else were held equal. The results indicated that each additional month of pregnancy was associated with a 0.01-point higher overall cognitive ability score. While these effect sizes are small, they are comparable to what has been observed for other known protective factors like non-smoking and high physical activity. With a disease like Alzheimer's that has been so elusive to prevention and treatment successes, and is so prevalent, even small changes to a person's risk are exciting discoveries. But long-term, pregnancy may be associated with improved cognitive health, indicating a shift from the initial and temporary postpartum decline. While these results support a connection between pregnancy and breastfeeding with long-term brain resilience, questions remain about the biological and sociocultural processes behind this relationship. The researchers wrote in the study that "more adult children could be a factor in the increased cognitive health, as supportive relationships could possibly buffer stress, promote well-being or encourage healthy behavior." They believe that such information could identify new therapeutic opportunities that "replicate or enhance the protective effects observed in women with specific reproductive histories," they wrote. "If we can figure out, as a next step, why those reproductive patterns lead to better cognitive outcomes in old age, then we can work toward figuring out how to craft therapies - for example, new drugs, repurposed drugs or social programs - that mimic the naturally-occurring effect we observed," Fox said. The team's research may open the door to potential advancements in preventative strategies targeting women at greater risk of Alzheimer's disease. At the population level, understanding this pattern may encourage further research into how changing fertility behaviors will affect trends in brain aging. Studies like the one led by Fox highlight the growing evidence that pregnancy and breastfeeding may play a role in brain function, with implications for women's health across generations. Data from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study and the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging were used to support these findings. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are associated with less later‐life cognitive decline in a longitudinal, prospective cohort. Brain microphysiological systems are reshaping in vitro neurotoxicity testing through functional validation and advanced disease modeling. Targeted protein degradation presents a promising strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, focusing on innovative approaches for gram-negative bacteria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Air ambulance pre-hospital care (HEMS) may make surviving critical injury more likely as it's associated with saving 5 more lives than would be expected in every 100 major trauma cases, suggests an analysis of survival data for one regional service in South East England, and published online in Emergency Medicine Journal. International evidence for the impact on survival of Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in major trauma has been hampered by methodological differences, inadequate sample sizes, and no agreed definitions of outcome, explain the researchers. And it's not clear which patients might benefit the most from these services. To find out, the researchers retrospectively analysed the outcomes of 3225 trauma patients in receipt of pre-hospital care from one HEMS team covering Kent, Surrey, and Sussex between 2013 and 2022. In all, 2125 patients exceeded 30 day survival following the incident (85% vs expected 81%), equivalent to 5 extra survivors in every 100 patients, adding up to as many as 115 additional lives saved each year, based on the average number of trauma patients attended by the service. Those patients most likely to benefit were those who were severely injured with a moderate (25-45%) probability of survival: 35% of them unexpectedly survived for 30 days. Key predictors of unexpected survival were younger age and higher initial Glasgow Coma Scale-a 3 to 15 point score used to assess level of consciousness after a brain injury. Pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia, which puts a trauma patient into an induced coma, and can only be performed by advanced care teams, such as HEMS, was independently associated with unexpected survival in this group. Among 1316 patients in traumatic cardiac arrest, 356 (27%) sustained return of spontaneous circulation while en route to hospital and 960 patients were pronounced dead at the scene. The researchers caution that their estimates represent excess survival compared with modelled predictions, rather than a causal effect of HEMS, and they assume consistent performance and case-mix over time, which may not always happen. Nevertheless, they say their findings illustrate "the potential magnitude of clinical benefit, consistent with previous economic and social benefits demonstrated in previous studies." They conclude: "These findings provide supportive evidence for continued investment in HEMS, particularly for severely injured patients, though comparative studies with alternative care pathways are needed to establish causal effectiveness."
