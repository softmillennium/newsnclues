                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Per Deadline, the Civil War studio will make good on its plans to expand the slasher series with two new projects. First on deck is a TV series from The Long Walk writer JT Mollner, actor Glen Powell, and producer Roy Lee. (Powell's currently just on hand to produce, possibly nixing any dreams of seeing him fight or die against Leatherface.) A new movie is also in early development by the show's producing team, but Mollner's reportedly not involved with it. I can't imagine better partners for this approach than A24. Powell similarly called the 1974 original one of his favorite films and “one of the definitive movies of my home state … With a marquee home in A24 and [with] visionary filmmaker JT Mollner, alongside our top-shelf producing partners, I couldn't have dreamed of a better team for such a dream property.” When Texas Chainsaw Massacre's rights were first up for grabs, horror filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Taylor Sheridan, and Oz Perkins were reportedly interested in getting onboard and reviving it with their own spin. We'll have more on the Texas show and eventual film as they develop.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pinterest fired employees who were trying to track the recently announced layoffs. The digital pinboard social media company announced last week that it would be laying off about 15% of its staff and shrinking its office space as part of a restructuring effort. In a meeting led by the company's Chief Technology Officer Matt Madrigal, engineering employees were told that Pinterest would not provide a list of affected employees due to privacy rights and company policies. That's when two employees took matters into their own hands. According to Pinterest, the engineers built an internal tool aimed at creating a master list of laid-off employees. “After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly,” a Pinterest spokesperson told Gizmodo in an emailed statement. CNBC and other outlets reported that those employees were eventually let go. Additionally, audio obtained from an all-hands meeting on Friday by CNBC suggests leadership viewed the incident as more than just a privacy issue. “Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions,” said Pinterest CEO Bill Ready at the meeting, according to CNBC. “But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist.” Like many tech companies in recent months, Pinterest has increasingly leaned into AI. Meanwhile, Amazon announced last week it was laying off roughly 16,000 workers. That all comes as software companies are currently experiencing a blood bath in the stock market. The new laws would make it harder for states and cities to regulate AI. Radars and cameras might be for seeing cars and people now but they can be used to make existing roads better in the first place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Littlebird founder Monica Plath was first promoting her Seattle-based startup in 2022, the idea was a “toddler tracker” designed to give parents a window into their child's day with a nanny or sitter. But as smartphone bans sweep through U.S. schools, Littlebird's promise has evolved into something more ambitious: a physical alternative for parents who want to stay connected without surrendering their kids to the digital world. “Parents don't have an option besides AirTagging their kids, and AirTags were meant to find luggage, not for on-demand, real-time alerts.” Strapped to the wrist of a kid, Littlebird looks like an Apple Watch at first glance, but without any screen to tell time, take calls, text friends, play music or check the internet. Plath said on LinkedIn this week that Littlebird shipped nearly 1,000 units in the first few days, and had $200,000 in sales on the first product release day last week. A University of Washington alum and single mom to two kids, Plath has spent the last two years overhauling Littlebird's technical DNA. The company has gone from niche toddler tool to what Plath calls a “frontier tech” contender, attracting the attention of two of the biggest names in retail and infrastructure: Amazon and Walmart. Plath said Littlebird is the first third-party company to integrate Amazon Sidewalk, a private, long-range network that piggybacks off the millions of Echo and Ring devices already sitting in American homes. And while Littlebird attracted 2,000 direct-to-consumer pre-orders over the last couple years, the startup is poised for a major retail leap. Unlike the Apple Watch or similar devices that can be viewed as classroom distractions, Littlebird does not chirp at the kids who are wearing it. There's no interactivity, just a light to signal that it's working. Sensors in the device determine when it's being worn. A “nest” is an important place such as home, school, or camp. Alerts can be set to signal when a child is coming and going. An early version of Littlebird was originally intended to monitor health metrics such as activity level, sleep, heart rate and temperature. “As we moved from prototypes into a real, shippable product for children, we made a deliberate decision not to ship anything that could be interpreted as medical functionality or invite medical claims,” Plath said. Littlebird has adopted a membership-based pricing model similar to high-end fitness wearables like Whoop and Oura. Littlebird employs six people and is looking to double headcount over the next couple months. “Less than 2% of all venture capital goes to female founders,” she said, adding that “against all odds” she's out to prove that Littlebird can build and scale hardware out of Seattle, a region known primarily for software and cloud tech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mistral AI has released a new family of AI models that it claims will clear the path to seamless conversation between people speaking different languages. The former is built to transcribe audio files in large batches and the latter for nearly real-time transcription, within 200 milliseconds; both can translate between 13 languages. Voxtral Realtime is freely available under an open source license. Mistral has pitched Voxtral Realtime—though the model outputs text, not speech—as a marked step towards free-flowing conversation across the language barrier, a problem Apple and Google are also competing to solve. The latest model from Google is able to translate at a two-second delay. This model is basically laying the groundwork for that,” claims Pierre Stock, VP of Science Operations at Mistral, in an interview with WIRED. Founded in 2023 by Meta and Google DeepMind alumni, Mistral is one of few European companies developing foundational AI models capable of running remotely close to the American market leaders—OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google—from a capability standpoint. Without access to the same level of funding and compute, Mistral has focused on eking out performance through imaginative model design and careful optimization of training datasets. The aim is that micro-improvements across all aspects of model development translate into material performance gains. Mistral's flagship large language model (LLM) does not match competing models developed by US competitors for raw capability. “Mistral offers an alternative that is more cost efficient, where the models are not as big, but they're good enough, and they can be shared openly,” says Annabelle Gawer, director at the Centre of Digital Economy at the University of Surrey. “Mistral does not position itself as a niche player, but it is certainly creating specialized models,” says Gawer. You leave this kind of less profitable business on the table, which creates room for middle players.” As the relationship between the US and its European allies shows signs of deterioration, Mistral has leant increasingly into its European roots too. “There is a trend in Europe where companies and in particular governments are looking very carefully at their dependency on US software and AI firms,” says Dan Bieler, principal analyst at IT consulting firm PAC. “Their question has always been: How do we build a defensible position in a market that is dominated by hugely financed American actors?” says Raphaëlle D'Ornano, founder of tech advisory firm D'Ornano + Co. “The approach Mistral has taken so far is that they want to be the sovereign alternative, compliant with all the regulations that may exist within the EU.” “Small and more regionally focused models will play a much larger role going forward.” In your inbox: Sign up for our new Tracker: ICE newsletter Big Story: He leaked a scam compound's secrets—and had to get out alive</p>

What started as one fortuitous shopper's success story in securing a graphics card at an amazingly low price has escalated into an all-out bragging contest. Redditors are flooding a viral thread to flaunt the incredible steals they've scored on Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 (codenamed Blackwell) series (codenamed Blackwell), some of the best graphics cards that you can buy at the moment. The original poster recently purchased a PNY GeForce RTX 5080 Overclocked Triple Fan graphics card for $562.49, 44% below its MSRP. Meanwhile, another Redditor gave fellow users a friendly heads-up about multiple PNY GeForce RTX 5070 Overclocked Triple Fan graphics cards at another Walmart store with $439.20 price tags. However, not every scavenger hunt has a happy ending. One unlucky Redditor had bought a PNY GeForce RTX 5090 Overclocked Triple Fan graphics card at MSRP, which is rare nowadays given market conditions. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. There's always a risk of purchasing high-value computer hardware at Walmart's clearance area. Sometimes these marked items are online returns where dishonest buyers use the swindler scam, and Walmart doesn't properly verify them. At other times, you may get lucky because markdowns result from damaged packaging or missing contents. As you can see from our GPU price tracker, prices continue to soar, and there is limited inventory across all U.S. retailers. It's near impossible to find a graphics card at MSRP, much less good deals on them. Desperate PC builders and upgraders have started looking beyond traditional retail channels and poking around in unorthodox places, such as Walmart clearance areas or thrift stores, which have produced a couple of interesting finds.

These users often completely ignore, leave out, or outright lie about the downsides of these drugs, from chronic weed use to LSD. But maybe its a pop-science kind of fact that I've been carring along all this time without factuality? So over the years of habit building, I've forced myself, when asked a question, to wait, argue it out in my head, then respond.So, in face-to-face conversations, I appear slow but at least not dumb, but I come to a fleshed-out conclusion.

The impacts are subtle, but they're there.The negative side effects are definitely being underrepresented at the “non-scaremongering” parts of civilization. For me, the downsides manifest as drarticlsly increased anxiety (I naturally have next to none), extremely poor sleep - I sleep but the sleep is so low quality it begins to feel like my brain barely works right, and the obvious one, the effects on your motivation. I naturally tend towards ADHD style dopamine chasing, and weed makes that about 100x worse. Instead of getting my work done, I will procrastinate with any number of cheap dopamine hits such as video games, internet sleuthing, etc. Have you tried blending in CBD?Typically I smoke small joints with 90% CBD strains and the rest a high THC strain, only thing I can smoke.

Any intelligence I've lost was not going towards anything that mattered anyway. That's actually what got me to quit initially years ago. So why am I okay with getting high? Edit: down-voters do not allow me to dislike the smell. I don't smoke weed but I had a roommate in college that smoked in the apartment 24/hours a day. But, after that first week, I didn't even notice the smell. I can smell it when the car ahead of me is smoking, I can smell it when the person on the other side of the bar recently smoked, hell, I can smell it in my car as soon as I start to approach my neighboring state where it's legal. Of course, eventually I realized it coincided with my neighbors college-aged kid coming home for summer break and smoking in their room.Anyone that says that cigarette smoke, perfume, car exhaust, people's breath in general, smell to any degree that weed does to non-smokers is incredulous.

Most drugs, OTOH, when used at the doses that make them attractive to recreational drug users, impair reason, and impairing reason is not just stupid, but immoral. We can debate the particular methods by which the state regulates or otherwise deals with drug use, but there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the criminalization of such drugs as such. This may seem alien to a culture whose emaciated understanding of morality is exhausted by the concept of consent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is betting that an AI assistant best known for turning on lights and answering trivia questions can become a sought-after benefit of its Prime membership, in the same league as free shipping and streaming video. The company is making Alexa+, the generative AI-powered upgrade to its voice assistant, available free starting today to all U.S. Prime members, nearly a year after it was unveiled. Today's rollout opens it up to Amazon's full U.S. Prime membership base, which is estimated at more than 200 million individual members by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. But the broad rollout comes more than three years into the generative AI era, with AI habits already ingrained for many users around ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others. Given its late start, Amazon is hoping that unlimited access to Alexa+ via Prime (including a browser-based chat experience at Alexa.com) will help close the gap against those rivals. Daniel Rausch, Amazon's vice president of Alexa and Echo, said in an interview that the Prime benefit is aimed at customers who use AI tools but can't or don't want to pay for a standalone subscription. Rausch cited the example of students and others who “bounce around between different chat assistants” when they hit usage limits on free tiers. Whether consumers see it as a true replacement for other AI chatbots remains to be seen. The site was only able to accept one document at a time, unlike other chatbots that can handle multiple uploads simultaneously. It's a small but telling limitation for anyone accustomed to the competition. For example, having uploaded those materials individually, I can now ask Alexa+ on my Echo devices to reference them in its responses — something I've been doing already in the Alexa+ early access program with emails from our kid's school and other family documents. Rausch said 76% of what customers do with Alexa+ is unavailable in any other AI, according to Amazon's own internal data. He cited functionality such as smart home controls, family calendar management, music discovery, booking reservations, and the thousands of device and service integrations that Amazon has built up over a decade. The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek Oregon theater marquee joked about ‘Melania' movie, and manager says Amazon pulled the film Amazon's ‘Just Walk Out' tech will survive company's retail pullback, minus the palm-scanning Amazon's new Alexa+ uses generative AI to personalize conversations and automate tasks Alexa+ in the real world: How I'm using Amazon's new assistant, and where it could still improve Claude meets Alexa: Amazon will reportedly use Anthropic's AI to help power its voice assistant</p>

Adobe's Monday announcement about discontinuing Animate was met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger, and users aired concerns about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate's functionality. The company changed its tune on Wednesday, saying there would no longer be a “deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.” Maintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users - we will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,” it said. One customer, posting on X, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like, “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and, “literally what the hell are they doing? Other customers would have support through March of next year. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.” we literally had a whole semester of adobe animate class and now they're discontinuing it 😭 https://t.co/Xsn9t05qpV Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.” For instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SNAK Venture Partners announced Wednesday the close of its oversubscribed $50 million debut fund, anchored by the investment firm Pritzker Group (founded by Illinois governor JB Pritzker and his brother, Tony). “Most of those wins were in consumer, which tends to be faster-moving than large enterprises,” Nagar continued. “We think there's a ton of white space to double down and focus on B2B marketplaces.” Looking specifically for the categories that haven't yet digitized. Though many new funds are struggling to raise capital (and capital remains concentrated at the top), Nagar said she and Koopersmith were able to lean on their backgrounds when wooing LPs. Nagar previously helped launch Amazon apparel back in 2009, and was head of mobile at RetailMeNot. Koopersmith, meanwhile, spent 20 years at Pritzker Group and serves on the board of various marketplace companies. At the same time, Nagar said that without Pritzker's support, it would have been quite hard to raise this fund, especially in last year's environment. Nagar said the firm is also location-agnostic, recognizing that the still-hidden marketplaces may not be found only in Silicon Valley and New York City. “We're finding these overlooked founders in places where maybe other funds aren't looking,” she said. SNAK is itself based in Chicago, which she said some LPs have questioned. Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Quebec pilot is the first field deployment of Vema Hydrogen's Engineered Mineral Hydrogen (EMH) technology and, according to the company, a significant development on its route toward tapping into a gigawatt-scale hydrogen supply that can attract and power high-value industries, support regional growth, and redefine what's possible for decarbonization in North America. Through that agreement, Vema's clean hydrogen will be leveraged by Verne to provide affordable, reliable, and low-emission power to its data center customers, with operations beginning as early as 2028. “Natural hydrogen is a critical element rapidly emerging as the first new primary energy source in decades,” said Ran Narayanasamy, CEO of MAX Power Mining, a natural hydrogen exploration company in Saskatchewan, Canada. “The advantage with natural hydrogen is that it's cleaner and more cost-effective. The broader promise of Vema's approach depends on how natural hydrogen compares with existing production methods. “99% of hydrogen is manufactured as emissions-emitting energy produced through fossil fuels. As natural hydrogen exists in an end product form under the ground, costly technological processes involved in manufactured hydrogen are eliminated from the process.” Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst at the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore., agreed that the equipment and energy costs of manufacturing hydrogen can be high. “Granted, with enough green energy — solar, wind, geothermal, atomic — you could manufacture hydrogen sustainably,” he conceded, “but the initial hardware cost would be excessive.” “Vema's Quebec pilot wells aim to prove that idea at scale by producing baseload hydrogen from rock formations, not from a factory,” he told TechNewsWorld. He explained that most hydrogen today comes from fossil-based pathways such as steam methane reforming, which is cheap but carbon-intensive unless carbon dioxide is captured; even then, you still rely on gas supply chains. “Electrolysis can be low carbon, but the economics swing hard with power prices and electrolyzer capex, which is why scale-up stays constrained in many markets,” he continued. “Geologic hydrogen tries to flip the model,” he added, “by sourcing hydrogen generated and stored in the crust, potentially lowering cost while keeping supply steady.” Vena noted that the challenges for hydrogen miners are not trivial. “You have to find it, then you have to prove it flows consistently, which is the difference between a science project and an energy business,” he said. “Subsurface uncertainty is real, including variable reservoir behavior and the need to manage risks like water impacts and induced seismicity from industrial operations,” he continued. “Hydrogen comes with the challenge that it is very light,” noted Rick Bentley, CEO of HydroHash, a crypto mining company that focuses on clean energy and high-efficiency operations, in Albuquerque, N.M. In liquid form, the energy density per weight is reasonably high, but the energy density per volume is still poor compared to natural or propane gases, in their liquid forms, with their relatively heavy carbon molecules.” “It is a very plentiful, potentially very green resource if you can find, remove, and transport it — much greener than petrochemicals, which have to be refined and can cause significant environmental damage in oceans, overland, and when burned,” he noted. “As an analyst, I'm extremely optimistic about this topic,” added Vena. “Hydrogen wins when it solves a specific problem, like firm power in constrained grids, industrial heat, or clean backup that beats diesel on both emissions and operations.” “The industry has spent years arguing about colors of hydrogen, but the next phase is about boring things like uptime, delivered cost, and permitting,” he said. “If geologic hydrogen delivers a steady baseload supply, it could be the rare hydrogen story that feels more like energy infrastructure than a climate experiment.” His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.

The Cornell Chronicle blog mentions that the interdisciplinary group, led by Sriramya Nair, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in the David A. Duffield College of Engineering, was already working with a 6,000-pound industrial robot for large-scale 3D printing of concrete structures on Terra Firma. This preassembled team spotted the Department of Defence's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) call for proposals, in search of 3D printing concrete construction tech which could be used several yards beneath the sea. “We said, ‘Hey, let's just do this and see, so that we will at least understand what the challenges are,'” recalls Nair. The researchers' hunch largely paid off, with an award of a $1.4m grant, contingent on meeting certain benchmarks, and promising early sub-sea results. Among the major challenges of 3D printing concrete underwater is washout, where the cement washes away more than binds to itself or its intended location. The Cornell team managed to overcome this hurdle with an experimentally optimized balance between material viscosity and pumpabiliity. DARPA also set out a specific challenge to overcome: the agency wanted the concrete mix to incorporate seafloor sediment as a major ingredient. This requirement was set for logistical purposes, but would also help minimize environmental impact – repurposing materials already present in the underwater area. The researchers also had some work to do on new sensing systems so they could carefully monitor and adapt the underwater 3D printing process in low-visibility conditions.

That's why tools like shred and SDelete rename files before destroying them. But even then, when those tools rename and destroy files, it stands out, it might even be worse because investigators can speculate more. It might corroborate some other piece of evidence (e.g.: sdelete's prefetch entry on windows, or download history from a browser for the same tool), and that might be a more serious charge (obstruction of justice in the US).

So no, don't be coy and pretend that all governments are like American institutions. No platform ever should allow CSAM content.And the fact that they didn't even care and haven't want to spend money for implementing guardrails or moderation is deeply concerning.This has imho nothing to do with model censorship, but everything with allowing that kind of content on a platform And the fact that they didn't even care and haven't want to spend money for implementing guardrails or moderation is deeply concerning.This has imho nothing to do with model censorship, but everything with allowing that kind of content on a platform This has imho nothing to do with model censorship, but everything with allowing that kind of content on a platform So not CSAM, but still creepy and something Reddit tightly decided it didn't want on the site.

But I am having trouble justifying in an consistent manner why Grok / X should be liable here instead of the user. I've seen a few arguments here that mostly comes down to:1. That this isn't just on the user's computer but instead posted on X.For 1. it seems to breakdown if we look more broadly at how LLMs are used. We're basically starting to treat LLMs as a higher level framework now. We don't hold vendors of programming languages or frameworks responsible if someone uses them to create CSAM. If in this case Grok isn't liable then why does the automatic posting (from the user's instructions) make it different? If it is, then it's not about the distribution anymore.There are some comparisons to photoshop, that if i created a deep fake with photoshop that I'm liable not Adobe. If photoshop had a "upload to X" button, and I created CSM using photoshop and hit the button to upload to X directly, is now Adobe now liable?What am I missing?

LLMs are completely different to programming languages or even Photoshop.You can't type a sentence and within 10 seconds get images of CSAM with Photoshop. LLMs are also built on trained material, unlike the traditional tools in Photoshop. There have been plenty CSAM found in the training data sets, but shock-horror apparently not enough information to know "where it came from". There's a non-zero chance that this CSAM Grok is vomiting out is based on "real" CSAM of people being abused. You can't type a sentence and within 10 seconds get images of CSAM with Photoshop.

Because Grok and X aren't even doing the most basic filtering they could do to pretend to filter out CSAM. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze3p1j710koReports on sextortion, self-generated indecent images, and grooming via social media/messaging apps:Snapchat 54%Instagram 11%Facebook 7%WhatsApp 6-9%X 1-2% Reports on sextortion, self-generated indecent images, and grooming via social media/messaging apps:Snapchat 54%Instagram 11%Facebook 7%WhatsApp 6-9%X 1-2% A provider should have no responsibility how the tools are used.

Yes, AI chatbots have to do everything in their power to avoid users easily generating such content.ANDYes, people that do so (even if done so on your self-hosted model) have to be punished.I believe it is OK that Grok is being investigated because the point is to figure out whether this was intentional or not.Just my opinion.

Platforms moderating illegal content is exactly what we are arguing about, so you can't use it as an argument.The rest cases you list are harms to the people using the tools/products.

X also actively distributes and profits off of CSAM. Why shouldn't the law apply to distribution centers? I mean, I thought that was basically already the law in the UK.I can see practical differences between X/twitter doing moderation and the full ISP censorship, but I cannot see any differences in principle...

Turns out people can handle that nuance just fine. If a platform encourages and doesn't moderate at all, yes we should go after the platform.Imagine a newspaper publishing content like that, and saying they are not responsible for their journalists Imagine a newspaper publishing content like that, and saying they are not responsible for their journalists ——-You've said that whatever is behind door number 1 is unacceptable.Behind door number 2, “holding tool users responsible”, is tracking every item generated via AI, and being able to hold those users responsible.If you don't like door number 2, we have door number 3 - which is letting things be.For any member of society, opening door 3 is straight out because the status quo is worse than reality before AI.If you reject door 1 though, you are left with tech monitoring.

Everything I read from X's competitors in the media tells me to hate X, and hate Elon.If we prosecute people not tools, how are we going to stop X from hurting the commercial interests of our favourite establishment politicians and legacy media? If we prosecute people not tools, how are we going to stop X from hurting the commercial interests of our favourite establishment politicians and legacy media? (note that this isn't a raid on Musk personally! What's new is that X automated the production of obscene or sexualised images by providing grok. Yes we are now dealing with an automated Photoshop. And somehow the people in charge have decided to do something about it, probably more for political or maybe darker reasons.So let me make a suggestion: maybe France or the EU should ban its citizen from investing in the upcoming SpaceX/xAI IPO, and also Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Adobe, etc. ?Hit them hard at the money level... it wouldn't be more authoritarian than something like ChatControl or restricting access to VPNs.And actually all the mechanisms are already in place to implement something like that.

And actually all the mechanisms are already in place to implement something like that. I don't get what's difficult to understand or believe here. Grok causes a big issue in practice right now, a larger issue than photoshop, and it should be easy for X to regulate it themselves like the competition does but they don't, so the state intervenes.> maybe France or the EU should ban its citizen from investing in the upcoming SpaceX/xAI IPO, and also Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Adobe, etc. A surgical strike is used to target the actual problem.

But then people find exploits just like the competition. I'm sorry, but I don't understand any of the arguments above.If we presume a dark control motivation then having shares in the entities you want to control is the best form of control there is. How can you say that nobody is posting CSAM on a massive decentralized social network with thousands of servers? There's basically no consent with what Grok is doing. Uncontrolled profileration of AI-CSAM makes detection of "genuine" data much harder, prosecution of perpetrators more difficult and specifically in many of the grok cases it harms young victims that were used as templates for the material.Content is unacceptable if its proliferation causes sufficient harm, and this is arguably the case here. If the prosecutor can't find evidence of a crime and a person is not charged, that is considered harmful? Making law enforcement have to work harder to find evidence of a crime cannot be criminalized unless you can come up with a reason why the actions themselves deserve to be criminalized.> specifically in many of the grok cases it harms young victims that were used as templates for the material.What is the criteria for this?

You could make a multitude of arguments against that perspective, but at least there is a conclusive reason for legal restrictions.> What is the criteria for this?My criteria would be victims suffering personally from the generated material.The "no harm" argument only really applies if victims and their social bubble never find out about the material (but that did happen, sometimes intentionally, in many cases).You could make the same argument that a hidden camera in a locker room never causes any harm as long as it stays undetected; that is not very convincing to me. > What is the criteria for this?My criteria would be victims suffering personally from the generated material.The "no harm" argument only really applies if victims and their social bubble never find out about the material (but that did happen, sometimes intentionally, in many cases).You could make the same argument that a hidden camera in a locker room never causes any harm as long as it stays undetected; that is not very convincing to me.

Would "I didn't know it was real" really count as a legal defense? Would "I didn't know it was real" really count as a legal defense? Absolutely-- prosecution would presumably need to at least show that you could have known the material was "genuine".This could be a huge legal boon for prosecuted "direct customers" and co-perpetrators that can only be linked via shared material.

Encryption serves ones individual privacy and preserves it against malicious actors. I'd guess that's a fundamental right in most jurisdictions, globally.We're talking CSAM here and shifting its creation into the virtual world through some GenAI prompts. Just because that content has been created artificially, doesn't make its storage and distribution any more legal.It isn't some reductionist "this makes enforcement of other laws harder", but it's rather that the illegal distribution of artificially generated content acts as fraudulent obstruction in the prosecution of authentic, highly illegal, content - content with malicious actors and physically affected victims.

I almost completely agree with your outlook, but I think that many of our laws trade such individual freedoms for better society-wide outcomes, and those are often good tradeoffs.Just consider gun legislation, driving licenses, KYC laws in finance, etc: Should the state have any business interfering there? I'd argue in isolation (ideally) not; but all those lead to huge gains for society, making it much less likely to be murdered by intoxicated drivers (or machine-gunners) and limit fraud, crime and corruption.So even if laws look kinda bad from a purely theoretical-ethics point of view it's still important to look at the actual effects that they have before dismissing them as unjust in my view.

The "oh its photoshop" defence was an early one, which required the law to change in the uk to be "depictions" of children, so that people who talk about ebephiles don't have an out for creating/distributing illegal content. First you defend CSAM, then we were talking about sexualised images of people without their consent, you were trying to diminish this as „just bikini“ pics As a father there shouldn't be any CSAM content anywhere.And think about that it is already proven these models apparently had CSAM content in their training data.Also what about the nudes of actual people? And think about that it is already proven these models apparently had CSAM content in their training data.Also what about the nudes of actual people? Also what about the nudes of actual people? I am shocked that we are even discussing this. But they are happy to censor for countries like turkeyHypocrisy level 1 million I still believe that the EU and aligned countries would rather have America to agree to much tighter speech controls, digital ID, ToS-based speech codes as apparently US Democrats partly or totally agree to. Surely we can still point at those laws and question their motives though.Spanish PM plainly stated a sort of editor framework of responsibility for platforms. This is the same country that strongly advocates for Chat Control within the EU, also looking for a similar under-16 ban on social media.So the same government is at once looking to deanonimize social media users, revoke their privacy regarding communications, and to enforce moderation standards never seen before.

Would it be good or bad if the user was met with a "This website is by law not available within the EU"? currently VPNs are too easy to use for the leadership of autocracies like the EU or the UK to be comfortable with them, so at the very least they will require for backdoors to see which citizens are watching what, and have them visited by fellows in hi-vis jackets No there isn't.Governments discussing such things doesn't _remotely_ mean there is a political will for them, or that they will be voted into law.Governments are expected to research and discuss paths of legislation (and in this case, come to the conclusion banning VPNs is both harmful and ridiculous).

Compare the DOJ fines on European banks and automakers with European fines on tech companies and you'll realize how ridiculous this claim is.

For some reason you forgot to mention "Like the US did with TikTok". when America already controls the main outlets through Android Play Store and Apple Store, and yep, they have proven to control them not just happen to host them as a countryarguably America did have valid security concerns with Huawei though, but if those are the rules then you cannot complain later on arguably America did have valid security concerns with Huawei though, but if those are the rules then you cannot complain later on They are tasked - and held to account by respective legislative bodies - with implementing the law as written.Nobody wrote a law saying "Go after Grok".

This isn't "anti-democratic", it's literally democracy in action standing up to technocratic feudalism that is an Ayn Randian-wet dream being played out by some morons who got lucky. As someone who has lived in (and followed current affairs) in both of these countries, this is a very idealistic and naïve view. There can be a big gap between theory and practice> There are statutory instruments (in France, constitutional clauses), that determine the independence of these authorities.> They are tasked - and held to account by respective legislative bodies -It's worth nothing here that the UK doesn't have separation of powers or a supreme court (in the US sense) > There are statutory instruments (in France, constitutional clauses), that determine the independence of these authorities.> They are tasked - and held to account by respective legislative bodies -It's worth nothing here that the UK doesn't have separation of powers or a supreme court (in the US sense) > They are tasked - and held to account by respective legislative bodies -It's worth nothing here that the UK doesn't have separation of powers or a supreme court (in the US sense) It's worth nothing here that the UK doesn't have separation of powers or a supreme court (in the US sense) however it's a very mainstream point of view so i respect that he/she has laid it out pretty well, so i upvoted the comment The European Court of Human Rights has reminded this point (e.g. 29 Mar 2010, appl. For a local observer, this is made obvious by the fact that the procureur, in France, always follows current political vibes, usually in just a few months delay (extremely fast, when you consider how slowly justice works in the country). This is kind of a genuine question from me since I have no idea how these authorities are set up in France or the UK... My most recent case: I went on holiday to a resort in Turkey, numerous Russians, families, retired, etc. I don't pass as a Russian-speaker (but I understand quite well) and once they hear me talking other unrelated language they naturally start to speak more freely in front of me (i.e. more liberal use of swearing, and even slurs if no other Russians are around).While sunbathing, or at the restaurant, or the pool, they were talking about daily, mundane things, same in the restaurant, etc. But when floating in pairs 20-30m from the shore? But when floating in pairs 20-30m from the shore? This step could come before a police raid.This looks like plain political pressure. Siezing records is usually a major step in an investigation. France has a reasonable judicial system so absent of other evidence i'm inclined to believe this was legit. Sure it could just be harrasment, but this is also how normal police work looks. France has a reasonable judicial system so absent of other evidence i'm inclined to believe this was legit. So the question becomes if it was done knowingly or recklessly, hence a police raid for evidence.See also [0] for a legal discussion in the German context. See also [0] for a legal discussion in the German context. I think one big issue with this statement – "CSAM" lacks a precise legal definition; the precise legal term(s) vary from country to country, with differing definitions. While sexual imagery of real minors is highly illegal everywhere, there's a whole lot of other material – textual stories, drawings, animation, AI-generated images of nonexistent minors – which can be extremely criminal on one side of an international border, de facto legal on the other.And I'm not actually sure what the legal definition is in France; the relevant article of the French Penal Code 227-23 [0] seems superficially similar to the legal definition of "child pornography" in the United States (post-Ashcroft vs Free Speech Coalition), and so some–but (maybe) not all–of the "CSAM" Grok is accused of generating wouldn't actually fall under it. (But of course, I don't know how French courts interpret it, so maybe what it means in practice is something broader than my reading of the text suggests. That's less of an issue for Anthropic/Google/OpenAI, since their executives don't have the same "anything that's legal" attitude which xAI often has. And, as I said – while that's undoubtedly true in general, I'm unsure to what extent it is actually true for France in particular.

But my impression is the definition of that word under French law is possibly narrower than some definitions of the English acronym “CSAM”. Canadian law is much broader, and so what's legally pédopornographie (English “child pornogaphy”) in Canada may be much closer to broad “CSAM” definitions> The point is, X did things that are illegal in France, no matter what you call them.Which French law are you alleging they violated? And how exactly are you claiming they violated it?Note the French authorities at this time are not accusing them of violating the law. I don't think the French legal process has reached a conclusion either way yet.One relevant case is the unpublished 2007 Court of Cassation decision 06-86.763 dated 12 septembre 2007 [0] which upheld a conviction of child pornography for importing and distributing the anime film “Twin Angels - le retour des bêtes célestes - Vol. [0] However, the somewhat odd situation is that it appears that film is catalogued by the French national library, [1] although I don't know if a catalogue entry definitively proves they possess the item. 227-23 distinguishes between material depicting under 15s (illegal to even possess) and material depicting under 18s (only illegal to possess with intent to distribute); this prosecution appears to be have been brought under the latter category only-even though the individual was depicted as being under the 15-suggesting this anime might not be illegal to possess in France if one has no intent to distribute it.But this is the point - one needs to look at the details of exactly what the law says and how exactly the authorities apply it, rather than vague assertions of criminality which might not actually be true. > The point is, X did things that are illegal in France, no matter what you call them.Which French law are you alleging they violated?

The company made and released a tool with seemingly no guard-rails, which was used en masse to generate deepfakes and child pornography. One the one hand, it seems "obvious" that Grok should somehow be legally required to have guardrails stopping it from producing kiddie porn.On the other hand, it also seems "obvious" that laws forcing 3D printers to detect and block attempts to print firearms are patently bullshit.The thing is, I'm not sure how I can reconcile those two seemingly-obvious statements in a principled manner.

X is the owner from computer that produced CP. So of course X is at least also a bit liable for producing CP. Also, safe harbor doesn't apply because this is published under the @grok handle! It's being published by X under one of their brand names, it's absurd to argue that they're unaware or not consenting to its publication. People creating nudes of others and using the Internet to distribute it can be sued for defamation, sure. I don't think the people hosting the service should be liable themselves, just like people hosting Tor nodes shouldn't be liable by what users of the Tor Network do. I'd guess Elon is responsible for that product decision. If you're hosting content, why shouldn't you be responsible, because your business model is impossible if you're held to account for what's happening on your premises?Without safe harbor, people might have to jump through the hoops of buying their own domain name, and hosting content themselves, would that be so bad? Without safe harbor, people might have to jump through the hoops of buying their own domain name, and hosting content themselves, would that be so bad? You have to understand that Europe doesn't give a shit about techbro libertarians and their desire for a new Lamborghini. I would prefer 10,000 service providers to one big one that gets to read all the plaintext communication of the entire planet. As it stands, I have a bunch of photos on my phone that would almost certainly get flagged by over-eager/overly sensitive child porn detection — close friends and family sending me photos of their kids at the beach. I've helped bathe and dress some of those kids. There's nothing nefarious about any of it, but it's close enough that services wouldn't take the risk, and that would be a loss to us all. (Snark aside, in your opinion are there comments on HN that dang would be criminally liable for if it weren't for safe harbor?) Grok makes it trivial to create fake CSAM or other explicit images. Before, if someone spent a week on photoshop to do the same, It won't be Adobe that gets the blame.Same for 3D printers. Before, anyone could make a gun provided they have the right tools (which is very expensive), now it's being argued that 3D printers are making this more accessible. Although I would argue it's always been easy to make a gun, all you need is a piece of pipe. But I think that's the crux if it. Technology is making previously difficult things easier, to the benefit of all humanity. It's just unfortunate that some less-nice things have also been included.

It's just unfortunate that some less-nice things have also been included. Without such clear legal definitions going after Grok while not going after photoshop is just an act of political pressure. This isn't about AI or CSAM (Have we seen any other AI companies raided by governments for enabling creation of deepfakes, dangerous misinformation, illegal images, or for flagrant industrial-scale copyright infringement?) The only thing I saw was Grok changing photos of adults into them wearing bikinis, which is far less bad. This is how it works, at least in civil law countries. If the prosecutor has reasonable suspicious that a crime is taking place they send the so-called "judiciary police" to gather evidence. Just last week I participated in a raid.

First paragraph on Wikipedia> Child pornography (CP), also known as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and by more informal terms such as kiddie porn,[1][2][3] is erotic material that involves or depicts persons under the designated age of majority.

The term CSAM was adopted in the UK following outrage over the "Gary Glitter Effect" - soaring offence rates driven by news of people caught downloading images of unspeakable abuse crimes getting mild sentences for mere child porn.This is why many feel strongly about defending the term "CSAM" from those who seek to dilute it to cover e.g. mild Grok-style child porn.The UK Govt. has announced plans to define CSAM in law.

I'm pretty sure you can add all the Governments, police depts and online safety organisations who use this term and rely upon it. Even if some kid makes a video of themselves jerking off for their own personal enjoyment, unprompted by anyone else, if someone else gains access to that (eg a technician at a store or an unprincipled guardian) and makes a copy for themselves they're criminally exploiting the kid by doing so. In some jurisdictions (such as Australia), this falls under the legal definition. That's why e.g. Interpol runs a global database of CSAM but doesn't bother for mere child porn. If you can't do that without keeping the model closed and verifying everyone's identities... well, that's good for your profits I guess. Everybody else has teams building guardrails to mitigate this fundamental existential horror of these models. If you don't like the law your billion dollar company still has to follow it. Can't because even before GenAI the "oh its generated in photoshop" or "they just look young" excuse was used successfully to allow a lot of people to walk free. Yes they could have an uncensored model, but then they would need proper moderation and delete this kind of content instantly or ban users that produce it. Or don't allow it in the first place.It doesn't matter how CSAM is produced, the only thing that matters is that is on the platform.I am flabbergasted people even defend this I think the HN crowd is more nuanced than you're giving them credit for: https://hn.algolia.com/?q=chat+control Did X do enough to prevent its website being used to distribute illegal content - consensual sexual material of both adults and children?Now reintroduce AI generation, where X plays a more active role in facilitating the creation of that illegal content. Now reintroduce AI generation, where X plays a more active role in facilitating the creation of that illegal content. In the UK, you must take "reasonable" steps to remove illegal content.This normally means some basic detection (ie fingerprinting which is widely used from a collaborative database) or if a user is consistently uploading said stuff, banning them.Allowing a service that you run to continue to generate said illegal content, even after you publicly admit that you know its wrong, is not reasonable.

Judges can evolve and interpret as they see fit, and this evolution is case law.This is why in the US the supreme court can effectively change the law by issuing a binding ruling. (see 2nd amendment meaning no gun laws, rather than as written, or the recent racial profiling issues) (see 2nd amendment meaning no gun laws, rather than as written, or the recent racial profiling issues) this is not compatible with that line of business - perhaps one of the reasons nothing is done in Europe these days Except for 40% of all Big Tech products and a vast industrial network of companies, and the safe airplane building and decent financial services that don't take 3% of everything, then yeah, I guess nothing is done in Europe these days.And wait, wasn't most of Google's AI stuff acquired from a European country?Honestly, while Europe has a lot of problems, this notion that many US people have that literally nothing happens there is wildly off-base.

Like, this is a function of fragmented capital markets rather than anything else. Like Walmart has a market cap of over 1tn now, do you think its business has materially changed since 2021 (when it was half that)?Meta has basically doubled since then, and again, their business is basically the same as it was 5 years ago.As another example, Stripe is valued at about 100bn, while both OpenAI and Anthropic are 3.5-5x that.

The vast majority of the EU is not common law, so "reasonable" in this instance is different.What you describe already happens in the USA, that why MLB has that weird local TV blackout, why bad actors use copyright to take down content they don't like.The reason why its so easy to do that is because companies must reasonably comply with copyright holder's requests.Its the same with CSAM, distributing it doesn't have first amendment protection, knowingly distributing it is illegal.

The way chatbots actually work, I wonder if we shouldn't treat the things they say more or less as words in a book of fiction.

Then, if violations continue, maybe two or three rounds follow... but at some point, especially if the violations are openly intentional (and Musk's behavior makes that very very clear), the hammer gets brought down.Our system is based on the idea that we institute complex regulations, and when they get introduced and stuff goes south, we assume that it's innocent mistakes first.And in addition to that, there's the geopolitical aspect... basically, hurt Musk to show Trump that, yes, Europe means business and has the means to fight back.As for the allegations:> The probe has since expanded to investigate alleged “complicity” in spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organised group, and other offences, the office said in a statement Tuesday.The GDPR/DMA stuff just was the opener anyway.

The warrant will have detailed what it is they are looking for, French warrants (and legal system!) are quite a bit different than the US but in broad terms operate similarly.

That's aside from the fact that they're a publicly traded company under obligation to keep a gazillion records anyway like in any other jurisdiction.

Probably better not to have inconvenient non-US-approved independent thoughts like that. To me, that's the distinction between political opponents I can respect, and, well, whatever we're seeing now. You got this information from American media (or their allies')In reality, Venezuelans flooded the streets in marches demanding the return of their president. Claim that you suspect there may be abuse, it will trigger a case for a "worrying situation".Then it's a procedural lottery:-> If you get lucky, they will investigate, meet the people, and dismiss the case.-> If you get unlucky, they will take the baby, and it's only then after a long investigation and a "family assistant" (that will check you every day), that you can recover your baby.Typically, ex-wife who doesn't like the ex-husband, but it can be a neighbor etc.One worker explains that they don't really have time to investigate when processing reports: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG9y_-4kGQA and they have to act very fast, and by default, it is safer to remove from family.The boss of such agency doesn't even take the time to answer to the journalists there...-> Example of such case (this man is innocent): https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/var-un-homme-se-mobilis...but I can't blame them either, it's not easy to make the right calls.

If you call 119 it gets assessed and potentially forwarded to the right department, which then assesses it again and might (quite likely will) trigger an inspection. The people who turn up have broad powers to seize children from the home in order to protect them from abuse.In general this works fine. If this person is bad at their job for whatever reason (incompetence/malice) it can cause a lot of problems. It is very hard to prove a person like this wrong when they are covering their arse after making a mistake.afaik similar systems are present in most western countries, and many of them - like France - are suffering with funding and are likely cutting in the wrong place (audit/rigour) to meet external KPIs. One of the worst ways this manifests is creating 'quick scoring' methods which can end up with misunderstandings (e.g. said a thing they didn't mean) ranking very highly, but subtle evidence of abuse moderate to low.So while this is a concern, this is not unique to France, this is relatively normal, and the poster is massively exaggerating the simplicity.

As a result they remove the child from his father, in direct contrast to the courts decision, and put the child through 6 years of isolation and abuse with no access to school. It took investigative journalists a while, but the result of the case getting highlighted in media was that the inspector and supervisor is now fired, with two additoal workers being under investigation for severe misconduct. Four more workers would be under investigation but too long time has passed. Don't live in Sweden if you have kids, I guess! The reason I mentioned that this occurred right after metoo is that the cultural environment in Sweden was a bit unstable. It was a very political time and everyone wanted to be perceived as being on the right side of history.The case has been debate in Swedish parliament but the reaction has been to not really talk about it.

This job will go to an "AI" any moment now./i "today it's my husband to take care of him because sometimes my baby makes me angry that I want to kill him" but she was saying it normally, like any normal person does when they are angry.-> Whoops, someone talked with 119 to refer a "worrying" situation, baby removed. -> Whoops, someone talked with 119 to refer a "worrying" situation, baby removed. There are some non-profit fighting against such: https://lenfanceaucoeur.org/quest-ce-que-le-placement-abusif...That being said, it's a very small % obviously not let's not exaggerate but it's quite sneaky. I'm sure they have much better and quieter ways to do that.Whereas a raid is #1 choice for max volume... Whereas a raid is #1 choice for max volume... I suppose that would pressure you to become an informant instead of taking a longer prison sentence, but there's pressure to do that anyway, like not wanting to be in prison for a long time. Guess what, similar things would be legal in France.lawfare is... good now? Between Trump being hit with felony charges for falsifying business records (lawfare is good?) and Lisa Cook getting prosecuted for mortgage fraud (lawfare is bad? That they're going to shoot his plane down? If there's no threat of violence, what does the French government even hope to achieve with this?

That's not a credible threat because there's approximately 0% chance France would actually follow through with it. France murdering someone would put them on par with Russia or India. If captain of the plane disobeyed direct threat like that from a nation, his career is going to be limited. Yeah Elon might throw money at him but that guy is most likely never allowed again to fly near any French territory. I guess whole cabin crew as well .Being clear for flying anywhere in the world is their job.Would be quite stupid to loose it like truck driver DUI getting his license revoked.

Why do they need to threaten shooting down his jet for that? "haha got you good with that jet lmao")? Why do they need to threaten shooting down his jet for that?

It seems Al Capone being taken down for tax fraud would similarly be lawfare by these standards, or am I missing something? Also, they are restricted in how they use it, and defendents have rights and due process.> Sabu was put under pressure by the FBI, they threatened to place his kids into foster care.Though things like that can happen, which are very serious. > Sabu was put under pressure by the FBI, they threatened to place his kids into foster care.Though things like that can happen, which are very serious.

If a state wants to make your life incredibly difficult for months or even years they can, the competent ones can even do it while staying (mostly) on the right side of the law. People are putting a lot of weight on the midterm elections which are more or less the last line of defense besides a so far tepid response by the courts and even then consequence free defiance of court orders is now rampant.We're really near the point of no return and a lot of people don't seem to notice. A lot of people are cheering it (some on this very site). As we're seeing with the current US President... the government doesn't (have to) care.In any case, CSAM is the one thing other than Islamist terrorism that will bypass a lot of restrictions on how police are supposed to operate (see e.g. Encrochat, An0m) across virtually all civilized nations. Western nations also will take anything that remotely smells like Russia as a justification.

It just shows that checks and balances are not properly implemented there, just previous presidents weren't exploiting it maliciously for their own gains. That due process only exists to the extent the branches of govt are independent, have co-equal power, and can hold and act upon different views of the situation.When all branches of govt are corrupted or corrupted to serve the executive, as in autocracies, that due process exists only if the executive likes you, or accepts your bribes. That is why there is such a huge push by right-wing parties to take over the levers of power, so they can keep their power even after they would lose at the ballot box.

It is not uncommon for minority families to lose rights to parent their children for very innocuous things that would not happen to a non-oppressed class.It is just another way for the justice/legal system to pressure families that have not been convicted / penalized under the supervision of a court.And this isn't the only lever they use.Every time I read crap like this I just think of Aaron Swartz.

Russia limits presidents to two 6-year terms, yet Putin is in power since 2000. Only then he became President, which would make the end of his second term 2024. So the current one would be his third term (by the magic of changing the constitution and legal quibbles which effectively allow a president to stay in charge for four almost whole terms, AFAIU).

Trump has a track record of chickening out when others show strength. And it can independently exert effort in a way other European countries can't. Musk losing Paris means swearing off a meaningful economic and political bloc. At this point a nuclear power like France has no issue with using covert violence to produce compliance from Musk and he must know it.These people have proven themselves to be existential threats to French security and France will do whatever they feel is necessary to neutralize that threat.Musk is free to ignore French rule of law if he wants to risk being involved in an airplane accident that will have rumours and conspiracies swirling around it long after he's dead and his body is strewn all over the ocean somewhere.

Seriously, every powerful state engages in state terrorism from time to time because they can, and the embarrassment of discovery is weighed against the benefit of eliminating a problem. It's just that the West has avoided to do that to each other because they were all essentially allied until recently and because the political implications were deemed too severe.I don't think however France has anything to win by doing it or has any interest whatsoever and I doubt there's a legal framework the French government can or want to exploit to conduct something like that legally (like calling something an emergency situation or a terrorist group, for example).

Trump is ignoring all the international agreements and rules, so why should others follow them? The second Donald Trump threatened to invade a nation allied with France is the second anyone who works with Trump became a legitimate military target.Like a cruel child dismembering a spider one limb at a time France and other nations around the world will meticulously destroy whatever resources people like Musk have and the influence it gives him over their countries.If Musk displays a sufficient level of resistance to these actions the French will simply assassinate him.

PS Yes, Greenpeace is a bunch of scientifically-illiterate fools who have caused far more damage than they prevented. Doesn't matter because what France did was still clearly against the law. Every major firm should have a "dawn raid" policy to comply while preserving rights.Specific to the Uber case(s), if it were illegal, then why didn't Uber get criminal charges or fines?At best there's an argument that it was "obstructing justice," but logging people off, encrypting, and deleting local copies isn't necessarily illegal.

Prosecution became hard to continue once he got involved. Prosecutors even drop winnable cases because they don't want to lose. Put this up there with nonsensical phrases like "violent agreement. I don't see aggressive compliance defined anywhere. They will explain that it was done remotely and whatnot but then the company will be closed in the country. Whether this matters for the mothership is another story. This was a common action during the Russian invasion of Ukraine for companies that supported Ukraine and closed their operations in Russia. Obviously, the government can just threaten to fine you any amount, close operations or whatever, but your company can just decide to stop operating there, like Google after Russia imposed an absurd fine. As France discovered the hard way in WW2, you can put all sorts of rock-solid security around the front door only to be surprised when your opponent comes in by window. This would be done in parallel for key sources.There is a lot of information on physical devices that is helpful, though.

I don't love heavy-handed enforcement on speech issues, but I do really like a heterogenous cultural situation, so I think it's interesting and probably to the overall good to have a country pushing on these matters very hard, just as a matter of keeping a diverse set of global standards, something that adds cultural resilience for humanity.linkedin is not a replacement for twitter, though. linkedin is not a replacement for twitter, though. Censorship increases homogeneity, because it reduces the amount of ideas and opinions that are allowed to be expressed. Humanity itself is trending more toward monoculture socially; I like a lot of things (and hate some) about the cultural trend. But what I like isn't very important, because I might be totally wrong in my likes; if only my likes dominated, the world would be a much less resilient place -- vulnerable to the weaknesses of whatever it is I like.So, again, I propose for the race as a whole, broad cultural diversity is really critical, and worth protecting. Even if we really hate some of the forms it takes. So, again, I propose for the race as a whole, broad cultural diversity is really critical, and worth protecting.

Otherwise, anyone can justify that cutting the head of their neighbour with a katana while dancing is part of an artistic performance, and absolute free speech is only possible if all artistic expression is given complete license. Those who pretend otherwise will have no ground to defend themselves on legal basis from being wiped out of existence by the very same logic. Libel must be as assertion that is not true. Photoshopping or AIing someone isn't an assertion of something untrue. It's more the equivalent of saying "What if this is true?" (a) in words legibly marked on any substance; or It doesn't have to be an assertion, or even a written statement.

If by raiding an office in France a bunch of US military secrets are found, it would suggest the company is not fit to have those kind of contracts. I mean, perhaps it's time to completely drop these US-owned, closed-source, algo-driven controversial platforms, and start treating the communication with the public that funds your existence in different terms. ... thereby driving up adoption far better than Twitter itself could. Big tech companies are breaking the laws left and right. There is currently a sort of identity crisis in the regulation. Big tech companies are breaking the laws left and right. I suppose the answer, if we're serious about it, is somewhat more nuanced.To begin, public administrations should not get to unilaterally define "the public interest" in their communication, nor should private platforms for that matter. Assuming we're still talking about a democracy, the decision-making should be democratically via a combination of law + rights + accountable institutions + public scrutiny, with implementation constraints that maximise reach, accessibility, auditability, and independence from private gatekeepers. Happy to get into further detail regarding the actual processes involved, if you're genuinely interested.That aside - there are two separate problems that often get conflated when we talk about these platforms:- one is reach: people are on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, so publishing there increases distribution; public institutions should be interested in reaching as many citizens as possible with their comms;- the other one is dependency: if those become the primary or exclusive channels, the state's relationship with citizens becomes contingent on private moderation, ranking algorithms, account lockouts, paywalls, data extraction, and opaque rule changes. That is entirely and dangerously misaligned with democratic accountability.A potential middle position could be ti use commercial social platforms as secondary distribution instead of the authoritative channel, which in reality is often the case. Which is why some argue that they should be treated as public utilities since dominant communications infrastructure has quasi-public function (rest assured, I won't open that can of worms right now).Politics is messy in practice, as all balancing acts are - a normal price to pay for any democratic society, I'd say. We've already done a lot to balance these, for sure, but we're not there yet and it's a dynamic, developing field that presents new challenges.

Mass media reports on anything widely relevant, niche media reports on things nichely relevant, and there's direct communication with anyone directly affected (recipient of a radio frequency allocation) so nobody really subscribes to the official government newspaper, but it's there and if there was a breakdown of communication systems that would be the last resort to ensure you are getting government updates.

New productions can also be created by reproducing or manipulating already existing depictions, for example, by editing film sequences together in a different order or by splicing an image of a child's head onto an image of another child's body." https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2011/93/oj/engLet me quote again: Pay attention to c.iv specifically:(c) ‘child pornography' means:(i) any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct;(ii) any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes;(iii) any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or(iv) realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes; Let me quote again: Pay attention to c.iv specifically:(c) ‘child pornography' means:(i) any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct;(ii) any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes;(iii) any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or(iv) realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes; (c) ‘child pornography' means:(i) any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct;(ii) any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes;(iii) any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or(iv) realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes; (i) any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct;(ii) any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes;(iii) any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or(iv) realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes; (ii) any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes;(iii) any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or(iv) realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes; (iii) any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or(iv) realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes; realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, for primarily sexual purposes;covers the example in question:If you take a picture of a 14 year old girl (age of consent is 15) and use Grok to give her bikini, or make her topless, then you are most definately producing and possessing CSAM.How about you? covers the example in question:If you take a picture of a 14 year old girl (age of consent is 15) and use Grok to give her bikini, or make her topless, then you are most definately producing and possessing CSAM.How about you?

Musk's social media platform has recently been subject to intense scrutiny over sexualised images generated and edited on the site using its AI tool Grok. Here you have a model that is actually creating the CSAM.It seems more similar to a robot that is told to go kill someone and does so. if the knife was designed to evade detection, then yes. Like how I see this is:* If you can't restrict people from making kiddie porn with Grok, then it stands to reason at the very least, access to Grok needs to be strictly controlled. It can't be completely omitted from this conversation that Grok is, pretty famously, the "unrestrained" AI, which in most respects means it swears more, quotes and uses highly dubious sources of information that are friendly to Musk's personal politics, and occasionally spouts white nationalist rhetoric. So as part of their quest to "unwoke" Grok did they also make it able to generate this shit too?

Meanwhile what I commonly see is people dunking on anything Musk-related because they dislike him, but give a free pass on similar things if it's not related to him. Additionally, the system should have a way to tell if someone is attempting to bypass their safety measures and act accordingly. "The point is to show just how aware X were of the issue, and that they chose to repeatedly do nothing against Grok being used to create CSAM and probably other problematic and illegal imagery.I can't really doubt they'll find plenty of evidence during discovery, it doesn't have to be physical things.

If every AI system can do this, and every AI system in incapable of preventing it, then I guess every AI system should be banned until they can figure it out.Every banking app on the planet "is capable" of letting a complete stranger go into your account and transfer all your money to their account.

On a related note given AI is just a tool and requires someone to tell it to make CSAM I think they will have to prove intent possibly by grabbing chat logs, emails and other internal communications but I know very little about French law or international law. I think your interpretation would be more along the line of making 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 and The Handmaid's Tale a reality. I will have to check that out, it sounds interesting. It was also pretty obvious how all the social media companies pushed the same narrative through COVID.I don't like how these social networks and the media try to manipulate things but I don't think giving the government even more power will fix anything. I think even if you had those laws on the books, you would still get manipulation through selective enforcement.I think the only solution is education and individuals saying no to these platforms' and their algorithmic feeds.

It expanded after Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust, a crime in France, and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said. and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group. Looking at the prompts below some of those image shows that even now, there's almost zero effort at Grok to filter prompts that are blatantly looking to create problematic material. The French raid statement makes no mention of CSAM. To me too.> CSAM is a woker word for child porn.Indeed some people would like it diluted thus. But it generally remains (an initialism not word) for something quite distinct - about abuse rather than just porn. > CSAM is a woker word for child porn.Indeed some people would like it diluted thus.

I was under the impression we were allies since like the 1800s or so despite some little tiffs now and again. The closest I can think of is GDPR which has its great aspects and also the cookies law (which is incorrectly interpreted). And some things like private IPs being PIIs which promotes nonsnsical "authorities notifications" that are not used afterwards.We have consulting companies doing yearly audits on companies to close the books. But whatever zombie government France is running can't "ban" X anyway because it would get them one step closer to the guillotine. If "French prosecutor" want to find a child abuse case they can check the Macron couple Wikipedia pages. By itself this isn't extraordinary in a democracy. I cross-checked Wikipedia's information with another source: https://www.connexionfrance.com/news/french-election-is-it-c... I don't think the Wikipedia characterization is far off a pretty commonly held sentiment. You are of course, able to disagree and consider them far-left, center, or whatever label you want.You stated earlier that because Wikipedia called mild immigration reform far-right (which it did not to my reading, so you pointed to National Rally as an example) words don't mean anything. But words do mean things by consensus, and from my reading the consensus is that National Rally is far-right.Of course, many far-right (and far-left) thinkers consider themselves centrists or mild, so there will be disagreement.

But there's also an obvious semantic fail when 34% of the electorate is "far right". It implies that "far" is just meaningless cant. Elections aren't won by 50%, you only need to convince 4 or 5% of the population that the far right is great. There is a reason Musk paid so much for Twitter. If this stuff had no effect he wouldn't have bought it. There either needs to be accountability for platforms or a ban on behavior driven content feeds.People lying on the internet is fine. Social media algorithms amplifying the lie because it has high engagement is destroying our society.

Comprehensive evidence and analysis is a search or chat bot away. Near right to me is advocating for things like lower taxes or different regulations or a secure border (but without the deportation of millions who are already in the country and abiding by laws). * Crypto currency rug pulls (World Liberty Financial) * Donations linked with pardons (Binance) * Pardoning failed rebels of a coup that favored him (Capitol rioters) * Bringing baseless charges against political enemies and journalists (Comey, Letitia James, Don Lemon) * Musk (DOGE) killing government regulatory agencies that had investigations and cases against his companies This is with two minutes of thought while waiting for a compile. It helps you see the actually interesting point being made. My point still stands, "politics change and assessments of politicians change accordingly".Bill Clinton's crime bill would be considered far right today.Ronald Regean's amnesty bill would be considered far left today. Ronald Regean's amnesty bill would be considered far left today. Ask anyone who was politically active (as a leftist) in the 90s. I'm not sure what was the equivalent of the Democratic Socialists of America (center-left) at that time, but i'm sure there was an equivalent and Bill Clinton was much more right-wing. That's without mentioning actual left-wing parties (like communists, anarchists, black panthers etc). He raised taxes, lowered military spending, and pursued universal healthcare. Those are not, and have never been, right-wing stances in the US. For example, universal health-care is only left-wing if it's a public service. Taking money out of the State's pockets to finance private healthcare and pharmaceutical for-profit corporations is very much a definition of right-wing policy. Lowering military spending by aggressively shrinking active duty troop levels and eliminating weapons programs is certainly left-wing. I don't think many self-described "right-leaning" people would have called Clinton "right wing" in the 90s.I 100% see your point and agree with you that he had major policies that I would call right wing today. I 100% see your point and agree with you that he had major policies that I would call right wing today. As much as it pains me to say this, because i myself consider de Gaulle to be a fascist in many regards, that's far from a majority opinion (disclaimer: i'm an anarchist).I think de Gaulle was a classic right-wing authoritarian ruler. He had to take some social measures (which some may view as left-wing) because the workers at the end of WWII were very organized and had dozens of thousands of rifles, so such was the price of social peace.He was right-wing because he was rather conservative, for private property/entrepreneurship and strongly anti-communist. Still, he had strong national planning for the economy, much State support for private industry (Elf, Areva, etc) and strong policing on the streets (see also, Service d'Action Civique for de Gaulle's fascist militias with long ties with historical nazism and secret services).That being said, de Gaulle to my knowledge was not really known for racist fear-mongering or hate speech. That's in comparison with far-right people who already at the time, and still today, build an image of the ENEMY towards whom all hate and violence is necessary. See also Umberto Eco's Ur-fascism for characteristics of fascist regimes.In that sense, and it really pains me to write this, but de Gaulle was much less far-right than today's Parti Socialiste, pretending to be left wing despite ruling with right-wing anti-social measures and inciting hatred towards french muslims and binationals.

I think that, for most Western people today, far-right == bad to non-white people, independent of intention (as you demonstrated with your remark about the PS), so de Gaulle's approach to Algeria, whether he's loud about it or not, would qualify him as far-right already.All this to say, the debate is based on differing definitions of far-right (for example you conflate fascism and far-right and use Eco, while GP and I seem to think it's about extremely  authoritarian + capitalist), and has started from an ignorant comment by an idiot who considers Bush (someone who is responsible for the death of around a million Iraqis, the creation of actual torture camps, large-scale surveillance, etc.) not far-right because, I assume, he didn't say anything mean about African-Americans.

But then again people on this very forum will argue Sanders is a literal communist so we circle back to the sub 70iq problem The "free-speechism" of the past you mention was about speaking truth to power, and this movement still exists on the left today, see for example support for Julian Assange, arrested journalists in France or Turkey, or outright murdered in Palestine.When Elon Musk took over Twitter and promised free speech, he very soon actually banned accounts he disagreed with, especially leftists. Why free speech may be more and more perceived as right wing is because despite having outright criminal speech with criminal consequences (such as inciting violence against harmless individuals such as Mark Bray), billionaires have weaponized propaganda on a scale never seen before with their ownership of all the major media outlets and social media platforms, arguing it's a matter of free speech.

I think we can and should all agree that child sexual abuse is a much larger and more serious problem than political leanings.It's ironic as you're commenting about a social media platform, but I think it's frightening what social media has done to us with misinformation, vilification, and echo chambers, to think political leanings are worse than murder, rape, or child sexual abuse.

However - it has one big problem that is rarely discussed... Normalizing of behaviour, interests and attitudes. It just becomes a thing that Grok can do - for paid accounts, and people think - ok, "no harm, no problem"... That's why all media depicting violence should be banned./s If xAI can't bring in guardrails or limit who can access these capabilities, then they deserve what's coming to them. Arguably morally reprehensible but it has not always been illegal (and still isn't in many places) if you're talking about images of adults. This comment chain isn't about a difference of opinion, but a difference in morality - there's no debating possible about morals I think. Go ask Pamela Anderson or Paris Hilton about that one. There are rules about material created without consent, but people do not retain a perpetual right to have formerly consentual material taken down. She claimes, later, to have not consented but given the sophistication of the production no reasonable person could believe she had no idea it was being filmed. She might not consent to the exact public release but she was certainly well aware of being filmed on the day. They did not consent to public release, but did consent to creation and private distribution, sometimes even taking and initially sharing the photos themselves.

It sounds like they are following due process. Did you ever expect the government to go after Adobe for "enabling" this? But police don't care about moral equivalence. For the legal details we would need to consult French law. But I assume it is illegal to create and distribute the images. Heck, it's also probably against Twitter's TOS too so by all rights the grok account should be banned.> This is a political action by the FrenchMaybe.

If a student printed the pictures out and distributed them at school you'd have maybe 1000 violations. Twitter likely has hundreds of millions if not billions. So it makes sense to go after the most severe violator. Any crime that doesn't cause victims is just another way for an oppressive collectivist state to further control their citizens. If you are not harming anyone (like when creating but not sharing these pictures) then it simply shouldn't be a crime. Have we a outsourced all accountability for the crimes of humans to AI now? But I also don't think that Grok should be able to quickly and easily generate fake revenge porn for minors. You can't just “undo” some girl being harassed by AI generated nude photos of her, so we…Yes, we should have some protections or restrictions on what you can do.You may not understand it, either because you aren't a parent or maybe just not emotionally equipped to understand how serious this actually can be, but your lack of comprehension does not render it a non-issue.Having schools play whack-a-mole after the photos are shared around is not a valid strategy. Never mind that schools primarily engage in teaching, not in investigation.As AI-generated content gets less and less distinguishable from reality, these incidents will have far worse consequences and putting such power in the hands of adolescents who demonstrably don't have sound judgment (hence why they lack many other rights that adults have) is not something most parents are comfortable with - and I doubt you'll find many teachers, psychiatrists and so on who would support your approach either.

No, but if you send those people who made  and distributed the AI nude of her to jail, these problems will virtually disappear overnight, because going to jail is a hugely effective deterrent for most people.But if you don't directly prosecute the people doing it, and instead just ban Grok AI, then those people will just use other AI tools, outside of US jurisdiction, to do the same things and the problem persists.And the issues keeps persisting, because nobody ever goes to jail.

And the issues keeps persisting, because nobody ever goes to jail. Obviously Grok shouldn't be legally allowed to generate fakes nudes of actual kids, but in case such safeguards can and will be bypassed, that doesn't absolve the humans from being the ones knowingly breaking the law to achieve a nefarious goal. Youths lack judgment, so they can't vote, drink, drive, have sex or consent to adults.A 14-year-old can't be relied to understand the consequences of making nudes of some girl.Beyond that, we regulate guns, speed limits and more according to principles like “your right to swing your fist ends at my nose”.We do that not only because shoving kids into jails is something we want to avoid, but because regulating at the source of the problem is both more feasible AND heads off a lot of tragedy.And again, you fail to acknowledge the investigative burden you put on society to discover who originated the photo after the fact, and the trauma to the victim.If none of that computes for you, then I don't know what to say except I don't place the right to generate saucy images highly enough to swarm my already overworked police with requests to investigate who generated fake underage porn.

They go to juvy or their parents get punished. Being 14 is not a get out of jail free card. The problem stems from parents lack of parenting, a huge lack of real after-school programs, and the tiktokification of modern society.30 years ago, we had a lot of the same "slap on the wrist" punishments because it was assumed when you got home your parent was going to beat your ass. That isn't a thing anymore (rightfully), because parenting through threat of violence just leads to those kids becoming violent parents.Our problem is we never transitioned from violent parenting into any other kind. COVID created a society of chronically online children who don't know how to interact offline.And yes, the tools to create bad shit are more accessible than ever, and I always come off as some angry gate keeper, but so much of the internet as it is today has become too easy to access by people incapable of the critical thinking required for safe use.In the last 5 years, generative AI has taken over most of the "public facing" internet, and with internet literacy at the same level it was 20-30 years ago, we are back in the "walled garden" AOL era, but it is Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok that are the gardens. 30 years ago, we had a lot of the same "slap on the wrist" punishments because it was assumed when you got home your parent was going to beat your ass.

I'm similarly repulsed by the idea of Grok generating images of kids, but if you draw a nude of an adult woman she's not going to get raped by that existing, and you don't have a right to not be embarrassed. In good faith, a few things - AI generated imagery and Photoshop are not the same. You keep using AI, without taking a moment to give the “intelligence” any thought.Yes, powerful people are always going to get by, as you say. But that doesn't change anything here - this is a separate conversation.If not Grok then someone else will do it - is a defeatist argument that can only mean it can't be controlled so don't bother. This point is where you come across as a CSAM defender. Govt's will/should do whatever they can to make society safe, even if it means playing whack a mole. Judicial system is about fairness and not efficiency.frankly, I think you understand all of this and maybe got tunnel visioned in your anger at the unfairness of people scapegoating technology for its failings.

Actually you'll see the opposite happen a lot - after Columbine, the number of school shootings went up [0] for example, because before people didn't consider it an option. Same with serial killers / copycats, and a bunch of other stuff.Likewise, if it hadn't been in the news, a lot of people wouldn't have known you can / could create nudes of real people with Grok. News reporting on these things is its own kind of unfortunate marketing, and for every X people that are outraged about this, there will be some that are instead inspired and interested.While a lot of punishments for crimes is indeed a deterrent, it doesn't always work. Also because in this case, it's relatively easy to avoid being found out (unlike school shootings).

That's how you fix all issues in society and enforce law abiding behavior. You make the cost of the crime greater than the gains from it, then crucify some people in public to set an example for everyone else.Do people like doing and paying their taxes?

Nobody commits crimes with the expectation that they'll get caught, and if you only "crucify some people", then most criminals are going to (rightfully) assume that they'll be one of the lucky ones. I genuinely cannot tell if you are being comically naïve or extremely obtuse here. You need only look at the world around you to see that this does not, and never will, happen.As another commenter said, this argument is presenting itself as apologia for CSAM and you come across as a defender of the right for a business to create and publish it. I assume you don't actually believe that, but the points you made are compatible.It is as much the responsibility of a platform for providing the services to create illegal material, and also distributing said illegal material. That it happens to be an AI that generates the imagery is not relevant - X and Grok are still the two services responsible for producing and hosting it.

I don't accept this as good faith argumentation nor does HN rules. Do you keep trying to whack-a-mole the AI tools for this, or the humans actually making and distributing fake nudes of real people? If Musk chooses not to implement them, that's his personal irresponsibility. You just cannot allow this content to be generated and distributed in the public domain by anonymous users. It has nothing to do with free speech but with civility and common understanding of what is morally wrong / right.Obviously you cannot prevent this in private forums unless it is made illegal which is a completely different problem that requires a very different solution.

Using Grok as the tool.If kids were to "git gud" at photoshop and use that to make nudes, would you arrest Adobe?

So then where do we draw the line between lethal weapons and crime correlation.

Where do we draw the line on which tools are responsible for that instead of the humans using them for it? The knife (as opposed to sword) example is interesting. We recognise that there is individual responsibility at play, and children might not be responsible enough to buy them, given the possible harms. Does this totally solve their use in violent crime? But if your alternative is “it's up to the individuals to be responsible”, well, that clearly doesn't work, because some people are not responsible. At a certain point, if your job is to reduce harm in the population, you look for where you can have a greater impact than just hoping every individual follows the law, because they clearly don't.

Anyone skilled at photoshop can do fake nudes as good or even better than AI, including kids (we used it to make fun fakes of teachers in embarrassing situations back in the mid 00s and distribute them via MSN messenger), so then why is only the AI tool the one to blame for what the users do, but not Photoshop if both tools can be used to do the same thing?People can now 3D print guns at home, or at least parts that when assembled can make a functioning firearm.

Edit for the addition of the line about bullying: "Bullying has always happened, therefore we should allow new forms of even worse bullying to flourish freely, even though I readily acknowledge that it can lead to victims committing suicide" is a bizarre and self-contradictory take.

Now it turns out Musk repeatedly sought to visit, including wanting to know when the "wildest" party was happening, after Epstein was already known as a child sex abuser. Musk claimed that Epstein had never been given a tour of SpaceX but it turns out he did in 2013. Will be interesting to see what happens as more is revealed. No i said no such thing, what I said was that the resources of authorities is a finite pie. If most of it goes towards petty stuff like corporate misbehavior that hurts nobody, there won't be enough for the grave crimes like actual child abuser that actually hurt real people.Same how police won't bother with your stolen phone/bike because they have bigger crimes to catch.

Sure but where's the proof that Grok is  actually producing illegal content? I searched for news sources, but they're just all parroting empty accusations not concrete documented cases. Note that IWF is not a random charity it works with the Police on these matters.I found this as the first item in Kagi search - perhaps you should try non AI searches I found this as the first item in Kagi search - perhaps you should try non AI searches In the UK it is illegal to create, distribute and store CSAM. A news site printing a photo CSAM would make them legally up the shitter.However, the IWF, who are tasked with detecting this stuff have claimed to have found evidence of it, along with multiple other sources, Ofcom who are nominally supposed to police this have an open investigation, so do the irish police.The point is, law has a higher threshold of proof than news, which takes time. If there is enough evidence, then a court case (or other instrument) will be invoked.

Also, framing the issue of sexual abuse by untouchable issue as the same as superhero comic issue (which itself was not just about superhero comic and you should know it) is spectacularly bad faith.Yes, there were always people who were stealing, abusing, murdering for own gain and fun. That is not an argument for why we should accept and support it as normalized state of world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Department of Health and Human Services is developing a generative artificial intelligence tool to find patterns across data reported to a national vaccine monitoring database and to generate hypotheses on the negative effects of vaccines, according to an inventory released last week of all use cases the agency had for AI in 2025. But experts worry that the predictions it generates could be used by Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to further his anti-vaccine agenda. A long-standing vaccine critic, Kenedy has upended the childhood vaccination schedule in his year in office, removing several shots from a list of recommended immunizations for all children, including those for Covid-19, influenza, hepatitis A and B, meningococcal disease, rotavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Because these claims are not verified, VAERS data alone can't be used to determine if a vaccine caused an adverse event. “VAERS, at best, was always a hypothesis-generating mechanism,” says Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who was previously a member of the CDC's Advisory Council on Immunization Practices. Offit says the system only shows adverse events that happened at some point following immunization; it doesn't prove that a vaccine caused those reactions. Despite this, anti-vaccine activists have misused VAERS data over the years to argue that vaccines are not safe. Leslie Lenert, previously the founding director of the CDC's National Center for Public Health Informatics, says government scientists have been using traditional natural language processing AI models to look for patterns in VAERS data for several years, so it's not surprising that HHS would move toward the adoption of more advanced large language models. One major limitation of VAERS is that it doesn't include data on how many people received a vaccine, which can make events logged in the database seem more common than they actually are. For that reason, Lenert says it's important to pair information from VAERS with other data sources to determine the true risk of an event. LLMs are also famously good at producing convincing hallucinations, underscoring the need for humans to follow up on any hypotheses generated by an LLM. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, reportedly proposed stricter vaccine regulation in a recent memo sent to staff in which he blamed the deaths of at least 10 children on the Covid-19 vaccine without citing evidence. The deaths were reported to VAERS and had previously been reviewed by FDA staff. More than a dozen former FDA commissioners responded with a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine, expressing concern about Prasad's proposed guidelines. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at Georgetown University, says that the use of LLMs could potentially detect previously unknown safety issues with vaccines. But since VAERS can contain inaccurate and incomplete data, he says it's important that any leads are thoroughly investigated first. “I would expect, depending on the approaches used, a lot of false alerts and a need for a lot of skilled human follow-through by people who understand vaccines and possible adverse events, as well as statistics, epidemiology, and challenges with LLM output,” he says. With deep staffing cuts at the CDC, Goodman says it would be important to have plans and capacity in place to deal with any emerging data, including screening it and deciding what may need to be studied further and how. In the past, VAERS has flagged legitimate safety issues, including instances of a rare clotting disorder among some people who received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine and rare cases of myocarditis, particularly among younger males, who got the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.
