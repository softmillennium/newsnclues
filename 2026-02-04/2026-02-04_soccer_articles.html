                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the World Cup just five months away, GOAL takes a look at how El Tri's squad could shape up next summer. Just one FIFA window - and only a handful of matches - separate El Tri from their World Cup opener on June 11 against South Africa at the Estadio Azteca, a venue set to become the first stadium to host three men's World Cups. Before that moment arrives, however, Javier Aguirre still has major decisions to make. Mexico's 2026 buildup has been more crowded than most, with a packed slate of friendlies designed to sharpen form and expand the player pool. Despite Aguirre insisting that roughly 80 percent of his final 26-man squad is already decided, questions persist with every passing match - questions compounded by a growing injury list that includes several projected starters. With the 100-day mark approaching, Mexico's margin for error is shrinking. GOAL takes a look at where El Tri stand as of now. GOAL's picks: Raúl Rangel, Luis Ángel Malagón, Guillermo OchoaIn the mix: Carlos Acevedo Aguirre has already said that goalkeeper is the position where he has the fewest doubts, and since returning to the El Tri bench for his third stint, Luis Ángel Malagón and Raúl Rangel have both stood out whenever called upon. That would indicate he is likely to make the final squad and compete in a record-breaking sixth World Cup, alongside Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Still, the fact that he does not play for a major club like América or Chivas is seen by some as a factor that hurts his chances of breaking into the Mexican national team. GOAL's picks: Johan Vásquez, César Montes, Mateo Chávez, Jesús Gallardo, Israel Reyes, Jorge Sánchez, Ramón Juárez, Richard Ledezma In the mix: Julián Araujo, Rodrigo Huescas, Jesús Orozco, Everardo López Johan Vásquez and César Montes are locked in at center back. But the right-back position remains a complete unknown, mainly due to Rodrigo Huescas' injury, the inconsistency shown by Jorge Sánchez and Kevin Álvarez, and Julián Araujo's lack of playing time in Europe before his move to Celtic in Scotland. Because of all that, Chivas player Richard Ledezma has entered the race. Jesús Orozco suffered a fracture last tournament with Cruz Azul, which puts his availability in serious doubt. Ledezma, born in the U.S., only recently became eligible to play for Mexico and made a strong impression, and when factoring in his solid performances with Chivas, he finds himself in a good position to sneak into the final list. GOAL's picks: Edson Álvarez, Gilberto Mora, Marcel Ruiz, Erik Lira, Luis Romo, Orbelín Pineda, Álvaro Fidalgo, Roberto Alvarado, Obed Vargas, Diego Lainez That is true despite a difficult spell in Europe with Fenerbahçe -who will not make his move permanent - and an ankle injury that will sideline him for several weeks. However, his lack of minutes and El Tri's struggles in midfield when he plays could - though still unlikely - raise questions about his status as a guaranteed starter. His best role may be at center back, where Mexico avoid the loss of pace seen when he plays in midfield. It remains unclear what shape Aguirre will choose for the opening match, although he typically sets his teams up in a 4-3-3. Real Betis midfielder Álvaro Fidalgo will be eligible to represent Mexico for the matches against Portugal and Belgium, giving him a strong chance - if he makes the final 26-man squad - to claim a starting role, as he is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in Liga MX. Once recovered, whether Huerta can rediscover his form with Anderlecht will determine if Aguirre decides to factor him in. One regular starter who is likely to miss out is Luis Chávez of Dynamo Moscow, as he continues to recover from an ACL injury and is unlikely to be ready in time for the World Cup - although nothing has been definitively decided yet. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting GOAL's picks: Raúl Jiménez, Santiago Giménez, Alexis Vega, Julián Quiñones, Germán Berterame Aguirre continues to stick with trusted veteran Raúl Jiménez, who will be the undisputed starting striker, followed by Santiago Giménez. Giménez has been dealing with an ankle injury that has kept him sidelined for several months, and while his return date remains unclear, the AC Milan forward will not lose his place - unlike what happened in 2022, when Gerardo Martino left him out of the squad for Qatar. Alexis Vega is also recovering from a knee injury and was recently operated on. Germán Berterame has been consistent, and his move to Inter Miami will bring him greater media exposure. He has also delivered when called up by Aguirre, scoring goals in recent appearances. Unless Lozano changes teams soon, time may be running out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Ireland overcome the Czechs at the Fortuna Arena, they will face the winners of Denmark versus North Macedonia at a sold out Aviva Stadium on March 31st to secure a place at this summer's tournament in North America. “Ireland will come with a big heart,” said Koubek on Wednesday. “And if the opponent allows them too much, they are very strong. “From my point of view, they are an average team in terms of play, but with an immense heart, and extremely solid and determined. In addition, there is cohesion and they work as a team.” When a Czech journalist was asked to translate what Koubeck meant by “island football”, he said: “It is more commonly associated with England and Scotland. It means a simple game, crosses into the penalty area for players to head. No great technique, but speed, efficiency, and fighting spirit.” Koubeck is expected to recall former captain Vladimír Darida, five years after his last cap against Denmark at Euro 2021, as the 35-year-old midfielder is having a strong season for FC Hradec Králové in the Czech league. He fits into our system with his style and creativity.” Darida could sit in midfield alongside West Ham's Tomáš Souček, who is expected to feature against Ireland despite being stripped of the captaincy following a dispute with fans after the last World Cup qualifier against Gibraltar in November. “You can always count on Tomáš, he's a Premier League player and a big personality,” said Koubek, “Nothing has changed in terms of his importance. And I want the other half not to be afraid of me. The successful applicants will be contacted by Friday, February 13th. Following an enormous demand for tickets from Irish fans, the Czech FA decided to update its distribution strategy, with tickets only accessible through a loyalty programme and with Czech identification.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USMNT manager said players should stay out of conversations that don't deal with soccer Last week, Mauricio Pochettino began a World Cup year with an unforced error. At the tail-end of a virtual press conference that covered a wide range of ongoing USMNT business, the 53-year-old Argentine – who has made himself commendably available to the American soccer press – was asked about recent comments by Tim Weah. “I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices,” Weah said. Pochettino plainly did not appreciate Weah wading into the affordability discourse that has become one of the dominant topics of this World Cup – along with, you know, all the rest of it. “I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside,” Pochettino said. The antediluvian stick-to-sports take rankled, in no small part because Weah wasn't talking about politics. He was a soccer player commenting on an extremely soccer-related matter. Why shouldn't he have an opinion on it? Pochettino then lent full-throated support to Fifa, a divisive governing body that has strayed far from its own statutory political neutrality in openly backing Donald Trump. “I think if Fifa does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why,” he said. On one hand: Pochettino was speaking from Fifa's World Cup headquarters in Coral Gables, Florida; what else was he supposed to say? Save for the odd cranky moment, Pochettino has been affable and savvy since joining US Soccer after short-lived spells as manager of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. But here, he sounded credulous and out of touch; ignorant of the many monetary obstacles placed before any non-rich fan wishing to support his team in person this summer. The cost of parking at the Los Angeles-area venue where the USMNT will play two of its three World Cup group stage matches will run as high as $300, per Fifa. It also contrasted sharply with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola recently speaking out on the horrors in Gaza and showing support for the Palestinian people and their plight yet again. Rather than being called out for holding an opinion on something squarely within his realm of employment, Weah should be commended for handling the subject deftly; for acknowledging that there is indeed a whole world of people out there with experiences that differ significantly from his own. While not without his own awkward utterances, Weah does have a track record of responding thoughtfully when he has been dragged into actual politics – he was a member of the first family of Liberia until fairly recently, after all. Like that time he and several Juventus teammates found themselves in the Oval Office, the backdrop to an unprovoked broadside by Trump on transgender athletes. “It was weird,” Weah said after that experience last summer. “I was caught by surprise, honestly, when he started talking politics, with Iran and everything. So I guess it was a cool experience, obviously being in the White House as a first time, it's always wonderful. But I'm not one for the politics, so it wasn't that exciting.” It is no small irony, then, that Weah and Pochettino appear to share the belief that players should remain apolitical. Which is to say that the manager not only misrepresented what Weah said, but also boosted the World Cup organizers who are blending soccer with politics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Missouri is located in the so-called Midwest, and in the summer it's much cooler than Texas, with lower humidity,” that story noted. “The Dutch national team isn't alone in this decision; Algeria, England, and world champion Argentina have also chosen Kansas City as their home base.” And Algeria is likely going to train in Lawrence. That has raised Kansas City's international profile, said Pam Kramer, president of KC2026. “Even the speculation around base camps has led to some exposure that you can't buy, right?” Kramer said Tuesday at a news conference. “That is global exposure that our region, regardless of who ends up base camping here, even the speculation has put Kansas City on the global stage as a place where people want to be.” To wit, the Argentine television station, TyC gave its readers a geography lesson about Kansas City. “Following the draw on December 5th, which revealed that Argentina would be part of Group J,” that site wrote, “the plan is for Lionel Scaloni's team to be based in Kansas City (in the state of Missouri, on the border with Kansas), the city where they will play their first match on June 16th against Algeria, and which is only two hours away from Dallas, where the remaining group matches against Austria and Jordan will be played.” And readers in England also learned about Kansas City's unique geography. “And sources in the US have disclosed to Daily Mail Sport that Tuchel, Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham — should he make it — will head for a parkside inn on the outskirts of the Missouri city which describes itself as being in the style of ‘an English Cottage. Not sure people in Johnson County would like being known as the “outskirts” of Kansas City, but that's how it was described to readers in England. Kramer said at Tuesday's news conference that embassy staff have visited from the seven nations that have games in Kansas City, along with a few other countries. And then thinking about what their presence will look like and how we can facilitate that, whether that's a pop-up embassy row or consular services center somewhere in the region, where visiting nationals have a resource to go to and they're all in one place.” Get in-depth, sideline coverage of Kansas City area sports - only $1 a month</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of England's brightest young talents has been left with nowhere to turn after a deadline day stalemate between his parent club and his loan side effectively trapped him in the Midlands. According to reports from The Athletic, Elliott was desperate to cut short his unhappy spell at Villa Park and return to Liverpool for the remainder of the campaign, having accepted that his opportunities under Emery had evaporated. The deal did not contain a standard recall clause that Liverpool could unilaterally activate. Villa, who are already covering the player's wages, were understandably unwilling to pay a premium to remove a player from their books. As the clock ticked down on deadline day, Elliott waited for a compromise between the two Premier League giants that never materialised, leaving him stranded at a club where the manager has explicitly stated he does not want him. The agreement stipulates that if Elliott makes 10 appearances for Villa, the move automatically converts into a permanent transfer with a mandatory fee. Aston Villa value this obligation at £30m, while Liverpool sources claim the figure is closer to £35m. With Elliott currently sitting on seven appearances, he is perilously close to triggering this substantial outlay. Emery has been ruthless in his management of the situation, deciding months ago that Elliott does not fit his long-term plans. While a recent midfield injury crisis involving Boubacar Kamara and John McGinn forced Emery to use Elliott sparingly in the last two games, the Spaniard remains determined not to be forced into a club-record signing he does not want, meaning Elliott's game time will likely be non-existent for the rest of the season. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Elliott arrived at Villa Park with high expectations after a standout tournament with England's Under-21s, but he struggled to adapt to Emery's specific and demanding system. The turning point appeared to be a match against Fulham in late September. Despite completing 16 of 17 passes, Elliott was hauled off at half-time. Emery prefers the physicality of players like Morgan Rogers and McGinn, leaving no room for Elliott's more technical, drifting style. It has resulted in a "slow-burning nightmare" where the player has often been excluded from matchday squads entirely, watching on as academy prospects were selected ahead of him on the bench. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Because Elliott made an appearance for Liverpool in August - coming on as an 89th-minute substitute against Newcastle - he has already represented two clubs this season. While a move to MLS remains theoretically possible as their 2026 season is just beginning, Elliott reportedly rejected an approach from Charlotte FC last month, feeling that a move to the United States at 22 would be premature. Despite the professional frustration, sources confirm Elliott has refused to let his head drop.

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, organisers will already be on the ground across the 16 host cities - Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Arlington, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver, Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. In January, a group of 23 UK MPs signed a motion calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major competitions, including the World Cup. In January, two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good – were shot dead by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which caused widespread outrage. Meanwhile, also in January, Trump asked Denmark to hand the autonomous territory of Greenland over to the US for what he described as security purposes. When several European allies rejected this, he threatened them with increased 25 percent trade tariffs, but the 79-year-old has since backtracked on the comments. Despite wanting to annex Greenland, Trump has insisted that the US will not use force. Concerns and suggestions of the US being stripped of hosting rights will continue to be voiced ahead of the tournament, but is this realistic, and do FIFA have the power to do so? Technically, yes, but such an impactful decision this close to a tournament will not come without issues. Force majeure is defined as an event such as war, crime or any other unforeseen circumstance which prevents someone or an organisation from doing something written in a legal agreement. Anderson explained: “It is unlikely that FIFA – the organisation that awarded its first global peace prize to Trump – would strip the US of its hosting rights. It would likely take an extreme turn of events for that to happen.” “It would under the contract be very difficult for the US to challenge a FIFA termination, but equally, it is very unlikely that FIFA would strip the most powerful economy in the world of its hosting rights, as this would have long-term diplomatic and economic impact for FIFA,” he continued. Anderson then explained how grounds for termination would usually be related to finances and infrastructure, such as stadiums. The professor then revealed that a typical contract ahead of such an event may include a “force majeure clause” which may cover “any event which is not within the reasonable control of either party, including any natural disasters and adverse weather conditions - such as flood, earthquake, storm or hurricane - or fire, war, invasion, hostilities - regardless of whether war is declared - civil war, rebellion, riot, revolution, insurrection, military coup, act of terrorists or other public enemies, nationalisation, confiscation, sanctions, boycott of the competition or otherwise and other adverse acts imposed by the Government and other governmental authorities, blockage, embargo, labour dispute, strike or lockout”. If a force majeure event occurs, usually both parties can walk away from contractual agreements and make alternative arrangements, such as moving the location of a tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, as fans begin mapping out their summer itineraries, the world of Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms has taken center stage. But if you are planning to attend a match or two, clear your credit card. As you might have heard, this is going to be the most expensive World Cup ever. There remains record demand, regardless, with millions of fans eagerly waiting to learn beginning Feb. 5 whether they are among those who won FIFA's random selection ticket lottery. FIFA president Gianni Infantino predicted that a portion of those fans will use resale platforms to sell their tickets for a profit – hiking prices up even further. Platforms like Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com promise to alleviate fans' spending by offering a wider range of options for match goers. However, those prices are determined by hosts, and have already yielded eye-watering charges in some cities. “It's really this once in a generational moment,” Nathan Rotman, Airbnb's director of policy strategy for North America, told The Athletic. That's a roughly 2,848 percent increase compared to weekend rates for a similar weekend in January, which start at $153 per night at the four-star hotel. The home, equipped with an in-ground pool and spacious yard, is listed for $34,837 for three nights, the home's required minimum length of stay. Meanwhile in cities like Los Angeles, where the U.S. men's national team will play two of its group games, demand for short-term rentals rose by 121 percent, according to data platform Airdna. “What we're hearing specifically from legislators, from host committees and destination marketing organizations is a lot of concern about whether or not they're going to have enough hotel supply for the tourist influx,” he said. So far, their data shows that guests from the three host nations account for the most searches for stays during match dates; families and large groups account for more than half of World Cup trips; and a “significant percentage” of available listings in host cities are priced under $500 per night. Airbnb, a FIFA partner since June 2025, has been making a visible push across host cities, lobbying for the easing of restrictions in places where short-term rentals may be limited. This found that Airbnb is expected to yield $1.2 billion in spending across North America, and Airbnb hosts are expected to earn $212 million across the tournament. In New York and New Jersey, Airbnb hosts are projected to earn an average of $5,700 during the World Cup, the most of any host city. “We estimated 2.1 million fans (will be) traveling with more than 230,000 staying in Airbnbs throughout the country,” Rotman said. “There's a really good opportunity, and core to our mission is spreading that economic opportunity beyond the hotels and the tourist centers into neighborhoods. Through the FIFA partnership, the company will be more visible to fans, especially with FIFA's stringent regulations limiting outside marketing at its competitions. The platform will also offer soccer-centric experiences for its users. For the Club World Cup last summer, fans could pay to join a training session with U.S. men's national team icon Tim Howard or pay to watch a match with him and fellow former national teamer Cobi Jones. East Rutherford, where listings are available, was among the many North Jersey towns that enforced municipal bans on short-term rentals nearly a decade ago, when Airbnb first became popular in those neighborhoods. In Spain, the rental platform was fined $75 million in December for unlicensed tourist rentals, as pushback sees short-term rentals as driving up housing costs. Airbnb has been working closely with leaders in host cities to ease restrictions for the World Cup, Rotman said. Lawmakers in Kansas City recently adopted rules making it easier for residents to host short-term rentals, by declaring a temporary need to prevent potential accommodation shortages. New York still has rules that strictly limit short-term rentals within city limits. In 2023, the city began enforcing a near ban by adopting restrictive rules, which, among other things, require that hosts be present during a guest's stay, and limiting guests to two people. That bill, which was strongly opposed by the hotel industry union, died before reaching the final voting agenda in 2025, as Bloomberg reported last month. Zohran Mamdani, New York City's new mayor, in November voiced his opposition to easing short-term rental restrictions, siding with union workers and suggesting any revival of Airbnb's fight in the city in the new year could be met with similar resistance. “As we look towards the World Cup, we're already seeing (hotel) prices up above $600 per night, and that's going to push people to stay in other places,” Rotman said in December. “So, New York City's loss will be New Jersey's gain, and other cities' gains, because they're pricing families and regular people out of coming to the city.” In Boston, a pair of professors from Harvard Business School and Boston University, went as far as urging in an op-ed in The Boston Globe that temporarily relaxing Airbnb rules next summer will give the city “a welcome boost,” as it would help prevent “severe accommodation shortages.” They argued that short-term rentals increase affordability, pointing to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil as a recent example. When demand for hotels and short-term rentals surged after the draw, some World Cups fans took to social media to air their grievances about last-minute cancellations by hosts. In some instances, hosts turned to community forums for advice on increasing the costs of their rentals to fall in line with the World Cup surge. At least one social media influencer and Airbnb host claimed they canceled a booking after realizing their prices were not updated to reflect the strong World Cup demand for their three-night stay in Atlanta. They described poor communication from the guest as reason for their cancellation. Airbnb said it has rules in place engineered to make host cancellations rare. Hosts must have a “valid reason” for their cancellation, and the cancellation must be timely, according to rules posted on the company's website. There could be financial consequences for hosts, like a cancellation fee, and the platform reserves the right to block a host from re-listing their home during those canceled dates. “Hosts set their own prices when it comes to these major games. We think of ourselves, really, as increasing competition, generally,” Rotman said. There are implications on the platform for doing those kinds of things that hurt hosts, (like) overall search. Anthony Zoric, a Croatian-American living in L.A., secured tickets for every World Cup match Croatia could play, through to the final. The city is also the hometown of Croatian football legend Luka Modrić, who, at 40, will almost certainly embark upon his last World Cup. That proximity was “key” because he will be traveling with young children; however, their confirmed reservation, booked through Airbnb, was canceled a few days after the World Cup draw over a “maintenance” issue. “And then I noticed that, like, an hour or two later, it was back up for triple the price. He has not yet booked his stay for his trip to Dallas but plans to use a different platform when he does. Host cancellations are rare, but we know they can disrupt guest plans and undermine confidence in our community. “We enforce fees and other consequences to deter this behavior, including blocking the listing calendar for the canceled dates so it can't be rebooked, automated reviews citing the cancellation, impact on Superhost status where applicable and, if warranted, up to suspension or deactivation of their account.” The spokesperson also said the company has amended its policies to deter host cancellations, decreasing such instances by 30 percent year over year since July 2023. For John Sear of Birmingham, England, who has tickets to four World Cup matches this summer, his housing plans for the tournament also hit a snag. He and his friend, Kevin Lindsey, from near London, used Booking.com in the fall to secure their stays. Their last was to Germany for the 2024 UEFA European Championship. They planned their itinerary around matches in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. “They'd had over 60 days to notice this after our booking. After exchanges with Booking.com, Sears said he agreed to cancel their booking and re-book on the platform, where prices surged dramatically. Booking.com did not respond to a request for comment from The Athletic. “We've always played that role where people will share their homes during specific periods of time when there is an opportunity (to do so). For these next few months, through July 19, 2026, they can call it: the World Cup effect. Melanie Anzidei  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic covering soccer.

Myriam Totta's early days as an Airbnb host have been marked by a series of disappointments. She and her husband spent $55,000 over the past year to make their Kansas City-area home more appealing for short-term renters. The four-bedroom home features the kind of touches — cozy TV-watching areas, an outdoor fire pit, and newly purchased furniture — that should be catnip for visitors. "It was like a baptism by fire," Totta tells me. She has high hopes for this summer, though, when the FIFA World Cup will deliver tens of thousands of soccer fans to their backyard. Kansas City's selection as one of 16 North American host cities is the main reason she and her husband decided to jump into the rental game — Totta says she was intrigued after hearing about a friend's plans to capitalize on the influx of out-of-towners. With the help of dynamic-pricing software that advises her on daily rates (for which she only pays $20 a month), Totta has set a goal of earning at least $2,500 per night during the festivities. It's shaping up to be a banner year for rental owners who, like Totta, own properties near some of the country's biggest sports stadiums. Airbnb hosts in places like Dallas, Atlanta, and Los Angeles are expected to rake in $212 million from the World Cup alone, according to an analysis by Deloitte (those estimates don't include earnings on other short-term rental platforms like Vrbo). Some operators aim to bank several thousand dollars per night. In Kansas City, for instance, median asking rates for short-term rentals on the night of June 16, when Algeria and Argentina face off in the tournament's group stage, are up more than 200% from a year prior. The promise of rental riches is drawing everyone from veteran property managers to newbies eager for a piece of the action. In many ways, it's never been easier to try your hand at short-term rentals. If you're looking to squeeze every last dollar out of your home, a vast array of software providers can advise you on pricing and listing strategies. If ease is what you're after, on-the-ground management companies stand ready to handle every last headache (for a fee, of course). But while fans are willing to splurge on top-tier homes in prime locations, some of these wannabe landlords are destined for letdowns. To stand out from their ever-savvier competition, homeowners are decking out their places in decor tailored to the most diehard fans and providing the kinds of flourishes, like freshly made treats or luxury linens, that are typically associated with five-star stays. The desire for beds near major sporting events has spawned a cottage industry of homeowners who moonlight as landlords a few times a year, investors who buy properties to rent them out to cash-flush fans, and management companies that shoulder the hassle of running mini-hotels.

Rent Like A Champion, founded in 2006 by a couple of Notre Dame alums, started out managing short-term rentals for college-town homeowners looking to make some extra money on busy football weekends. The company now also partners with event organizers like the PGA of America to secure accommodations for fans, corporate clients, and athletes. The vast majority of its hosts are regular homeowners rather than full-time real estate investors, says CEO Dave Longwell, and the most sought-after listings can earn five figures for a weeklong event. But he cautions that the eye-catching paydays are limited. The experiences of these part-time hosts could offer a road map for those hoping to tap into the World Cup gold rush. Lisa Hinkle, a 63-year-old client of Rent Like A Champion who lives walking distance from Notre Dame's football stadium in South Bend, Indiana, says two-night stays for games can bring in anywhere from $3,500 to $3,800, while the biggest home game of the season — likely the Fighting Irish's matchup against national title runner-up Miami this coming fall — could reach $5,000. Hinkle, who works two jobs, says she spends about 10 to 20 hours cleaning and preparing the house for the next guests after a stay. She's carried out various remodels over the years, from upgrading bathrooms to adding more beds so the house can sleep up to 16 people. Hinkle outfits the house with Notre Dame-branded towels, mugs, and other decor, including Fighting Irish-themed cornhole and an inflatable leprechaun outside on game weekends. She leaves pastries from a local baker and personally checks in with guests, offering flexibility for check-in or check-out times if needed. "I think people appreciate the extra little added touches," she says. In November, the Kansas City Short-Term Rental Alliance and Missouri Vacation Home Alliance hosted a crash course for homeowners interested in listing their properties for the World Cup. Tyann Marcink Hammond, owner of the vacation rental company Branson Family Retreats and "Queen of Guest Experience," as she's known around the industry, says her message to potential landlords was to shed any social media-induced fantasies of handing off the keys and then "you go sit on a beach with an umbrella drink in your hand." Seemingly simple choices, like the kinds of towels or linens on offer, or how guests will even get inside the house, can give rise to sprawling decision trees that can stump any host. At the November session — another is scheduled for Feb. 6 and 7 — attendees weren't as concerned with those minute details. Instead, they were most interested in learning about pricing. "People want to know, is it worth their time and energy?" To help homeowners wring every last dollar out of their short-term rentals, tech companies like PriceLabs, Eviivo, and AirDNA offer relatively cheap tools that replace guesswork with science. Jamie Lane, AirDNA's chief economist, says the company has seen strong booking demand for the World Cup on Airbnb and Vrbo, where Kansas City is already more than 40% occupied for the tournament's group stage. Lane says he expects to see a pop of supply a little closer to the event, as more people catch word of the rates their neighbors are getting. But waiting too long could be a losing strategy. Paris saw a 50% jump in inventory on Airbnb and Vrbo — a "pretty astonishing" increase, Lane says, given that the city is already Airbnb's second-largest market in the world. Most of those new listings came in about three or four months before the event, which gave them enough time to build a little bit of a reputation on the platform. Sophisticated travelers gravitate toward experienced hosts and places with a track record of good reviews, Lane says, and are less likely to gamble on a new listing. If potential World Cup landlords want to get a good rate when things kick off in June, it's a good idea to get some reps in this spring. She has some bookings lined up for February and March — "I cannot wait to experience a good guest," she tells me — though the life of a short-term rental host still has its ups and downs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Columbus is one of seven cities that will host games as part of the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympic men's and women's soccer tournaments, with matches being played at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field, home of the Crew. The venue, which holds 21,000, has hosted multiple international soccer matches for the United States men's and women's teams since opening in 2021. The other additional cities hosting the soccer tournaments are Nashville, New York, San Diego, San Jose and St. Louis. Here's what else we know about 2028 Olympic soccer coming to Columbus: The dates are still subject to change. "It's really a package deal," Crew president of business operations Mary Shepro said. Shepro said Columbus has submitted bids to host CONCACAF events in the upcoming years. She confirmed Columbus was included in U.S. soccer's bid to host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup, and Shepro feels "highly confident" that Columbus will be a team base for the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup. So, in the coming weeks and months, we really hope to have many more exciting events to announce." In 2026, the second round of SheBelieves Cup games and the NWSL Challenge Cup are already scheduled to take place at ScottsMiracle-Gro Field. Olympic organizers have not announced that any other sport will come to Columbus. However, the Crew and other local organizations that helped bring Olympic soccer to the city, such as the Greater Columbus Sports Commission, have started thinking of community events to stage around the Games, despite them being more than two years away. "Can we be doing youth soccer camps and clinics? Can we be engaging with our fanbase in a new way? Can we be engaging with all of the visitors that will be coming into town to watch soccer? In the pitch U.S. soccer sent to FIFA regarding Columbus being a potential host site for the 2031 Women's World Cup, Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium was one of the training facilities listed for teams to use. The official schedule for both tournaments is expected to be announced in the upcoming months, with tickets going on sale in April.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While acknowledging that the final roster is still not set, head coach Carlo Ancelotti made clear that there are firm conditions Neymar must meet to be included in Brazil's plans. Since Ancelotti took over as Brazil's head coach, Neymar's potential return to the national team has remained a constant topic of discussion. However, a combination of recurring injuries and frank conversations between the star and the Italian manager has delayed that comeback, raising questions about Neymar's availability for what he hopes will be his final World Cup. Speaking Monday at a CBF event in Rio de Janeiro announcing a new sponsor, Ancelotti addressed whether the World Cup list has already been defined: “It is not decided. At the first press conference, I said that Brazil is fortunate to have many good players. Neymar's last appearance for Brazil came on Oct. 17, 2023, against Uruguay in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying, when he suffered a torn ACL that sidelined him for more than a year. Since then, four different head coaches have occupied Brazil's bench, including Ancelotti, yet the former Barcelona star has not been recalled. Brazil & Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick reveals his idol pick At present, Neymar continues his recovery with Santos after undergoing knee surgery last year to repair a meniscus injury. The 2026 World Cup could mark the final appearance for a core group of Canarinha veterans, including Casemiro (33), Alex Sandro (35), Alisson (33), Marquinhos (31) and, of course, Neymar (33). As part of the buildup, Brazil face a challenging schedule designed to help Ancelotti refine his squad. Additional friendlies ahead of the tournament have yet to be confirmed, with Brazil set to open their World Cup campaign on June 13 against Morocco, a match many fans hope will feature Neymar back in the Seleção lineup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As concerns over homelessness in Dallas rise as the World Cup gears up to come to North Texas, city leaders have cut another meeting on the subject short. DALLAS - A second Dallas city council meeting on homelessness was cut short as concerns over World Cup preparations in the city rise. When it did start, only four of the seven members were present. The City of Dallas is considering both temporary Pallet shelters and permanent tiny homes as new strategies to house the homeless, with a privately-funded tiny home community for the chronically ill set to open in Ellis County by year's end. Dr. Allen Gwinn, a clinical professor of IT and Data Analytics at SMU, presented a heat map of homeless encampments merged with a heat map of deaths reported in outdoor locations. "There seems to be visually a correlation between reports to 311 of homeless encampments and people found expired in an outdoor setting. Changes the narrative a little, doesn't it?" Councilman Adam Bazaldua questioned the objectivity of the data, and wanted an audience member with Housing Forward to weigh in. That's when councilmen Bazaldua and Zarin Gracey left and the quorum was broken with multiple other council members already missing. With or without the World Cup, these are urgent questions and policies, and it's why it's a standing committee for the city council," Mendelsohn told FOX 4. "It's something we work on every single month." The Source: Information in this story came from FOX 4 reporting.
