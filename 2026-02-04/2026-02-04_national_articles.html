                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? This DOJ is no longer capable of doing its job. “I wish you would just hold me in contempt of court so I can get 24 hours of sleep,” a lawyer representing Donald Trump's government told a federal judge on Tuesday. Julie Le, the lawyer, who was temporarily detailed to the US Attorney's Office in Minneapolis, was assigned to 88 federal court cases in under a month — a crushing workload that would make even the most diligent attorney beg for mercy. Le, moreover, was in court after federal district Judge Jerry Blackwell ordered her and her co-counsel to explain why the Trump administration had not complied with a January 27 order requiring it to release an individual from US custody. As Blackwell's order demanding an explanation laid out, the government also did not respond to a January 31 order threatening to hold it in contempt. As Patrick Schiltz, the chief judge in Minnesota's federal district court, explained in a January 26 order, the Trump administration “decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.” Trump, in other words, deployed thousands of armed law enforcement officers to harass and arrest people in Minneapolis, without sending enough lawyers to handle all of the federal court cases that would inevitably result from Trump's occupation of Minnesota. Worse, Trump's government appears either unwilling or unable to comply with court orders even when one of its lawyers does engage with a particular case. Le reportedly told Blackwell at Tuesday's hearing that it is like “pulling teeth” to get the Trump administration to comply with these orders. “It takes 10 emails from me for a release condition to be corrected,” Le said. In his January 26 order, for example, Schiltz ordered Todd Lyons, the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to personally appear in court and explain the government's inability to comply with his previous order, unless the immigrant named in that order was swiftly released. This tactic appears to have worked, because the man was released. But, while Schiltz's tactic successfully got the Trump administration to comply with a single court order, the administration is still out of compliance with numerous others. Trump, in other words, appears to have broken the Department of Justice. It simply does not have the personnel it needs to respond to all of the legal violations committed by ICE in Minneapolis. Any future potential employer who Googles her name will find an array of news articles about the time that she asked a federal judge to hold her in contempt. This stigma will follow her, moreover, despite the fact that there's no evidence that she was incompetent or otherwise neglected her duties. There's a lesson here for lawyers who are considering public service: Don't work for Trump's Justice Department or this can happen to you. It is likely, moreover, that working conditions in Trump's DOJ will only get worse. NBC News reported that Le is no longer working for the US Attorney's Office in Minnesota after her courtroom confession, so now her 88 cases will need to be handled by some other already overworked lawyer. Her co-counsel, Ana Voss, is also “among those who have given their notices of resignation,” according to NBC. 2 attorney, resigned in protest last month after senior DOJ officials pushed them to open a criminal investigation into the widow of Renee Good, who was killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. Nor are Justice Department lawyers outside of Minnesota safe from being pulled into the Minneapolis debacle. Bloomberg reported that all of the nation's 93 US Attorney's Offices were recently ordered to designate one or two lawyers who will join “emergency jump teams” that will assist DOJ offices that require “urgent assistance due to emergent or critical situations.” The Justice Department, in other words, appears to be pulling lawyers off criminal prosecutions and civil defense of the US government, so they can deal with an outbreak of crises created by Trump's policies. Another reason why DOJ lawyers are stretched so thin is that the Trump administration is detaining many immigrants without a legal basis to do so. There's no telling how many immigrants are illegally confined right now, but have yet to challenge that illegal detention because they haven't been able to find a lawyer. v. Noem, the case where he ordered ICE's director to appear in court if an immigrant was not released. The Trump administration claimed that it must detain this immigrant, identified only as “Juan T.R.” in court documents, under a provision of federal law that calls for detention “in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission.” But Juan is not an applicant for admission. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has misread this law to detain numerous immigrants without legal justification. There's no telling how many immigrants are illegally confined right now, but have yet to challenge that illegal detention because they haven't been able to find a lawyer. Until fairly recently, federal courts might have responded to such widespread legal violations by issuing a “nationwide injunction,” a court order that bars the federal government from committing the same legal violation anywhere in the country. But the Supreme Court's Republican majority recently limited lower courts' power to issue such injunctions in Trump v. CASA (2025). And so these cases are being handled piecemeal, even though the Justice Department apparently lacks the personnel to respond to each individual case. The consequences of the Minneapolis occupation are likely to be felt for years after Trump leaves office, even if Congress enacts legislation barring any future president from conducting a similar operation. Many top applicants, meanwhile, will likely be reluctant to apply for Justice Department jobs out of fear that they will be placed in an impossible position, as Julie Le was. The specter of DOGE, and similar Trump administration efforts to fire civil servants, looms over all federal jobs. The Justice Department typically pays much less than what its lawyers could earn in private practice, but it has historically been an attractive employer for elite attorneys because it offered job security and a predictable workload. It's far from clear whether DOJ's lawyers will regain that confidence once the United States has a new president. A federal court says deportation protections for Haitian immigrants will remain in place. ﻿We're about to lose our last nuclear arms control treaty with Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House border czar Tom Homan says the administration is withdrawing 700 immigration officers from Minnesota, effective immediately, after state and local officials agreed to turn over arrested immigrants. Still, Homan warned, the mission of mass deportations continues. The Trump administration is reducing the number of immigration enforcement officers in Minnesota after state and local officials agreed to cooperate by turning over arrested immigrants, border czar Tom Homan said Wednesday. A widespread withdrawal will only occur after people stop interfering with federal agents carrying out arrests and setting up roadblocks to impede the operations, Homan said. The U.S. military has unleashed a new round of strikes against Islamic State members in Syria following the deadly December ambush that killed two U.S. soldiers and one American civilian interpreter. U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that U.S. aircraft conducted the attacks between Jan. 27 and Monday, destroying targets that included a communication site and weapons storage facilities. “Striking these targets demonstrates our continued focus and resolve for preventing an ISIS resurgence in Syria,” said Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM's commander. The U.S. military said its multiple rounds of strikes since December have killed or captured more than 50 Islamic State members, including “an experienced terrorist leader who plotted attacks and was directly connected” to the ambush. Petro's visit to Capitol Hill comes a day after he met with President Donald Trump, and the pair emerged describing their meeting as friendly. Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said the meeting revolved around ways to coordinate anti-drug trafficking efforts, as well as economic and infrastructure projects. A man convicted of trying to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in 2024 was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon pronounced Ryan Routh's fate in the same Fort Pierce courtroom that erupted into chaos in September when he tried to stab himself shortly after jurors found him guilty on all counts. Prosecutors had asked for life without parole, saying Routh is unrepentant and has never apologized. Routh also received a consecutive seven-year sentence for one of his gun convictions. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats aim to submit proposed legislation concerning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “within the next 24 hours.” Schumer said Americans are “appalled” at some of the ICE enforcement actions taking place in the country and that Democrats have “common-sense, tough objectives to rein in ICE.” Among those, he said ICE agents should not be involved in what he called “roving patrols.” He said they also should not be allowed to engage in racial profiling or to enter certain facilities such as schools and churches. “Finally, no secret police,” Schumer said, referring to the use of masks. The department also said that its consumer price index — a closely watched inflation gauge — will come out Friday, Feb. 13, two days late. Senate Banking leaders Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden wrote to Treasury and DOJ leadership asking for documentation related to President Trump's lawsuit seeking $10 billion from the IRS and Treasury over leaked tax information, arguing the lawsuit reeks of “bald corruption.” The tax leak was caused by a contractor who has pled guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison, and that the events occurred during Trump's first administration. “This lawsuit is a shameless and transparent act of corruption that should make any American's head spin,” states the letter sent to agency leadership, Wednesday. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is laying out four demands for continued funding of the Department of Homeland Security after a short-term patch lapses on Feb. 13. Jeffries said Democrats are seeking mandatory cameras for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. They also believe judicial warrants must be issued by a court before Americans are taken from their homes or cars. He also said that Democrats believe enforcement officers should not be masked in “an arbitrary and capricious fashion.” Also, he said ICE should not be able to detain and deport American citizens, “which we know is taking place right now.” Testifying at the House Financial Services Committee, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has had several loud exchanges with House Democrats over inflation and Trump family cryptocurrency investments. In one instance, after a back and forth over whether tariffs cause inflation or one-time price increases, California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters told committee leadership about Bessent: “can someone shut him up?” And in a screaming match with Democratic New York Rep. Gregory Meeks over the Abu Dhabi royal family's purchase of roughly 49% of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency firm last year, Meeks shouted at Bessent, “stop covering for the president. Bessent is expected to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. Envoys from Moscow and Kyiv met in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday for another round of U.S.-brokered talks on ending the almost four-year war, as a Russian attack using cluster munitions killed seven people at a market in Ukraine. “The discussions were substantive and productive, focusing on concrete steps and practical solutions,” Umerov said on social media as the first of two days of talks wrapped up. It's set to expire Thursday, removing any caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared readiness to stick to the treaty's limits for another year if Washington follows suit, but President Trump has been noncommittal about extending it. Trump has repeatedly indicated he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons and involve China in arms control talks, a White House official who was not authorized to talk publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity said Monday. Beijing has balked at any restrictions on its smaller but growing nuclear arsenal. Trump, a Republican, has indicated he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons but wants to involve China in a potential new treaty. “I actually feel strongly that if we're going to do it, I think China should be a member of the extension,” Trump told the New York Times last month. In his phone call with President Trump, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said China will “never allow Taiwan to be split” from the mainland, according to the official news agency Xinhua. China claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and vows to take it by force if necessary, though the island has never been under Beijing's rule. A day after a series of conflicting reports about the location and format of U.S.-Iran talks, Rubio said Trump officials are working on maintaining a meeting this week with Iranians as tensions between the two countries continue to rise. “I think the Iranians had agreed to a certain format, for whatever reason, this change in their system or what have you. But the United States is prepared to meet with them,” Rubio said. Iranian state TV reported Wednesday that the talks would take place in Oman, not Turkey as originally planned. Rubio said Wednesday that China needs to be part of any future talks to impose limits on nuclear weapons, noting the country's “vast and rapidly growing stockpile.” Trump said Wednesday that he spoke with President Xi Jinping of China, including on subjects involving the military. But Trump didn't elaborate on whether those talks involved their countries' nuclear arsenals. President Trump said Wednesday he and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the situation in Iran in a wide-ranging call that comes as the U.S. administration pushes Beijing and others to isolate Tehran. Trump, who continues to weigh taking military action against Iran, announced last month in a social media post he would impose a 25% tax on imports to the United States from countries that do business with Iran. Years of sanctions aimed at stopping Iran's nuclear program have left the country isolated. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that a breakthrough on Ukraine-Russia peace talks may not come for a while but that the Trump administration has made great progress on negotiations from this time last year. “If you look at the checklist of open items that existed at this time last year and the checklist of open items that remain now in terms of reaching a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, that list has been substantially diminished,” Rubio said. “We will hold our officers to the highest standard,” he told reporters before shifting tone. The only people you are hurting is your own community. Trump's border czar described improved coordination among federal, state and local law enforcement after he arrived in Minnesota to oversee Trump's immigration crackdown. But Homan stopped short Wednesday of criticizing operations before he arrived, despite clashes between federal authorities and Minnesota residents, including ICE and Border Patrol officers killing two U.S. citizens. Homan said he “brought a different set of eyes” to Minnesota at Trump's request. “President Trump sent me here to help de-escalate what was going on,” Homan said, without mentioning the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Prosecutors may seek to add charges that would make Rahmanullah Lakanwal eligible for a death sentence if he's convicted in the Nov. 26 ambush, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Tortorice said Wednesday during the defendant's court appearance. “We're pursuing those options,” Tortorice told U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta. Mehta said he wasn't asking for any “firm commitments” from the government yet. “I'd rather get to that point sooner rather than later,” the judge said before setting May 6 as Lakanwal's next court date in Washington. Lakanwal, an Afghan national, pleaded not guilty to nine counts, including first-degree murder, in the shooting that killed West Virginia National Guard Spc. White House border czar Tom Homan holds a news conference at the Bishop Whipple Federal building on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026 in Minneapolis. Still, when pressed on whether ICE and CBP officers would stop random requests that people prove their U.S. citizenship or legal immigration status, Homan declined to rule out spontaneous arrests beyond an original “criminal target.” “We will not turn a blind eye to illegal immigration,” he said. Homan says its a mix of 700 ICE and Border Patrol agents leaving. Representing the Japanese government, minister of state for foreign affairs Iwao Horii told the meeting that Japan was fully on board with the U.S. initiative and would work with as many countries as possible to ensure it's a success. “Japan shares a deep sense of concern and urgency about the risk of disruptions to critical mineral supply chains,” he told a ministerial meeting on critical minerals co-hosted by Vance and Rubio at the State Department. Georgia General Election 2020 ballots are loaded by the FBI onto trucks at the Fulton County Election HUB, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga., near Atlanta. He proposed frameworks that will serve as “platforms for coordinating policies” to ensure countries can have abundant and affordable access to critical minerals. “So we stand ready and intend to work with each country here today to find a specialized role that you can play,” Rubio said, as he was hosting a ministerial meeting at the State Department with dozens of nations to build a bloc to rebuild global supply chains of the critical minerals without China. “Everyone here has a role to play, and that's why we're so grateful for you coming and being a part of this gathering that I hope will lead to not just more gatherings, but action.” “We want members to form a trading bloc among allies and partners, one that guarantees American access to American industrial might while also expanding production across the entire zone,” he said at a ministerial meeting at the State Department on Wednesday. “What is before all of us is an opportunity at self-reliance that we never have to rely on anybody else except for each other, for the critical minerals necessary to sustain our industries and to sustain growth.” He defended the government's push to ramp up production of the rare earths metals used in electronics, military hardware, phones and other goods. Vance said markets have been unable to deliver on key economic priorities at a State Department conference on building out the rare earths supply chain that is now dominated by China. Vance said the U.S. government will create baseline prices for rare earths to ensure that foreign competitors are unable to undercut domestic producers and a trading bloc among the U.S. and its allies. Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday said prices for critical minerals must be made “more predictable and less erratic” for the U.S. to rebuild its critical minerals industry to counter China in the global market. Vance is speaking at a ministerial meeting at the State Department where Secretary of State Marco Rubio is convening ministers from several dozens of countries on building supply chains that should be less reliant on China. U.S. border czar Tom Homan at a press conference in Minneapolis on January 29, 2026. The Trump administration is reducing the number of immigration enforcement officers in Minnesota after state and local officials agreed to cooperate by turning over arrested immigrants, border czar Tom Homan said Wednesday. About 700 federal agents will be withdrawn from the immigration operation around Minnesota, Homan said during a news conference. Roughly 3,000 federal officers are currently deployed in the state. Vance said that when Rubio invited him to the State Department, he countered that Rubio should come to the White House instead. But then Rubio said he has many jobs and Vance said he'd do Rubio a favor since Vance has just one job. That, combined with aggressive actions by Russia and China, has wreaked havoc on human rights protections globally, according to the annual report. ”President Donald Trump's second administration has been marked from the start by blatant disregard for human rights and egregious violations. The U.S took significant steps backward on immigration, health, environment, labor, disability, gender, criminal justice, and freedom of speech rights, among others,” the 536-page report said. I cannot remember a similar assault on domestic checks and balances, coupled with such an open disdain for international human rights norms.” The White House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Oman didn't immediately acknowledge it would host the talks. She was released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, shortly after the militant group launched a surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage.

(Lothar Speer via AP) Ryan Routh is scheduled to appear Wednesday before U. S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Fort Pierce. Her courtroom erupted into chaos in September shortly after jurors found Routh guilty on all counts, including attempting to kill a presidential candidate and several firearm-related charges. Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen, and officers quickly dragged him out. Routh's sentencing had initially been scheduled for December, but Cannon agreed to move the date back after Routh decided to use an attorney during the sentencing phase instead of representing himself as he did for most of the trial. Prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum filed last month that Routh has yet to accept any responsibility for his actions and that he should spend the rest of his life in prison, in accordance with federal sentencing guidelines. Trump, a Republican, isn't expected to attend Wednesday's arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Trump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose allegations of an affair with Trump threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. He was sentenced to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment. Trump denies Daniels' claim and said he did nothing wrong.

(AP Photo/Adam Gray) Despite rare negotiations between Democrats and President Donald Trump, a bipartisan agreement on new restrictions for federal immigration enforcement in the next two weeks will be exceedingly difficult — or even “an impossibility,” as Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. The negotiations come amid some bipartisan sentiment that Congress should step in to de-escalate tensions over the enforcement operations that have rocked Minnesota and other states. But it's unclear if the president or enough congressional Republicans will agree to any of the Democrats' larger demands that the officers unmask and identify themselves, obtain judicial warrants in certain cases and work with local authorities, among other asks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British government has agreed to release emails and other documents casting light on the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States despite his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. British police on Tuesday opened a criminal investigation into politician Peter Mandelson over alleged misconduct in public office related to his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer departs 10 Downing Street to go to the House of Commons for his weekly Prime Minister's Questions in London, Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer departs 10 Downing Street to go to the House of Commons for his weekly Prime Minister's Questions in London, Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. Starmer insisted he was unaware of the depth of the relationship and said Mandelson had “lied repeatedly” about his ties to Epstein. A trove of documents about Epstein released last week by the U.S. Department of Justice has finished off Mandelson's long political career — and left Starmer facing angry questions about his judgment in making him Britain's envoy to the Trump administration, the country's most important ambassadorial post. Starmer fired Mandelson, 72, in September after emails were published showing he maintained a friendship with Epstein following the late financier's 2008 conviction for sex offenses involving a minor. Epstein died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019, while awaiting trial on U.S. federal charges accusing him of sexually abusing dozens of girls. At a question-and-answer session in the House of Commons dominated by the Epstein revelations, Starmer said Mandelson had “lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador.” The opposition Conservative Party said that wasn't good enough, and moved to force a vote in Parliament calling for the release of emails and other documentation related to the decision to appoint Mandelson. Starmer said he would ensure that “all of the material” is published, except for documents that compromise Britain's national security, international relations or the police investigation into Mandelson's activities. Opposition lawmakers — and some from Starmer's Labour Party — said they worried the government would use national security as an excuse to keep embarrassing documents secret. “The prime minister is talking about national security. The government gave in to lawmakers' anger and agreed that the Intelligence and Security Committee — made up of parliamentarians from several parties — would decide what papers should be published, rather than a senior civil servant as Starmer had proposed. Documents released last week by the U.S. government suggest Mandelson may have shared sensitive information with Epstein when he was government minister a decade and a half ago. In 2009, he appears to have told Epstein he would lobby other members of the government to reduce a tax on bankers' bonuses, and passed on an internal government report discussing a potential sale of U.K. government assets. The newly released files also suggest that in 2003-2004, Epstein sent three payments totaling $75,000 to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Since those disclosures, Mandelson has resigned from the House of Lords and faces a police investigation for alleged misconduct in public office, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Opening an investigation does not mean Mandelson will be arrested, charged or convicted. “We will be assessing if, in light of these newly available documents, there might be a breaches of the respective rules with regard to Peter Mandelson,” European Commission spokesperson Balazs Ujvari said. “We have rules in place, emanating from the treaty and the code of conduct that commissioners, including former commissioners, have to follow.” Associated Press writer Sam McNeil in Brussels contributed to this report. This story was earlier corrected to show that the EU is investigating Mandelson, not Epstein.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi is on hunger strike whilst being held in detention by Iranian authorities, according to a statement from her foundation. In the statement shared exclusively with CNN, the Paris-based foundation, which is run by her family, says it received credible information that Mohammadi began her strike on Monday “to protest her unlawful detention and the dire conditions in which she is being held, realities faced by numerous political prisoners currently held in Iran.” Ali Rahmani, Mohammadi's son, said in a statement that he was “deeply worried” about his mother and everyone else detained by the regime. “What is happening in our country is a crime against humanity,” Rahmani said, adding that before her arrest, his mother was “calling for solidarity, unity, and peace.” Mohammadi was arrested in December by security and police forces during a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer and human rights activist who was found dead in his office. The foundation said that due to Mohammadi's medical history, which includes heart attacks, chest pain, high blood pressure, as well as spinal disc issues and other illnesses, “her continued detention is extremely dangerous and a violation of human rights laws.” The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has also been restricted access to her family, the Foundation said, and has only had one phone call with her brother on December 14, with no contact since then. Taghi Rahmani, Mohammadi's husband, said authorities were demanding that when his wife make calls, she says all is well. “Narges will never be silenced, and it is her voice that they fear most.” One of Iran's most prominent human rights activists, Mohammadi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023. In December 2024, Iranian authorities suspended her prison term for three weeks to allow her to recover from a surgery to remove part of a bone in her lower right leg, where doctors had discovered a lesion suspected of being cancerous. She has been sentenced to multiple prison terms totaling 36 years on charges that include acting against national security and spreading propaganda, according to the Narges Foundation. Supporters say she's a political prisoner, detained for working to advance women's rights and democracy.</p>

Seif al-Islam al-Qaddafi, the son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi, was reportedly killed by "four masked men," according to his team. The office said he was shot to death, but did not provide other details, according to the AP. Additionally, the outlet said that Khaled al-Zaidi, a lawyer for Seif al-Islam, confirmed his death on Facebook. The "masked men" allegedly stormed Seif al-Islam's home and killed him in a "cowardly and treacherous assassination," the AP reported, citing Seif al-Islam's team. He is the second son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi and his second wife, Safia Farkash. Born in 1972, Seif al-Islam was the second-born son of longtime dictator al-Qaddafi. Seif al-Islam al-Qaddafi is seen after his capture in the custody of revolutionary fighters in Zintan, Libya, Nov. 19, 2011. Seif al-Islam, who was seen by many as Libya's face to the West, has been described as the most influential man in the country, despite the fact that he did not hold an official position. He led the talks on Libya abandoning weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the loved ones of those killed in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Reuters reported. Muammar al-Qaddafi, who ruled Libya since 1969, was toppled and killed in a NATO-backed popular uprising in 2011. In late 2011, Seif al-Islam was captured by fighters while trying to flee to Niger and was later released in June 2017 when one of Libya's rival governments granted him amnesty, according to the AP. In November 2021, Seif al-Islam announced his candidacy in the country's presidential election, but was eventually disqualified by Libya's High National Elections Committee, the AP reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration will pull 700 federal immigration officers from Minnesota as a result of cooperation from Democratic officials in turning over criminal illegal immigrants in jails, according to White House border czar Tom Homan. Homan announced on Wednesday morning that he and senior homeland security officials have made “significant progress” in discussions with Gov. Between December and January, roughly 3,000 ICE and CBP were sent in to supplement ICE personnel already there following the revelation of a billion-dollar fraud scheme targeting social services. Homan arrived in Minneapolis on Monday, Jan. 26, at President Donald Trump's request. Homan took over the surge of federal law enforcement to Minnesota from Greg Bovino, a Border Patrol chief from California who Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had appointed last year to oversee Border Patrol's at-large operations assisting ICE. On Wednesday, Homan said his team had made “significant progress” and expected that to increase in the coming weeks. “We currently have an unprecedented number of counties communicating with us now and allowing ICE to take custody of illegal aliens before they hit the streets, unprecedented cooperation,” Homan said during a press conference. Homan has asked Minnesota officials repeatedly to allow ICE to take custody of illegal immigrants in local and state jails rather than release them. “We are not requiring jails to hold people past their normal release time for immigration purposes,” said Homan. ICE, CBP, and other Justice Department and Homeland Security law enforcement officials assisting them in Minnesota will only make “targeted” arrests, according to Homan. Federal law enforcement will only go out into communities with the goal of finding and arresting a specific individual who they have identified prior to going out. Under Bovino's leadership, Border Patrol's practice of approaching people in the street, even at places such as Home Depot, where illegal immigrants seeking work may loiter, had sparked a backlash in the blue state. Homan said federal police will focus on arresting illegal immigrants with criminal records, similar to what the Biden and Obama administrations did. However, Homan added that collateral arrests of noncriminals found when officers move in to arrest a known criminal would continue. “Just because you prioritize public safety threats, don't mean [sic] we forget about everybody else,” said Homan. “We will continue to enforce the immigration laws in this country.” “During our efforts to identify and implement improvements of how operations are planned, conducted and managed, we identified a gap in regard to the use of body worn cameras,” Homan said. “This was actually raised by the workforce when I started walking around talking to people here, some officers and agents had them, some didn't. That inconsistency was unacceptable, so we moved immediately to prioritize full body cam deployment in the city.” On Tuesday, Daily Caller reporter Jorge Ventura posted a video that showed checkpoints set up in the Minneapolis streets by activists.</p>

Authorities are still searching for the missing mother of NBC "Today" co-host Savannah Guthrie after Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, over the weekend in what appears to be an abduction. Guthrie has often spoken publicly about her faith — and now that same faith is echoing in her family's urgent request for prayers. On Tuesday, Guthrie posted an image that said, "Please Pray." Above all, we believe in Him," her caption said. "Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment," it continued. Savannah Guthrie is asking others to pray for her mom's safe return. Her mom, Nancy Guthrie, is pictured at left. At least one church in the New York City metro area has been asking members to join the "Today" host in prayer, sharing this message: "Please pray for Nancy Guthrie." News host Jason Kennedy shared a past interview with Guthrie in which she reflected on her faith and grief following her father's death. A post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie) I can't lose my dad and God at the same time. I can't afford it,'" said Guthrie in the interview. "So that has been a lifelong journey of coming to understand who God is, how he interacts with the world, what it means to live in a broken world. Guthrie says it has been a lifelong journey for her of coming to understand who God is. "If you're God, you can accomplish that goal without horrible suffering, but it's an irreverent thought," she added. "But I don't think God is afraid of that thought, and when I have wrestled with those things, I have come to a greater understanding of this broken world that we live in what we can believe — and this is the leap of faith." "God has promised there will be no more suffering, there will be no more tears, there will be no more injustice and that is the world he has in mind," said Guthrie in the same interview. We are still trying to accomplish in our little way and in our little way means by receiving his love." "Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant," the "Today" show host wrote in a social post. Last February, Guthrie published a children's book titled "Mostly What God Does is Love You." Her children's book followed "Mostly What God Does: Reflections on Seeking and Finding His Love Everywhere." "We still have that ability, through our faith, to think, let's get Nancy home." TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager, Carson Daly, Sheinelle Jones and Craig Melvin spoke about Savannah Guthrie's faith and leaning into prayer to show Savannah and her family support amid the disappearance of her mom, Nancy. Anyone with information about Nancy Guthrie is urged to contact the Pima County Sheriff's Department at 520-351-4900. In that book, Guthrie shared personal stories from her life as a mother, daughter, friend and journalist that explores the highs and lows of life — highlighting the faith present in every day. During a tribute honoring her mother's 80th birthday, Guthrie described her as a woman of deep faith, ABC reported. "She's lived a life of integrity and loyalty," said Guthrie earlier about her mother. "She's lived a life of integrity and loyalty," Guthrie said at the time. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Tucson residence at around 9:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. "She's lived a life of integrity and loyalty." While the circumstances surrounding her disappearance have not been elaborated upon, Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday that "we do, in fact, have a crime." Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Nanos offered sparse information regarding the search for Nancy Guthrie. On Wednesday, the NBC "Today" show reported that law enforcement did not at that point have any solid leads or suspects. "We don't know where she is," Nanos said, adding investigators are starting from the point where Nancy Guthrie was last seen and fanning out from there.

The Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., in November has pleaded not guilty. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, is accused of shooting West Virginia National Guard Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Beckstrom succumbed to her injuries, while Wolfe was critically injured and remains hospitalized. Two National Guard soldiers were shot Wednesday blocks from the White House in Washington, D.C. Alleged gunman Rahmanullah Lakanwal has been charged with first-degree murder. DOJ prosecutors told Judge Amit Mehta on Wednesday that the death penalty had not been taken off the table, though none of the charges Lakanwal is facing are death penalty-eligible. However, DOJ prosecutors said that they are considering all potential charges and "pursuing those options," including a superseding indictment which could potentially include charges that could bring the death penalty into play. Mehta said he would need to know soon and prosecutors told him they would try to have an answer by the next status conference, which is scheduled for May 6. National Guard are seen after reports of two National Guard soldiers shot near the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. Lakanwal appeared in court wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and a white prayer shawl. He arrived in a wheelchair, which could be due to injuries sustained after the alleged attack, as he was shot at the time and was hospitalized for weeks after the incident. He was later charged with transporting a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and with transporting a stolen firearm in interstate commerce. ATF and Secret Service Police officers are seen after reports of two National Guard soldiers shot near the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. "The transfer of this case from Superior Court to District Court ensures that we can undertake the serious, deliberate and weighty analysis required to determine if the death penalty is appropriate here," U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a statement when the new charges were announced. "Sarah Beckstrom was just 20 years old when she was killed and her parents are now forced to endure the holiday season without their daughter. Andrew Wolfe, by the grace of God, survived but has a long road ahead in his recovery," Pirro added. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt discusses the U.S. Navy shooting down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea, details on the administration's new trade deal with India and more on 'America Reports.' The Iranian drone shot down by the U.S. military over the Arabian Sea was conducting surveillance as part of a "routine and lawful mission over international waters," Iranian media is claiming. The Tasnim News Agency, which is affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), cited a source Wednesday as saying that the drone operated by the IRGC successfully transmitted reconnaissance photos to its command center before suffering a loss of communication. The source added that the drone was carrying out a "routine and lawful mission over international waters," engaging in surveillance and imaging duties. The U.S. military had shot down the unmanned Iranian drone Tuesday after it "aggressively approached a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier with unclear intent," a U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) spokesman previously told Fox News. USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is shown at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, Calif., on Aug. 11, 2025. "USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) was transiting the Arabian Sea approximately 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when an Iranian Shahed-139 drone unnecessarily maneuvered toward the ship," Capt. "The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by U.S. forces operating in international waters," CENTCOM also said. "An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board." (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) USS Abraham Lincoln is in the Middle East after President Donald Trump said last week that, "A massive Armada is heading to Iran." An F/A-18F Super Hornet, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 41, prepares to make an arrested landing on the flight deck of USS Abraham Lincoln in the Pacific Ocean on Aug. 10, 2024. Hawkins also told Fox News on Tuesday that, "During a separate incident hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, IRGC forces harassed a U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed merchant vessel lawfully transiting the international sea passage."

Its return was crowned when, last month, the Trump administration published updated federal dietary guidelines that recommend full-fat dairy, like whole milk, and passed a new law that allows public schools to serve whole milk, which had been effectively prohibited since 2012 in an effort to reduce students' saturated fat intake. Cue a flurry of odd social media posts from the Trump administration's offices. One bore an illustration of President Donald Trump as a 1950's-era milkman, while an AI-generated video had Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drinking whole milk in a dark nightclub. Every action on the internet has an equal and opposite reaction, so many social media users are sharing their theories about the milk posting blitz. Is this a MAHA thing, considering Kennedy's demonstrated love for saturated fat? Is this a racist dog whistle, given that white supremacists have made milk their beverage of choice (because many people of color can't digest lactose)? Or is the Trump administration just shilling for Big Dairy? President Bill Clinton's health secretary appeared in a 1990s Got Milk? ad, while President Barack Obama's agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, went on to earn a $1 million salary as a dairy industry lobbyist during Trump's first term and then returned to the US Department of Agriculture to serve as secretary under President Joe Biden in which he, too, regularly praised the virtues of dairy on X. “There is a reflexive deference to dairy at USDA and in federal food policy circles regardless of political affiliation,” a former USDA official, who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation, told me. “Dairy is treated as a cultural and political baseline, receiving more attention than almost all other US commodities…USDA staff feel almost a paternal sense of protection over the industry, at all costs.” But likely the most beneficial policy for milk companies comes down to school cafeterias. In the 1940s, Congress developed the National School Lunch Program, which required schools to serve each student at participating schools a cup of whole milk. That helped the industry sell off surpluses, which beneficially raised prices for farmers. In an effort to reduce food waste, some schools have tried a different approach by, for example, suggesting children can choose water if they don't want milk. But even such light nudges have been met with reprimands from the USDA. All this milk in schools accounts for about 8 percent of the US dairy industry's annual revenue. Few sectors of the food industry seem to have so much influence over school food, or the USDA itself for that matter. While dairy can certainly be part of a healthy diet, the idea that it's essential for both children and adults is a myth, and an outdated one at that. But decades of nutritional research has reached a more nuanced conclusion — that calcium absorption is complex, and high milk consumption in adolescence and adulthood doesn't reduce the chance of hip fractures in old age. US dietary guidelines have long recommended three daily servings of dairy, though Harvard University's public health school recommends zero to two. Undercover investigations into massive corporate-run dairy factory farms and small organic operations alike have revealed horrific cruelty. Journalists and labor groups have exposed abysmal working conditions for the industry's largely immigrant workforce. And scientists warn we need to decrease our consumption of dairy and other animal products to lower our risk of climate catastrophe. That's likely in large part due to the fact that the top 10 dairy states include a mix of blue, red, and purple electorates. As a result, dairy state Democrats join with Republicans to champion bill after bill to further aid the industry or attack its plant-based competition, even though the dairy industry goes against many of the Democratic party's stated values. There are also cultural explanations for milk's popularity in Washington right now. Even as their numbers decline, farmers maintain a vaunted status in American society, so lawmakers are hesitant to criticize them and quick to propose favorable policies. White supremacists have also made it a symbol for their ideology because the lactose in milk is most commonly tolerated by white people and less frequently so people of color. But its extremely online milk content is much more likely what it appears to be on its face: an advertising campaign for the dairy industry. And in spirit it's really not that much different from what other administrations — whether Republican or Democrat — have done, and I'd wager, what the next one will do, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Washington Post laid off about one in three employees across the company Wednesday morning, dealing another big blow to a newsroom that has reached a breaking point. Post owner Jeff Bezos had no immediate comment about the cutbacks. Bezos has been pushing the Post's management team to return the publication to profitability, but many journalists at the paper have criticized his approach and questioned his motives. “Bezos is not trying to save The Washington Post. He's trying to survive Donald Trump,” former Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler said in a column earlier this week. Earlier this week Bezos hosted Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Bezos-owned Blue Origin rocket company. On Wednesday morning, staffers were told to “stay home today” while notices were sent about who had been laid off. “These moves include substantial newsroom reductions impacting nearly all news departments,” executive editor Matt Murray said in an internal memo. The Post's international coverage is also being markedly reduced, though some bureaus outside the US will maintain a “strategic overseas presence,” Murray said. Murray said “this restructure will help to secure our future in service of our journalistic mission and provide us stability moving forward,” though many staffers heaped skepticism on his claim. At the Post lately, “it's just been one funeral after the other,” contributor Sally Quinn, wife of the late Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, told CNN's Pamela Brown Wednesday morning. Quinn said of Bezos, “It just seems heartbreaking that he doesn't feel the paper is important enough to bankroll.” Employees described the severe cuts in social media posts Wednesday morning. Horrible,” the Post's Amazon beat reporter Caroline O'Donovan wrote on X. “I'm among the hundreds of people laid off by The Post,” race and ethnicity reporter Emmanuel Felton wrote. “This comes six months after hearing in a national meeting that race coverage drives subscriptions. The Post's publisher, Will Lewis, has spoken privately about finding a path to profitability for the Post by focusing the paper's investment on politics and a few other key areas, while cutting back in areas like sports and foreign affairs. That talk prompted teams of reporters to send Bezos impassioned letters that urged him not to shrink the newsroom. In one letter obtained by CNN, signed by bureau chief Matt Viser and seven other White House reporters, the staff said it will be unable to maintain its history of excellence in reporting if the Post lays off significant numbers from other news units. “If the plan, to the extent there is one, is to reorient around politics we wanted to emphasize how much we rely on collaboration with foreign, sports, local — the entire paper, really. On Wednesday morning, Murray wrote in a staff-wide memo that “for the immediate future, we will concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers: politics, national affairs, people, power and trends; national security in DC and abroad; forces shaping the future including science, health, medicine, technology, climate, and business; journalism that empowers people to take action, from advice to wellness; revelatory investigations; and what's capturing attention in culture, online, and in daily life.” “Of course, there were acute business problems that had to be addressed,” Baron wrote. But those challenges “were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top,” Baron wrote. Loyal subscribers “were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands,” Baron wrote, citing among other factors the late 2024 decision by Bezos to spike a planned editorial page endorsement of Kamala Harris. That decision, though separate from the newsroom's operations, led to mass cancellations from subscribers, hurting the Post's bottom line. Baron also cited what he called “Bezos's sickening efforts to curry favor” with Trump. A year ago, Bezos outlined a new vision for the Post's once-esteemed opinion section, promoting libertarian ideals, including free markets and personal liberties. That decision led opinion editor David Shipley to exit the company. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Opposing a White House-brokered funding deal that cleared Congress on Tuesday and was signed into law by President Donald Trump didn't stop Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) from each claiming credit for more than $50 million in earmarks for New Mexico. Roughly half of Senate Democrats, including Heinrich and Luján, voted against the measure Friday as the party demands policy changes to Trump's immigration enforcement agenda before providing more funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Heinrich denied the notion that his statement, which said he was “extremely proud” of the $67 million “I secured for our communities,” and his vote, were contradictory. He was absent for votes held in the chamber on Monday and Tuesday. Luján's initial statement said he was “proud to deliver over $50 million in federal funding to support critical projects that expand housing, strengthen health services, and boost infrastructure across our state.” Negotiating earmarks, often viewed in Washington as a dirty word associated with pork barrel spending to fund lawmakers' pet projects, into funding measures and then opposing them is not a new phenomenon for lawmakers from either party. Some even take credit for touting funding projects they played zero role in crafting, such as certain Republicans did with Biden-era money after voting against the Inflation Reduction Act or the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. But there is an emerging pattern for Heinrich and Luján. It's the second time in recent months they've cast “no” votes on spending bills, followed by statements taking credit for their earmarks. Both opposed the government funding measure last November to end the longest-ever shutdown in U.S. history, yet each still claimed recognition for securing more than $200 million for New Mexico projects. Luján said at the time it was “deeply frustrating.” Still, Heinrich took credit for having “secured” upwards of $207 million in federal funds for New Mexico, and Luján said he “successfully secured” north of $202 million.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has renewed his focus on election integrity — including calling for what he described as the “nationalization of voting” — even as many Republicans on Capitol Hill show little appetite to embrace his push. The firestorm erupted on Monday when Trump appeared for an interview with his former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. “We have states that are so crooked, and they're counting votes.” GOP officials have long expressed concerns about Trump's rhetoric regarding elections. Although those concerns are less acute after Trump won reelection in 2024, Republicans, from House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) on down, distanced themselves from the president's talk push to “nationalize the voting.” “I'm a big believer in decentralized and distributed power, and I think, you know, it's harder to hack 50 election systems than it is to hack one,” Thune told reporters on Tuesday. “However, he believes there has obviously been a lot of fraud and irregularities that have taken place in American elections. A second White House official told the Washington Examiner that Trump “cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections,” in part, because “more than a dozen states do not require a photo ID to vote” and “while some states maintain accurate and up-to-date voter rolls, other states do not.” “That's why he's urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Washington Examiner. Trump's comments and his administration's crackdown could have an impact far beyond this week on Capitol Hill. Claremont McKenna College politics professor John Pitney, a former Republican strategist, agreed, pointing to absentee ballots, or voting by mail, as being “at the top of Trump's hit list.” Republican state parties are actually pushing mail voting,” Pitney told the Washington Examiner. “One study found that voters aged 65 and older were most likely to use mail-in voting in 2024. Trump seems to think that mail voters are for undocumented immigrants. In fact, they tend to be old, white citizens — his own base.” “Congress has clear constitutional authority under the Elections Clause to set baseline rules for federal elections, even if conservatives have traditionally been wary out of respect for federalism,” Lennox told the Washington Examiner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a fleeting moment in Washington, top Democrats believed last week they could reach a deal with the GOP to set new limits on President Donald Trump's nationwide immigration enforcement after federal agents killed two US citizens in Minnesota. That hope is mostly gone inside the US Capitol. Congress' push for a bipartisan deal to scale back federal immigration officers' powers is now in doubt, with Speaker Mike Johnson ruling out two of Democrats' biggest demands after the deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Johnson is among many Republicans who are refusing Democrats' demands to stop searches without a judicial warrant and unmask ICE officers in public. Instead, many GOP lawmakers are issuing their own must-haves, like language to end so-called sanctuary cities – a nonstarter for Democrats. Johnson said Tuesday that Republicans are “never” going to agree to requiring that ICE agents obtain warrants from a judge, rather than simply getting the greenlight from a Trump administration official. Democrats, meanwhile, are insisting they cannot accept anything but dramatic reforms to the Department of Homeland Security that can satisfy the national uproar from their base. Now, both parties are anticipating a nasty standoff over the DHS budget when its current funding runs out in just two weeks. Tensions are quickly rising on Capitol Hill as the two sides harden their positions, with growing odds of a DHS shutdown that could snarl airport traffic and leave the Coast Guard and Secret Service without pay. The biggest question now is whether the two sides can come up with a funding bill that any Democrats can support — or whether the department is headed for its third shutdown in less than a year. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Tuesday afternoon that it will be very difficult to get a deal over ICE by the deadline and it might take a miracle. Maybe things will come together and we'll be able to vote on something at the end of the two weeks,” Thune told reporters. “I think that would be overly optimistic, based on my experience.” Asked about whether Republicans can reach a deal by mid-February, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise seemed even more downbeat. They've been clear for years that they don't want to fund law enforcement of any kind,” Scalise told CNN. It's not even clear how the negotiations will proceed: Thune has said it is up to House and Senate Democrats to work with the White House, while one top Democrat involved in DHS funding – Sen. Chris Murphy – has said the onus is on GOP leaders in Congress to come to his party. They need to convene some serious negotiations,” Murphy said of Thune and Johnson. Another Democrat, Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, voiced exasperation at what he described at the GOP's shifting tune on the talks. Asked Tuesday about Johnson throwing cold water on some of Democrats' demands, Crow said, “They continue to not operate in good faith, right?” So far the only bipartisan agreement appears to be over ICE officers wearing body cameras – something that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced Monday will be rolled out for all Homeland Security officers on the ground in Minneapolis. Rep. Tim Burchett, a hardline conservative from Tennessee, told CNN he believes it will be “very hard” to get a deal on ICE and attacked one of Democrats' ideas of forcing ICE officers to remove their masks. Many Democrats, meanwhile, insist they're feeling little pressure to avoid a DHS shutdown in two weeks, even considering potentially debilitating effects on TSA and other agencies. Outcry from the base has been so strong that just 21 House Democrats voted for a massive funding package on Tuesday that included temporary funding for DHS. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri said GOP willingness to deal on the issue has seemingly disappeared. “If you check with all of the offices, I can almost guarantee you that all of these offices are getting more phone calls saying ‘no' than maybe anything since the ACA,” Cleaver told CNN. “I don't see how we're going to get there in two weeks, I honestly don't,” Vargas added. When asked if any Republicans have any appetite to make changes to ICE, GOP Rep. Warren Davidson told CNN: “Very few.” And he said he doubts any deal can happen in the next two weeks, or at all, with Democrats. “I don't think Democrats want to say ‘yes.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, left, and FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey, enter a command vehicle as the FBI takes Fulton County 2020 Election ballots, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga., near Atlanta. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, speaks out against President Donald Trump's investigation of the 2020 presidential election ballots in Georgia, and the involvement of Trump ally Tulsi Gabbard, director of National Intelligence, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. WASHINGTON (AP) — A complaint made about Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard months ago relates to an allegation that she withheld access to classified information for political reasons, according to a memo sent to lawmakers by the inspector general's office and obtained by The Associated Press. That allegation in the complaint filed in May appeared to not be credible, according to the former watchdog for the intelligence community that initially reviewed it. Gabbard's office has denied the allegations and disputed that it withheld the complaint, saying the delay in getting it to lawmakers was due to an extensive legal review necessitated by the complaint's many classified details, as well as last year's government shutdown. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia told reporters that he had not seen the complaint as of Tuesday but that he expected to see it within a couple days, following what he called a protracted effort by lawmakers from both parties to pressure Gabbard to send the report as required by law. “This is in direct contradiction to what Gabbard testified during her confirmation hearings — that she would protect whistleblowers and share the information of timely matter.” The IG's memo, which contains redactions, does not offer further details of either allegation. In June, then-inspector general Tamara Johnson found that the claim Gabbard distributed classified information along political lines did not appear to be credible, according to the current watchdog, Christopher Fox, in the memo to lawmakers. Federal law allows whistleblowers in the intelligence services to refer their complaints to the Gang of Eight lawmakers even if they have been found non-credible, as long as their complaint is determined to raise urgent concerns. In his memo, Fox wrote that he would have deemed the complaint non-urgent, meaning it never would have been referred to lawmakers. “If the same or similar matter came before me today, I would likely determine that the allegations do not meet the statutory definition of “‘urgent concern,'” Fox wrote. The referral of the complaint to lawmakers isn't simple because it contains classified details that necessitate it being hand-delivered, resulting in a process that is likely to take a few days. The inspector general's office confirmed that some lawmakers and their staff were allowed to read copies of the complaint on Monday. She has recently drawn attention for another matter — appearing on site last week when the FBI served a search warrant on election offices in Georgia that are central to Trump's disproven claims about fraud in the 2020 election. That unusual role for a spy chief raised additional questions from Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees. Gabbard said Trump asked her to be present at the search. She defended her role in a letter to lawmakers, arguing that she regularly works with the FBI and is authorized to investigate any threat to election security. Warner said Tuesday that he doesn't accept Gabbard's explanation and that her actions are eroding longstanding barriers separating intelligence work from domestic law enforcement. “The director of national intelligence does not conduct criminal investigations,” Warner said. “She has no role in executing search warrants. And she does not belong on the scene of a domestic FBI search.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Activists are approached by federal agents for following agent vehicles, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026, in Minneapolis. People protest against U.S. Immigrations and Customs enforcement in Portland, Maine, Friday, Jan. 30, 2026. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration Operation Catahoula Crunch, also known as Swamp Sweep, in Louisiana. The Department of Homeland Security's approach to naming immigrant enforcement operations, accompanied by a punchy, at times mocking tone in its official statements, elicits polarizing opinions: Are the names funny or offensive? Reactions often depend on political affiliation and support for the operations that largely target Black and brown communities. “That is why they have those disgusting names,” said Gomez, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee. Administration officials “don't even use that kind of language when they conduct operations across the globe dealing with some of the worst terrorists imaginable.” But Congressman Brandon Gill believes the names demonstrate President Donald Trump is not joking about reining in illegal immigration and securing the border. “I think all he's doing is letting them know we continue to be serious about that,” the Texas Republican said. Historically, names for delicate U.S. military operations have not been catchy proper nouns but something benign. In war time, operation titles were names that could easily clue people in without drawing suspicion if overheard by spies or seen on paper, said Michael O'Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution and the author of several books on U.S. military history and defense strategy. In the modern era, code names for operations are a chance for an administration to project an image of how a mission is going. For example, President George W. Bush often built operation names on themes of freedom. Operation names are also an opportunity to be a “victory dance.” The Trump administration named its lightning bombing campaign on Iran in 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer. “But, if you're ever unsure of the prospects, you try to use a little bit more generic or nondescript name so that nobody can figure out what the mission's going to look like if they happen to hear about it beforehand.” They've been the basis of Internet memes and online merchandise. “It seems like they're just trying to market their detention centers in a trolling type of way,” said Hector Diaz, a Miami immigration attorney who has represented over two dozen Hispanic clients detained in Florida. Operation Catch of the Day, which wrapped up in Maine last month, immediately drew backlash from Democratic lawmakers when the name was first announced. Congresswoman Chellie Pingree called the branding “racist and degrading” to Mainers in general and the state's immigrant communities in particular. Shenna Bellows, Maine's Democratic secretary of state who is also running for governor, denounced “the grotesquely named operation,” warning the Trump administration's actions and messaging have chilled business and civic life in the state. “When ICE agents are patrolling the streets and arresting and imprisoning people, wrongly, then people are afraid to go out,” Bellows told AP. Immigration operation names have also received backlash for taking inspiration from pop culture. White when it launched an immigration sweep in Charlotte, North Carolina, with the same title. The names persevere, even after some Trump officials signaled federal agents' conduct could be restrained following the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota and allegations of other misconduct by federal immigration officers. Janet Mills' Maine State of the State address a week ago, she slammed ICE agents for trying to “intimidate and silence” communities. Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham, a Republican, responded by calling for greater support for longtime residents over newer arrivals to the state. “There was a lot of care and support, of course, around new Mainers, but the one thing I don't see is people standing up for old Mainers and standing up for the people of Maine that have been here and are from here,” Faulkingham said last month during the Maine operation. “America can have a secure border and effective immigration enforcement without the type of lawless cruelty and chaos we've seen from Trump,” Gandhi said. This story has been correct to remove erroneous information. Congresswoman Chellie Pingree is not running for governor of Maine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump railed against CNN‘s chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins for “never” smiling as she asked the president a question about the survivors of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “What would you say to the survivors who feel like they haven't gotten justice?” Collins asked the president during Tuesday's Oval Office signing of the funding bill. The question came after she cited that several women who are survivors of Epstein's sex trafficking ring have denounced the Department of Justice's redactions of content in the Epstein files. “You are so bad,” Trump said to Collins as he spoke over her. “Well, I'm asking you about survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, Mr. President,” Collins said. You're a very dishonest organization, and they should be ashamed of you,” Trump said to Collins. Trump said he did not read the files in the latest trove but said of Lutnick and Musk, “I'm sure they're fine.” Collins then pressed Trump on the DOJ's redactions in the files, saying, “A lot of women who were survivors of Epstein's are unhappy with those redactions that came out. Some of the entire witness interviews are totally blacked out.” She asked Trump if the DOJ “should be more transparent” in their release and redaction process. “I heard that, and you're telling me something else. Now that nothing came out about me, other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally by Epstein and other people. But I think it's time, now, for the country to maybe get on to something else, like healthcare or something that people care about.” She's an unhappy person,” pointing toward Collins. Trump has shut down members of the White House press pool throughout the first year of his second term when he thought they were asking unfair questions, often repeating his signature “fake news” line. In November, Trump made headlines for interrupting a Bloomberg reporter and snapping at her with “Quiet, piggy!“ White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump is “very frank and honest” with members of the White House press pool.</p>
