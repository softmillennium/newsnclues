                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polkadot's highly anticipated smart contract upgrade is off to a slow start. One week on, however, and developers have deployed just 19 contracts, per Subscan data. Ethereum, the largest smart contract-enabled blockchain, hosts tens of millions of contracts and saw over 160,000 new ones deployed last week, according to Token Terminal data. “Our focus is on a battle-tested foundation,” a Parity Technologies spokesperson told DL News, adding that partnerships and developer programmes tied to smart contracts have not surfaced yet. Created in 2016 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot was envisioned to be the “blockchain of blockchains” that would overcome key limitations holding back Bitcoin and Ethereum. Yet Polkadot has suffered from slow adoption, made worse by multiple strategic pivots over the years. To add to the blockchain's woes, Parity has been accused of wasting money by hiring expensive executives with multi-six-figure salaries, and the blockchain itself overspending on marketing. It has a large developer base, and most tools, such as Hardhat, Foundry, and the Solidity programming language, excel at Ethereum compatibility. Because of this, many new blockchains aim for Ethereum compatibility to attract developers and make it easier for them to redeploy existing Ethereum DeFi protocols. Developers could only deploy smart contracts on so-called Polkadot parachains, which fragmented the ecosystem and added complexity for users. The new functionality lets developers deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot, either using Ethereum-compatible tools or using the blockchain's own architecture. “If you're already building with Solidity, the experience will feel familiar,” Parity said in an X post announcing the smart contract upgrade. Yet some critics say the push for Ethereum compatibility is misguided. “If they treated this as a side project and didn't sacrifice a whole lot of other things like Ink, then it may make sense. But that's not the case,” Wei Tang, previously a core developer for Ethereum and Polkadot, said on X. Rust is the main smart contract language used on Solana. In effect, Polkadot is trading compatibility with Solana for Ethereum. The problem, Tang said, is that the implementation is built on a misunderstanding of Ethereum compatibility, resulting in slower transactions than anticipated. “Even if they implement everything to the very end of their roadmap, it wouldn't be faster than Ethereum layer 2s,” Tang said. “Early on-chain metrics mean little at this stage,” the Parity spokesperson said. “Protocol releases are slow to roll out while developers test cautiously in today's market.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UBS CEO Details Crypto Plans Following Report of Bitcoin, Ethereum Trading for Wealthy Clients Publicly traded Swiss bank UBS Group AG (UBS) is creating a path to tokenized services and crypto access for its clients, the firm's CEO confirmed on its Q4 earnings call on Wednesday. The firm, which manages invested assets of more than $7 trillion, has seen its shares drop around 6% on Wednesday, recently changing hands at $44.79. “As digital assets become a more relevant part of the financial system, we are taking a focused client-led approach,” CEO Sergio Ermotti said on the call. “The next generation of investors expects a seamless technological experience, and the emergence of digital assets and tokenization is creating opportunities to fundamentally change how we operate,” Ermotti said. “In this context, clients will increasingly place an even higher premium on trusted advice from partners who can offer true global connectivity, access to innovative products, and seamless cross-border solutions,” he added. “UBS is uniquely positioned to convert these trends into stronger profitability and long-term value creation.” Notably, the firm did not mention stablecoins in its quarterly update. However, in December it was named as an early design partner of Stripe's stablecoin-focused blockchain, Tempo. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price continued falling for the sixth day on Wednesday, visiting levels last seen in November 2024 as risk sentiment remained fragile amidst a confluence of macro headwinds and a lack of demand. This broader retreat followed a staggering $467 billion wipeout in total market value since late January. Meanwhile, the crypto fear and greed index fell three points to 14, marking a fresh multi-month low and firmly anchoring the market in a state of extreme fear. Altcoins traded in the red throughout the day, with single-digit gains limited to stablecoins and a few isolated outliers. Bitcoin price broke below critical support zones after confirming a 15-month low near $73,000, as a cascade of bearish catalysts continued to weigh heavily on market structure. Investors have grown increasingly defensive following a rapid shift in macroeconomic expectations triggered by US President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Warsh, known for his hawkish monetary stance and emphasis on a smaller Fed balance sheet, has revived fears of a prolonged period of tight liquidity. This policy pivot crushed hopes for interest rate cuts in the near term, boosting the US dollar and pressuring Bitcoin into deeper correction territory. As safe-haven demand surged, capital flowed into US Treasuries, gold, and silver, while Bitcoin's “digital gold” narrative fell apart. Gold jumped to fresh highs on renewed Middle East tensions. More than $5.4 billion in leveraged long positions were liquidated over the past 72 hours, with nearly $214 million flushed from Bitcoin trades alone in the last day. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, once a key driver of bullish sentiment, have recorded over $1.5 billion in outflows over the past week and $6 billion in redemptions since November. As risk-off sentiment intensifies, these vehicles have failed to attract sustained interest from traditional finance players. Jobless claims and the non-farm payrolls report will offer fresh clues on whether the Fed's hand may be forced toward a more dovish stance. Until then, Bitcoin is expected to remain caught in the crossfire of hawkish policy signals, geopolitical friction, and collapsing demand. In terms of technicals, Bitcoin breached its 100-week simple moving average that has historically preceded deeper market corrections. Every time Bitcoin has lost 100W EMA, it has retested the 200W EMA.Right now, 200W EMA is at $68,000 and this will most likely be retested.Once the retest happens, you could start accumulating for the long-term. The next critical level sits near the 200-week exponential moving average at around $68,000, with some analysts warning of potential downside toward $60,000 or lower if that threshold gives way. According to market analyst Altcoin Sherpa, that remains a possibility based on current circumstances. on 1 hand it makes sense for $BTC to tap the 200W EMA, an indicator that hasn't been touched since 2023. Either way, the bottom is closer than we think imo Bitcoin is also close to confirming a bearish head and shoulder pattern on the 4-hour chart as observed by trader and analyst Sam Price. To avoid further downside, Bitcoin must reclaim $76,000 with conviction, as noted by some analysts. According to analyst Jelle, it would position Bitcoin for a recovery rally. However, a wave of late-session buying during Asian trading hours helped the sector reclaim some ground, pushing the total altcoin market cap back above $1.1 trillion. Market leaders, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and BNB, posted losses from 3% to 8%. Ethereum, in particular, touched an 11-month low near $2,100 before stabilising.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These assets rely on Bitcoin rather than alternative blockchains for validation and permanence. Interest in this model has grown as users seek stronger security and long-term durability. Understanding how they function requires learning about recent technical changes. This uniqueness makes them suitable for digital art collectibles and records. Bitcoin NFTs differ from traditional tokens because they do not rely on smart contracts. Instead, they use Bitcoin native data structures for permanence. Traditional NFTs are usually created on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana. Those systems rely on programmable contracts to manage ownership and transfers. Bitcoin NFTs avoid complex scripting and use simpler methods for inscription. This approach prioritizes security and immutability over flexibility. The result is a different tradeoff between functionality and resilience. Ordinals are a system that assigns unique identifiers to individual satoshis. A satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. By tracking each satoshi separately, data can be attached to it. This data forms the basis of a Bitcoin NFT. Ordinals enable uniqueness without changing Bitcoin core rules. Ordinals use a numbering system that follows satoshis through transactions. Each satoshi receives an order based on when it was mined. This order allows users to track a specific satoshi over time. When data is inscribed, it becomes linked to that satoshi. Inscriptions store data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This data can include images text or other digital content. The content is fully on-chain rather than hosted elsewhere. Creating an inscription involves embedding data into a transaction. No external server is required to retrieve the content. Anyone can verify the data using a Bitcoin node. Bitcoin is known for its strong security model. Bitcoin NFTs inherit this security because they rely on the same consensus rules. Once an inscription is confirmed, it cannot be altered. It ensures that digital assets remain unchanged over time. Not all Bitcoin wallets support viewing or managing inscriptions. Specialized wallets have emerged to handle this functionality. These wallets track ordinals and display associated content. Users must choose compatible software to interact with Bitcoin NFTs. Wallet development continues to evolve with demand. Marketplaces provide platforms to buy and sell Bitcoin NFTs. These platforms index inscriptions and present them to users. Some platforms integrate escrow or listing tools. Liquidity is still developing compared to older NFT markets. Bitcoin NFTs are not limited to artwork. They can represent documents identity records or historical archives. Some projects explore using inscriptions for academic or legal proofs. The permanence of Bitcoin supports these long-term records. Innovation continues as developers test new ideas. Storing data on Bitcoin increases block space usage. This has raised debates within the community. Higher usage can lead to increased transaction fees. Some view this as a natural market outcome. Others argue for careful consideration of network priorities. Bitcoin mining consumes energy to secure the network. Bitcoin NFTs rely on the same infrastructure. Critics question whether additional data storage is efficient. Supporters note that security and permanence justify the cost. This debate reflects broader discussions about blockchain sustainability. Bitcoin NFTs exist directly on the main chain. Layer two solutions may offer different NFT models. Users must weigh tradeoffs between efficiency and immutability. Bitcoin NFTs raise questions about intellectual property. Users should understand the distinction between ownership and rights. The Bitcoin community have diverse opinions on NFTs. Some welcome innovation and new use cases. Others prefer Bitcoin to remain focused on payments. Developers use specialized tools to create and manage inscriptions. These tools interface with Bitcoin nodes and wallets. Infrastructure continues to improve as adoption grows. The future of Bitcoin NFTs depends on user demand and network economics. If demand persists tools and standards will mature. Long-term archives may benefit most from this model. Understanding ordinal inscriptions and wallets is essential. Bitcoin NFTs align with these values through minimal changes. Miners include transactions based on fee markets. Bitcoin NFTs contribute to this economic model. Bitcoin NFTs face usability and scalability challenges. Platforms like Horizon Market focus on education and discovery. A contextual reference such as Bitcoin NFT can help users explore curated information. Educational environments reduce confusion for new participants. They demonstrate flexibility without altering core rules. Bitcoin NFTs are still early in their lifecycle. Bitcoin NFTs represent a significant evolution in digital ownership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital assets are playing an increasingly important role in the U.S. and global economies. Some assets have become speculative investments that swing wildly in value from day to day, such as Bitcoin, while others like Tether act more as a digital alternative to fiat currency by pegging their value to the U.S. dollar. Taxpayers who acquire, sell, or use digital assets in transactions have relied on a variety of IRS notices for years, because Congress has not yet established specific rules for most cryptocurrencies. Below, the Bipartisan Policy Center shares some broad principles to guide Congress toward thoughtful and durable solutions for the federal tax treatment of digital assets. BPC also considers how those principles might bear on some of the most complicated questions facing lawmakers seeking reform, such as: The answers are neither simple nor straightforward for lawmakers. Policymakers from both parties are interested in making the United States a desirable location to create, invest in, and use digital assets, giving Congress a critical role in providing clear and consistent rules for digital asset owners and financial institutions. Lawmakers will also play an important role in setting clear expectations for when and how digital asset owners will pay taxes on assets that have appreciated in value. Further, legislation can help ensure that brokers and custodians of digital assets are reporting the information that the IRS and other financial regulators need to prevent abuse, tax evasion, or money laundering. As financial expert Andrea Kramer noted in an October 2025 Senate Finance Committee hearing, although digital assets are a novel challenge for Congress, “this is not the first time that a new asset class has been created and made available for trading, nor is this the first time our Code has been applied to a totally new asset class.” (One such example is the index mutual fund, created in 1976.) In that spirit, several principles should apply to federal legislation modifying the tax treatment of digital assets: BPC considers some of those trade-offs below as they apply to the most difficult questions facing lawmakers. Another is staking, where digital asset owners put up some of their existing assets as collateral to help validate transactions and are rewarded with new assets upon completion. Unlike many investments, such as stocks or bonds, individuals and businesses can use digital assets, such as Bitcoin or Tether, for transactions. Imagine someone who owns $10 of Bitcoin, sees it appreciate in value to $15, and then uses that $15 in Bitcoin to purchase a sandwich. This complexity has led some digital asset advocates and industry voices to call for a de minimis exemption for digital asset transactions—in essence, transactions under a certain dollar amount would owe no taxes even if the digital asset being used had appreciated in value. Congress may justify a small exemption on complexity grounds; then-Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) proposed a $50 de minimis exemption with industry support in 2022. Current proposals range from $300 to $600 per transaction, with some proposals also applying an annual cap to prevent crypto traders from averting tax simply by making numerous small-sized transactions (although an annual cap would create its own complexities). To maximize fairness with similar assets and minimize arbitrage opportunities, Congress could eye a threshold aimed more at coffee or dinner transactions than major purchases. Lawmakers could also consider one type of de minimis treatment for stablecoins, which stay pegged to the dollar, and another for cryptocurrencies that swing significantly in value (like Bitcoin). Some revenue loss may be acceptable to minimize complexity, although Congress should not allow asset owners to frequently or significantly avoid capital gains taxes. A wash sale occurs when an investor sells an asset and, within 30 days before or after the sale, buys back the same or a substantially similar asset. Wash sales can offer tax advantages to investors, allowing them to claim capital losses but then re-establish ownership in the same asset at a lower basis, which is why Congress has established rules prohibiting tax deductions for losses on wash sales of stocks. Meanwhile, a constructive sale occurs when an investor engages in financial activities that mirror the sale of an asset, or allow her to reap the financial benefits of an asset sale, without actually disposing of the asset. Because constructive sales can also offer tax advantages (i.e., tax deferral) to the investors who engage in them, Congress has established rules that apply capital gains taxes to constructive sales of stocks. Securities dealers are required to mark most of their assets to market at the end of the calendar year, either applying them to inventory at fair market value if held for resale to customers or—if not inventory meant for resale—recognizing gains and losses on assets regardless of whether they were sold. Mark-to-market accounting generally provides a clear reflection of income with respect to assets that are traded in established markets. Applying these three principles—simplicity, fairness, and avoiding revenue loss—can help lawmakers modernize the tax code for digital assets while avoiding special carve-outs that undermine confidence in the broader system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Take a 30-second survey to help improve The Block. TRM Labs has reached a $1 billion valuation after closing a $70 million Series C funding round amid growing demand for tools that help national security agencies and companies track illicit activity across crypto markets. The new capital vaults TRM into the ranks of so-called crypto unicorns and comes as law enforcement agencies and financial institutions grapple with a sharp rise in crypto-enabled fraud, sanctions evasion, and illicit finance, according to the firm's Wednesday announcement. Founded in 2018, TRM provides software that traces transactions across multiple blockchains, helping customers identify suspicious activity, assess risk, and support investigations. Its clients include government agencies, regulators, exchanges, and financial firms that use crypto rails for payments and settlement. TRM said it plans to use the funds to expand its product suite, further invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and grow its global team, as criminals increasingly exploit new technologies to obscure illicit flows. The company also emphasized plans to combat AI-enabled scams and fraud that have become a key driver of demand for advanced blockchain intelligence. "AI is one of the most important technologies of our generation, and where it's applied matters," TRM Labs CEO and co-founder Esteban Castano said. Venture capital firm Blockchain Capital led the Series C with participation from CMT Digital, Goldman Sachs, Bessemer Venture Partners, DRW Venture Capital, Y Combinator, Brevan Howard Digital, Thoma Bravo, Alumni Ventures, Citi Ventures, and Galaxy Ventures. Recent research from the firm found that illicit actors captured nearly 3% of total crypto liquidity in 2025, while another report detailed how Iran's Revolutionary Guard moved roughly $1 billion through UK-registered crypto exchanges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto world is buzzing with worry right now. The total market cap has lost over $115 billion in just one day. Bitcoin fell to around $72,900, sparking a chain reaction of sales across major coins. This post breaks it down simply, with clear reasons, charts insights, and what to watch next. The crypto market cap dropped to $2.45 trillion from recent highs. It bounced a bit to $2.56 trillion, but the damage is done. This sharp fall shows risk-off mood spreading from stocks to crypto. Weakness in traditional markets like stock indices spilled over. When big indices pull back, investors dump risky assets like crypto first. Long positions (bets on price up) took the biggest hit. Here's how it works: Traders use leverage to bet big with small money. Thin weekend liquidity made it worse. Its drop to $72,900 was the lowest in months. Even hot tokens like Hyperliquid's HYPE dropped 12% in a day. It's still up 25% monthly after an 87% rally from Jan 21 to Feb 3. This looks like healthy pullback, not crash. High leverage + low spot buying = volatile mix. Market cap hit $2.45T support, buyers came in (mostly shorts covering). Until spot money flows back, expect swings from macro news and leverage flushes. But timing is key – watch BTC levels. Bear case: BTC under $72K, liquidations restart. Today's drop is painful but typical crypto volatility. Liquidations, macro fears, and profit-taking explain most of it. Bitcoin at $76K offers a rebound chance, but $72,900 is make-or-break.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The firm addressed speculation that a multibillion-dollar client trade was motivated by concerns over Bitcoin's resistance to future quantum computing advances. Galaxy Digital denied that a $9 billion Bitcoin sale by one of its clients was linked to quantum computing risks, countering speculation after its earnings call. Following the company's earnings call, crypto community members pointed to a $9 billion Bitcoin (BTC) sale by one of Galaxy's wealthy customers who was ”fairly concerned about BTC quantum resistance.” Alex Thorn, Galaxy's head of research, said in a Tuesday X post that the $9 billion trade executed on behalf of its client was not due to Bitcoin-related quantum computing concerns. Galaxy reported a net loss of $482 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 and a $241 million loss for 2025 in its quarterly report published on Tuesday. Related: Trump's Fed nomination a ‘mixed' signal for Bitcoin, US liquidity: Analyst The impact of a future quantum computing breakthrough has been a long-standing concern for cryptographers, and began emerging in asset management practices in recent years. In January, investment bank Jefferies' ”Greed & Fear” strategist, Christopher Wood, reportedly eliminated his 10% Bitcoin allocation recommendation from his portfolio, citing concerns around advances in quantum computing. To address the perceived quantum computing threat, a group of Bitcoin advocates and crypto fund managers started championing the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal known as BIP-360, which would introduce a post-quantum signature option for Bitcoin addresses that could be vulnerable to future advances in quantum computing. Related: DOJ-released emails suggest Epstein made $3.2M Coinbase investment in 2014 Galaxy Digital's earnings call and reports of the massive crypto whale offloading assets came as Bitcoin briefly dipped below $74,000 on Tuesday, adding to concerns about the market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When TRM Labs cofounders Esteban Castaño and Rahul Raina moved to San Francisco in 2018 to create a startup, their mentors told them that great companies are built when you believe something about the world that others don't. Along with a passion for technology and national security, the pair shared a conviction that billions of people would use digital assets to move money around the world. On Wednesday, the San Francisco–based startup announced a $70 million Series C funding round, led by its seed investor Blockchain Capital, along with a who's who of traditional firms including Goldman Sachs, Bessemer, Brevan Howard, Thoma Bravo, and Citi Ventures. But an early strategic decision to track multiple cryptocurrencies and blockchains at a time when they paled in comparison to Bitcoin, as well as a deep bench of former government investigators, allowed TRM to gain a firm foothold in a crowded ecosystem as governments and private industry realized that blockchain technology was here to stay. “We've seen a 500% increase in AI-enabled use in scams and fraud,” said Ari Redbord, a former federal prosecutor who came on board as one of TRM Labs' earliest employees and currently serves as the global head of policy. “This is a civilization-level threat … and we're building the company for that moment.” “Without third-party tools, it would be infinitely more time-consuming and inefficient,” he told Fortune. Koopman, who is taking over as chief of criminal investigation at the IRS in March, said that the agency started working with TRM Labs soon after it launched. Though they had already been using Chainalysis for years, the IRS made an effort to not put “all of our eggs in one basket,” as Koopman put it, especially as cybercriminals began to expand beyond using just Bitcoin for illicit transactions. “We were staying on par because of the companies that existed, like TRM,” he said. There's nothing the FBI can do all on its own.” TRM's close relationship with governmental agencies has at times created tension with the broader crypto industry, which was founded on libertarian ideals of decentralization. Many in the sector were incensed by reports of Hamas using crypto wallets that cited blockchain analytics groups like TRM Labs, especially after critics like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) “Bringing security to digital assets … is very much aligned with the crypto industry,” he said. “There's a real brand issue for crypto and digital assets.” (TRM still publishes reports that analyze illicit flows using Tether on Tron.) “Our mission is to stop bad actors,” Redbord said. “You don't stop bad actors working only with the most regulatory-compliant places where there's no illicit activity.” Still, as the Trump administration takes a more lax approach to crypto regulation and welcomes onetime outlaws like Tether's Paolo Ardoino into the U.S., Redbord insists that TRM's approach hasn't shifted. We're critical infrastructure for building this new economy of digital assets.” Blockchain Capital led TRM Labs' seed round at a time when growth investments weren't commonplace in the industry. Now, seven years later, the crypto venture firm is leading TRM's Series C. While general partner Spencer Bogart said there isn't any particular metric that persuaded his firm to double down, he pointed to TRM's revenue, which has grown around 50% for the past four years. “This is not a company that has gone through the same types of crypto winters that we see more broadly across a lot of our portfolio companies,” Bogart told Fortune. But as Wall Street embraces tokenization, or issues different digital assets on blockchains, Bogart believes TRM will be able to weather any impending downturn. “It's one of those things that becomes absolutely table stakes for anybody that's going to be touching something in the [crypto] space,” he said. According to Castaño, around 40% of TRM's customers are in the private sector, though he said that segment is growing as financial organizations explore tokenized deposits, equities, and other assets. The accelerating role of AI, both in cybercrime and analytics, also adds to TRM's value proposition. “Criminals are getting all of these amazing technologies, while our defenders on the front lines—the compliance professionals and our law enforcement analysts and officers—are oftentimes still using spreadsheets.” With a rapidly growing team of 350 employees, TRM Labs is capitalizing on its founders' early vision that blockchain would dominate the rails of global finance.

The slide picked up pace late in the session after Advanced Micro Devices sank in after-hours trade on a disappointing sales forecast. Traders also stayed cautious ahead of earnings from Alphabet and Amazon later this week, as investors demanded clearer payoffs from costly AI spending. Crypto traders watched the same risk-off undercurrent spill into digital assets. Tony Severino, market analyst at YouHodler, said Bitcoin remains locked in a tightening range, and he pointed to a signal building on longer timeframes. “At the same time, Bitcoin continues to trade below the monthly basis line, with only days left before a monthly close that would confirm acceptance beneath it.” Metals have held extreme levels without a clear break, and Bitcoin has stayed stuck in one of the tightest volatility regimes in its history, conditions that tend to frustrate short-term traders while signalling markets are working off time rather than trend, he said. On Wall Street, the focus tightened on software makers seen as vulnerable to AI-driven competition after Anthropic rolled out a legal tool for its Claude chatbot. Away from tech, pockets of the market showed more resilience. FedEx extended a record-breaking rally, and Walmart pushed past $1 trillion in market value. In other moves, oil climbed after the US Navy shot down an Iranian drone heading toward an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. Tom Barkin said policy easing has bolstered the jobs market as officials turn back to getting inflation to target, and Stephen Miran said the absence of strong price pressures means rates need to be lowered again this year.
