                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The attorney, Julie Le, was sent back to her job at ICE, according to a source familiar with the matter. In an extraordinarily candid exchange with a federal judge on Tuesday, Le, who had been asked to explain why the administration was not promptly complying with a slew of court orders stemming from immigration cases she's handling, admitted that the government did not have enough lawyers on the ground to adequately keep up with Operation Metro Surge and that trying to get errors fixed is like “pulling teeth.” “They are overwhelmed and they need help, so I, I have to say, stupidly (volunteered),” she told US District Judge Jerry Blackwell, according to a transcript of the hearing obtained by CNN. Blackwell is threatening to hold her and another lawyer in contempt for repeated violations of orders he's issued in immigration cases. “Sometime I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep. I work days and night just because people (are) still in there,” Le said. Her comments in court offer a rare look under the hood of Operation Metro Surge, which officials announced Wednesday would be partially scaled back. Last week, the chief judge of the state's federal trial-level court said ICE “has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence” and specifically called out nearly 100 court orders he said had been violated in recent weeks. Among those orders are ones requiring the government to immediately release immigrant detainees whom judges determined were being held unlawfully in Minnesota or Texas, where many of them were flown after being arrested in the Twin Cities. Judges, including Blackwell, were also frustrated by release conditions ICE had imposed on some immigrants since the court had not specifically allowed the agency to fashion such conditions. Though Blackwell said he thought Le and Justice Department attorney Ana Voss, who is also facing a contempt threat, were “working in good faith and under difficult circumstances,” he warned them that “a court order is not advisory and it is not conditional.” “It is not something that any agency can treat as optional while it decides how or whether to comply with the court order,” the judge said. “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all, is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign,” Blackwell added. Tuesday's hearing was called after Blackwell grew increasingly distressed about repeated violations of court orders in a handful of cases in which he determined that an immigrant swept up in Operation Metro Surge had been unlawfully detained by the administration. In one such case, a man who was detained by ICE officers on January 10 was ordered released by Blackwell five days later, after the judge concluded that his criminal history did not warrant mandatory immigration custody. Absences and loss of innocence: ICE raids leave behind a heavy weight in Minnesota schools “Detention without lawful authority is not just a technical defect, it is a constitutional injury that unfairly falls on the heads of those who have done nothing wrong to justify it,” he said during the hearing. Oscar's attorney, Kira Kelley, told Blackwell that the administration's “detain first, find authority later” approach to immigration enforcement had resulted in a “horrific experience” for her client, who she said went without clean food and clean clothes during the ordeal. That people are just being treated like less than human. And all of this was happening while he had a court order for his release,” Kelley said. The Trump administration's enforcement blitz in Minnesota has faced push back from state and local officials, who failed to convince a different federal judge in Minneapolis to temporarily block the operation. It has also sparked extensive protests and last month two US citizens were shot by federal law enforcement agents. But Le, too, appeared to have some reservations about how the operation was being handled and the way in which her colleagues were responding to adverse court orders stemming from it. She said at one point that “it took a fight, a big, huge fight,” to get colleagues at ICE to walk back release conditions improperly imposed by the agency on some immigrants who were ordered released by judges in Minnesota. Her warning to them, she said, was that if they didn't work to clean up the problems, she would put their names on court filings to ensure she wasn't the only person taking heat over the issues. In another unusual admission from Le, the attorney said the chaos of the assignment had led her to submit her resignation, but that she stopped short of leaving the temporary post because she felt she was needed to ensure people were not continuing to remain detained even after a judge said they needed to be released. You need to go back and get more people out. That's why I'm still here,” she told the judge. “I am here just trying to make sure that the agency understand how important it is to comply with all the court orders, which they have not done in the past or currently.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pentagon is again threatening to sever ties with Scouting America unless the organization formerly known as the Boy Scouts of America reverts to “core values” and realigns itself with service to “God and country”. A warning to end the US military's longstanding partnership with one of the nation's largest and most popular youth organizations came in a Monday night post to social media by the Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, who insisted the scouting movement “lost its way” in a 2025 rebrand that promoted inclusivity and included admitting girls and LBGTQ+ members. Donald Trump's defense department under its head, Pete Hegseth, has previously railed against being “woke” in the US military, including diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, and suggested that women lack the physical strength to be effective combat troops. Parnell's post said the department had conducted a months-long review of its relationship with Scouting America, and would continue logistical and financial support “as long as the organization rapidly implements … common-sense, core value reforms”. “For more than a decade now, Scouting America's leadership has made decisions that run counter to the values of this administration and this Department of War, including an embrace of DEI and other social justice, gender-fluid ideological stances. The post hinted that the department had secured Scouting America's acquiescence by threatening to withdraw support for its national gathering of up to 20,000 scouts and leaders in July, an event that has traditionally benefited from US military members providing logistics, medical care and security. “Our review of the [the ‘Department of War's'] financial assistance and partnership with Scouting America, including its quadrennial National Jamboree celebration, has been rigorous and ongoing. Scouting America did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement to the Washington Post, the organization said: “For nearly 116 years Scouting has stood as a cornerstone of American ideals, good citizenship, service, and adventure for American youth. It represents a significant change of tone from Scouting America, which in November said it was “surprised and disappointed” by Hegseth's criticism of the organization's new “genderless” policies and perceived refusal to “cultivate masculine values”. A draft memo to Congress by the defense secretary accused the scouting movement, traditionally a strong recruiting source for the US military, of an “attack on boy friendly spaces” and fostering “gender confusion”. Scouting America said at the time that it was “disappointed in the potential policy change”, and that its “American values have not changed”. “Our nation's military has walked side-by-side with Scouts for generations,” the group said in a statement. The threat by Hegseth, who was never a Boy Scout, drew criticism from Glenn Thompson, a Republican Pennsylvania congressman and longtime supporter of the scouting movement. “It would be nearsighted to uproot this decades-long partnership.” The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's stopgap bill funds the department of homeland security until 13 February White House border czar says 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota Speaking at the US Capitol today, Senate and House Democrats said that “dramatic changes” are needed at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as they continue their negotiations over a full-year appropriations bill “You can't just stop anybody on the street … and not even tell them why they're picked up,” Schumer said today. Schumer said that he hopes Republicans in both chambers will negotiate in good faith, but they also need to get the White House “on board”. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics has said that January's employment report will be released next Wednesday after being delayed by the three-day government shutdown, Reuters reports. The BLS said the consumer price index report for January will now be published next Friday instead of on Wednesday; while the job openings and labor turnover survey report for December, which was due on Tuesday, will be released on Thursday this week. Speaking at the US Capitol today, Senate and House Democrats said that “dramatic changes” are needed at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as they continue their negotiations over a full-year appropriations bill “You can't just stop anybody on the street … and not even tell them why they're picked up,” Schumer said today. Schumer said that he hopes Republicans in both chambers will negotiate in good faith, but they also need to get the White House “on board”. “It's an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee who was not authorized to speak publicly. But Bezos has remained silent, and did not respond to a series of letters sent by staffers representing the newspaper's foreign, local and White House reporting teams. On Monday, though, he was there in person to warmly greet Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, on a tour of another one of the companies he owns, his Blue Origin spaceflight startup in Florida. Donald Trump touted his “extremely good” relationship with Xi Jinping of China, after an “excellent” phone call today. “It was a long and thorough call, where many important subjects were discussed,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, before rattling off several topics from trade to the his upcoming trip to China in April. “The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way. I believe that there will be many positive results achieved over the next three years of my Presidency,” Trump added. The two-day trilateral talks starting on Wednesday come after Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of exploiting a US-backed energy truce last week to stockpile weapons before launching a record number of ballistic missile attacks at Ukraine on Tuesday. Donald Trump said later on Tuesday that Vladimir Putin had “kept his word” on the ceasefire, adding that Russia's pause in attacks was only meant to last until Sunday. US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, have travelled to Abu Dhabi for the negotiations. When it comes to protests, Homan noted that 158 people have been arrested for “assaulting, impeding, interfering” with immigration officers in Minnesota. Homan said he's had “frank, honest discussions” with the state's governor, Tim Walz; Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey; and the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, while noting they “don't agree on everything”. Today, Homan tried to mitigate any speculation about his takeover. “I'm not going to sit and point fingers at anybody that they failed, because it was a great operation. We took a lot of public safety threats off the street.” Homan added: “President Trump sent me here to help de-escalate. We're not walking away from our mission … This is smart law enforcement. Another note from today's press conference in Minneapolis, Homan said that all Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers in Minnesota will integrate with the ICE team on the ground to form “one unified chain of command”. Experts note that CBP officers have a different remit, particularly when carrying out their roles for interior immigration enforcement. “Just because you prioritize public safety threats don't mean we forget about everybody else,” he said. Tom Homan said that “around 2000” immigration officers remain in Minnesota after today's most recent drawdown announcement. He added that the pre-operation number was between 100 and 150 officers. Namely, asking local officials to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when an undocumented immigrant who has been booked and arrested is released from jail. Speaking to reporters today, Tom Homan said that the Trump administration will draw down 700 immigration enforcement officers. He said this was as a result of increased coordination between county jails and federal officials. Notably, Homan has not confirmed which sheriffs have agreed to this increased coordination with federal immigration enforcement. A reminder, the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) already facilitate transfers of people who have completed felony sentences in state prisons, when federal agents are present to take custody. In Minneapolis, for example, Hennepin County does not notify federal immigration authorities when undocumented immigrants are booked or arrested, and is barred under state law from honoring requests to hold someone past their release time so immigration officers can take custody – known as ICE detainers. Homan, however, said that he was “not requiring jails to hold people past their normal release time for immigration purposes” while addressing reporters today.</p>

An Economist/YouGov poll published on Tuesday also showed strong support for a de-escalation of immigration operations in the Twin Cities. As demonstrations intensify in both Minneapolis and St. Paul, respondents also indicated strong support for those taking part in protests, with 50 percent viewing all or most demonstrations as being peaceful. When it comes to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in the cities, only 35 percent viewed them as mostly peaceful, while 47 percent said they were engaged in mostly violent actions. A majority of Americans also recognized that the Trump administration's initial narrative of the shooting of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who was killed by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, was false, as White House officials had baselessly claimed he was a “domestic terrorist” in the first few days after the killing. After backtracking on his initial insinuation that Pretti was to blame for his own killing, Trump has since gone back to trying to smear Pretti, writing in a Truth Social post last week that, since a new video showed the Minneapolis resident kicking a tail light out of an immigration agent's vehicle days prior to his death, Pretti's “stock has gone way down,” describing him as an “agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist.” Critics have pointed out, however, that, no matter what Pretti had done in the days or even hours and minutes before he was shot, his killing was in no way justified, as agents had held him down, removed a weapon he was legally carrying, and then shot him several times. Steve Schleicher, an attorney representing Pretti's parents, issued a statement in response to the newer video. “A week before Alex was gunned down in the street — despite posing no threat to anyone — he was violently assaulted by a group of ICE agents,” Schleicher said. “Nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex's killing at the hands of ICE on January 24.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The U.S.'s political landscape — and our daily lives — are increasingly shaped by repression and violence, amplified by a media cycle designed to keep us fearful in the present, uncertain about the future, and depleted. Exhaustion is not a side effect of this system. Last year, I wrote that Donald Trump's attacks were designed to exhaust us. Over the past year, I've watched communities build movements and adapt their organizing under this reality. The chaos meant to break us instead revealed what it actually costs — mentally and physically — to live inside a system built on crisis and attrition. It was no longer treated as a personal struggle, but as shared terrain — produced by oppressive systems and requiring collective response. The question shifted from How much more can we carry? As adrienne maree brown reminds us, “What we practice at the small scale sets the pattern for the whole system.” Organizers and neighbors expanded strategies of care, political education, and collective action, rooted in lived experience and repeatedly rebuilt in response to escalating state violence and policy whiplash. Across communities, campuses, and movements — from Intro to Worldbuilding, an ongoing reflective learning space offered by the Resonance Network; to student-led teach-ins organized through Students for Justice in Palestine; to long-standing political education shaped by Critical Resistance and Interrupting Criminalization — these decentralized spaces became sites of local, and global political analysis. Participants examined U.S. complicity in international violence, tracked the repression of student dissent and protest movements, and situated present struggles within longer, transnational histories of resistance. More than information-sharing, they helped people think together and clarify what the coming years would demand. In moments designed to confuse and overwhelm, shared analysis and deliberate pace became forms of power — shaping collective responses to state violence. In cities facing intensified immigration crackdowns, communities and their allies built rapid-response networks to protect neighbors targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). They were counter-institutions — infrastructure designed to keep people connected, informed, cared for, and protected in a system built to fragment and isolate them. As ICE activity near clinics and hospitals drove many people to delay surgeries, avoid urgent care, or forgo prenatal support, organizers, community members, and health workers stepped in. They coordinated clinic escorts, arranged discreet transportation, and connected patients to safe care settings, filling the gaps left by fear, criminalization, and state abandonment. I keep returning to images of college campuses across the nation, particularly amid sustained organizing for Palestinian liberation. Wellness and child care volunteers made broader participation possible. Organizers treated sleep, food, and emotional regulation not as luxuries deferred to some imagined future, but as conditions for protecting the fullness of our humanity and our ability to stay in the struggle. In Minnesota, amid intensified federal immigration attacks, Stand With Minnesota has become a volunteer-led hub that organizes mutual aid, legal resources, and collective response — offering a clear point of access for those facing enforcement and for those seeking to support them. In Chicago, The Love Fridge Chicago, founded during the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to address food access and inequity through a citywide network of free community refrigerators, redirecting edible food away from landfills and into neighborhoods most impacted by food apartheid. What began as emergency response has endured as everyday infrastructure, linking survival, environmental harm, and collective responsibility in material ways. Across these contexts, care is not framed as charity or personal wellness, but as strategy — designed to reduce harm, sustain participation, and make endurance possible under sustained pressure. Our resistance must be shaped by what lies ahead: a system sliding toward open authoritarianism, the normalization of mass violence, and repression that is no longer episodic but continuous. The most subversive thing we can do is refuse to disappear. The question now is not how much more we can push ourselves, or how long we can survive in isolation, but whether we can build the capacity to hold on — to care for and protect one another — because everything ahead of us depends on it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorney detailed to Minnesota to help handle the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities has been removed from her post after telling a judge that the job “sucks” because of the crushing workload and the government's apparent inability to comply with court orders. The attorney, Julie Le, was sent back to her job at ICE, according to a source familiar with the matter. In an extraordinarily candid exchange with a federal judge on Tuesday, Le, who had been asked to explain why the administration was not promptly complying with a slew of court orders stemming from immigration cases she's handling, admitted that the government did not have enough lawyers on the ground to adequately keep up with Operation Metro Surge and that trying to get errors fixed is like “pulling teeth.” “They are overwhelmed and they need help, so I, I have to say, stupidly (volunteered),” she told US District Judge Jerry Blackwell, who is threatening to hold her and another lawyer in contempt for repeated violations of orders he's issued in immigration cases. “Sometime I wish you would just hold me in contempt, your honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep. I work days and night just because people (are) still in there,” Le said. “And, yes, procedure in place right now sucks. I'm trying to fix it,” she continued. “I am here with you, your honor. Last week, the chief judge of the state's federal trial-level court said ICE “has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence” and specifically called out nearly 100 court orders he said had been violated in recent weeks. Among those orders are ones requiring the government to immediately release immigrant detainees whom judges determined were being held unlawfully in Minnesota or Texas, where many of them were flown after being arrested in the Twin Cities. Judges, including Blackwell, were also frustrated by release conditions ICE had imposed on some immigrants since the court had not specifically allowed the agency to fashion such conditions. Though Blackwell said he thought Le and Justice Department attorney Ana Voss, who is also facing a contempt threat, were “working in good faith and under difficult circumstances,” he warned them that “a court order is not advisory and it is not conditional.” “It is not something that any agency can treat as optional while it decides how or whether to comply with the court order,” the judge said. “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all, is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign,” Blackwell added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 65-year-old brother of King Charles III, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, left the Royal Lodge in Windsor on Monday and is now living on the king's Sandringham estate in eastern England, Britain's Press Association reported. British media reported that Mountbatten-Windsor will live temporarily at Wood Farm Cottage while his permanent home on the estate undergoes repairs. Mountbatten-Windsor's move to Sandringham was announced in October when Charles stripped him of his royal titles amid continuing revelations about his links to Epstein. But the former prince was expected to remain at Royal Lodge, where he has lived for more than 20 years, until the spring. The expedited departure came as Thames Valley Police announced that they were investigating allegations that Epstein flew a second woman to Britain to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor. The allegations are separate from those made by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed she had been trafficked to Britain to have sex with Andrew in 2001, when she was just 17. Former Prince Andrew should testify before U.S. Congress over Epstein ties, Starmer says Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with Epstein. He hasn't responded publicly to the new trafficking allegation. In an e-mail dated March 23, 2011, the lawyer for an exotic dancer said Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor asked her to take part in a threesome at the sex offenders' Florida home. The woman's legal representatives accused the pair of having “prevailed upon her to engage in various sex acts” during the alleged encounter in early 2006 after initially hiring her to dance for them. “My client has not pursued her claims against your client until this time because she is not proud of the circumstances of that night,” the lawyer wrote. In other correspondence between Epstein and someone believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor shows Epstein offering to arrange a date between the man and a 26-year-old Russian woman. The man, who signs off simply as “A,” later suggests that he and Epstein have dinner in London, either at a restaurant or Buckingham Palace. The documents do not show wrongdoing by many of those named. After Charles became king in 2022, he tried to force his brother to move into a smaller house on the Windsor Castle estate. Mountbatten-Windsor refused, citing a lease on the property that ran through 2078. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia and Ukraine are poised to hold a second round of talks in Abu Dhabi on February 4-5; the New START arms control treaty between the US and Russia expires on February 4 with no extension agreed; and the European Commission is considering a complete ban on Russian oil imports by the end of 2027. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia. Moscow and Kiev are preparing to enter a second round of negotiations in Abu Dhabi on February 4-5. The meeting will take place against the backdrop of an energy ceasefire that has now expired, during which Kiev behaved with relative restraint, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik told Izvestia. Although those contacts ended without a clear compromise on the territorial issue, Russian sources described them as not without results. An important development was also a meeting between Steve Witkoff and Russian presidential special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, held on January 31 in Florida. Andrey Kortunov, expert at the Valdai Club, told Izvestia he believes it is unlikely that any major breakthroughs should be expected from the talks. At the same time, fundamental topics — territorial issues and Ukraine's future status in the European security system — should be discussed in a separate format, most likely at a higher level," he told Izvestia. "His statement about sending NATO troops to Ukraine confirms that the alliance's secretary general is acting as a provocateur, trying to derail the efforts of diplomats. The United States has not responded to a proposal made by Russian President Vladimir Putin in September 2025 to continue observing the treaty's quantitative limits on warheads and their delivery systems for one more year after its expiration. The document itself does not provide for another formal extension, as was done in 2021. As a result, beginning on February 5, if no reaction comes from Washington, the last bilateral agreement regulating US-Russia relations in the sphere of strategic stability will become history, Vedomosti writes. For now, it is too early to speak of a comparable replacement for the New START Treaty, head of the military-political studies department at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies Oleg Krivolapov told Vedomosti. At the same time, he believes it is also too early to talk about a new round of arms racing stemming from the absence of legally binding control mechanisms. In his view, even if a new treaty does eventually emerge, the path toward it will be extremely difficult because of theaccumulated problems. "Washington is not fully showing readiness to engage in substantive and pragmatic discussions of complex issues or to seek compromises," the expert stressed. As for a new arms race, he believes it "is already in progress." Classic agreements like the New START have not lost their relevance, but they cannot "embrace the unembraceable," nor can they easily be extended to a broader number of participants, researcher at the Center for International Security at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations Dmitry Stefanovich believes. He stressed that there are still no real signals of the Trump administration's readiness to develop a new treaty framework. "But perhaps the expiration of New START will serve as a strong reason for clarifying US approaches. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel on February 3 for a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of dialogue with Washington after Trump expressed hope for reaching a deal capable of preventing a military conflict. In recent days, Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, visited the Kremlin. "Clear-minded representatives of the IRGC may agree to some demands from Washington, but full compliance — dismantling the nuclear program, reducing missile capabilities, and ending support for Shiite proxy forces in the Middle East — would in effect amount to capitulation," he explained. "Military equipment continues to be moved into the region. We will definitely have several days of relative calm, at least until the talks are declared deadlocked," he told Izvestia.a New Delhi is set to receive "the best possible deal" following an agreement reached on February 2 between US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said at a briefing on February 3. Late on February 2, Trump announced that he had reached an understanding with Modi. According to Trump, Washington will fully repeal the 25% surcharge imposed in late August 2025 on Indian goods for purchasing Russian oil, claiming that Modi had agreed to halt such imports. Experts told Vedomosti India is unlikely to abruptly abandon Russian oil, instead pursuing a phased reduction as it balances access to the US market with the need for affordable energy. "But negotiations on both agreements proceeded independently and took a long time. At the same time, the economist continued, it is notable that India has not confirmed its intention to stop buying Russian oil. Such a move is unlikely to be immediate and would more likely be gradual and partial — an option that would be most acceptable for New Delhi given its ties with Moscow, Gnidchenko suggested. Another argument in favor of a gradual reduction in Russian oil purchases is that Venezuela is unable to ramp up oil exports overnight due to infrastructure limits," the analyst added. Based on the experience of 2025, it is worth refraining from "catastrophic" forecasts about India's consumption of Russian oil, researcher at the Center for the Indo-Pacific Region at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations Gleb Makarevich told Vedomosti. Trump likely linked India's tariff relief to its purchases of Russian oil in the way he himself wanted to present from Modi, Makarevich noted. According to Kpler data, Russia's share of India's oil imports stood at 33% at the end of 2025, down from roughly 37% in 2024, amid tighter US oversight and EU sanctions. The European Commission is considering a plan to fully ban imports of Russian oil no later than the end of 2027. Last year, 9.73 mln metric tons of crude were pumped through the southern branch of Druzhba, with shipments going to Hungary and Slovakia. On the northern branch of the pipeline, deliveries of Russian oil to Germany and Poland have not taken place since 202 For Russia, the remaining oil exports to Europe account for just over 4% of its total overseas shipments, the newspaper writes. However, in monetary terms their share is likely much higher, since the EU's price cap does not apply to pipeline supplies. These supplies allow Hungary and Slovakia — countries that have taken a relatively balanced stance in the current conflict between Russia and the West — to remain provided with energy resources. The expert also noted that efforts are underway to cut these countries off from Russian gas as well, which undermines their economic potential. According to Boris Kopeikin, chief economist at the Stolypin Institute for Growth Economics, a full ban on Druzhba shipments would likely lead to higher costs for Russian companies and at least a temporary decline in volumes as supplies are rerouted. Still, he believes the losses would not be critical. Mark Shumilov, analyst covering the resource sectors at Renaissance Capital, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the government has been preparing in advance for a gradual reduction in flows along this route. To that end, Transneft has expanded pipeline capacity to the ports of Novorossiysk (15 mln metric tons) and Primorsk (10 mln metric tons). This will make it possible to redirect Russian oil exports to seaborne routes if pumping through Druzhba is fully halted. TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews</p>

In a video posted by the State Emergency Service, firefighters can be seen putting out car fires as a distraught man appears to be mourning his son.

It added that, allegedly, two electrical substations were hit, "Frunzenskaya" and "Belgorod." Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov claimed  Ukraine's "massive" missile attack damaged energy infrastructure in the Oblast. Ukrainian Telegram channel Exilenova Plus, citing local residents, said the blackout followed an attack. He added that one civilian was injured in the attack. Belgorod Oblast borders Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk regions and is regularly used as a staging area for Russian strikes on Ukrainian territory. The attack came amid Russia's mass assaults on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, leaving thousands without heating and energy supply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian, Ukrainian, and US delegations are holding a second round of peace negotiations in the UAE on Wednesday. Territorial disputes remain the main obstacle to a settlement. Ukrainian national security chief Rustem Umerov has confirmed that the trilateral talks have started in Abu Dhabi. The talks were initially planned for Sunday but were postponed due to a scheduling issue, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Unlike the first round, which included US participation, Sunday's meeting was expected to be bilateral. However, the White House confirmed on Tuesday that American envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would take part on Wednesday. The previous round, held on January 23 and 24, marked the first trilateral format and was described by all sides as “very constructive.” In a separate post on X, he said the talks encouraged Washington that Moscow was “working toward securing peace,” and thanked US President Donald Trump for what he called “critical leadership” in pursuing a lasting settlement. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio admitted “it's still a bridge we haven't crossed,” adding that “there's active work going on to try and see if both sides' views on that can be reconciled.” Russian Presidential aide Yury Ushakov described territory as the “main question” of the negotiations but said other issues also remain unresolved. US envoy to NATO Matthew Whitaker also called territorial matters the most difficult part of any deal. Zelensky ruled out concessions, saying Kiev would not give up its claims to Donbass or the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant “without a fight.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, which joined the Russian state as a result of referendums in the fall of 2022, are now part of Russia and that the issue is closed. Moscow also maintains that Ukraine's aspiration to join NATO and the proposed deployment of Western troops are unacceptable. Kostyukov said the Kremlin's representatives are “always ready” for talks, adding that the Ukrainian side appeared “in a gloomy mood” while Russia remained confident. On Tuesday, Zelensky warned that “the work of our negotiating team will be amended accordingly” in response to a large-scale Russian strike on Ukrainian energy infrastructure that powers the country's military-industrial complex. Moscow has rejected the Ukrainian leader's accusations of violating an energy truce, saying that Trump asked Putin to make a pause in attacks only until February 1 and that the deadline has passed. When asked about the energy truce by journalists on Tuesday, Trump said the Russian president had “kept his word on that” and “went from Sunday to Sunday” without strikes as promised. Trump and other officials said that the sides are “very close” to a deal. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the parties appear nearer to an agreement than at earlier stages. By contrast, the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said Brussels is not seeking to reopen direct talks with Moscow and argued that pressure on Russia should be maintained before any negotiations begin. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the talks' continuation, saying it was “good that the negotiations… are continuing” and pledging to work with European partners to “put an end to the conflict as soon as possible.” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday that direct talks between the sides represented “important progress,” but claimed that the recent Russian airstrikes “do not signal seriousness about peace.” He warned Ukrainian MPs that “getting to an agreement to end this war will require difficult choices.” Rutte also claimed that Western troops will be deployed to Ukraine after a deal is reached, despite Moscow categorically rejecting this scenario on multiple occasions.</p>

Poets Marie Mariya and Megumi Moriyama, sisters who translated an English version of “The Tale of Genji” into Japanese, will speak at an event at Tokyo's Setagaya Literary Museum on Feb. 14. The English version was translated by British Orientalist Arthur Waley (1889-1966) about 100 years ago. The sisters are expected to talk about Waley's edition of Genji — now revived in modern Japanese — as well as what they discovered during the translation process. “It was utterly fascinating,” said haiku poet Mariya during an interview at the sisters' Tokyo home in January. “That's what first came to mind when I read Waley's Genji.” Moriyama, who is two years younger than Mariya, said: “It was incredibly exciting and thrilling. Fluent in English, they wanted to convey the feeling of Waley's Genji to Japanese readers, drawing on their experience as poets. The protagonist, Hikaru Genji, is written as “Shining Prince” in katakana. He is a radiant presence, as if descended from the heavens. Their Japanese translation is highly regarded and continues to be reprinted. He decided to translate the work himself, publishing six volumes between 1925 and 1933. In his autobiography, Keene wrote: “I was utterly captivated by The Tale of Genji. Arthur Waley's translation was dreamlike and enchanting, vividly portraying a beautiful world far away.” Keene decided to pursue studying Japanese literature after the war partly because of this encounter. When it was published, Waley's edition created a sensation in literary circles. Hailed by numerous critics as a major Japanese masterpiece, it became a bestseller and was translated into French, Italian and other languages. Britain at that time was in a period of transition, with the Victorian era just ended and having experienced World War I. The literary world was starting to depict human psychology, known as a stream of consciousness, which broke through during the Victorian-era stagnation bound by form and principle. However, this type of writing had already existed since at least the 11th century in Japan, and it is said to have had a major impact in Europe. “We were told that translating ‘The Tale of Genji' would be a 10-year job,” said Moriyama. Mariya and Moriyama did not divide the translation work; they both worked on the entire text and immersed themselves in translation work for 10 hours every day. Moreover, they didn't use computers, instead writing by hand in their notebooks. They exchanged translations, edited each other's work, and after discussions, combined them into one piece. By doing so, this makes it easier for modern Japanese readers to understand the material. Mariya and Moriyama said that like a spiral, it winds into new dimensions, and that is how “The Tale of Genji,” which was originally written 1,000 years ago, continues to be read by people today, allowing the work to live on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump held talks with Colombian President Gustavo Petro in the White House on Tuesday, just weeks after the leaders traded insults over drug trafficking and an American military raid in Venezuela. The US revoked Petro's visa last year after he denounced Trump's strikes on alleged cartel boats in the Caribbean as “barbaric” and argued that deportations of Colombian nationals by US immigration officials violated human rights. And we got along very well,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. He added that the leaders discussed sanctions and were working to combat drug cartels, without elaborating. Petro said the talks were “very positive” despite their differences. “We may be very different from a civilizational or historical point of view, but what we share is a love of freedom. The Colombian presidential office said Petro provided Trump with “information and names of criminal structures” linked to the drug trade and presented his country as “a strategic ally” in the fight against cartels. Petro also spoke about the “historic results” his government has achieved in seizing drugs from criminal groups. Petro, who had condemned the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by US commandos in early January, urged Trump to normalize relations with Caracas, according to his office. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges when they were brought before a New York judge last month. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic launched plug-ins for its Claude Cowork AI agent on Friday, enabling automation across legal, sales, marketing and data analytics. The pattern should be familiar by now: An apparent breakthrough occurs in artificial intelligence that promises to upend traditional industries, and the market panics, driving down share prices in legacy companies. On Tuesday, data providers and legal software companies had their turn after Anthropic released productivity tools for lawyers. Two State Street SPDR exchange-traded funds tracking software, services and financial data stocks lost a total US$300.6-billion in market value after the news, The Wall Street Journal reported. The sell-off is not unlike what happened last year when Chinese company DeepSeek released cheap, efficient AI models, hitting the share prices of companies tied to building resource-intensive data centres. Hardware companies such as Celestica Inc., which builds equipment for AI data centres, have performed well over the past year because their products are in demand. Toronto's Constellation Software Inc., which acquires companies that build applications for niche industries, has seen its stock price fall more than 50 per cent in the past 12 months owing to concerns that AI coding tools make it easier for competitors to win business, and for the company's own customers to make custom tools. The market reaction Tuesday also highlights a tension between the frontier AI developers such as Anthropic, OpenAI and Google that build general-purpose large language models (LLMs) that can complete a range of tasks, and the companies that build products on top of these very same models. Anthropic, for example, recently released a plug-in for its generative AI platform that it said can handle legal tasks such as reviewing documents, flagging risks and tracking compliance. CS Disco Inc., an AI-powered legal services company in the United States, dropped 12 per cent. The question is what is stopping Anthropic and its ilk from going even deeper into the legal tech space – or any other sector, for that matter – and building custom software on top of their models, potentially putting their own customers out of business. “These applications that are simply a wrapper around what already exists in an LLM, I do not understand what the enduring moat is,” said John Ruffolo, founder of Maverix Private Equity. “You are building your business on top of another business that could compete against you.” That's part of the reason why Maverix has stayed away from backing AI startups, even as valuations have soared. How AI is both hurting and helping the next generation of workers But when it comes to law, there are reasons why AI developers may not make much of an effort any time soon, said Scott Stevenson, co-founder of AI legal software company Spellbook. The market may not be big enough to be worthwhile, for one thing, but the specialization that some companies provide is not so easily replicated. “The model providers will start building some light tooling for different verticals, but what Anthropic does is very thin,” Mr. Stevenson said. We do one thing, and we do it well.” With every new LLM that's released, Spellbook's business has only grown, as law firms become more interested in specialized tools, he said. But any advancement in general-purpose AI systems forces every other company to up its game. Companies such as Cursor, Replit and Lovable have achieved massive valuations thanks to the popularity of their AI coding tools, which can build apps and websites based on plain-language instructions. For these large developers, building coding tools may be more straightforward than contending with complicated integrations with other software or processes that exist in other industries, and more lucrative, too, given the size of the software market. Plus, Mr. Stevenson said, AI companies are heavy users of these tools, so there is an incentive to keep improving them. “I do think they will compete with Cursor and others for sure,” he said. The S&P North American Technology Software Index, for example, is down about 19 per cent so far this year. Shares in video-game companies such as Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and Roblox Corp. tumbled in late January after Google released Project Genie, which can build digital worlds based on text prompts.
