Microsoft has released a browser-based, playable level of the classic video game Quake II. This functions as a tech demo for the gaming capabilities of Microsoft's Copilot AI platform — though by the company's own admission, the experience isn't quite the same as playing a well-made game.

You can try it out for yourself, using your keyboard to navigate a single level of Quake II for a couple minutes before you hit the time limit.

In a blog post describing their work, Microsoft researchers said their Muse family of AI models for video games allows users to “interact with the model through keyboard/controller actions and see the effects of your actions immediately, essentially allowing you to play inside the model.”

To show off these capabilities, the researchers trained their model on a Quake II level (which Microsoft owns through its acquisition of ZeniMax).

“Much to our initial delight we were able to play inside the world that the model was simulating,” they wrote. “We could wander around, move the camera, jump, crouch, shoot, and even blow-up barrels similar to the original game.”

At the same time, the researchers emphasized that this is meant to be “a research exploration” and should be thought of as “playing the model as opposed to playing the game.”

More specifically, they acknowledged “limitations and shortcomings,” like the fact that enemies are fuzzy, the damage and health counters can be inaccurate, and most strikingly, the model struggles with object permanence, forgetting about things that are out of view for 0.9 seconds or longer.

In the researchers' view, this can “also be a source of fun, whereby you can defeat or spawn enemies by looking at the floor for a second and then looking back up,” or even “teleport around the map by looking up at the sky and then back down.”

Writer and game designer Austin Walker was less impressed by this approach, posting a gameplay video in which he spent most of his time trapped in a dark room. (This also happened to me both times I tried to play the demo, though I'll admit I'm extremely bad at first-person shooters.)

Referring to a Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's recent statements that AI models could help with game preservation by making classic games “portable to any platform,” Walker argued this reveals “a fundamental misunderstanding of not only this tech but how games WORK.”

“The internal workings of games like Quake — code, design, 3d art, audio — produce specific cases of play, including surprising edge cases,” Walker wrote. “That is a big part of what makes games good. If you aren't actually able to rebuild the key inner workings, then you lose access to those unpredictable edge cases.”

FOSS unites Red and Green.

In a surprising turn of events, an Nvidia engineer pushed a fix to the Linux kernel, resolving a performance regression seen on AMD integrated and dedicated GPU hardware (via Phoronix). Turns out, the same engineer inadvertently introduced the problem in the first place with a set of changes to the kernel last week, attempting to increase the PCI BAR space to more than 10TiB. This ended up incorrectly flagging the GPU as limited and hampering performance, but thankfully it was quickly picked up and fixed.

In the open-source paradigm, it's an unwritten rule to fix what you break. The Linux kernel is open-source and accepts contributions from everyone, which are then reviewed. Responsible contributors are expected to help fix issues that arise from their changes. So, despite their rivalry in the GPU market, FOSS (Free Open Source Software) is an avenue that bridges the chasm between AMD and Nvidia.



The regression was caused by a commit that was intended to increase the PCI BAR space beyond 10TiB, likely for systems with large memory spaces. This indirectly reduced a factor called KASLR entropy on consumer x86 devices, which determines the randomness of where the kernel's data is loaded into memory on each boot for security purposes. At the same time, this also artificially inflated the range of the kernel's accessible memory (direct_map_physmem_end), typically to 64TiB.

In Linux, memory is divided into different zones, one of which is the zone device that can be associated with a GPU. The problem here is that when the kernel would initialize zone device memory for Radeon GPUs, an associated variable (max_pfn) that represents the total addressable RAM by the kernel would artificially increase to 64TiB.

Since the GPU likely cannot access the entire 64TiB range, it would flag dma_addressing_limited() as True. This variable essentially restricts the GPU to use the DMA32 zone, which offers only 4GB of memory and explains the performance regressions.

The good news is that this fix should be implemented as soon as the pull request lands, right before the Linux 6.15-rc1 merge window closes today. With a general six to eight week cadence before new Linux kernels, we can expect the stable 6.15 release to be available around late May or early June.

Will this cable unlock high refresh 8K gaming?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Shenzhen 8K UHD Video Industry Cooperation Alliance, a group made up of more than 50 Chinese companies, just released a new wired media communication standard called the General Purpose Media Interface or GPMI. This standard was developed to support 8K and reduce the number of cables required to stream data and power from one device to another. According to HKEPC, the GPMI cable comes in two flavors — a Type-B that seems to have a proprietary connector and a Type-C that is compatible with the USB-C standard.

Because 8K has four times the number of pixels of 4K and 16 times more pixels than 1080p resolution, it means that GPMI is built to carry a lot more data than other current standards. There are other variables that can impact required bandwidth, of course, such as color depth and refresh rate. The GPMI Type-C connector is set to have a maximum bandwidth of 96 Gbps and deliver 240 watts of power. This is more than double the 40 Gbps data limit of USB4 and Thunderbolt 4, allowing you to transmit more data on the cable. However, it has the same power limit as that of the latest USB Type-C connector using the Extended Power Range (EPR) standard.

GPMI Type-B beats all other cables, though, with its maximum bandwidth of 192 Gbps and power delivery of up to 480 watts. While still not a level where you can use it to power your RTX 5090 gaming PC through your 8K monitor, it's still more than enough for many gaming laptops with a high-end discrete graphics. This will simplify the desk setup of people who prefer a portable gaming computer, since you can use one cable for both power and data. Aside from that, the standard also supports a universal control standard like HDMI-CEC, meaning you can use one remote control for all appliances that connect via GPMI and use this feature.

The only widely used video transmission standards that also deliver power right now are USB Type-C (Alt DP/Alt HDMI) and Thunderbolt connections. However, this is mostly limited to monitors, with many TVs still using HDMI. If GPMI becomes widely available, we'll soon be able to use just one cable to build our TV and streaming setup, making things much simpler.

Melting occurs despite Corsair's first-party 600W 12VHPWR cable being used.

Another Blackwell GPU bites the dust, as the meltdown reaper has reportedly struck a Redditor's MSI GeForce RTX 5090 Gaming Trio OC, with the impact tragically extending to the power supply as well. Ironically, the user avoided third-party cables and specifically used the original power connector, the one that was supplied with the PSU, yet both sides of the connector melted anyway.

Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs face an inherent design flaw where all six 12V pins are internally tied together. The GPU has no way of knowing if all cables are seated properly, preventing it from balancing the power load. In the worst-case scenario, five of the six pins may lose contact, resulting in almost 500W (41A) being drawn from a single pin. Given that PCI-SIG originally rated these pins for a maximum of 9.5A, this is a textbook fire/meltdown risk.

The GPU we're looking at today is the MSI RTX 5090 Gaming Trio OC, which, on purchase, set the Redditor back a hefty $2,900. That's still a lot better than the average price of an RTX 5090 from sites like eBay, currently sitting around $4,000. Despite using Corsair's first-party 600W 12VHPWR cable, the user was left with a melted GPU-side connector, a fate which extended to the PSU.

The damage, in the form of a charred contact point, is quite visible and clearly looks as if excess current was drawn from one specific pin, corresponding to the same design flaw mentioned above. The user is weighing an RMA for their GPU and PSU, but a GPU replacement is quite unpredictable due to persistent RTX 50 series shortages. Sadly, these incidents are still rampant despite Nvidia's assurances before launch.

With the onset of enablement drivers (R570) for Blackwell, both RTX 50 and RTX 40 series GPUs began suffering from instability and crashes. Despite multiple patches from Nvidia, RTX 40 series owners haven't seen a resolution and are still reliant on reverting to older 560-series drivers. Moreover, Nvidia's decision to discontinue 32-bit OpenCL and PhysX support with RTX 50 series GPUs has left the fate of many legacy applications and games in limbo.

As of now, the only foolproof method to secure your RTX 50 series GPU is to ensure optimal current draw through each pin. You might want to consider Asus' ROG Astral GPUs as they can provide per-pin current readings, a feature that's absent in reference RTX 5090 models. Alternatively, if feeling adventurous, maybe develop your own power connector with built-in safety measures and per-pen sensing capabilities?

CFD simulation is cut down from almost 40 hours to less than two using 1,024 Instinct MI250X accelerators paired with Epyc CPUs.

AMD processors were instrumental in achieving a new world record during a recent Ansys Fluent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation run on the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). According to a press release by Ansys, it ran a 2.2-billion-cell axial turbine simulation for Baker Hughes, an energy technology company, testing its next-generation gas turbines aimed at increasing efficiency. The simulation previously took 38.5 hours to complete on 3,700 CPU cores. By using 1,024 AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators paired with AMD EPYC CPUs in Frontier, the simulation time was slashed to 1.5 hours. This is more than 25 times faster, allowing the company to see the impact of the changes it makes on designs much more quickly.

A new supercomputing record has been set!Ansys, @bakerhughesco, and @ORNL have run the largest-ever commercial #CFD simulation using 2.2 billion cells and 1,024 @AMD Instinct GPUs on the world's first exascale supercomputer. The result? A 96% reduction in simulation run…April 4, 2025

Frontier was once the fastest supercomputer in the world, and it was also the first one to break into exascale performance. It replaced the Summit supercomputer, which was decommissioned in November 2024. However, the El Capitan supercomputer, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, broke Frontier's record at around the same time. Both Frontier and El Capitan are powered by AMD GPUs, with the former boasting 9,408 AMD EPYC processors and 37,632 AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators. On the other hand, the latter uses 44,544 AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators.

Given those numbers, the Ansys Fluent CFD simulator apparently only used a fraction of the power available on Frontier. That means it has the potential to run even faster if it can utilize all the available accelerators on the supercomputer. It also shows that, despite Nvidia's market dominance in AI GPUs, AMD remains a formidable competitor, with its CPUs and GPUs serving as the brains of some of the fastest supercomputers on Earth.

“By scaling high-fidelity CFD simulation software to unprecedented levels with the power of AMD Instinct GPUs, this collaboration demonstrates how cutting-edge supercomputing can solve some of the toughest engineering challenges, enabling breakthroughs in efficiency, sustainability, and innovation,” said Brad McCredie, AMD Senior Vice President for Data Center Engineering.

Even though AMD can deliver top-tier performance at a much cheaper price than Nvidia, many AI data centers prefer Team Green because of software issues with AMD's hardware.

One high-profile example was Tiny Corp's TinyBox system, which had problems with instability with its AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards. The problem was so bad that Dr. Lisa Su had to step in to fix the issues. And even though it was purportedly fixed, the company still released two versions of the TinyBox AI accelerator — one powered by AMD and the other by Nvidia. Tiny Corp also recommended the more expensive Team Green version, with its six RTX 4090 GPUs, because of its driver quality.

If Team Red can fix the software support on its great hardware, then it could likely get more customers for its chips and get a more even footing with Nvidia in the AI GPU market.

The Nissan Leaf was once the number-one selling EV in the world. Unveiled in 2009, it hit the road in 2010, beating Tesla to market as the first mass-produced EV and topping sales charts for a decade. It was a bold move, and one that should have cemented the company as one of the world's premier EV players. So what happened?

Some 15 years later, in the United States, the automaker has floundered. It didn't predict the rise of hybrids, and it's still dealing with the PR aftermath of a very public failed merger with Honda. Add in years of mismanagement and an outright neglect of its EV portfolio, and the former king of EV sales has been scrambling to find its footing. A chaotic market reeling from threats of tariffs really isn't helping.

Still, Nissan is at least attempting to claw its way back to its former glory. It has a new CEO, upcoming EVs and a hybrid for the US market, and the self-awareness to know it needs to adapt how it does business. Nissan is ready for change. Oh, and those talks with Honda aren't over yet.

“This is the heart of Nissan,” the automaker's former chief planning officer and shiny new CEO, Ivan Espinosa, tells media gathered at the Nissan Technical Center, located just outside of Yokohama in Atsugi, Japan. Notably absent from this event is outgoing CEO Makoto Uchida. This is the introduction to Espinosa as the boss—but more importantly, the automaker wants to share its plans for the future.

We're seated in a large design studio with a screen that fills an entire wall; executives address the crowd with a mix of renewed focus and humility. In an industry full of bravado, Nissan is refreshingly forthcoming about its issues.

Chief performance officer Guillaume Cartier begins the two-day event by expressing that the company would be an open book, and be honest about the external and internal issues that have plagued the brand in recent years. The Nissan/Honda merger fell apart largely due to the Nissan leadership's unwillingness to concede that in the automotive world, Nissan and Honda are not equals. This time round, there's a promise for better transparency.

The news Nissan wants everyone to now focus on is the unveiling of the third-generation Leaf. Gone is the hatchback—the Leaf has morphed into a sporty but handsome crossover. And after all, the US market loves a crossover.

Powered by Nissan's 400-volt CMF-EV platform, the Leaf will rest on the same architecture as the Ariya. Outside of smart design and repeated insistence that the team focused on efficiency, the automaker shared no information about range, battery capacity, or price. The vehicle will be available first in the United States and Canada beginning in 2025.

For Europe, the automaker unveiled a new all-electric Micra, an urban runabout that senior vice president of global design Alfonso Albaisa refers to as “charming.” The wide eyes of the Micra have returned and are now powered by electrons instead of petroleum. It's built on the CMF-B EV platform that also underpins the Renault 5 E-Tech. Like the Leaf, Nissan was silent on details about range, price, and battery capacity, but we do know that Europe will get both the Micra and Leaf in 2025.

In a move that will attempt to fix its previous huge market oversight, Nissan will begin production of an all-new hybrid Rogue in 2026, while a PHEV is also in the works. The automaker's midsize SUV competes directly with the wildly popular Honda CR-V and Toyota Rav4, both of which have hybrid powertrain options.

The Rogue will use the third generation of Nissan's e-Power series hybrid technology. Unlike typical hybrids, an e-Power's wheels are only powered by the electric motor, while a specially tuned gas engine acts as a generator. The second generation of the technology is currently in use in the Nissan Qashqai, but this upcoming version combines the powerplants, gearbox, and inverter into a single 5-in-1 unit, using the same electric motor and other components found in Nissan's EV. A clever way to lower costs.

Nissan says that this system delivers the attributes of an EV—increased lower-end torque, smoother acceleration, real-time motor-based torque vectoring (Nissan calls this e-4orce), and a quieter ride. At Nissan's Granddrive test track in Yokosuka, Japan, I was able to test the second and upcoming third-generation e-Power system, and I found it compelling, and, in many cases, superior to traditional hybrid systems. Although the small 1.8-kWh-capacity battery pack means drivers will still have to endure the rumble of an engine on a regular basis, even if it is quieter.

After a keynote, Nissan led us into a courtyard to look at (but not photograph) a series of vehicles in various states of development. The most intriguing was a rugged electric SUV that oozed X-Terra vibes. The light-offroader will begin production in Nissan's Canton, Mississippi, plant in 2027, deftly escaping the latest tariffs announced by President Trump.

Nissan sees the vehicle as a way to differentiate itself from competitors. “You saw an outdoorsy EV, which is not what you see today. The reason to do that is to be different, because the market will get very crowded very fast. We want to come in with an offer that is more unique,” Espinosa says.

Sometimes, however, there is good reason why a certain category of EV “is not what you see today,” and while trying to be different is certainly laudable, it is not always advisable. We'll see soon enough if Espinosa's strategy pans out. Regardless, this Canton-built rugged electric SUV will beat Scout's offerings to market, and will go head-to-head with Rivian's R2. That is, if everything goes according to plan for both automakers.

Nissan has big plans and an intriguing upcoming lineup that, on paper, seems to give it the automotive firepower to be a true competitor in the electrified vehicle market. Bringing those proposals to fruition requires leadership willing to aggressively move forward while taking a long, hard look at the current situation and making drastic changes.

There's a tinge of frustration in Espinosa's voice as the new Nissan CEO explains the current situation with Honda. “The fact that the integration talks stopped is in no way meaning that we are not collaborating with them,” Espinosa said.

“The future of the industry is going to be very challenging, and it's clear that the name of the game is how you build efficient partnerships that add value to your company,” Espinosa told reporters during a roundtable event. For automakers, sharing a platform reduces both parties' financial commitment. Parts procurement also benefits. Suppliers will always prioritize the customer who places the largest order. If a part is used in multiple vehicles across multiple brands, it's built sooner and at a lower cost.

It's the economies of scale in action. The issue? Nissan's scale has dropped dramatically. In 2018, the automaker was producing 5.8 million units a year. Currently, that number has dropped to 3.5 million units. Its US factories are currently underutilized, and its lineup, while slowly undergoing a refresh over the past few years, in some cases still lags behind competitors. Recent moves to rectify the situation have come with their own issues.

The Ariya was a fine reboot of the automaker's electric vehicle strategy, but the vehicle itself hasn't taken off like EV offerings from other automakers. Ponz Pandikuthira, Nissan's chief planning officer for North America tells WIRED how timing hurt the vehicle's launch. As it was introduced, Tesla began cutting prices to ward off new competitors in the market, and suddenly, the Ariya was 20 percent more expensive than a similarly equipped Tesla.

The Ariya also isn't eligible for the $7,500 EV tax credit unless the vehicle is leased. Then, add in manufacturing delays of eight to ten months, and the result is a vehicle hitting the market after any hype that had been generated died down.

Pandikuthira also explains the reason behind Nissan's lack of a hybrid in the coveted midsize SUV segment. With the vehicle price increases during the Covid lockdowns, Nissan (and other automakers) believed that this was the new normal. A rise in overall vehicle value would make EVs seem more affordable at the price points an automaker would need to sell an electric vehicle at to make a profit.

Like many manufacturers, Nissan had bold plans to introduce a fleet of EVs, and at the time, to add a hybrid to its lineup would mean making one less EV. So the automaker gambled on an inflated marketplace. Suddenly, the prices of vehicles came back down to earth, and Nissan's future lineup wouldn't generate much-needed profits. It's tough to be nimble without capital.

According to Espinosa, Nissan has 1 trillion yen ($6.65 billion) in cash. The issue is that the company has $1.5 billion in debt due this year, and ​​$5.6 billion in debt due in 2026. “We're not in the situation in which we have an urgent need for cash,” Espinosa said. “What we have to work on is the free cash-flow generation, which is different. So we have to accelerate revenue generation. We have to get our sales pace in better shape, and we need to work on cost.”

A big part of that is its work to reduce development time from 55 months to 37 months. Then 30 months on each vehicle iteration based on the platform. “We need to show what we're capable of doing,” the new CEO says.

At the multiday event in Japan, Auto Pacific president and chief analyst Ed Kim tells WIRED, “One of the big takeaways I got from all this was that I don't think even Nissan knows how they're going to get there.” However, Nissan's willingness to partner with others, the introduction of a hybrid to compete with the Rav4 and CR-V, and its upcoming lineup are all good moves, Kim says. “Oftentimes, when an automaker has their backs against the wall, sometimes they pull out some of their best design work,” he adds.

But all of this meticulous planning and good intention could quickly be derailed by the chaotic financial situation in the US market. Nissan needs to win big in the United States, and the Trump administration's tariff chaos isn't helping.

“We are working on multiple scenarios to be ready when some clarity comes. It's changing every other day,” Espinosa tells WIRED. Of course, Espinosa said this mere hours before Trump announced the 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles and parts, and an even more recent 24 percent reciprocal tariff on other goods from Japan. Whether Nissan was planning for that kind of clarity is unclear.

WIRED reached out to Nissan for an update. The automaker wouldn't comment directly, but pointed us to a comment from Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a trade association that represents international automakers. “At a time when cost is the number one concern for American car buyers, US automakers are working to provide a range of affordable vehicles for consumers,” she says. “The tariffs will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.”

Sam Abuelsamid, automotive analyst and vice president of market research for Telemetry, believes these costs could hit Nissan hardest. “Of the three largest Japanese automakers operating in the US, Nissan will likely face some of the biggest challenges with the tariffs,” he says. “They only have two plants in the US and import a significant percentage of their products from either Mexico or Japan.”

Like many automakers, Nissan may spread the cost of the tariffs across its entire lineup of vehicles to keep the vehicles that are imported to the US from being prohibitively expensive—although each vehicle will soon undoubtedly cost more.

For Espinosa, in the face of such economic turmoil, the inconvenient truth is that Nissan could do everything right and still struggle because of forces beyond its control. “From a product perspective, they're definitely headed in the right direction. But the big question mark is really on the business side,” Kim says. Indeed, it's the big question for every automaker right now. Except, for Nissan, the results could be catastrophic.
