Pope Francis' medical team briefly considered suspending treatment, but instead decided on an aggressive course that put his organs at risk, the doctor co-ordinating his hospital care has said. Francis was released on Sunday after 38 days of treatment for double pneumonia, under doctors' orders to observe two months of convalescence during which he should avoid large gatherings. The medical bulletin that night said the pope had suffered a bronchiospasm so severe that he inhaled vomit “worsening his respiratory picture”. Dr Alfieri said he believed that prayers for the pope help keep him alive, something that the doctor said is backed by scientific literature. I can say that twice the situation was lost, and then it happened like a miracle,” the doctor said, adding that “of course he was a very co-operative patient”.</p>

Mr Lukashenko marked three decades in power last year, and his political opponents have denounced the tightly orchestrated January 26 election as a farce. Opposition members have been imprisoned or exiled abroad by Mr Lukashenko's unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech. Thousands of Lukashenko supporters attended Tuesday's inauguration ceremony, where he denounced his critics as foreign stooges who were at odds with the people. Belarusian activists say it holds more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Centre. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after running against Mr Lukashenko in 2020, vowed to keep fighting for the country's freedom.</p>

Miller Gardner's body was found in a hotel room in the popular Costa Rican resort area of Manuel Antonio, on the country's Pacific coast. “Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss,” a statement from the team said. “It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years – so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”</p>

The carmaker sold fewer than 16,000 vehicles across Europe last month, down 44%, according to Jato Dynamics. It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers: why can't people remember early childhood? Freud called the phenomenon infantile amnesia, and for many years scientists wondered whether it resulted from trouble in creating or retrieving memories.</p>

Far right party doubles its number of seats, while chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, hopes to form government before Easter Germany's new parliament sits for the first time on Tuesday with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) the second biggest force, as negotiators seek to iron out key differences on tax and migration that are likely to dominate a new coalition government under Friedrich Merz. The MPs taking seats on Tuesday range in age from 23 to 84. Lawmakers of foreign descent are also disproportionately rare in the new parliament. Zada ​​Salihović, a 24-year-old from Die Linke who has become the second-youngest MP in the Bundestag after Hoss, said the new parliament was “still a reflection of a privileged minority” that did not adequately represent women, workers, young people, eastern Germans and people with migrant backgrounds.</p>

Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held. Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's “no connection to Mr Mangione for any of said alleged threats”. Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. An Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. But they say there are not enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.</p>

Officers have confiscated nearly 6.5 tonnes of cocaine from a semi-submersible submarine intercepted off the Azores while bound for the Iberian peninsula, Portugal's judicial police said on Tuesday. Drug traffickers have been caught using semi-submersible vessels, sometimes dubbed "narco-submarines", to smuggle cocaine while attempting to evade detection. Five crew members were onboard the vessel, which was used by an international crime ring, the statement added. Many so-called "narco-submarines" cannot fully dive like a true submarine, but some are able to dip completely underwater.

Gjert Ingebrigtsen has pleaded not guilty to charges of physically abusing two of his seven children, namely the track athlete and his sister, Ingrid. Jakob Ingebrigtsen, 24, told the court about several incidents of violence.

Now the long investigation into the toddler's death has taken a shocking turn with four individuals — including Émile's grandparents and two of their adult children — being taken into police custody. Emile's grandfather Philippe Vedovini and his wife, who was not named by the prosecutor, were arrested in the commune of La Bouilladisse on suspicion of “voluntary homicide” and “concealing a corpse,” according to a statement by the Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor. Emile's disappearance gripped the nation as long and widespread searches yielded nothing. The case also sparked media attention, particularly surrounding Émile's grandfather, who, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, was questioned by police in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school. But police had considered his involvement as only one possible explanation behind the boy's tragic death.</p>

Britons are widely ignorant of the scale and legacy of Britain's involvement in slavery and colonialism, a survey has found, with the vast majority unaware how many people were enslaved, how long the trade went on for, or for how long UK taxpayers were paying off a government loan to “compensate” enslavers after abolition. Nonetheless, the survey found support for some form of reparations is growing, with 63% now agreeing that Caribbean nations and descendants of enslaved people should receive a formal apology, up 4% from last year's poll, while support for financial reparations has also increased, with 40% now in favour. “People point to reparations and think merely in financial terms, but one of the most important things is correcting the record – because until people learn what happened there will not be that widespread, public will to make reparation possible,” she said. “For us not to listen is disgraceful and could have consequences of its own,” she added.

The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong. The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest “serious” level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country's acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.</p>

Dr Alan Borthwick, head of medieval and early modern records at NRS, said: “In essence he was looking for correspondence, especially from parts of the world where Scots were involved in general personal or business matters, but also routine domestic correspondence, which might turn out to have unusual postmarks – a bit magpie-like, he was attracted by something ‘shiny' even if most people couldn't see the attraction.” Alison Byrne, chief executive of NRS, said: “These historical thefts were on an unprecedented scale and carried out we believe by one individual who was a regular visitor to the institutions he stole from.</p>

Actor denies assault and says any crude comments he made on film set were due to his bad mood The French actor Gérard Depardieu has admitted in court that he grabbed the hips of a woman who has accused him of sexual assault, but said it was to avoid slipping and was not a sexual attack. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted. He denies any wrongdoing, telling the court on Tuesday: “I deny all of it.” He told the panel of three judges: “I would never put anyone between my legs.</p>

Taking to X, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware wrote, “Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime – even if accidentally.” Calling the Trump administration “dangerous”, he stated that this government cannot be trusted to protect Americans. Representative Pat Ryan of New York even declared that if House Republicans do nothing, he will “IMMEDIATELY” begin his own congressional investigation. Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief, was mistakenly invited into a Signal chat group that included over a dozen high-ranking Trump administration officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and others, according to the Atlantic. Speaking to MSNBC, Goldberg poked fun at Walz, saying: “I'm thinking to myself, I'm glad Mike Waltz didn't invite a Houthi into the group or a Russian spy, or an adversary of the United States.” During a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Trump still has complete faith in his national security staff, which includes national security adviser Mike Waltz.</p>

It is a source of immense family pride that her father, an artist and teacher, designed the red-and-white Greenlandic flag.

The mysterious spinning lights were officially attributed to a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a mission for the US National Reconnaissance Office (NROL-69). After liftoff, excess fuel was released into space, freezing and catching sunlight to create a breathtaking spiral display visible from the UK. This phenomenon, known as "rocket ice clouds," was previously observed in 2023 over parts of the US following another SpaceX launch.</p>

If Europe wasn't already on notice, the extraordinary leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen was another sign that it has a target on its back. “There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” he added. At heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance's views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump. Trump broadly sees the world as transactional and optimists in Europe have claimed he could force a positive outcome by forcing those nations to spend more on defense budgets. Hegseth said the strike would promote “core” American values including freedom of navigation and pre-establish deterrence.</p>

The order followed a request by Japan's Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families. The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in the 1960s during an anti-communist movement supported by Abe's grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. Two earlier case involved criminal charges — the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud. Nicknamed the “Moonies,” after its founder, the church developed relations with conservative world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as his predecessors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. In Japan, the group has faced lawsuits for offering “spiritual merchandise” that allegedly caused members to buy expensive art and jewelry or sell their real estate to raise donations for the church.</p>

Australia are doing a much better job of controlling possession now, spreading play wide then turning to go backwards, and so on. 59 min Here come China again, Yang bursting down the right and slinging over a cross that forces Miller to chest behind, under pressure form Li. I guess they're happy with that thy've got, but their defence doesn't look strong enough to rely on. I guess for free, that makes some kind of sense, but on the other hand, brilliant though his ball-striking is, he offers every opponent a defensive weakness to target.

Israeli police arrested three men, including Ballal, who was injured during the standoff, he said. It denied reports that at least one of the Palestinians was arrested in an ambulance.

Nangaa dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's comments last week that his country — whose mineral resources are estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world's technology — is looking for a minerals partnership with the U.S. The rebel leader also rejected the outcome of last week's meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without his group's involvement would fail. Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out of talks facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders. It is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.</p>

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.” It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim. “Attacks against civilians, including journalists, are never acceptable under any circumstance,” Kengo Sakajiri, the paper's executive editor added in a statement. The IDF in October said six Al Jazeera journalists were “exposed” as alleged members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad based on what it said were documents found in Gaza that Israel alleged confirmed their military affiliations, including directories and training documents. Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader.</p>

The senator said Americans were clearly “very disturbed” by the daily turmoil in Washington, and that they felt squeezed, stressed and desperate for leaders who are willing to fight for them. “For years, I've talked about the concept of oligarchy as an abstraction,” Sanders said. During an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Sanders dismissed as “nonsense” a question about whether the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should run for the Senate, which some have suggested is a way to primary Schumer. Gesturing to the overflow crowd that turned out to his rally with Ocasio-Cortez in Arizona, he said of his colleagues: “You tell me how many people are going out?” While he credited the party with ushering in progress on social issues such as civil rights, women's rights and LGBTQ+ rights, the senator said Democrats have for too long failed to champion an economic agenda that would meaningfully address the concerns of working-class people – an assessment many leaders roundly rejected.</p>

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday the claim that white people are being persecuted in his country is a “completely false narrative.” It was his latest attempt to push back against allegations made by U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and some white minority groups in South Africa. South African-born Musk, who has regularly accused South Africa's Black-led government of being anti-white, repeated a claim this weekend in a social media post that some of the country's political figures are “actively promoting white genocide.” Afrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa more than 300 years ago. Since Trump's executive order, the South African government has sought to dispel what it says is misinformation over white farmers, who are sometimes victims of violent attacks in their homes. There were a total of 6,953 homicides across South Africa during that same time period, according to the police statistics.</p>

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, according to Palestinian medics. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Lawyer Lea Tsemel told the Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones. The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by AP disputed.</p>

TOKYO (AP) — A controversial South Korean church with powerful political connections faces dissolution in Japan after a Tokyo court ordered a revokation of its legal status after the government accused it of manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families. The Unification Church has faced hundreds of lawsuits in Japan from families who say that it manipulated members into draining their savings to make donations, but for decades it largely escaped official scrutiny and maintained close links with the governing Liberal Democratic Party. The church is perhaps best known for mass weddings where it paired off couples, often from different countries, and renewed the vows of those already married, at places like stadiums and gymnasiums. Two earlier case involved criminal charges — the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud. The church has developed relations with conservative world leaders including U.S. presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.</p>

Israeli legislators have given their approval to the 2025 state budget, a key test for Benjamin Netanyahu's fragile coalition government that would be at risk of collapse if the vote didn't go his way and snap elections were called. Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians left a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they were being held on Tuesday. It highlights the parallel realities in which the two friends live - Abraham with his yellow Israeli number plate that lets him travel anywhere, while Adra is confined to a territory that only ever gets smaller for Palestinians, despite it being their homeland. We all approached this budget with a great sense of mission and responsibility,” said finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.</p>

South Sudan's President Salva Kiir, right, and Vice President Riek Machar, left, attend a Holy Mass led by Pope Francis at the John Garang Mausoleum in Juba, South Sudan Sunday, Feb. 5, 2023. South Sudan's president Salva Kiir, left, and vice-president Riek Machar, right, shake hands after meetings in Juba, South Sudan, on Oct. 20, 2019, to discuss outstanding issues to the peace deal. Calling the situation unfolding in the country “dire,” Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage “and put the interests of their people ahead of their own.” More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. “Given this grim situation,” he said, “we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.”</p>

Five wildfires were 88 percent contained on average as of Tuesday morning local time, according to a government news release. One has been completely contained, and the largest — which has burned more than 31,000 acres near population centers that are home to more than 200,000 people — was 55 percent contained. The largest fire was threatening Uiseong, forcing at least 1,550 residents to flee, Lim said. Hundreds of wildfires erupt every year, according to the country's forest service, although most are small and contained. In March 2022, fires burned more than 40,000 acres, also on the east coast, and wreaked $750 million of damage.</p>

UK Health Security Agency's tool highlights viruses and bacteria, many not yet seen in the country, that could pose biosecurity risk Oliver said UKHSA's scientists had considered “not just the fact that some of these families have got high potential to cause pandemics or epidemics, but also where there are currently gaps in the availability of either diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, or where there are evolving and growing changes around antimicrobial resistance, or where there is a significant sensitivity to climate change, that might mean that this threat evolves or changes more rapidly”. The document, which will be updated regularly, does not indicate which pathogens UKHSA considers most likely to cause the next pandemic, Oliver stressed, but those most in need of increased scientific investment and study. Such a virus would have a much higher R number [indicating how contagious an infectious disease is] than the original variants of Covid – making it impossible to control by even the strictest lockdown. “That said, there are many potential kinds of novel pandemic threats – so-called Disease X – and the UKHSA report is a timely reminder that we should not put all our eggs in one basket.”</p>

Green card holders living in America may soon be required to surrender their social media accounts to the government under a new proposal by President Donald Trump administration's as part of their crackdown on immigration. Visa applicants living abroad are already required to share their social media handles with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The plan is an extension of a current policy that mandates visa applicants abroad to provide their social media handles. He cast the nation's estimated 11 million immigrants in the US illegally as the driving factor behind crime, gang violence and drug trafficking - assertions not supported by government statistics, and accused immigrants of draining US government resources and depriving citizens of jobs. Almost immediately, federal law enforcement started posting photos of the crackdown to social media: agents wore body armor and jackets emblazoned with names of multiple agencies - including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, known as ATF - during raids on immigrants without proper legal status.</p>

A routine message on Signal changed everything for Jeffrey Goldberg, an Israel-American journalist, when a connection request from Michael Waltz, national security adviser to President Donald Trump, on March 11 led him into an unexpected journey into military secrets and high-stakes strategy. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.” Goldberg, who had spent years reporting on national security matters, was shocked by the message. Journalists were rarely, if ever, invited to be part of such discussions. Goldberg had never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting before, nor had he ever heard of one being coordinated through a commercial messaging app, he wrote.</p>

But before asking what ailed her, he said this: “Interesting time to be an American, I suppose.” What comes after the revelation that someone is American, U.S. citizens overseas say, are awkward questions, pauses and euphemisms — but almost always a reference to America under Trump in 2025. “Now, that romanticized image has completely changed,” Van Horne, a Democrat, said in an email.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) on Monday announced several ‘transparency initiatives' under President Donald Trump - including a detailed explanation of its newly introduced identity verification change. Earlier this month, the SSA had announced that it will impose tighter identity verification measures starting March 31. This rule change will affect millions of Americans to verify their identity in person rather than over the phone. Dudek published a summary of select agency challenges under the titles: Treasury Offset Program (TOP) Resumption, Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification (eCBSV) Cost Reduction and Enhancements Plan, Payroll Information Exchange (PIE) Phased Implementation Plan and Strengthening Identity Assurance Across Customer Service Channels. Like other federal agencies, the SSA will also be cutting costs in what is described as an ‘efficiency' move.</p>

Ukraine's foreign minister, Adrii Sybiha, said: “Instead of making hollow statements about peace, Russia must stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians.” Sumy is just across the border from Kursk oblast where Ukrainian forces have been holding Russian territory since August 2024.

Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants. But Caracas said Saturday it had reached an agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras. In December 2023 and January 2024, India was the top buyer of Venezuelan crude oil. In January 2024, India was importing nearly half of Venezuela's total oil exports (almost 557,000 bpd for the month). Trump told reporters Monday that the 25 per cent tariff would be on top of existing rates.</p>

After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies. Han's case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. But the Constitutional Court likely won't take a deep dive into Yoon's criminal allegations, as it's only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office. While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation. Under South Korea's constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.</p>

Anti-government protesters in Turkey clashed with police on Monday amid growing demonstrations over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. Thousands of protesters rallied outside Istanbul's city hall to voice anger over what they see as a crackdown on democratic freedoms. “There is a coup against our democracy right now,” said an older male protester who also wished to remain anonymous.</p>

The incident came to light after The Atlantic reported on Monday that its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had been accidentally added to a Signal group chat that included top Trump administration officials such as Vice President J.D. Goldberg claimed that one of Hegseth's final messages before the attack “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing.” National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told Reuters that the message thread “appears to be authentic” and confirmed that an internal review had been launched into “how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.” “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials,” Hughes added, without clarifying whether national security protocols had been breached or if any disciplinary action would follow. “There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” the account labeled ‘JD Vance' said, arguing that “the strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.” In response, Hegseth agreed, stating: “I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”</p>

According to Gaza's health ministry, more than 50,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the Israel-Hamas war after hundreds more deaths were added to the casualty toll following Israel's resumption of hostilities last week in its surprise wave of airstrikes. The January ceasefire put an end to over a year of fighting that had been sparked by Hamas' 7 October, 2023, onslaught on Israel, in which militants murdered about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured 251 others.</p>

On March 14, a person identified as Vance expressed doubts about carrying out the strikes, saying he hated "bailing Europe out again," as countries there were more affected by Huthi attacks on shipping than the United States. And a person identified as "S M" -- possibly Trump advisor Stephen Miller -- argued that "if the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return." The security breach provoked outrage among Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing it as "one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time" and calling for a full investigation. And Hillary Clinton -- who was repeatedly attacked by Trump for using a private email server while she was secretary of state -- posted the Atlantic article on X along with the message: "You have got to be kidding me."

Calling the situation unfolding in the country “dire,” Nicolas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if president Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage “and put the interests of their people ahead of their own”. More than 40,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Mr Kiir and Mr Machar together in a government of national unity. Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Mr Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating “particularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players”. “Given this grim situation,” he said, “we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war”.</p>

That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration. And those plans appeared accurate when US later launched air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that matched details from the group chat. After pushback from other members of the Trump administration, Vance appears to address Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying "If you think we should do it let's go". A user with the initials MAR, whom Goldberg believes could be Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio, said "good Job Pete and your team!

Jessica Hoff, 47, was arrested on Friday in connection with the February incident, according to news agency Associated Press. As of now, prosecutors have not filed formal charges against her, according to court records. She is being represented by a public defender, whose office does not comment on cases to the media.

Twenty-two such deaths were recorded across 13 forces during the four-year period. “But what's really clear from the research and speaking with families is that in the past, in too many cases, investigators have missed obvious patterns of coercive, controlling behaviour.

President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, is facing a Senate hearing on Tuesday morning about his qualifications to run the massive retirement system, as well as his plans for the agency at a time when it has been targeted for significant job cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup. The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.

Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management.</p>

Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler said Tuesday that she is in favor of holding interest rates steady for "some time" as some economic data shows signs of softness and progress on inflation slows. The central bank last Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year. What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico. Kugler highlighted that prices of goods have started rising again after falling over the past year, which she says is "unhelpful" because it helped keep a lid on overall inflation and also impacts inflation expectations. Trump on Monday said he would like to see the Fed lower rates because inflation is coming down.</p>

Boeing (BA) wants President Trump to let it out of a guilty criminal plea agreement the jet maker reached with the Biden administration, according to a report. After Boeing and Biden's DOJ officials reached the guilty plea deal last year, they submitted it to a federal judge. But that US judge for the Northern District of Texas, Reed O'Connor, decided late last year in an order that the deal was insufficient, in part because of its terms governing the selection and conditions for a corporate monitor tasked with protecting against future fraud. In their objection filed in the Texas court, they said the DOJ made concessions to Boeing that it would not extend to any other criminal defendant. A federal judge in Illinois ruled on Monday in a separate case that former Boeing CEOs Dennis Muilenberg and Dave Calhoun, as well as Boeing suppliers, could not be held liable for negligence claims brought by families of victims killed in the 2019 Max crash.</p>

A spokesperson for KPMG told City AM: “Whilst there is a lot of market uncertainty, we continue to grow and there are opportunities to help clients to not only remain compliant but optimise their businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory environment all while finding cost-effective ways of meeting their regulatory needs.” An overview of the Big Four market, Gibson noted that firms “were able to sell themselves to lawyers with their ready made global networks, blue-chip client base, legendary organisational abilities, and gargantuan turnover.” City AM has a long read on what is next for the Big Four.</p>

One caveat that can impact those lower starting salary figures: When people change fields, they tend to take a pay cut initially. “Only about 30% of job seekers say they want to switch industries, but more than 50% of recently hired workers got their jobs in a new industry,” Pollak told me.“That suggests that workers who keep an open mind, expand their search, invest in new skills, and follow opportunity are disproportionately successful.” Click here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more</p>

"If you go back two months, people were saying that the likelihood of a recession was extremely low," Powell said. Powell's assessment of the US economic picture falls in line with what many forecasters have been saying, but it is more optimistic than other data points. In a research note to clients on Sunday, Morgan Stanley's chief global economist wrote that "all the cries about recession" are "probably" overdone. The key investor question right now is whether economic growth forecasts have come down far enough — or if they will keep moving lower and further weigh on stocks. For now, Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan tells Yahoo Finance that the current signs of slowing aren't abnormal.</p>

This unique anatomy inspired its scientific name, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, which is Greek for "two digits" and honors the Mongolian paleontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar. Other species of dinosaur, such as T. rex, had two fingers, but this marks the first time a therizinosaur has been found with fewer than three digits. The researchers think that D. tsogtbaatari may have evolved this unique hand in order to better grip vegetation, allowing for more efficient feeding. "We think many therizinosaurs may have used their hands for foraging in a 'hook-and-pull' motion, but Duonychus takes this to another level with its extreme claw structure." Additionally, Kobayashi suggested that the claws may have played other roles, such as in "defense, courtship, or even play."</p>

Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.

Wade cut off the ballhandler, Derrick White, then recovered back to Brown, forced him left and contested his shot. He was on the summer league squad that, under then-coach John Beilein, reportedly endured two-a-days in which both practice sessions lasted more than two hours. From when he was young, Wade "wanted to soak up any information that you had," Kinnamon said. "Us small-town kids, I think sometimes maybe we don't dream big enough, almost," Korn said. Yes, coaches have gone at him about being more aggressive -- though Korn himself only ever did it once, when Kansas State was trailing at halftime against its rival Kansas Jayhawks in Wade's senior year, a game it would go on to win -- but Wade's instinct to make the right plays is not a bad one, especially now that he's on a team stacked with scorers.</p>

Will Wade was agreeing to a deal with NC State hours before his McNeese Cowboys team won their first NCAA tournament game in program history. Anyone who could return the Hoosiers to glory would be an icon in Bloomington forever, but after 20+ years of disappointment, that's easier said than done. There was a reason Bennett hung it up at 55 years old: he didn't think Virginia could maintain its impressive results in the new era of college basketball, where NIL money is king. He's been known to recruit international players, and that could be a big help again if Virginia can't win bidding wars for top transfers. Medved made the NCAA tournament in three of his last four years at Colorado State, where he produced pros like David Roddy and Nique Clifford.</p>

Carter wins with speed and violence around the corner, which can be mobilized in Tennessee where there's already a prominent interior pass rusher such as DT Jeffrey Simmons. CB Jaire Alexander might be on his way out of Green Bay, and the Packers need a CB1. I think Graham can be scheme-versatile, a wrecking ball who uses leverage and technique to win on the interior despite shorter arms. I think Starks has been a victim of some draft fatigue, but he's an incredibly versatile player who went from playing on the roof at Georgia in 2023 to being more of a nickel and playing man coverage in 2024 without missing too many beats. They didn't really address the spot too heavily in free agency, but Stewart makes a lot of sense here.</p>

Sabonis attempted to contest him, but stuck his foot into Tatum's landing zone. In the 2017 Western Conference finals, Kawhi Leonard got hurt when Zaza Pachulia closed out into his landing zone, so when a defender steps under an airborne shooter, it is now considered a flagrant. Tatum has already reached 65 games, so he is eligible for an All-NBA selection. Still, Boston needs Tatum at full strength for the postseason, and ankle sprains can be tricky. For now, all Boston can do is hope that Tatum's sprain won't linger into the playoffs.</p>

These are, of course, the post-Luka Dončić Mavericks we're talking about, so there's no such thing as pure optimism. Their competition in Phoenix has won four of its past five games and is far healthier. But those who stick around will at least see a new star doing everything in his power to help their team compete. What if Davis, like Irving, suffers an injury that goes into next season while pushing for a Play-In spot the Mavericks probably shouldn't even want? What if the adductor strain that kept him out for a good chunk of this season lingers into next year?</p>

Per Roberts, Betts is slated to play in Tuesday's exhibition against the Los Angeles Angels. Betts, a late scratch from Sunday's exhibition game against the Angels, told reporters, including "Dodgers Talk," that he's switched medications recently, and that he feels better except for persisting stomach issues. Indeed, Betts said earlier on Monday that he'd been unable to keep down solid food and has instead subsisted off smoothies.

As she prepares to play US Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wednesday's quarter-final, BBC Sport analyses how Raducanu is thriving without a full-time coach. What Raducanu describes as a "different approach" has brought an emphasis on having fun at the right times, with shorter, less intense practice and warm-up sessions. Raducanu's father Ian secured the services of Platenik, but her results in Miami without him have left some wondering if she even needs a full-time coach. Questions have regularly been raised about Raducanu's resilience, given the amount of injuries and issues she has dealt with since her US Open win. Henman points to Raducanu playing more tournaments - even though she lost six of nine matches before the Miami Open - as a reason behind her improved durability.</p>
