President facing calls to remove senior security officials over app blunder that saw Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg added to highly-sensitive group chat by mistake

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

President Donald Trump has come under fire after it emerged on Monday that senior officials in his administration, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance, reportedly discussed a highly sensitive operation aimed at targeting Houthi positions in Yemen in a Signal group chat to which Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic, was added by mistake.

Asked about the staggering security breach, Trump said that he backs Waltz despite calls for his resignation, saying he has “learned his lesson” over the fiasco.

Hegseth has meanwhile called Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist” but he too is facing calls to step down from Democrats, who have branded the scandal “a major screw-up.”

Particularly incensed was former U.S. secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, whom Trump repeatedly threatened to jail for allegedly using a private email account while in office, who responded by saying simply: “You have got to be kidding me.”

Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are currently appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss worldwide threats and will be grilled on the leak.

U.S. consumer confidence fell for the fourth straight month as Americans' anxiety about their financial futures declined to a 12-year low amid rising concern over tariffs and inflation.

The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9. Analysts were expecting a decline to a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.

The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.

The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession in the next year held steady at a nine-month high, the board reported.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not respond to a question today about his inclusion in the Signal group chat.

Donald Trump's administration is refusing to answer any questions from a federal judge about deportation flights to El Salvador's notorious prison under the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act.

Judge James Boasberg had ordered government attorneys to answer a series of questions — including when those planes left the United States and entered El Salvador — to determine whether administration officials intentionally defied his court orders, which were delivered in court and in filings hours before the planes landed March 15.

For more than a week, the judge has pushed the administration for answers and extended deadlines for a response.

Alex Woodward has been following the case.

Senator Angus King of Maine asks Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard how it's possible war plans wouldn't be deemed classified information.

Gabbard doesn't go into detail and repeats that it wasn't classified.

Watch that moment: 

A TikTok star claims that Elon Musk's lawyers probed her over a series of critical tweets amid an announcement that she is running for Congress.

Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a Gen-Z influencer who is known as Kat Abu, has declared she's “not scared of standing up” to President Donald Trump and Elon Musk after she revealed her political ambitions in Illinois's 9th District because of a “spineless” Democratic party who are failing to intervene.

Madeline Sherratt reports.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is the latest member of the Trump administration to claim that the Signal group chat on strikes against the Houthis in Yemen did not include classified information.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said similar when asked, claiming “nobody was testing war plans.”

The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg told Kaitlan Collins last night on CNN: “That's a lie. He was texting war plans, he was texting attack plans.”

India is considering cutting tariffs on more than half of U.S. imports worth $23 billion in the initial phase of a trade deal that the two countries are negotiating, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters.

This would represent the largest reduction in years, designed to ward off reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration.

The South Asian nation aims to lessen the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's retaliatory global tariffs scheduled to take effect on April 2, a threat that has shaken markets and left policymakers in a scramble, even among Western allies.

In an internal assessment, New Delhi projected that these reciprocal tariffs would affect 87% of its total exports to the United States, valued at $66 billion, according to two government sources familiar with the details.

As part of the deal, India is willing to lower tariffs on 55% of U.S. goods it imports, currently subjected to tariffs ranging from 5% to 30%, said both sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

In this category of goods, India is prepared to "significantly" reduce tariffs or even eliminate some entirely on imported goods valued at over $23 billion from the United States, one of the sources indicated.

FBI Director Kash Patel says he was only recently briefed on the Signal group chat matter and doesn't have an update on whether the FBI has launched an investigation into it.

Senator Mark Warner asks for an update by the end of the day.

Senator Mark Warner asked Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard if she participated in the group chat.

“I don't want to get into specifics...” she replied.

Warner asked: “You are not TG in this group chat?”

Gabbard replied: “I'm not going to get into the specifics... because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.”

She also said that there was no classified material shared in the group chat, to which Warner responded: “If there was no classified material, share it with the committee. You can't have it both ways.”

“Senator, I was on a Signal messaging group,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe tells Warner, confirming he was in the group chat disclosed by The Atlantic yesterday.

Ratcliffe says he was briefed by the CIA about the use of Signal “as a permissible work use.”

“My communications were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” Ratcliffe says.

Watch their exchange here: 

An Elon Musk superfan has created a music video filmed on the back of a Tesla Cybertruck that celebrates the billionaire's “master plan to save our lives.”

Alessandra Basher, who describes herself as a stay-at-home mom who “dreams” of becoming a stand-up comedian, has been mocked online for the video branded the “most cringe thing on the internet right now.”

Rhian Lubin watched so that you don't have to, but obviously do if you want a good laugh.

Pope Francis' medical team briefly considered suspending treatment, but instead decided on an aggressive course that put his organs at risk, the doctor co-ordinating his hospital care has said.

Dr Sergio Alfieri said the 88-year-old pontiff and people close to him alike understood “that he might not survive the night”, after the bronchospasm attack during which the pope inhaled vomit.

“We needed to choose whether to stop and let him go, or to push it and attempt with all of the possible drugs and the treatments, taking the very high risk of damaging other organs,” Dr Alfieri told told the Milan daily Corriere della Sera.

“In the end, that is the path we chose.”

Francis was released on Sunday after 38 days of treatment for double pneumonia, under doctors' orders to observe two months of convalescence during which he should avoid large gatherings.

The pope appeared weak and frail when he greeted the crowd outside the Gemelli hospital before his discharge.

The Vatican has said it is not clear if the pope will meet with the King on a Vatican state visit next month, or any Holy Week activities leading up to Easter on April 20.

Dr Alfieri said that the pope remained “alert” throughout the February 28 ordeal and that his personal health care assistant, Massimiliano Strappetti, “who knows perfectly the pontiff's wishes”, urged them “to try everything. Don't give up”.

Dr Alfieri acknowledged that the treatment risked damaging the pope's kidneys and bone marrow, “but we continued, and his body responded to the treatments and the lung infection improved”.

The medical bulletin that night said the pope had suffered a bronchiospasm so severe that he inhaled vomit “worsening his respiratory picture”. Doctors used a non-invasive aspiration to clear his airways.

Three days later, in a second life-and-death crisis, the pope suffered a pair of acute bronchiospasms episodes. Doctors used a camera tube with a device to remove mucus plus that yielded abundant secretions.

The bulletin emphasised that the pope “always remained alert, oriented and collaborative”.

Dr Alfieri said he believed that prayers for the pope help keep him alive, something that the doctor said is backed by scientific literature.

“In this case the whole world was praying. I can say that twice the situation was lost, and then it happened like a miracle,” the doctor said, adding that “of course he was a very co-operative patient”.

A Black Sea agreement has been reached between the US and Russia, the White House says - and it also says the US "will help restore Russia's access to the world market" for certain products. Follow the latest here.

Talks between Russia, the US and Ukraine in Riyadh in recent days have centred on the Black Sea - particularly on a deal to secure shipping there that collapsed more than 18 months ago.

In recent days, we have covered here how Moscow was said to be keen to revive a UN-backed deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its ports without being attacked, known as the Black Sea grain initiative.

The deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain via its southern ports.

How did deal benefit Russia?

The deal also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports, but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement.

This meant Russia stopped granting safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine, and the country's grain exports subsequently slumped. 

Since then, though, Russia's priorities have changed.

Under today's ceasefire at sea, Russia would once again be able to export farm produce and fertiliser through the Black Sea, getting relief from sanctions imposed by Western countries.

The US even referred to helping Russia access the world market again for agricultural products, in its statement earlier.

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke has also explained today that Russia is only agreeing to deals in its favour.

Russia is happy to continue fighting on land, where it is slowlg making gains, while signing up to something that protects its ships at sea - where Ukraine has been growing in confident and damaging Russian vessels.

Russia will be quite happy dragging the US through peace talks without making any meaningful concessions, says security analyst Michael Clarke. 

Today's outcome is another, like the 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire, that the US "can boast about" that doesn't massively change anything on the ground for Ukraine. 

"The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes and they'll present little gains for the US," he explains.

"But they won't address the central issue," he says. 

No real deal can be agreed unless Donald Trump starts putting meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin. 

"Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on."

He also says Trump will stay interested until it "gets difficult", at which point he'll "just go onto something else".

"He's a disrupter, but when disruption becomes hard to follow through, he goes on to the next topic, and I think that's what will happen."

Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov say it has agreed to "ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea".

This comes after the White House said Russia has agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea.

Ukraine and US delegations have been holding talks in Saudi Arabia today.

Umerov adds Kyiv holds that any movement by Russian military vessels outside of eastern part of the Black Sea will constitute violation of the spirit of this agreement.

"In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence."

In similar wording to the statement issued by the White House, he adds: "All parties agreed to develop measures for implementing the Presidents' agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Ukraine and Russia."

Some new details are just coming out of the White House now.

They have said the US and Russia have agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea, which had been a key focus of talks this week.

Additionally, they agreed to work together on measures banning strikes on energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine.

Significantly, Washington will also help to restore Russia's access to global markets for agricultural and fertiliser exports, the White House added. Where this leaves Western sanctions against Russia is unclear at this stage.

With Ukraine, the US said it has agreed it will remain committed to returning forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

The White House statement on Russia in full:

The United States and Russia have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.

The United States will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions. 

The United States and Russia agreed to develop measures for implementing President Trump's and President Putin's agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine. 

The United States and Russia welcome the good offices of third countries with a view toward supporting the implementation of the energy and maritime agreements. 

The United States and Russia will continue working toward achieving a durable and lasting peace.
 
The United States reiterated President Donald J. Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict must stop, as the necessary step toward achieving an enduring peace settlement.

To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh. 

The United States expresses gratitude to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his leadership and hospitality in once again facilitating these important discussions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Ukraine's security agency has detained a serviceman it's accused of helping Russia.

The SBU said this "mole" worked to give away Ukrainian soldiers' positions during the fighting over Kursk, the Russian region Kyiv's forces invaded last summer.

Since then, Russia has taken back much of its territory, particularly in recent weeks.

"While at the front, the 'mole' was preparing coordinates for the aggressor's missile and bomb attacks on the locations of Ukrainian troops," the SBU said.

It said the man had been recruited by Moscow's GRU intelligence service through social media messaging app Telegram, where he had posted comments in support of Russia.

According to a US intelligence report, Russia is working on a new satellite to carry a nuclear weapon.

Such a weapon could have "devastating consequences" for both the US and the world, the Annual Threat Assessment by the US intelligence community added.

It also added the war in Ukraine has given Russia a chance to learn a "wealth of lessons" about Western weapons and intelligence.

While Moscow will not be able to achieve "total victory", the report added momentum remains on their side in the Ukraine war.

For context: Military analyst Michael Clarke explained in our live Q&A earlier that nuclear war is not any more likely now than it was before Russia's invasion.

This is partly because nuclear weapons wouldn't give Russia any advantage on the battlefield. You can catch up on his insight in the link below...

We're back now from our live Q&A with Michael Clarke - link in the post below.

You can catch up on a range of issues he addressed there, but we'll share some insight with you here now, given there's been so much focus on ceasefire talks in Saudi Arabia this week.

Asked if the return of a Black Sea deal would give Russia's navy safe passage through waters, Clarke broke down what discussions have focused on - and why they're likely to benefit Moscow more.

"The Russians are quite keen to do this because they want to get their stuff out," he said.

"At the moment, they can't get their stuff out of the Black Sea, because of the threat that the Ukrainians could pose to their ships."

There are two issues now on the table in talks, Clarke said.

These are: 

They are both more to Russia's benefit than Ukraine's, Clarke said.

"It is a very, very limited ceasefire - which gets more limited every day - of the two elements that the Russians most want," he added.

"Because they're the two elements that actually benefit them more than they benefit the Ukrainians."

And with the US going for quick negotiations, in contrast to Russia's "running-the-clock-down" approach, Clarke said it looks like Moscow is "giving the American team a complete run-around".

"They're giving them a lesson in tough diplomacy, and there are none tougher than the Russians when it comes to negotiating something on the Black Sea," Clarke added.

And don't overlook Turkey's role in this, he said, as they control the waterway connecting the Black Sea to the rest of the world.

What is this Black Sea deal?

Moscow is said to be keen to revive a UN-backed deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its ports without being attacked, known as the Black Sea grain initiative.

The deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain from its southern ports.

The deal also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports, but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement.

Military analyst Michael Clarke is with us again to answer your questions on the Ukraine war - and there's plenty to get through.

He'll be covering topics including:

Click on the link below now to follow along...

Interfax news agency has reported Russian forces have claimed two settlements in eastern Ukraine.

Those are Myrne, in the Donetsk region, and Mali Shcherbaky, in the Zaporizhzhia region.

According to that report - which cites Russia's defence ministry - the two settlements in the map below are the locations taken by Moscow's forces.

Something worth noting as uproar over the extraordinary war plans leak continues - Donald Trump's key envoy was in the infamous group chat while he was in the Kremlin.

Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, visited Moscow on 13 March, when he appeared to be in the group chat on encrypted chat platform Signal.

A journalist was accidentally added to that chat on the same day, with Witkoff's name appearing among the list of other users there.

As our US correspondent James Matthews points out in the post below, Washington's allies will be wondering what other classified material is discussed in group chats.

It's likely the fact Witkoff was in Moscow when this text chain was already formed won't ease concerns.

Russia and Ukraine agreed separately in talks that concluded Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to avoid military strikes on vessels in the Black Sea, the White House said.

In parallel statements, the White House said that each country "agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it has made separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban strikes against energy facilities in the two countries.

The White House said in a statement that Washington would help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports and would continue facilitating talks on both sides in a bid toward achieving a sustainable peace.

        Criticism by Denmark's leader Mette Frederiksen comes after the White House announced a US delegation would be visiting the Arctic island.
    

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen criticised the US on Tuesday for putting "unacceptable pressure" on Greenland, ahead of an unsolicited visit to the Arctic island by members of the Trump administration. 

A delegation from Washington including Second Lady Usha Vance, wife of US Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright is set to visit semi-autonomous Danish territory from Thursday until Sunday.

"I have to say that it is unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark in this situation. And it is pressure that we will resist," Frederiksen told Danish media.

"You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country."

US President Donald Trump on Monday repeated his desire to take over Greenland, using national security as a justification. He said that the upcoming visit was about "friendliness, not provocation".

However, Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede on Monday called the visit "highly aggressive". He said that there would be no official meetings with the US representatives as the island has just held elections, with a new government yet to be formed. 

Egede, who will remain in his post until a new government convenes, wrote on Facebook that there was worry on the island over the visits. 

The "only purpose" of a trip by Waltz is "a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood," Egede said. 

Frederiksen referred to Egede's comments in her interview on Tuesday, saying that it was "clear that when you make a visit in this way, and the Greenlandic politicians clearly say that they do not want the visit, you cannot interpret it as respectful."

“It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs, or what Greenland wants,” the Danish leader concluded. 

Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time US ally that has rejected Trump's overtures. Copenhagen has recognised the island's right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Last month, JD Vance blasted Denmark for "not doing its job" and "not being a good ally" by not countering the Chinese use of sea lanes in the region. 

"So you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?" JD Vance told Fox News. "If that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do."

During the US delegation's visit to Greenland, Usha Vance and one of her three children will "visit historic sites" and "learn about Greenlandic heritage", according to her office. 

A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that it "should not be a surprise" that Waltz and Wright would visit "a US Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground," referring to the US Pituffik military space base in northern Greenland.

Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, says the governing body feels the mandatory tests for athletes are "a really important way of providing confidence".

World Athletics will introduce mandatory testing for anyone entering female competitions to verify their biological sex, insisting it is necessary to protect women's sport.

It is the latest move overseen by Sebastian Coe - as president of the governing body - to address the gender eligibility issue, two years after banning anyone assigned male at birth from female events.

Lord Coe said after a World Athletics Council meeting today that they could adopt non-invasive cheek swab tests or dry blood tests that only have to be carried out once on an athlete.

"This we feel is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition," he said.

The tests would seek to verify if someone has transitioned to a female after going through male puberty or if they had differences of sex development that provided testosterone advantages.

Testing providers are now being sought.

Lord Coe said: "The pre-clearance testing will be for athletes to be able to compete in the female category.

"The process is very straightforward frankly, very clear and it's an important one and we will work on the timelines.

"Neither of these are invasive. They are necessary and they will be done to absolute medical standards."

Sebastian Coe's mission has become - in his view - protecting the integrity of women's sport.

Having banned transgender women from women's events overseen by World Athletics, any competitors with differences of sex development will also be prohibited from competing alongside those who were female at birth.

Lord Coe believes he is trying to prevent any unfair performance advantage gained by anyone who has gone through male puberty.


And his solution to verifying eligibility is sex testing - part of the Olympics in the last century.

He insists the new swab tests for all female athletes will be non-intrusive, checking if there's any presence of the SRY gene that is typically found on the Y chromosome.


But Alun Williams, of the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport, is part of a group of global academics expressing concern that the initial genetic test could lead to clinical examinations of bodies.

The new tests, though, could be in place in time for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September and be a requirement for every female competitor.

Will the tests be adopted by other sports that have already banned transgender women from women's events?

And, ultimately, under pressure from Donald Trump, will they be widespread for 2028 LA Olympics hopefuls?

It follows US President Donald Trump, ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, saying there are only two sexes - male and female - while calling on sports to ban transgender women from women's events.

The International Olympic Committee has previously called a return to sex testing a "bad idea", but incoming IOC President Kirsty Coventry is not ruling it out, having also talked about protecting the female category.

"This is a conversation that's happened and the international federations have taken a far greater lead in this conversation," she told Sky News after her election last week.

"What I was proposing is to bring a group together with the international federations and really understand each sport is slightly different.

"We know in equestrian, sex is really not an issue, but in other sports it is.

"So what I'd like to do again is bring the international federations together and sit down and try and come up with a collective way forward for all of us to move."

Reem Alsalem, the UN's special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, last year called on the IOC to reintroduce sex testing for female athletes to protect them from injuries amid concerns about eligibility.

The IOC introduced "certificates of femininity" at the 1968 Mexico Games. But those chromosome-based tests were deemed unscientific and unethical and dropped ahead of Sydney 2000.

A former New York Yankees player and his wife say they have “many questions” and “few answers” after their youngest son fell ill and died during a family vacation.

Miller Gardner – the son of Brett and Jessica Gardner – was 14.

Miler Gardner died in his sleep on Friday morning, according to a statement from the couple that was released by the Yankees on Sunday. Costa Rica's judicial investigation agency reportedly told NBC News that the boy seemingly died by asphyxia “after a possible intoxication after apparently ingesting some food”.

The cause of death was preliminary, and officials are awaiting an autopsy and an analysis of toxicology testing results, NBC reported.

Miller Gardner's body was found in a hotel room in the popular Costa Rican resort area of Manuel Antonio, on the country's Pacific coast.

The Gardners' statement said their family had “so many questions and so few answers at this point”.

“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” Jessica and Brett Gardner said in the release. “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

The Yankees said their organization was “filled with grief”.

“Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss,” a statement from the team said. “It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years – so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”

Brett Gardner, 41, was drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and spent his entire Major League Baseball career – from 2008 to 2021 – with the organization. The outfielder helped the Yankees win a World Series championship in 2009, and was a popular figure in the clubhouse and with the team's fans.

Academics from US hoping to escape funding freezes and ideological impositions are being actively recruited

Laced with terms such as “censorship” and “political interference”, the Belgium-based jobs advert was far from typical. The promise of academic freedom, however, hinted at who it was aimed at: researchers in the US looking to flee the funding freezes, cuts and ideological impositions ushered in by Donald Trump's administration.

“We see it as our duty to come to the aid of our American colleagues,” said Jan Danckaert, the rector of Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), in explaining why his university – founded in 1834 to safeguard academia from the interference of church or state – had decided to open 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, with a particular focus on Americans.

“American universities and their researchers are the biggest victims of this political and ideological interference,” Danckaert said in a statement. “They're seeing millions in research funding disappear for ideological reasons.”

The university is among a handful of institutions across Europe that have begun actively recruiting US researchers, offering themselves as a haven for those keen to escape the Trump administration's crackdown on research and academia.

Since Trump took power in late January, researchers in the US have faced a multipronged attack. Efforts to slash government spending have left thousands of employees bracing for layoffs, including at institutions such as Nasa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US's pre-eminent climate research agency. The government's targeting of “wokeism” has meanwhile sought to root out funding for research deemed to involve diversity, certain kinds of vaccines and any mention of the climate crisis.

In France, the director of the prestigious Pasteur Institute in Paris, Yasmine Belkaid, said it was already working to recruit people from across the Atlantic for work in fields such as infectious diseases or the origins of disease.

“I receive daily requests from people who want to return: French, European or even Americans who no longer feel able to do their research or are afraid to do it freely,” Belkaid told the French newspaper La Tribune. “You might call it a sad opportunity, but it is an opportunity, all the same.”

The sentiment was echoed by France's minister for higher education and research, Philippe Baptiste, in a recent letter that called on research institutions to send in proposals on how best to attract talent from the US. “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the US,” he said. “Naturally, we wish to welcome a certain number of them.”

On Thursday, the Netherlands said it was aiming to swiftly launch a fund to attract researchers to the country.

While the fund would be open to people of all nationalities, the country's education minister, Eppo Bruins, hinted at the tensions that have gripped US academia in announcing the plans.

“There is currently a great global demand for international top scientific talent. At the same time, the geopolitical climate is changing, which is increasing the international mobility of scientists,” Bruins said in a letter to parliament.

“Several European countries are responding to this with efforts to attract international talent,” he added. “I want the Netherlands to remain at the vanguard of these efforts.”

The Dutch effort comes after France's Aix-Marseille University said it had set up a programme – titled Safe Place for Science – that would put aside funding for more than two dozen researchers from the US for three years.

“We wish we didn't have to do this,” said Éric Berton, the university's president. “We're not looking to attract researchers. But we were quite indignant about what was happening and we felt that our colleagues in the US were going through a catastrophe … we wanted to offer some sort of scientific asylum to those whose research is being hindered.”

Two weeks after the programme was launched there have been about 100 applications, with researchers from Yale, Nasa and Stanford among those who have expressed interest. The university continues to receive about 10 applications a day, said Berton, many of them from researchers involved in studying climate, health or social sciences.

Berton said he hoped universities across Europe would join his in providing a safe space for researchers. “I think that we need to realise the historic moment we're living through and the serious, long-term consequences this could have,” he said. “Europe must rise to the occasion.”

At VUB, the opening of the 12 postdoctoral positions was also aimed at acknowledging the global impact of Trump's crackdown. Two research projects in which the university was involved – one delving into youth and disinformation and another investigating the transatlantic dialogue between the US and Europe – had been cancelled due to “changed policy priorities”, it said.

For the university in Brussels, the openings were also a vindication of sorts. In a 2016 interview with Fox News, Trump had sought to characterise life in Brussels as akin to “living in a hellhole”, falsely accusing migrants in the city of failing to assimilate.

“At the time, the statement elicited many emotional reactions in Europe,” the university said. “This gives additional symbolic meaning to the VUB initiative.”

Mette Frederiksen says trip by members of the Trump administration ‘not what Greenland needs or wants'

Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has accused the US of putting “unacceptable pressure” on Greenland – which she has vowed to resist – before an unsolicited visit to the Arctic island by members of the Trump administration.

The White House surprised Nuuk and Copenhagen on Sunday by announcing that a US delegation led by the second lady, Usha Vance, would be arriving in Greenland later this week.

Also due to participate in the visit from Thursday to Saturday are the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, now embroiled in an embarrassing security leak, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright.

“I have to say that it is unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark in this situation. And it is pressure that we will resist,” Frederiksen told Danish channel TV 2 on Tuesday.

The Danish leader also dismissed the idea of the trip being a private visit, saying: “You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.”

Trump's threats to acquire Greenland, she said, should be taken seriously. “President Trump is serious … He wants Greenland. Therefore, it cannot be seen independently of anything else,” she told Danmarks Radio (DR).

She said: “It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs or what Greenland wants from a visit. Therefore, no matter how we twist it, it is a completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, the Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population, but it is also on Denmark and thus the kingdom.”

Copenhagen, Greenland's former colonial ruler, retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, which is still part of the kingdom of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire for the US to gain control over the island, which he has said is crucial for American security.

Greenland's prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, has accused Washington of “foreign interference” in relation to the planned visit, amid political uncertainty in the territory as coalition talks continue less than a fortnight after a general election.

The US president responded by saying the delegation had been invited by “officials” on the Greenlandic side. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he told reporters on Monday.

The Nuuk government, however, disputed that. “For the record, the Greenlandic government has not issued any invitations for visits, either official or private,” it said in a statement. “The current government is acting as an interim government pending the formation of a new coalition, and we have kindly requested all countries to respect this process.”

The territory is led by a caretaker government as the Greenlandic Democrats continue with coalition talks following an election earlier this month. On Monday, Greenland's most US and Trump-friendly party, Naleraq, left negotiations over their belief that Greenland should rapidly declare independence.

Kuno Fencker, a member of parliament for Naleraq, which came second to the Democrats in the election, said the party had been “thrown out” of coalition talks, in part because of the upcoming US visit.

“It has an effect because many of the members think that we, especially me, are selling the country to the US,” he said, adding that it was not in his authority to do so.

Accusing the Danish media of “fear-mongering” over the US and Trump, he said: “Divide and rule is being used extremely towards Greenland and fear-mongering about the United States. And especially Donald Trump is framed as the big villain, big bad wolf, here.”

The White House has said Waltz and Wright will visit the US space force base in Pituffik, in the north of Greenland, for briefings from US personnel, and they are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog-sled race.

The White House National Security Council has said the delegation aimed to “learn about Greenland, its culture, history and people”.

Major security leak sparks calls for investigations. Plus, Tesla's European sales drop 44%

Good morning.

A major security leak is triggering bipartisan outrage after the Atlantic revealed that senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.

According to the Atlantic, the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally invited into a Signal chat group with more than a dozen senior Trump administration officials – including the vice-president, JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and others.

The group discussed secret military plans for recent US attacks on the Houthi armed group in Yemen.

The leak has shocked people across the political spectrum. The minority Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, called it “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time”. He urged Republicans to seek a full investigation.

What did Hegseth say? On Monday Hegseth said that “nobody was texting war plans” and attacked Goldberg as “deceitful and highly discredited” without refuting any specifics from the Atlantic story.

An appeals court judge claimed on Monday that Nazis were given more rights to contest their removal from the United States during the second world war than Venezuelan migrants deported by the Trump administration.

The comments came during a contentious hearing shortly after a lower court thwarted the Trump administration's effort to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court rejected its use and ruled accused migrants must get hearings first.

What does the administration claim? That the Alien Enemies Act, which permits deportation of foreign nationals during wars or invasions, is applicable because the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua's activities constitute an “invasion”. But they have not provided solid evidence that those deported are even gang members: one is a 23-year-old gay makeup artist with no apparent gang affiliations.

Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 65 people in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including women, children and two journalists, the Palestinian health authority said on Monday, nearly a week after Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas.

Palestinians in Gaza have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel launched its new offensive in the territory, which started on Tuesday last week with a wave of airstrikes that killed about 700 people, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the territory run by Hamas – ending two months of relative calm in which many had returned north to their damaged homes.

How many people have been killed in the war? The Gaza health ministry said at least 50,082 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 had been wounded since the beginning of the war, which began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.

And how many journalists? More than 170 journalists and media workers have been killed since October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), whose director said in a statement: “This nightmare in Gaza has to end. The international community must act fast to ensure that journalists are kept safe and hold Israel to account.”

The discovery of underground ovens and 200 pairs of shoes in what activists call an “extermination camp” has horrified Mexico, sparking protests and spotlighting the more than 120,000 people registered as missing.

Ukraine has accused Moscow of making “hollow statements about peace” after 88 people were injured in a Russian missile attack, as US and Russian officials began talks in Saudi Arabia.

Turkish authorities arrested more than 1,100 people, including journalists, after tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests.

Swedish shoppers boycotted major supermarkets for seven days, protesting over “runaway” food price rises.

Tesla car sales slumped in Europe last month, reflecting a backlash over Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. The carmaker sold fewer than 16,000 vehicles across Europe last month, down 44%, according to Jato Dynamics. Meanwhile, police in Texas said they found and seized “incendiary devices” at a Tesla dealership in Austin yesterday.

It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers: why can't people remember early childhood? Freud called the phenomenon infantile amnesia, and for many years scientists wondered whether it resulted from trouble in creating or retrieving memories. Now, research appears to suggest an answer.

US honeybee deaths have hit record highs, with some commercial beekeepers reporting the loss of 60% of their colonies on average over winter, a survey found. It's pushing many beekeepers close to ruin. “There's no one single thing affecting honeybees but we are trying to figure out what the most important stresses are right now,” said Scott McArt, a Cornell associate professor.

Derek Harris has lived in Sharrington, England, for 50 years. In January he heard that the telecoms firm BT would be withdrawing the village's telephone box. But he and other campaigners argued it was an “iconic heritage asset,” and vital to combat poor phone signal. Yesterday, BT backtracked: the village's red box will stay connected.

            The medical staff looking after Pope Francis considered stopping his treatment so he could die, according to the lead doctor, after the 88-year-old pontiff was hospitalized with a drawn-out respiratory illness.
    


            Professor Sergio Alfieri told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera the most critical moment came on February 28 when the pope had a breathing crisis and inhaled his own vomit.
    


            “We had to choose whether to stop and let him go or force it and try with all the drugs and therapies possible, running the very high risk of damaging other organs. And in the end, we took this path,” Alfieri said.

            Alfieri, who led the team at Rome's Gemelli hospital, said the decision to continue with treatment was made by Francis' nurse. “The Holy Father always decides. He delegated all kinds of health care choices to Massimiliano Strappetti, his personal health care assistant who knows perfectly well the Pontiff's wishes.”
    


            He reportedly told Alfieri: “Try everything, we won't give up. That's what we all thought too. And no one gave up.”
    


            Francis left the hospital on March 23 after 38 days in hospital, the longest since his election as pope 12 years ago. The pontiff had a number of breathing crises during his time in hospital, with Alfieri previously saying that two of them put the pope's life in danger.
    


            During his stay the Vatican provided an extraordinary level of detail about Francis' condition.
    


            Alfieri said this was the pope's decision and that the Vatican's bulletins were prepared by the medical team with some additions from Francis' personal secretaries.
    


            “From the first day he asked us to tell him the truth and he wanted us to tell the truth about his condition… nothing was ever changed or omitted.”
    


            Francis has returned to his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he will receive treatment including mobility and respiratory-related physiotherapy, especially for voice recovery, and engage in personal prayer, according to the Vatican.



            Doctors also advised the pope to have 24-hour medical assistance, including oxygen therapy, and in case of any emergencies.
    


            The pope will return to work gradually. He has shown determination to recover, resuming some duties and signing documents. Francis has not led the Angelus prayer for the past seven Sundays, but has still offered reflections every week – most recently calling for “peace” in war-torn regions.
    


            “You have continued to pray for me with so much patience and perseverance. Thank you so much. I also pray for you,” he said in a post on X on Sunday. “Let us pray together for peace, especially in martyred Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.”

President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, a day after it was revealed that he added the editor-in-chief of Atlantic magazine to a chat group where top US national security officials discussed plans about attacking the Houthis in Yemen earlier this month.

In an interview with NBC News on Tuesday, Trump called Waltz “a good man,” adding that he “has learned a lesson.”

The President further stated that the outcome of the March 15 airstrikes, which he called “perfectly successful,” was not affected at all following the inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg in a Signal group. The group also included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

He pointed out that it was the “only glitch in two months” following his presidency, “and it turned out not to be a serious one.”

Trump's remarks come after White House issued a new statement on Tuesday over the alleged blunder. Earlier, the National Security Council stated that The Atlantic's story seemed to be a “authentic message chain.”

Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary for the White House, said: “Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

Taking to X, she even shared three “facts about his latest story”.

According to Leavitt, the White House Counsel's Office has given advice on different channels for Trump's top officials to interact “as safely and efficiently as possible.” She also noted that no “war plans” were discussed or secret data was sent to the thread.

Citing the National Security Council, she said that the White House is conducting an investigation into how Goldberg's number was accidentally added to the thread.

“Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,” she added.

Meanwhile, Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are demanding Waltz's resignation following alleged “outrageous national security breach.”

“We need a full investigation and hearing into this on the House Armed Services Committee, ASAP,” the Democrat added.

Following The Atlantic's story, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, blasted the magazine and told reporters that “nobody was texting war plans.”

He called Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.”

A disturbing video has surfaced of a woman being brutally attacked on a crowded train platform in Calgary, Canada, with bystanders failing to intervene. The footage has gone viral, sparking widespread outrage and allegations of racism, as the victim appears to be of Indian descent. 

The footage shows the man, identified as Braydon Joseph James French, grabbing the woman's jacket, repeatedly shaking her. He then grabbed her water bottle, splashed water on her face, slammed her into transit shelter walls, and demanded her phone while violently shaking her. The assailant fled the scene without taking her phone, allowing the woman to contact the authorities. Bystanders witnessed the attack but failed to intervene.

Here's the video:

A post shared by The Canada Punjabi (@thecanadapunjabi)



According to a police statement on social media, an incident occurred on Sunday at approximately 1:40 p.m. at the 3 Street SE CTrain station platform. Calgary authorities reported that the assailant was apprehended within 30 minutes, thanks to witness assistance.



"As a result, Braydon Joseph James FRENCH, 31, of Calgary, has been charged with 1 count of attempted robbery. At this time, the incident is not believed to be racially motivated, however, our Diversity Resource Team is engaging with those in the community who are impacted by this incident," a tweet by Calgary police read.

"Thanks to the support of witnesses in the area and to the swift actions of our members, we were able to arrest within 25 minutes of this incident. These types of incidents cause concern in the community & will not be tolerated in our city," CPS District 1 commander, Inspector Jason Bobrowich said. 

The Calgary police have offered support to the victim, who is now requesting privacy as she deals with the aftermath of the incident. Although police currently don't believe the attack was racially motivated, their Diversity Resource Team is still reaching out to the affected community to address concerns and provide support.

Reacting to the video, one user wrote, "Funny the whole conversation would be to deport if it was the other way around. How about whoever does the crime, does the time. Fair on both ends."

Another commented, "Sadly if people intervene they end getting in trouble. I once stopped a person from targeting an old man & when the police got there I was the one who being told I should've stood to the side & just call the police."

        Senior figures have expressed disbelief and outrage after a journalist revealed that he was sent sensitive information about military strikes in Yemen.
    

Senior figures in the Democratic party have called for the resignation of US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after he sent war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a Signal group chat that included a journalist.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that the material shared "contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing". 

The US National Security Council stated that the text chain "appears to be authentic". 

Two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on 15 March, the US launched a wave of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. 

The revelation, with its clear implications for national security, has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and political circles, and many have called for investigations into how the blunder came about, while others have called for disciplinary action.

The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, led calls for Hegseth's resignation, calling for him to "be fired" if he did not quit. In his statement, Martin blasted Hegseth as "unfit to lead the Defence Department even before he risked our national security". 

"Hegseth should resign, and if he doesn't resign, he should be fired. It's crystal clear that our men and women in uniform deserve better – and that our national security cannot be left in Hegseth's incompetent and unqualified hands," Martin added.

Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the leak on a non-classified system as "completely outrageous and shocks the conscience", adding that it shows that Americans are increasingly angry "due to the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defence."

In his statement, Jeffries called for House Republicans to join Democrats "in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach.” Separately, Jeffries told reporters that Hegseth "has got to be the most unqualified person ever to lead the Pentagon in American history".

Stressing the gravity of the situation in a floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: “This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time." 

He underlined that using encrypted instant messaging service Signal, rather than government communications channels, was even more concerning than the leak to The Atlantic.

"It's bad enough that a private citizen was added to this chain, but it's far worse that sensitive military information was exchanged on an unauthorised application," Schumer explained.

It has also drawn reaction from former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose use of a private server for classified emails while Secretary of State became a major scandal during her 2016 campaign, with President Donald Trump repeatedly returning to the issue. 

“You have got to be kidding me,” Clinton responded in a post on X while sharing the eyes emoji and The Atlantic article.

Reaction from Republicans appeared more mixed, with many seeking to downplay the incident. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana was among those offering a lukewarm response. 

“A mistake was made. It happens,” Kennedy told media. Other figures in the party recognised the blunder, but refused to call for repercussions for those involved.

But Senate Armed Services Committee Chair, Roger Wicker, was among those telling reporters that "mistakes were made". 

“We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis,” the Mississippi Republican senator said, adding that the panel “definitely” plans to investigate the situation. 

Meanwhile, The Hill reported that Republican Senator John Cornyn, of Texas, a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters at the Capitol on Monday the inclusion of a journalist in the chat was “a huge screwup".

“I mean, is there any other way to describe it," he added.

The White House on Tuesday insisted that no classified material was sent on a chat between senior officials about strikes on Yemen that was accidentally shared with a journalist.

“No war plans were discussed,” President Donald Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. “No classified material was sent to the thread.”

The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in an article, claimed that he was inadvertently invited into a group chat where top US officials planned for strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels.

While Trump informed the public about the strikes on March 15, Goldberg claimed that he knew about them hours earlier as he was part of the chat, which included US defense secretary Pete Hegseth and vice president JD Vance.

Top Democrats were quick to condemn the incident, describing it as a major security breach and calling for an investigation to determine how it happened.

On Tuesday, Leavitt said that the White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on several different platforms for Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.

She also criticised Jeffrey Goldberg, saying that the magazine editor is “well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

“Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed, and that's what matters most to President Trump,” Karoline Leavitt added.

Earlier today, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he was unaware of the incident. "I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic," Trump said.

 

Jeffrey Goldberg said he was unexpectedly invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the “Houthi PC small group”.

The editor claims that hours before those military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15, defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan in the messaging group, “including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing”.

He added that US officials in the group also debated whether the US should carry out the strikes, and at one point Vance appeared to question whether US allies in Europe, more exposed to shipping disruption in the region, deserved US help.

The grandparents of a French toddler who went missing nearly two years ago have been arrested on suspicion of his murder, prosecutors said Tuesday.

Two-year-old Émile Soleil disappeared from his grandparents' garden in Le Haut-Vernet, a hamlet in the French Alps, in July 2023. Nine months after his disappearance, his remains were discovered by a hiker near the village.

Now the long investigation into the toddler's death has taken a shocking turn with four individuals — including Émile's grandparents and two of their adult children — being taken into police custody.

Emile's grandfather Philippe Vedovini and his wife, who was not named by the prosecutor, were arrested in the commune of La Bouilladisse on suspicion of “voluntary homicide” and “concealing a corpse,” according to a statement by the Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor.

Emile's disappearance gripped the nation as long and widespread searches yielded nothing. His parents were absent on the day he vanished. At the time they told a Christian website they still hoped for a miracle.

The case also sparked media attention, particularly surrounding Émile's grandfather, who, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, was questioned by police in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school. But police had considered his involvement as only one possible explanation behind the boy's tragic death.

Earlier this month, investigators returned to Le Vernet, with forensic teams combing through “several spots in the area.” The prosecutor confirmed that forensic operations are still ongoing in various locations, with new developments expected as the investigation unfolds.

CNN has reached out to the grandparents' lawyer.

French actor Gerard Depardieu has acknowledged that he used crude and heated language around a woman who accuses him of sexual assault and grabbed her hips but denied assaulting her, as he gave evidence for the first time at his trial in Paris.

She told the court that he had behaved “like a madman” who took “pleasure in frightening me”.

The second day of the Paris trial centred on the Oscar-nominated actor's behaviour during the filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.

The 76-year-old has denied assaulting the women.

But during more than an hour of evidence on Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualised language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.

Depardieu said he had been in a “bad mood” because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.

“I understand perfectly if she's a bit upset,” he said. “I don't have to talk like that, get angry like that, voila.”

But he insisted that he is not a sexual predator.

“I'm not touching the butts of women,” Depardieu said.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (£62,000) if convicted. The verdict is not expected immediately after the trial.

The set dresser gave evidence after Depardieu. She described the alleged assault in detail.

She said he grabbed her hips then started “palpating” her behind and “in front, around”. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.

“That's when I had a reflex of ‘My God'. I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn't do it,” she said. “He terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.”

“It was very brief, there was no shouting,” she said, adding that she had been too “petrified” to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu's hands from her.

“I saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that's what I felt, it's savagery,” she said. “He terrified me, and that amused him.”

She said Depardieu's calm and co-operative attitude in court bore no resemblance to his behaviour at work.

“Here, he's exemplary, he doesn't move, he's quiet, he doesn't make any noise,” she said. “He's not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.”

On the film set “he started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities”, she told the court.

The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.

In his evidence, Depardieu said he had noticed that the set dresser had been taken aback by his behaviour and language. He acknowledged that his behaviour can be boorish.

“I've always been told I have a Russian nature, I don't know if it's because of the drinking or the vulgarity,” he said. “I have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.”

French star actor Gerard Depardieu, on trial for sexual assault, told the Paris court Tuesday that he was not in the habit of "groping" women, and called the #MeToo movement a "reign of terror."He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement, which he told the court Tuesday "will become a reign of terror".

Gerard Depardieu is more than just a household name in France.

Two women have accused the French actor of assault on the set of 'The Green Shutters' in 2021.

Actor Gérard Depardieu arrived in a Paris court on Monday for his trial over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, a case placing one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence. French actor Gérard Depardieu went on trial at a Paris court Monday charged with sexually assaulting two women during a 2021 film shoot, as his lawyer vowed to show all the accusations were "false".Depardieu has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20

Gérard Depardieu's sexual assault trial is a pivotal moment for France, testing its readiness to confront sexual violence, especially when committed by revered cultural icons in the post-MeToo era.View on euronews

In February 2025, Harvard's Center for American Political Studies published a poll showing that 46% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 in the United States supported Hamas – not the Palestinians, but Hamas.

In an October 2024 poll of Americans, Pew Research found that “adults under the age or 30 are as likely to trust information from social media as they are to trust national media outlets.” A poll two months before found that 52% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 got their political news from TikTok and 50% of users of X said that they regularly get their “news” from that platform.   What is the “news” about Jews and Israel that the “under 30s” are seeing on social media?Nonprofit antisemitism monitoring platform Cyberwell reported in late 2024 that 11 months after the October 7 attacks there had been a “36% increase in online Jew-hatred” and a “doubling in outright calls to violence against Jews.” None of this is happening by chance. The speed of which antisemitic content is created, the consistency of the messaging and the specific targeting of younger people unambiguously reflects a well thought out and well managed social media strategy. One Palestinian advocate has called this coordinated effort the “Instafada: social media as resistance.” Another noted that its strategic use of “social media….. has empowered laypeople to coordinate, take to the streets in protest, build encampment protests on universities, initiate petitions and fundraisers, disrupt politicians, stop arms factories, and revive the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign (which has ultimately affected the profits of corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's).”  Hand using mobile smartphone with icon social media and social network. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)A perfect example of this strategy in action was the campaign launched by Hamas supporters denying that Israelis were sexually assaulted during the October 7 terrorist attacks. Despite the fact that Hamas live-streamed and shared videos of women being raped, there was a massive online campaign conducted last February and March by pro-Hamas influencers and activists calling the reported sexual assaults “atrocity propaganda,” intended to distract the public from the war and to “unfairly demonize Hamas.”It is therefore no surprise that under 30s are disproportionately supporting Hamas and against something as fundamentally humanitarian as releasing the hostages.

(CNN) — Lengthy talks between the United States and Russia on a potential ceasefire in Ukraine have ended without agreement on Tuesday, Russian state news agency Interfax reported, pouring cold water on expectations that the two sides would be able to present some sort of joint statement after the marathon meeting.

Interfax quoted the first deputy chairman of the the Russian Federation Council's Defence and Security Committee, Vladimir Chizhov, as telling state TV channel Rossiya-24 that the statement was “not adopted because of Ukraine's position.”

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and seemed to agree on a joint statement, which however was not adopted due to Ukraine's position, is also very characteristic and symptomatic,” Chizhov told Russia-24, according to Interfax.

US and Russian diplomats had been widely expected to issue a joint statement on Tuesday morning. Such a statement would send a powerful signal that both Washington, DC and Moscow were serious about the ceasefire.

The US has not yet commented on the outcome of talks.

Russian and US officials met at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on Monday, the same location where the US delegation met with Ukrainian officials on Sunday.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Tuesday that Moscow was “analyzing” the results of the second round of talks between Russian and US officials. Speaking to reporters during one of his regular daily press calls, he seemed to downplay the importance of the talks, describing them as “technical.”

He also said there were currently no plans for Trump and Putin to speak, although he added that a conversation between the two leaders could be arranged “quite quickly.”

South Korean firefighters on Tuesday appeared closer to containing the largest wildfires in the country's southeastern regions, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land across the country in the past five days.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.

Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days. 

Officials in Andong, a city in the country's southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters — including schools and indoor gyms — as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries. 

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple's national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.

The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.




More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.

The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest “serious” level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country's southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.

Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts. 

Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country's acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.

Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.

The IDF denied claims made on Monday by No Other Land Israeli co-director Yuval Abraham on X/Twitter that Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of the Academy Award-winning documentary, was taken from an ambulance by IDF soldiers.Abraham said that Ballal was beaten, bleeding, and wounded in his head and stomach. Abraham also added that Ballal had since disappeared and that it's "unclear whether he is receiving medical treatment or what is happening to him."The military reported that several terrorists had thrown rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles near Susya in the West Bank.  Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving "mutual rock-throwing" between Palestinians and Israelis at the scene.The IDF and Israel Police arrived to disperse the confrontation as several terrorists began throwing rocks at the security forces.

The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police. An Israeli citizen was injured in the incident and was evacuated to receive medical treatment. Contrary to claims, no Palestinian was apprehended from inside an ambulance, the military added.Abraham wrote on the social media platform in Hebrew and English. He then uploaded a video with a masked settler whom he claims to be one of the individuals who attacked Ballal's village, adding that "they continued to attack American activists, breaking their car with stones.

Hossam Shabat and Mohammad Mansour are among more than 170 journalists killed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for  Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram only hours before he was killed was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called the “assassination” of its correspondent, Shabat, and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said that it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

This is Hossam's team, and we are sharing his final message :“If you're reading this, it means I have been killed—most likely targeted—by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old—a college student with dreams like anyone else. For past 18… pic.twitter.com/80aNO6wtfO

In the post, Shabat said that for the past 18 months, he had dedicated “every moment of my life to my people,” documenting the horrors in Gaza to “show the world the truth they tried to bury.”

“By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven't known in the past 18 months,” he wrote. “I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honor of my life to die defending it and serving its people.”

The message was signed: “For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.”

More than 170 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the war in October 2023, according to CPJ, which has maintained a database of all journalists killed for their work over the past 30 years.

During the war, Shabat became known for his live reporting from on the ground and heartfelt interviews with people who had lost so much. Wearing a press vest and helmet, he documented moments of grief and tragedy in crowded hospitals, displacement camps and the sites of strikes. He spoke with parents mourning their dead babies, people calling out for their family in the rubble, and mothers whom he calmed down when they couldn't speak through weeping.

He also found moments of joy — such as his tearful reunion with family after a year and a half of war.

A post shared by Khaled Beydoun (@khaledbeydoun)

Videos posted by Al Jazeera after his killing show a crowd of people surrounding his lifeless body, shouting his name and weeping. The video could not be immediately verified by The Washington Post.

In March 2024, Shabat visited a northern Gaza hospital to document sick children who were facing deteriorating conditions. There, he and other Gaza-based journalists discovered Fadi al-Zant, who, after videos of the emaciated 6-year-old went viral, became one of a handful of children evacuated to receive medical care in the United States, as The Post reported in July.

Mansour, who was also a correspondent for Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun, was killed by a missile strike at his home in Khan Younis, and his wife and child were injured, the newspaper said. “Attacks against civilians, including journalists, are never acceptable under any circumstance,” Kengo Sakajiri, the paper's executive editor added in a statement.

In a statement, the IDF said it had “struck several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in the area of Khan Younis and Rafah” on Monday, and that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance, additional intelligence and precise munitions.”

When Shabat, along with five other journalists, was first labeled a militant by Israel in October, Al Jazeera warned that what the network described as “fabricated accusations” may serve as a “pretext for further violence” against the journalists.

The IDF in October said six Al Jazeera journalists were “exposed” as alleged members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad based on what it said were documents found in Gaza that Israel alleged confirmed their military affiliations, including directories and training documents. The Israeli military released the documents, along with screenshots of them that included IDF-transposed labels and English translations.

Posting the photos and names of the journalists, the Israeli military said most of the journalists were allegedly part of “Hamas's military wing [spearheading] propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera.” The Post could not verify the authenticity of the documents.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for several areas of northern Gaza late Monday, forcing another round of displacements for Palestinians who were able to return to their homes in the devastated north in late January for the first time since the early days of the war. The military described it as a final warning before the areas would come under attack.

Nearly 125,000 people have been displaced in recent days as they fled Israeli bombardment and ground operations, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Monday, before the latest evacuation orders. The United Nations estimates that over the past week, Israel has issued evacuation notices for more than 14 percent of the enclave, along with “vast ‘no go' areas along the border,” spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Monday.

It was past 10 p.m. in Gaza when the evacuation order for Jabalya came in, leaving families with few options other than fleeing on foot, in the dark, in search of relative safety. Two hours before, similar warnings were issued for the areas of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.

“People left under the cover of darkness,” Razan Faisal, a resident of Jabalya who opted to stay behind, said in an interview Tuesday. “We have many elderly people and children, and evacuations involve walking for long hours, which is extremely difficult,” she said, adding that the situation in Jabalya is dire. “There is no aid, and only a few supplies are available in the market at extremely high prices.”

Since March 18, the day Israel broke the fragile truce and resumed bombing Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 792 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday. More than 60 percent of them are women and children, according to the ministry.

JERUSALEM — Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was attacked Monday by a group of Jewish settlers in the West Bank and later arrested by the Israeli army, according to activists and a neighbor who spoke to The Washington Post.

Ballal was released Tuesday after being interrogated by police, according to a statement by activists familiar with his condition. They added that Ballal went to a hospital after being freed.

The Palestinian director was in his home village of Susya, part of the cluster of rural Palestinian communities known as Masafer Yatta, when settlers approached the village and tried to graze their sheep on private Palestinian land just before iftar, the sundown meal at which Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan, according to Nasser Nawajah, who lives in the small village and reports on settler violence for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. He spoke with Ballal's wife, who described the attack.

A video taken by Khamudi Mahmoud, a resident of the village, shows a tall man wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap aggressively approaching Ballal in a rocky clearing as Ballal backs away and a crowd of villagers shout behind him.

Dozens of masked settlers wielding batons, knives and a rifle then attacked property and residents, activists who document settler attacks in the area said in a statement afterward.

“Hamdan tried to retreat, and he brought his kids and wife inside the house and stood at the door to protect them,” Nawajah said. Four settlers began to hit the door of Ballal's house, injuring Ballal's head, according to Nawajah, recounting what Ballal's wife told him.

The settlers fired bullets next to the house and then dragged Ballal away while he was injured, Nawajah said.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted to X that a “violent clash” broke out between Palestinians and Israelis and that it involved “mutual stone-throwing.”

The United Nations said it is making the “difficult decision” to scale back its presence in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. About one-third of the roughly 100 international staff members in Gaza will be temporarily relocated, the agency said in a statement.

“We are not abandoning Gaza,” U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said in a news briefing Tuesday, adding that the decision to reduce international staff numbers was because the U.N. was unable to guarantee the safety of its employees.

On Monday, the United Nations said a strike that hit a U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza, killing a Bulgarian employee and injuring five other international staff members, came from Israeli tankfire — something the Israel Defense Forces has denied. The U.N. has called for an investigation, with spokesman Stéphane Dujarric saying Monday, “The Israelis knew exactly where this U.N. facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.”

Also Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its offices in Rafah was “damaged by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties. Fortunately, no staff were injured in this incident, but this has a direct impact on the ICRC's ability to operate.”

The IDF said in a statement that its forces had “fired at a building after identifying suspects inside and feeling threatened. … Upon review, it was found that the identification was mistaken, and the building belongs to the Red Cross.” It added that the incident would be investigated.

Aid groups have warned about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. The U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Monday that nearly 125,000 people in the enclave have been displaced in recent days as they flee Israeli bombardment,

“This is a human catastrophe,” UNRWA said Monday, emphasizing that Israel's siege and blockade of all aid into Gaza has caused food shortages and sent prices soaring.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram, hours before he was killed, was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called Shabat's “assassination” and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

Top officials in the Trump administration discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application that mistakenly included a journalist, the White House acknowledged Monday, a development that swiftly drew criticism from Democrats and Washington's national security establishment.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the message thread revealed in an extraordinary report by the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, “appears to be authentic,” and that administration officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

The “inadvertent number” belonged to Goldberg, whose article details a robust policy discussion that occurred in the lead-up to a March 15 military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants. Goldberg reported being added to the group chat, which occurred on the encrypted messaging platform Signal, by President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. Other participants appeared to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and several other senior aides, the Atlantic article says.

Hughes, the National Security Council spokesman, characterized the discussion as “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials” executing Trump's national security strategy. But the disclosure immediately raised questions about how the administration has discussed classified national security matters and whether anyone will be disciplined.

Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent days that they will investigate unauthorized leaks to journalists, citing reporting in a number of publications. Several of them also for years criticized the handling of classified information by Democrats in other cases.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. (Photo: PTI)


	Since plunging during the Covid-19 pandemic, international student enrollment in the US has been rebounding a relief to American universities that count on their tuition payments. Two months into the new Trump administration, educators fear that could soon change.


	Unnerved by efforts to deport students over political views, students from other countries already in the US have felt new pressure to watch what they say. 


	A Ph.D. student at the University of Rochester from South Asia said it feels too risky to speak about LGBTQ+ causes she once openly championed or even be seen near a political demonstration. With reports of travel bans circulating, she likely won't fly home for the summer out of fear she would not be allowed back into the US.


	You're here for an education so you've got to keep moving forward on that end, said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.


	But also it's very hard to, say, OK, I'm at work. I've got to zone out. I can't be thinking about the news.' 
	Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. As the US government takes a harder line on immigration, cuts federal research funding and begins policing campus activism, students are left to wonder if they'll be able to get visas, travel freely, pursue research or even express an opinion.


	It has a chilling effect, said Clay Harmon, executive director of AIRC, a membership organisation focused on recruiting and enrolling international students.


	Even if there's no direct consequence or direct limitation right now, all of this cumulatively produces an impression that the US is not welcoming, it's not open or that you may be in some kind of danger or jeopardy if you do come to the US.


	During a recent trip to India, the biggest sender of students to the US, the consensus among recruiting agencies was that far fewer of that country's students are interested in American colleges than in recent years, Harmon said.


	Some students are waiting to see how policy changes will play out, while others already have deferred admission offers for fall 2025, he said. Student social networks are active, and news about immigration-related developments in America like a Republican proposal to prevent Chinese students from studying in the US spreads quickly.


	Students in Canada, China, India and elsewhere have been seeking answers and advice on Reddit and other social media sites, wondering whether to move forward with US plans, or choose a college in the United Kingdom, Germany or elsewhere in Europe.


	International students are coveted as an antidote to declining domestic enrollment and source of full-price tuition payments. In the 2023-2024 academic year, 1.1 million international students at US colleges and universities contributed an all-time high $ 43.8 billion to the nation's economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs, according to data released by NAFSA, an agency that promotes international education.


	International graduate students also play a large role in advancing research, said Fanta Aw, who heads NAFSA.


	Aw said universities must work to remind prospective students that detentions like those of a pro-Palestinian activist Columbia University and, more recently, a scholar at Georgetown University, still are not the norm, despite the attention they receive.


	We have international students at lots of universities, she said, and news coverage has focused on consequences for international students at just a couple of colleges. So we have to also put into perspective the fact that the vast majority of students are in universities where we're not hearing anything.


	The messaging from colleges and universities on the changing political climate has varied. Some, including Northeastern University in Boston, have responded to Trump's directives with webpages to keep current and prospective students informed.


	Our global community will continue to be a welcoming place for admitted students from all corners of the world, spokeswoman Renata Nyul said via email.


	Others have gone further. Bunker Hill Community College in Boston has suspended its one- to two-week study abroad programs, citing concerns about potential travel restrictions. Administrators at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism have warned students who are not US citizens about their vulnerability to arrest or deportation.


	Brown University has advised international students and staff, including visa holders and permanent residents, to postpone travel after a Brown professor was deported to Lebanon despite having a US visa.


	Homeland Security officials later said she openly admitted to supporting a Hezbollah leader and attending his funeral.

The White House says both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and stop military strikes in the Black Sea

Washington releases separate statements after American officials met representatives from both countries in Saudi Arabia in recent days

Ukraine agrees to stop military force in the Black Sea, but adds any movement of Russian naval vessels would be a violation of the agreement, its defence minister says

Earlier the Kremlin said talks with the US focused on creating safe shipping lanes in the Black Sea, but the details would remain private

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov added that Russia was in favour of resuming the Black Sea grain initiative - a deal allowing Ukraine to safely export grain, state-owned Tass news agency reports

Edited by James Gregory

The Ukrainian defence ministry has released its own statement on the deal, which largely follows the same wording as the White House. 

But it also adds that the movement of Russian warships outside of the "eastern part of the Black Sea" will be treated as a violation of the agreement and a "threat to the national security of Ukraine". 

"In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence," the defence ministry statement says on X. 

The defence ministry adds that "additional technical consultations" will be needed for the "effective implementation" of what has been agreed.

Here are the key points from the statement released by the White House following its talks with Russia in Riyadh:

The US also says Ukraine has agreed to these two points.

The statement adds: 

The White House says both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and stop military strikes in the Black Sea.

We'll bring you more details and lines from the White House statement on US talks with the Russian delegation in the next post. 

We've just received a statement from the White House on the talks between the US and Ukrainian delegations in Riyadh. It says:

It adds the US reiterated to both sides in the war that the killing has to stop and it will continue facilitating negotiations. 

Europe must acquire all means
to defend itself against military aggression, the president of the European
Council has said.

"If Russia considers that Ukraine's
borders are just a line on a map, why should it respect any other
country's borders," Antonio Costa asks in a speech at the European Policy
Centre.

Costa adds that peace without
defence is an "illusion" and that Europe needs to continue to stand shoulder to
shoulder with Ukraine to create lasting peace in Europe. 

“Russia's aggression gave a new
sense of urgency to our strategic autonomy, not only on energy but also on
defence,” he says, adding there needs to be a “collective effort to boost our defence
spending by more than 30%, paving the way for decisions which are shaping a Europe
of defence”.

Russian officials met American counterparts for 12 hours of talks

If you're just joining us this lunchtime, here's the latest we know about the talks in Saudi Arabia, as well as what's been happening on the frontline in Ukraine:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be meeting French President Emmanuel Macron tomorrow at the Elysée Palace in Paris, French media is reporting.

The two leaders will hold talks ahead of the next iteration of meetings as part of the "coalition of the willing", due to take place on Thursday.

Talks are continuing between European leaders on how to ensure any ceasefire agreement secured between Russia and Ukraine is maintained, as well as how Kyiv can be given assurances about its future security. 

As we've been reporting, among the topics said to have been discussed in Riyadh is the potential revival of the 2022 Black Sea grain deal - which had allowed cargo ships travelling to and from Ukraine to safely navigate without being attacked by Russia.

Both Ukraine and Russia are major grain exporters, and prices rocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

A reluctance on the part of international shipping companies to do business with Moscow also hampered Russian exports.

Two deals were brokered by the UN and Turkey - one with Ukraine, and one with Russia - that together were intended to allow both countries to resume and scale-up shipments to amounts closer to pre-war levels.

The deal facilitated the movement of grain, sunflower oil and other products required for food production such as fertiliser through the Black Sea. 

It was initially put in place for a period of 120 days but, after multiple extensions, Russia pulled out in July 2023, claiming key parts of the agreement had not been implemented.

Sergei Lavrov and Antonio Guterres pictured in January 2024

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says United Nations chief Antonio Guterres is in constant contact with Russia on the issue of easing Russian grain and fertiliser exports.

According to the Kremlin, Guterres is "trying to help" and looking for ways around current Western sanctions. 

We have not heard anything yet from the UN in response to Lavrov's comments. 

The UN, alongside Turkey, brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative in 2022. But inthe summer of 2023, Russia pulled out of the agreement and stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine.

A separate agreement, called the Memorandum of Understanding, was signed between the UN and Russia to facilitate the export of Russian food products and fertilisers.

The US and Russia did not issue a joint statement after their peace talks in Riyadh because of "Ukraine's position", a Russian politician claims. 

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and apparently agreed a joint statement – which wasn't however adopted because of Ukraine's position – that is very typical and symptomatic," Vladimir Chizhov, first deputy head of the defence committee at the Russian parliament's upper house, has told Russian media this morning.

He added that he wouldn't "comment on such details before they are made public”.

The Kremlin said earlier that the contents of the US-Russia talks held in Saudi Arabia yesterday would not be published, with the results still “being analysed”by both sides. 

The two countries were expected to release a joint statement at 08:00 GMT today. It's not clear whether one might still be released later today.

Moscow has accused
Ukraine of continuing to target Russia's civilian energy infrastructure amid
continuing peace talks.

In a statement, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian
drones attacked a power grid in the Krasnodar territory yesterday, as well as a gas
distribution station in the occupied Luhansk region. It also said a Ukrainian drone
targeted an underground gas storage facility in occupied Crimea yesterday,
which was intercepted.

"By continuing daily attacks on Russia's
energy infrastructure, Zelensky confirms that he is incapable of sticking to
agreements or of being managed by foreign guarantors of any possible
agreements," the ministry said.

Away from the talks, both Russia and Ukraine have continued to carry out attacks overnight. 

Images have been released by Ukraine's state emergency service, which says show the aftermath of Russian drone strikes in the cities of Fastiv and Boryspil, in the Kyiv region, and the city of Izyum, in the north-eastern Kharkiv region.

James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent in Kyiv

There were 12 hours of talks between the Russians and Americans on Monday in Riyadh. The text we're expecting will probably give some readout of what was discussed. 

What's interesting is the fact Washington and Moscow are even contemplating issuing a joint statement that does not involve the Ukrainians, despite those talks with the Kyiv continuing.

Ahead of these talks, people were describing them as shuttle diplomacy - with three delegations in the same hotel complex in Riyadh. 

But there doesn't seem to be that much shuttling - it seems to be just long talks with one side and the Americans to find where there is common ground.

The focus is on restoring the 2022 Black Sea grain initiative - a very specific deal done to open up one seaway to get grain and fertiliser out of Ukraine, while in return relaxing economic sanctions to let Russia export some more of its grain and fertiliser. 

That is not the same thing as a comprehensive ceasefire across the Black Sea, so we wait to see precisely what they've agreed, if anything. 

But at the moment, it seems to be as ever slow incremental steps rather than anything resembling a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire across the whole of the Ukraine which was demanded by the US and agreed to by Kyiv.

Issues surrounding the safety of shipping in the Black Sea were discussed with the US in Saudi Arabia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says, according to the state-owned Tass news agency.

Lavrov adds that Russia is in favour of resuming the Black Sea grain initiative - a deal allowing Ukraine to safely export grain, after pulling out in 2023. 

The Kremlin said a short while ago that the contents of the talks held in Riyadh yesterday would not be published, with the results still “being analysed” by both sides.

It had been reported earlier, however, that negotiators were examining a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea.

Earlier, we brought you reports that the US and Ukrainian teams in Saudi Arabia were holding a further meeting today. 

That meeting has now ended, the AFP news agency reports, citing a source from the Kyiv delegation. 

"The talks are over. All details will be announced later," the source tells a small group of media, according to AFP.

Ukraine's national broadcaster, Suspilne, also reports that the talks - the second round in the past three days - have finished.

More now on what we've heard from Moscow about the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia. 

As we reported in our last post, the Kremlin says the results of the meeting have been conveyed to their respective capitals and are currently “being analysed”. 

“We're talking about technical talks, where they go into detail, so of course the contents of those talks definitely won't be made public,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says on a daily conference call with Russian and international journalists.

“The briefings made to the capitals are being analysed [and] we can talk about the understandings [reached] later,” he adds.

On the potential for another call between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, he says there are no plans right now, but that it could be quickly arranged if needed. 

Asked whether there were now grounds for three-way talks including Ukraine, Peskov says that had not been discussed.

A Kremlin spokesperson says both Russia and the US are currently analysing the outcome of talks in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

Dmitry Peskov adds that the content of what was discussed will not be published. 

We'll bring you more on this shortly.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron will hold another meeting on the "coalition of the willing" on Thursday.

In the aftermath of the Saudi Arabia talks, the European leaders, along with their allies, aim to provide possible solutions to ensure any potential ceasefire agreement can be maintained and give Ukraine confidence about its future security.

In a statement shared yesterday, a Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer was continually updating the White House on meetings with his allies, following conversations on military planning.

The US and Ukrainian delegations are currently holding a further round of talks in Riyadh, according to reports.

"We are still working with the Americans," a member of the Ukrainian delegation tells a small group of media, according to the AFP news agency.

Bloomberg is reporting the same, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.

Pete Hegseth shared war plans in the group chat, The Atlantic reported. (Reuters: Nathan Howard)

In any other presidency, the story would rock the United States: Washington's most senior national security advisers having a highly confidential discussion about plans for the US to launch military strikes, and every word of it being read by an astonished journalist.

But in these times of the New World of Donald Trump it was seen as yet another day — a story that might run for a few hours before blowing over.

Washington is not what it used to be. When news emerged that The Atlantic's editor-in-chief had been accidentally included in a group chat about a plan to bomb Yemen, Trump barely missed a beat.

He knew nothing about it, he told a media conference. He asked journalists for detail, but wasn't particularly fazed. Later, on social media, he re-shared a satirical headline poking fun at The Atlantic's readership numbers.

There was no apparent sense that there would be any accountability. These things happen.

The story broke when Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in The Atlantic that he knew in advance that the US was about to conduct air strikes on Yemen's Houthis on March 15.

"The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defence, had texted me the war plan at 11.44 am," Goldberg revealed. "The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing."

Goldberg wrote:

"On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz.

"Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. 

"I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump's national security adviser."

Goldberg, as an experienced journalist, was concerned that it may have been a hoax but accepted the request, hoping it was the real Mike Waltz and that perhaps he wanted to talk about Ukraine or Iran.

One can imagine Goldberg's surprise when he became part of a group chat discussing a military operation to bomb Yemen.

The group included Vice-President JD Vance, and key officials or representatives of them, including Waltz; Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. The group also included a CIA official, who Goldberg chose not to name as that person is an active intelligence officer.

Goldberg wrote he "could not believe that the national security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans".

"I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior US official, up to and including the vice-president," he wrote.

For Goldberg, the security breach continued. After the bombing, Waltz celebrated by posting three emojis — a fist, an American flag and fire. There had indeed been fire — Yemen's health authorities say the bombing killed at least 53 people.

Witkoff was not to be outdone, and, Goldberg wrote, sent five emojis to the group: two sets of hands praying, a flexed bicep and two American flags.

After the attacks, officials shared congratulatory messages, according to The Atlantic.

For 18 senior US officials to have a casual chat on a commercial social media platform has shocked many in Washington.

It comes only days after The New York Times reported on a plan for Elon Musk to be given a tour of the Pentagon — including, according to anonymous sources, a briefing about US plans for any war with China. (The Trump administration both labelled the story fake and launched internal probes into how it was leaked.)

Although Trump's support ensured Hegseth was confirmed as secretary of defence, many concerns were raised as to whether someone who before this position had been a weekend host on Fox News was qualified to oversee the world's largest military.

The incident raises some obvious questions about the level of competence of Trump's national security team.

Messages published by The Atlantic show JD Vance and Pete Hegseth complaining about Europe.

The first questions that naturally come to mind are about how a magazine editor was invited to join — and then able to lurk in — this 18-member group with nobody asking: "Hang on, who's that guy?"

But beyond that stunning blunder, the bigger questions are about the handling of confidential, and potentially classified, military plans by these top officials.

Anyone who's watched an American spy drama or war movie knows the US has incredibly tight protocols around where and how state secrets are discussed.

That's why Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state blew up into a damaging scandal during the 2016 election campaign — one that Donald Trump repeatedly said she should be jailed over.

And it's why Trump himself faced criminal charges — ultimately dropped — over the alleged stashing of classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago ballroom and bathroom.

Donald Trump's attacks on the judiciary pre-election, as he personally fought criminal prosecution, was one thing. But the way it's escalating from the White House is stress-testing the separation of powers.

This new revelation appears to represent a significant breach of those protocols.

It's not clear exactly what was in the messages, because The Atlantic deemed some of it too sensitive to print. Hegseth has disputed the description of them as "war plans".

But on the known facts, it appears at least some of the chat should have been confined to the authorised, secure channels set up for purposes like sensitive military discussion.

Signal is a more secure app than others, thanks to its encryption technology, but no app can ever be considered free of vulnerabilities.

Security and defence experts here in Washington say it looks like the Espionage Act may have been breached.

The fall-out will be felt beyond Washington.

You can imagine the chatter today in parts of Canberra.

When conversations like the group chat take place in Australia, there's an expectation it's done over secure lines. 

A similar howler in Australia would almost certainly send heads rolling.

Experts say Australia should expect Washington to be "sceptical" of vital intelligence-sharing alliance Five Eyes and say AUKUS might too be in trouble. 

Australia and America's other Five Eyes intelligence partners — Canada, the UK and New Zealand — were already being forced to wrestle with questions about how much they could continue to trust their long-time ally.

Incidents like this will only shake that faith further.

But will there be any accountability?

The agencies that would traditionally investigate something like this are now under the tight control of fierce Trump loyalists.

And the Trump administration's flood-the-zone strategy is likely to push the news agenda through another dizzying series of events before the week is out.

Perhaps the most America can hope for is that this shocking error — and the publicity that results from putting a magazine editor in the middle of it — serves as a wake-up call that leads to more care in future.

China's carbon intensity fell less than planned for in 2024 even as Beijing made strides in renewable energy.

Taipei, Taiwan – China's failure to meet a key carbon emissions target has raised concerns about its ability to achieve carbon neutrality, a potentially decisive factor in global efforts to avert the worst effects of climate change.

China's carbon intensity – a measurement of carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) – fell 3.4 percent in 2024, missing Beijing's official target of 3.9 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

China is also behind its longer-term goal of slashing carbon intensity by 18 percent between 2020 and 2025, as set by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in its most recent five-year plan.

Under China's “dual targets”, President Xi Jinping has pledged to reach peak emissions before the end of the decade and carbon neutrality by 2060.

China's progress is being closely watched around the world due to its paradoxical position as the world's top polluter – responsible for about 30 percent of global emissions – and the world's leader in renewable energy investment.

The country's success or failure to meet its emissions targets will have major implications for the international community's efforts to keep average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, a benchmark set by the United Nations to avert “catastrophic” effects of climate change.

The chances of the planet being able to keep below the 1.5C threshold over the long-term are already in doubt, after 2024 became the first calendar year in history where temperatures breached the limit.

Although carbon intensity is just one of the benchmarks used by Beijing, it provides important insights into how decarbonisation is playing out across the economy, said Muyi Yang, a senior energy analyst at Ember, a global energy think tank based in the United Kingdom.

“Even though the economy continued to grow, the reduction in emissions relative to that growth wasn't as rapid as intended,” Muyi told Al Jazeera.

The world's second-largest economy relied heavily on industrial growth to power itself out of the economic slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but this in turn has led to a recent surge in energy demand, Muyi said.

While China's economy officially grew 5 percent in 2024, electricity demand grew 6.8 percent year-on-year, according to government data.

Carbon emissions grew 0.8 percent year-on-year.

Record heatwaves have posed a further challenge to emission reduction efforts by disrupting energy production at hydropower dams, forcing authorities to make up the shortfall with coal power.

 



 

Despite the setbacks, Beijing has made remarkable achievements in renewable energy, according to David Fishman, a senior manager at the Lantau Group, an energy consultancy firm in Hong Kong.

China last year met 14.5 percent of its total energy demand with wind and solar power and another 13.4 percent with hydropower, according to government data.

The country also met about 75 percent of its incremental growth in energy demand – 500 out of 610 terawatt hours – with renewable energy, Fishman said, based on an analysis of government data.

The figure represents “massive amounts of clean energy” roughly equivalent to Germany's annual energy consumption, Fishman told Al Jazeera.

Much of this growth has been driven by government support, including from the highest levels of the CCP.

Xi Jinping Thought, Xi's governing ideology enshrined in the Chinese constitution, states that China must strive towards an “ecological civilisation”.

In 2021, Xi announced that “high energy consumption and high-emission projects that don't meet requirements should be resolutely taken down”.

The same year, China launched its Emissions Trading Scheme, the world's largest carbon trading market, under which firms that produce less emissions than their designated allowance can sell their unused allowances to polluters exceeding their limits.

More recently, Xi has called for China to focus on “new quality productive forces” and transition to more high-end and innovation-driven manufacturing, said Anika Patel, a China analyst at Carbon Brief.

“[China] has historically been seen as the ‘factory of the world' but with a focus on the so-called ‘old three', which are all lower-value products – appliances, clothing and toys. Now it wants to shift towards green growth and the ‘new three', which is solar panels, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries,” Patel told Al Jazeera.

The CCP will release its newest round of carbon emissions targets for 2026 to 2030 alongside its next five-year plan later this year, Patel said, which will impact the direction of both public and private sectors.

Yao Zhe, a global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, said while China is on track to reach peak carbon before 2030, whether it can leave coal fully behind in the long term is less certain.

“Achieving carbon neutrality will require many more structural changes in China's energy sector and economy as a whole. And those changes need to start soon after peak,” Yao told Al Jazeera.

“While Chinese policymakers are good at supporting the cleantech industry, they tend to defer these structural reforms to a later timeframe – possibly later than 2035 – and this is a real concern.”

Donald Trump backs National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, who accidentally added a journalist to a group chat about air strikes on Yemen

Trump tells NBC: "Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man"

Waltz added editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a chat about US air strikes on Yemen earlier this month

In the chat, Vice-President JD Vance seemingly says he hates "bailing Europe out again"

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth apparently replies to Vance with: "I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC"

There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.

If such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives – and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.

Fortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.

Unfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.

That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.

And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.

On 15 March, the US launched what it described as a "decisive and powerful" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Four days earlier, on 11 March, Jeffrey Goldberg writes that he received a connection request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz's.

Signal is used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and send disappearing messages.

Two days later, Goldberg said he was added to a Signal chat entitled "Houthi PC small group".

A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the chat, Goldberg reported.

Accounts labelled "JD Vance," the name of the vice-president; "Pete Hegseth," the Defence Secretary; and "John Ratcliffe," the director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chat. Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared to be added.

Goldberg says he watched as the group chat discussed targets and timings for military strikes. And those plans appeared accurate when US later launched air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that matched details from the group chat.

Welcome back to our live coverage as the White House confirms that a journalist was accidentally texted classified US military information.

The Trump administration is facing political uproar after the Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a Signal message group in which US national security officials planned a military strike in Yemen.

The group apparently included Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.

Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, said he had seen classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck.

The report sparked a firestorm of criticism from opposition Democrats and concerns among several Republicans.

We'll bring you live updates, analysis and reaction to this extraordinary story during the UK morning and as the US wakes up, so stay with us.

Congress is expected to grill Trump officials over the incident in an upcoming Senate intelligence hearing.

Two key witnesses set to appear at that hearing were reportedly members of the Signal chat: Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and John Ratcliffe, director of the CIA.

Thanks for joining us.

Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, a
Washington DC-based magazine that publishes articles on politics, business and
the economy, foreign affairs, culture and the arts, technology, and science.

He has worked there since 2007, when he joined as a national
correspondent before taking over as editor-in-chief in 2016. The magazine won
its first Pulitzer Prizes under his leadership in 2022, as well as a variety of
other awards.

And, as we know now, Goldberg was also part of a classified
conversation where senior US government officials discussed military strikes on
a foreign country.

The vice-president pushed back against the planned attack, expressing concern over the prospect of "bailing Europe out"

In the messages revealed by the Atlantic one of the most notable things was Vice President JD Vance's disagreement with Trump's Yemen strategy. 

Vance argued, in the messages, the administration didn't need to rush to attack Yemen and he experienced concern over what should be expected of the Europeans and others for the US doing this. 

“3%  of US trade runs through the Suez. 40% of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message,” Vance reportedly wrote in a message.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now," Vance says in a later message. "There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

After pushback from other members of the Trump administration, Vance appears to address Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying "If you think we should do it let's go". 

"I just hate bailing Europe out again," Vance writes.

"This is blatantly illegal and dangerous beyond belief," Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren says of the group chat breach. "Our national security is in the hands of complete amateurs," she said on social media.

"What other highly sensitive national security conversations are happening over group chat? Any other random people accidentally added to those, too?"

Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said: "Think about what we would do if Biden were president and this came out... we would raise the roof", according to a reporter for Semafor, external. 

"It's going to be interesting to see if anybody loses their job over this," she added.

Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono posted: "Egregious, reckless, and illegal. No amount of spin can change that."

"It's baffling. It's shocking. It's dangerous," says Samar Ali,
a professor of politics and law at Vanderbilt University, saying that the text
chain appeared to be "a clear violation of our national security laws and our archive
norms".

Sensitive government communications are required to take
place in a sealed-off room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facility (SCIF), Ali says.

Ali says these rooms are “virtually impossible to penetrate,” unlike the messaging app Signal.

Ali speaks from experience, recalling when she once used a SCIF to hash out negotiations
between the US and EU.

One question Ali raises with me is what accountability those involved in the Signal chat might face? She notes that she would have lost her job and security clearance if she committed similar violations.

Some of the Signal messages National Security Adviser Michael Waltz sent to the chat were set to 
disappear after one week, Jeffrey Goldberg reported in his article for The Atlantic.

That raises concerns about two federal laws that require the preservation of government records: the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act.

“The law requires that electronic messages that take
place on a non-official account are preserved, in some fashion, on an official electronic
record keeping system," said Jason R Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and
Records Administration. 

Such regulations would cover Signal, he said.

Official government communications are supposed to be either automatically archived, or the individuals involved are supposed to forward, copy, or preserve the messages.

“The open question here is whether these communications
were automatically archived," Baron told the BBC. "It's not clear whether that occurred."

It was also unclear whether the individuals in the chat had taken other steps to preserve the records.

The use of Signal to discuss the military strikes also raised security questions.

“Assuming that any of the conversations on
Signal could be considered classified, then under Department of Defense guidance
those communications should have taken place on a classified government network,
or on a network with government-approved encrypted features," Baron said.

“We should all be concerned about the use of these
electronic messaging apps to evade federal record keeping requirements," he said.

Former defence adviser Mara Karlin says group chat mishap 'not normal'

Mara Karlin, who served under six Secretaries of State and was assistant Secretary of Defence, told the BBC the story from The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg is "stunning" and "not normal".

Karlin says these types of conversation should take place in a secure space, in the Pentagon or in the situation room in the White House, not in a Signal group chat.

Karlin says she expects both allies and adversaries to pay attention to this, saying they will ask: "Can the US government keep sensitive information in a secure manner?" 

Inspector general investigations and congressional investigations will be carried out, Karlin predicts.

"This is historic," she adds.

Goldberg says officials got 'lucky' it was him inadvertently added to group chat

Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was inadvertently invited to the Signal group chat with US officials, has been speaking with PBS News Hour about his experience. 

"They got quite lucky that they included my phone number," Goldberg told PBS News. 

"If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn't somebody who supported the Houthis, because they were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people who were involved in that operation."

Goldberg said he doesn't disagree with the administration's statement that the messages show a debate among senior levels, but says that point matters less when considering the security concerns.

'Nobody was texting war plans', says Pete Hegseth in response to The Atlantic report

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth just spoke with reporters in Hawaii about the messages published in The Atlantic's article. 

He mostly deflected questions from reporters, saying Goldberg was not a serious journalist and claiming that he "peddles garbage".

"So you're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist," he alleged.

He then praised the military operation, saying, "We will ultimately decimate the Houthis".

Pressed again on the group chat, Hegseth deflected.

"Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that," he said.

On Sunday, the US launched what it described as a "decisive and powerful" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Messages among top White House officials show not everyone was on board with the plan from the start, in part because American actions would help Europe. Officials in the chat, including Vice President JD Vance, said they wanted Europeans to offer something in exchange for the American action in Yemen.

The White House confirmed the content of the messages as reported in The Atlantic was authentic. 

@PeteHegseth if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.

- JD Vance

VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.

- Pete Hegseth

We've compiled a timeline of the events leading up to a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, gaining access to a chat for top US officials.

Tuesday March 11: Goldberg receives an invitation request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account identified as White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz

Thursday March 13: The editor-in-chief receives a notification that he has been added to a group chat on the app, called "Houthi PC small group". A message to the group said it would be used for the coordination of strikes against the Houthis, "particularly over the next 72 hours", Goldberg reports

Friday March 14: Now on the second day of communications, Goldberg says conversations diverted as an account called JD Vance spoke of a trip to an economic event in Michigan. Attention then turned back to the Houthis, with an account identified as Pete Hegseth showing support for the proposals to be raised with President Donald Trump

Saturday March 15: Goldberg receives a message in the chat about the attacks on the Houthis at 11:44 local time, just over two hours later the account purported to be that of Waltz says the "operation was a success"

Among the details shared by journalist Jeffrey Goldberg from the
group chat he was inadvertently invited to are the reactions from White House
officials after military strikes were launched.

Michael Waltz shared a fist emoji, a US flag emoji and a fire
emoji, Goldberg's messages show.

A user with the initials MAR, whom Goldberg believes could be
Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio, said "good Job Pete and your
team!!”

Pete is in reference to Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense
who apparently shared the details of the planned strikes in the Signal group.

Goldberg says the username Steve Witkoff responded with five
emojis - two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. Witkoff is
Trump's special envoy to the Middle East.

The BBC has not independently verified the individual users in
the chat, but the White House has said it appeared to be "an authentic
message chain".

Joe Biden's former transport secretary Pete Buttigieg has just reacted to news of the security breach on his social media account. 

"From an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of (expletive) imaginable," the high-profile Democrat says.

"These people cannot keep America safe."

This is the moment senator Chuck Schumer demands a "full
investigation" of the Yemen strike group chat.

Schumer says "very harsh consequences" should be faced
by any government employee who shared the sensitive military plans.

Mike Johnson defends Trump administration after Yemen group chat mishap

Reporters on Capitol Hill just asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson about the Signal group. 

"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it on to that thread, they're going to track that down and make sure it doesn't happen again," Johnson tells reporters. 

Johnson said the Trump administration "acknowledged it was a mistake".

"What you did see, though, I think, was top level officials doing their job, doing it well,” he added. 

US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz (L) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (R)

As we've been reporting, Editor-in-Chief of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a group chat with US national security officials.

The White House confirmed the texts published by Goldberg "appears to be an authentic message chain" and they were investigating how Goldberg had been added to it.

Goldberg says he received an invite from an account purporting to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz on 11 March, four days before the US launched what it described as a "decisive and powerful" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Also in the chat, Goldberg reports, were accounts that matched the names of Vice-President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) John Ratcliffe.

He also says top officials from various agencies also appeared to be added.

We've been talking a lot about Signal, the app that was used to discuss war plans.

It's a free, open-source encrypted messaging app that was launched in 2014. 

Conversations within the app are end-to-end encrypted - meaning they can only be read or heard by the recipients.

It is often used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and the ability to send disappearing messages.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration's top intelligence officials are facing Congress this week to offer their first testimony in office about the threats confronting the United States and tackle urgent questions about the security breach that unfolded when war plans were mistakenly leaked to a journalist.

In the first, by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia denounced what he called a pattern of “careless, incompetent behavior” by the Trump administration with regard to the handling of sensitive information.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling” that no one thought to check the participants on the group chat, said Warner, the panel's top Democrat.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are among the witnesses appearing Tuesday before the Senate panel and again Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing is taking place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Republican administration, including Ratcliffe, Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” Goldberg reported. The strikes began two hours after Goldberg received the details.




“Horrified” by the leak of what is historically strictly guarded information, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, said he will be demanding answers in Wednesday's hearing.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration. 

Former FBI Director Christopher Wray routinely has said he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career when the United States faced so many elevated threats at once, but the concerns he more regularly highlighted had to do with sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism.

“We have to change to the dynamic threat landscape that is changing constantly not just in America but abroad,” Patel said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, citing the elevated threat from “narco-traffickers.” But, he added, “we're not going to forget or ignore national security — never.” 

The hearings are also unfolding against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine. 

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with President Donald Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth blamed the media on Monday for reports he shared military plans to an unclassified Signal chat. Speaking to reporters traveling with him as he landed in Hawaii for his first trip to the Indo-Pacific Hegseth said “nobody was texting war plans”.

President Donald Trump said Monday he knows “nothing” about his top national security officials inadvertently texting war plans about upcoming military strikes on Yemen to a group in a secure messaging app that included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Top national security officials for President Donald Trump, including his defense secretary, texted plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic, the magazine reported in a story posted online Monday. The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.” 



Trump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.

President Donald Trump said Monday he knows “nothing” about his top national security officials inadvertently texting war plans about upcoming military strikes on Yemen to a group in a secure messaging app that included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief.



The material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.



It was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.



Just two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

The National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, it included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence. 



Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.



Hegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Trump from the publication. He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain. 



“Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defense secretary. 



Trump on Tuesday in a brief interview with NBC News' Garrett Haake downplayed the incident as “the only glitch in two months” of his administration “and it turned out not to be a serious one.”



White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday said in post on X that no war plans were discussed and that “No classified material was sent to the thread.”



Leavitt said on Monday the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.”



Earlier Monday, Trump told reporters: “I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine.” 



By early evening, the president jokingly brushed it aside. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic' Where No One Will Ever See Them.”



Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting. 



Leavitt said the White House counsel's office has provided guidance to Trump's top officials on a number platforms to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.







The sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth's office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information. 



Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted operational plans on an unclassified app.

The administration's handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.



“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.



“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.



He said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Trump's Cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”



Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.



Himes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday's previously scheduled committee hearing.



Some Republicans also expressed concerns.



Sen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday, “We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”



Reed said he would be speaking with Wicker about what the committee will do to “follow up” on the Signal leak. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants to learn more about what happened.



“Obviously, we got to to run it to the ground, figure out what went on there,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.



Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson offered a notably forgiving posture. 



“I think it would be a terrible mistake for there to be adverse consequences on any of the people that were involved in that call,” Johnson said. “They were trying to do a good job, the mission was accomplished with precision.”







The handling of national defense information is strictly governed by law under the century-old Espionage Act, including provisions that make it a crime to remove such information from its “proper place of custody” even through an act of gross negligence.



The Justice Department in 2015 and 2016 investigated whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law by communicating about classified information with her aides on a private email server she set up, though the FBI ultimately recommended against charges and none were brought.



In the Biden administration, some officials were given permission to download Signal on their White House-issued phones, but were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the Democratic administration.



The official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to communicate what they internally referred to as “tippers” to notify someone when they were away from the office or traveling overseas that they should check their “high side” inbox for a classified message.



The app was sometimes also used by officials during the Biden administration to communicate about scheduling of sensitive meetings or classified phone calls when they were outside the office, the official said.



The use of Signal became more prevalent during the last year of the Biden administration after federal law enforcement officials warned that China and Iran were hacking the White House as well as officials in the first Trump administration, according to the official.



The official was unaware of top Biden administration officials — such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan — using Signal to discuss sensitive plans as the Trump administration officials did.



Signal's encryption protocol is open source, meaning that it's freely available for anyone to inspect, use or modify. The encryption protocol is also used by another popular chat service, social media company Meta's WhatsApp platform.



Some of the toughest criticism targeted Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, said on social media that Hegseth, “the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in history, is demonstrating his incompetence by literally leaking classified war plans in the group chat.”







In the chain of messages, Vance questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of “a moderate to severe spike in oil prices” and if the timing of the operation might be a “mistake.”



“I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,” Vance argued. “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”



Vance also made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the U.S. by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.



“If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in a back-and-forth with Hegseth.



“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,” Hegseth replied. He added, “I think we should go.”



The vice president's communications director, William Martin, released a statement downplaying the debate. He said Vance “unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy.” 



Leavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them. The briefing will take place at 10 a.m. ET.

The hearing comes a day after The Atlantic magazine reported that top national security officials for Trump, including his defense secretary, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat that included the magazine's editor-in-chief in a secure messaging app.

Here's the Latest:

Senate Democrats are calling for further investigations and possible resignations following news that top national security officials texted military plans to a group chat that included Jeff Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, told CIA Director John Ratcliffe that the leak was an “embarrassment” and asked whether it was “just a normal day at the CIA?”

“Don't insult the intelligence of the American people,” Bennet told Ratcliffe before asking how Goldberg was added to the chat. “Did he invite himself to the Signal thread?”

“I don't know how he was invited,” Ratcliffe said in response. “Clearly, he was added to the Signal group.”

Four protesters interrupted the hearing in Congress to decry former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's ardent support for Israel.

One blew a shofar, and another shouted, “I am a proud American Jew!” and then “Let Palestinians live!”

Police quickly grabbed the protesters, but their shouts could still be momentarily heard in the Senate hallway.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said on Tuesday he would defer to the White House on whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or National Security Adviser Michael Waltz should face repercussions over war plans that were texted in a group chat that included a journalist.

“But I think we should be critical,” he said.

“The fact that classified information was put on an unclassified system, I think the secretary of defense needs to answer for that,” Bacon added.

He dismissed the need for an Armed Services committee investigation, simply because the facts were apparent.

Bacon also called the White House's saying that no war plans were shared “baloney.”

“They ought to just be honest and own up to it,” Bacon said.

Bacon served nearly thirty years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, specializing in electronic warfare and intelligence.

“My communications to be clear in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe told lawmakers during a Senate hearing on global security threats.

Democrats have said the leaked military plans in a Signal group message that included a journalist show a sloppy disregard for security, but Ratcliffe said no rules were violated.

During heated questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said there's a difference between “inadvertent” releases of information and intentional leaks.

“There was no classified material that was shared,” Gabbard said.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said China has heavily invested in stealth aircraft, hypersonic weapons and nuclear arms and is looking to outcompete the U.S. when it comes to artificial intelligence.

Noting Russia's large nuclear arsenal, she called the country a “formidable competitor.” She added that while Iran is not currently seeking to build a nuclear weapon, it has become a critical supplier of weapons to Russia.

And North Korea, she said, remains committed to pursuing military capabilities that would allow it to strike U.S. forces in the region or the U.S. homeland.

Gabbard's remarks came during her testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee during a hearing on worldwide threats to the U.S.

“These actors are in some cases working together in different areas to target U.S. interests,” Gabbard told lawmakers.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., blasted Pentagon and intelligence officials for engaging in the chat, which he said revealed secret information about U.S. plans to strike Yemen.

Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the leak “sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior.”

Warner said that if a lower ranking officer had texted similar secret plans, “They would be fired.”

The comments came at the start of a Senate hearing featuring testimony from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel.

The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has told the leaders of America's intelligence community that it has become too bureaucratic and political to keep up with emerging national security threats.

“As the world has become more dangerous, our intelligence agencies have gotten more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we have been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said in his opening statement.

At the hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are likely to face questions after it emerged that Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other national security officials texted war plans to a group chat that included a reporter.

The Arkansas Republican delivered an opening statement in which he ticked through a litany of challenges facing the United States from a report on worldwide threats.

Cotton asked, “Are our intelligence agencies well-postured facing against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is ‘no,' at least not yet.”

Cotton said that after years of “drift,” the intelligence community “must recommit” to what he said is its core mission of “collecting clandestine intelligence from adversaries.”

Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the committee, called the report “one of the most complicated and challenging” during his 14 years on the panel.

The federal lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in New York by the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent members of Columbia's faculty. The groups allege the Trump administration violated free speech laws and federal procedures when it cut $400 million in funding for Columbia over allegations of antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.

Tolerating that at Columbia risks turning other colleges into “servile arms of the government, advancing only the political preferences of the latest president in order to secure federal funding,” the lawsuit says.

The Education Department did not immediately comment.

Columbia on Friday agreed to several demands from the administration as a condition for restoring its federal funding. It put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhauled its rules for protests and student discipline, measures that the suit calls an unprecedented intrusion on the school's autonomy.

The Atlantic editor-in-chief's account of being added to a Signal group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised questions about how highly sensitive information is supposed to be handled.

The National Security Council has since said the text chain “appears to be authentic” and that it is looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain.

Signal is an app that can be used for direct messaging and group chats as well as phone and video calls.

Signal uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services that prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls.

In a social media post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “war plans” were not discussed and that no classified material was sent to the thread.

She said the counsel's office has provided guidance on different platforms that Trump's top officials can use to communicate “safely and efficiently.”

Leavitt reiterated that the National Security Council is looking into how a telephone number for Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, was added to the thread.

She said U.S. military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen were successful, “terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump.”

Since plunging during the COVID-19 pandemic, international student enrollment in the U.S. has been rebounding — a relief to American universities that count on their tuition payments. Two months into the new Trump administration, educators fear that could soon change.

Unnerved by efforts to deport students over political views, students from other countries already in the U.S. have felt new pressure to watch what they say.

Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. As the U.S. government takes a harder line on immigration, cuts federal research funding and begins policing campus activism, students are left to wonder if they'll be able to get visas, travel freely, pursue research or even express an opinion.

Some students are waiting to see how policy changes will play out, while others already have deferred admission offers for fall 2025, he said. Student social networks are active, and news about immigration-related developments in America — like a Republican proposal to prevent Chinese students from studying in the U.S. — spreads quickly.

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas says the news that several top Trump national security officials texted war plans in a group chat that included a journalist on a secure messaging app will come up.

But Cotton said on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” that he'd like to keep the focus on the subject for the hearing, which is threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the officials set to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

When Ash Lazarus Orr went to renew his passport in early January, the transgender organizer figured it would be relatively routine.

But more than two months on, Orr is waiting to get a new passport with a name change and a sex designation reflecting who he is. The delay has prevented him from traveling overseas to receive gender-affirming care this month in Ireland since he refuses to get a passport that lists an “inaccurate sex designation.”

Orr blames the delay on President Donald Trump, who on the day he took office issued an executive order banning the use of the “X” marker as well as the changing of gender markers.

“This is preventing me from having an accurate identification and the freedom to move about the country as well as internationally,” said Orr, who is among seven plaintiffs — five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs — who have sued the Trump administration in federal court over the policy.

Whether to return to the federal workforce is a decision confronting thousands of fired employees after two judges this month found legal problems with how Trump is carrying out a dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government. One ruling by a California federal judge would reinstate 16,000 probationary employees.

On Monday, the Trump administration sought to stop giving fired workers any choice by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the rehiring orders. It was not clear how quickly the nation's high court could rule on the emergency appeal, which argued that U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, went beyond his legal authority.

Although it is unknown how many federal workers are taking up the offers to return to work, some employees have already decided to move on, fearing more reductions down the road.

Others who were asked to return were immediately put on administrative leave, with full pay and benefits, or offered early retirement. For those who chose to return, some say the decision came down to their dedication to the work and a belief that what they do is important.

Trump and Vance are scheduled to have lunch in the White House private dining room at 12:30 p.m. ET, according to the White House. Later, Trump is expected to sign executive orders at 2 p.m. ET.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week, their first opportunity since being sworn in to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and on Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration.

The Trump administration on Monday invoked a “state secrets privilege” and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law — a case that has become a flashpoint amid escalating tension with the federal courts.

The declaration comes as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg weighs whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process.

Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm “diplomatic and national security concerns.”

Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his national security team Tuesday while Democrats in Congress demanded answers after an explosive report revealed top Trump administration discussing sensitive information about U.S. war plans in a Signal group chat with a journalist present.

The stunning security breach was revealed by The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in a first-hand account detailing how Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, mistakenly invited him into a chat on the app Signal that included 18 administration officials including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

Unaware the reporter was in the chat, the Trump officials plotted U.S. airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi sites in Yemen that took place March 15. The conversations culminated with Hegseth, hours before the airstrikes, sharing secret plans ‒ including targets and attack sequencing ‒ in the chat.

The inadvertent leak, by officials using the publicly available encrypted Signal messaging app, raises alarming questions about the potential mishandling of national security information, which federal law dictates should only be shared through the government's own approved secure platforms.

Here is what we know:

FBI Director Kash Patel said he was briefed about the Signal incident Monday night and again on Tuesday morning. 

“I don't have an update,” Patel said in response to Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner's question of whether the FBI had launched an investigation into the potential leak of classified information. 

Warner had asked Gabbard, seated to Patel's left in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, to confirm she was one of several senior officials a part of the group chat. 

“I'm not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said repeatedly, adding, “because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.” 

CIA Director John Ratcliffe, another reported member of the Signal chat, confirmed to Warner he was a member of the virtual group 

Trump officials used the chat to discuss preparations ‒ and concerns ‒ about plans to strike Houthi sites in Yemen in response to the Iran-backed militant group's repeated attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea that go back more than two years.

Vance told the group that he worried the planned airstrikes could undercut Trump's position on foreign policy affairs that impact Europe more than the US. At one point he said, "I just hate bailing Europe out again.”

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now," Vance said in the chat. "There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

It is unclear why Goldberg, a longtime Washington-based reporter and edit-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the chat of Trump officials.

Goldberg said he received a connection request from a Signal user with name Mike Waltz on March 13. Two days later, he was added to a chat called “Houthi PC small group.”

No one realized that Goldberg, whose username appeared as "JG," had been added, Goldberg wrote.

Goldberg said he was initially suspicious about the chat, wary that it could be a hoax designed to entrap a reporter and skeptical top national security officials would be using a phone app to discuss such sensitive material. He said he realized it was authentic when the Yemen airstrike plans revealed by Hegseth came to fruition.

"I didn't think it could be real," The Atlantic article's headline said. "Then the bombs started falling."

Trump, in a phone interview Tuesday with NBC News, stood by Walz in his first substantive remarks on the stunning security breach. "Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man," the president said.

Trump told NBC that Goldberg's presence in the chat had "no impact at all" on the military operation.

“It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there," Trump said when asked what he was told about how Goldberg was added to the Signal chat.

Trump expressed confidence in his national security team despite the details revealed in The Atlantic's story, calling the situation "the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one."

Warner wasted no time bringing up The Atlantic's scathing story in his opening remarks during the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing Tuesday morning on global threats to the United States. 

Warner, vice chairman of the committee, condemned the reported group chat of senior officials – which included Gabbard and Ratcliffe, who sat facing Warner and the committee as witnesses for the hearing. 

“Putting aside that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” Warner said, “it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check – security hygiene 101 – who are all the names? Who are they?” 

Added, by accident, to the chat was Goldberg. The Virginia senator called the error reckless and sloppy, and said it was emblematic of issues across the Trump administration.  

“If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer, and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired,” Warner said. “I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error.” 

Trump was charged with mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House when his first term concluded. A federal judge dismissed the indictment last summer and special counsel Jack Smith dropped his appeal to continue pursuing the federal criminal charges after Trump's presidential election victory last November.

The Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a Signal group chat with top Trump officials addressing secret war plans. Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest from the White House.

President Donald Trump is not planning to fire national security advisor Mike Waltz in the wake of The Atlantic's reporting of an apparent national security breach, Fox News has learned.

"He's not getting fired," Trump told Fox News. The president said the incident was a "mistake," though there was "nothing important" in the Signal text thread. 

The president described Waltz as a "good guy" and added that the "attack was a success," referring to the U.S. operation against the Houthis in Yemen that was discussed on the text chain between senior Cabinet officials. 

A source close to the president previously told Fox News that Waltz's job is safe and that he is not on the chopping block. 

Fox News is told Waltz has no plans to resign and is sticking to his schedule Tuesday. He will be talking to his Russian counterpart about a Black Sea ceasefire deal and has plans to speak to Trump as usual later Tuesday.

Waltz is also telling colleagues that he has never met or talked to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, Fox News has learned.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a new statement on Tuesday. The National Security Council earlier said The Atlantic's report referenced what appeared to be an "authentic message chain." 

"Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin," Leavitt wrote, before offering three "facts about his latest story." Leavitt said no "war plans" were discussed, no classified material was sent to the thread and that the White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for the president's top officials to communicate "as safely and efficiently as possible." 

"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread," Leavitt said. "Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump."

A senior White House official earlier revealed to Fox News how Goldberg may have been added to the Signal text chain with Cabinet members.

The official said that he had never met and had never spoken to Goldberg. Somehow, Goldberg's number was added to one of the members of the list, the senior official said, noting that Signal is allowed in multiple agencies. 

It appears that Goldberg's number was added to a contact card by one of the Trump administration staffers, Fox News has learned. The chat had Cabinet officials plus some of those officials' staffers.

WILL CAIN SHARES HIS TAKEAWAY ON THE ATLANTIC'S STORY ON THE TRUMP ADMIN'S 'WAR PLANS' TEXT

Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are calling for Waltz's ouster over the breach. 

"This is an outrageous national security breach and heads should roll. We need a full investigation and hearing into this on the House Armed Services Committee, ASAP," Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., wrote on X. 

"We can't chalk this up to a simple mistake — people should be fired for this," Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., told Axios. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth blasted The Atlantic article, telling reporters on Monday that "nobody was texting war plans." 

Hegseth billed Goldberg as a "deceitful and highly discredited journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again."

Goldberg appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday morning to discuss the contents of the text chain. The reporter said Vice President JD Vance "asserted his disagreement" with Trump in front of other Cabinet members believed to be on the text chain and "articulated a view that the president didn't understand the consequences or stakes." 

"I think it's notable that the vice president of the United States is telling members of the Cabinet that I don't think the president understands," Goldberg said. "I just think it's noteworthy, just my journalistic perspective, that the vice president is, is being so, so blunt about that. But it's a very it's a substantive policy disagreement on some levels." 

A person on the chat labeled "SM," believed to be Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, pushed back in the chat and the conversation seemed to defer to the president's ultimate judgment. 

Goldberg further categorized the chat as "obviously very focused on getting Europe to pay for the strikes on the Houthis and a lot of resentment directed at Europe for not having the capacity to defend shipping lanes that are affected by the Houthis."

Goldberg made the point to MSNBC that lower levels of the armed forces must adhere to cybersecurity and social media rules. 

"And you can go to jail," Goldberg said. "You can go to Leavenworth for mishandling what we would consider to be minor classified information."

He also defended The Atlantic, as administration officials have categorized it as a failing publication. 

"We're a profitable magazine. We have more than 1.2 million paid subscribers. We have tremendous web traffic. And we are completely self-funded at this point. It's going really great," Goldberg said.

Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream analyzes the legal pushback to the Trump administration's deportation of illegal migrants on ‘America Reports.'

The Justice Department said this week that it has invoked the state secrets privilege in its ongoing court battle over the deportation of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, a national security tool that allows the government to withhold certain information from the courts for national security purposes. 

In the 10-page court filing submitted to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior Trump administration officials said they chose to invoke the privilege because disclosure would pose what they described as a "reasonable danger" to national security and foreign affairs. 

"The Court has all of the facts it needs to address the compliance issues before it," the Justice Department officials said, adding: "Further intrusions on the Executive Branch would present dangerous and wholly unwarranted separation-of-powers harms with respect to diplomatic and national security concerns that the Court lacks competence to address."

The news comes as Boasbeg has repeatedly pressed government lawyers for more information about its deportation flights last weekend, which sent around 261 migrants, including Venezuelan nationals and members of the gang Tren de Aragua, from the U.S. to El Salvador.

The flights left U.S. soil around the time Boasberg agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, or the little-used wartime immigration law passed by Congress in 1798, to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals.

Hours later, however, planes carrying hundreds of migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed on the basis of the law in question, arrived in El Salvador.

In the days that followed, Boasberg ordered both parties back to court to testify over the removals, and whether the Trump administration knowingly defied his court order.

The Justice Department had largely refused to comply with his requests for information – which included questions on how many individuals it deported "solely on the basis" of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation, where the planes landed, what time each plane took off from the U.S., and from where – citing national security protections.

Boasberg previously warned the Trump administration of consequences last week if it were to continue to violate his order, noting that their options were to either file information under seal or invoke the state secrets privilege.

Should the Trump administration invoke the state secrets privilege, Boasberg noted at the time, the court "is obligated to ‘determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege.'"

This was disputed in the filing by Bondi and other senior Justice Department personnel, however, who said in the filing Monday night, "No more information is needed to resolve any legal issue in this case."

The legal back and forth comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly stressed that a federal judge, in their view, does not have the ability to rule on national security matters or immigration issues – putting Boasberg, and his ruling, directly in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

The Justice Department also appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C., which heard the case yesterday. The three-judge panel declined to immediately rule on the matter, though a decision is expected sometime this week. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed Sunday to appeal the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.

Top U.S. intelligence officials face Congress one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a Signal group chat that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials are facing Congress for back-to-back hearings this week to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

Other news we're following today:



As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.

One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.

“That's what Signal was supposed to be for,” then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.

Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.

While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.

Frank Bisignano, a self-professed “DOGE person,” is facing the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday for his confirmation hearing to serve as commissioner of the beleaguered Social Security Administration.

Bisignano was asked by several Democratic lawmakers during the hearing whether the Trump Administration plans to privatize Social Security or cut recipients' benefits.

When asked by one lawmaker, “Do you think social security should be privatized?” Bisignano responded: “I've never heard a word of it, and I've never thought about it.”

The agency has taken center stage in the debate over Department of Government Efficiency cuts to taxpayer services.

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, asked Ratcliffe and Gabbard whether the chat mentioned targets, weapons, specific units or timing of the strike on Yemen.

“I don't remember a mention of specific targets,” Gabbard said. “I believe there was discussion around targets, in general.”

“I think that's consistent with my recollection,” Ratcliffe said when Kelly asked him the same question.

Democrats have asked for an investigation into the leak, which Ratcliffe and Gabbard have said contained no classified information.

Senate Democrats are calling for further investigations and possible resignations following news that top national security officials texted military plans to a group chat that included Jeff Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, told CIA Director John Ratcliffe that the leak was an “embarrassment” and asked whether it was “just a normal day at the CIA?”

“Don't insult the intelligence of the American people,” Bennet told Ratcliffe before asking how Goldberg was added to the chat. “Did he invite himself to the Signal thread?”

“I don't know how he was invited,” Ratcliffe said in response. “Clearly, he was added to the Signal group.”

The video of the joke German group chat, posted on Tuesday to social media, is chasing clout from the fallout over a story published by The Atlantic about top U.S. security officials texting war plans to a group chat that included a journalist.

In the satire, five government bureaucrats message with “Chef” — German for “boss” — in a chat that spans from the rare good weather to the intricacies of Tuesday's transition between the old and new parliamentarians. 

Naturally, Germany's infamous bureaucracy — which the texters are proud of — plays a starring role.

The chat closes with the colleagues lamenting their lives in civil service and sending emojis that included a superhero and a hand's nails being painted — a nod to Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, and his use in his chat of the emojis for a fist, an American flag, and fire.

Four protesters interrupted the hearing in Congress to decry former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's ardent support for Israel. 

One blew a shofar, and another shouted, “I am a proud American Jew!” and then “Let Palestinians live!”

Police quickly grabbed the protesters, but their shouts could still be momentarily heard in the Senate hallway.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said on Tuesday he would defer to the White House on whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or National Security Adviser Michael Waltz should face repercussions over war plans that were texted in a group chat that included a journalist. 

“But I think we should be critical,” he said. 

“The fact that classified information was put on an unclassified system, I think the secretary of defense needs to answer for that,” Bacon added.

He dismissed the need for an Armed Services committee investigation.

Bacon also called the White House's saying that no war plans were shared “baloney.”

“They ought to just be honest and own up to it,” Bacon said.

Bacon served nearly thirty years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, specializing in electronic warfare and intelligence.

“My communications to be clear in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe told lawmakers during a Senate hearing on global security threats.

Democrats have said the leaked military plans in a Signal group message that included a journalist show a sloppy disregard for security, but Ratcliffe said no rules were violated.

During heated questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said there's a difference between “inadvertent” releases of information and intentional leaks.

“There was no classified material that was shared,” Gabbard said.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said China has heavily invested in stealth aircraft, hypersonic weapons and nuclear arms and is looking to outcompete the U.S. when it comes to artificial intelligence.

Noting Russia's large nuclear arsenal, she called the country a “formidable competitor.” She added that while Iran is not currently seeking to build a nuclear weapon, it has become a critical supplier of weapons to Russia.

And North Korea, she said, remains committed to pursuing military capabilities that would allow it to strike U.S. forces in the region or the U.S. homeland.

Gabbard's remarks came during her testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee during a hearing on worldwide threats to the U.S.

“These actors are in some cases working together in different areas to target U.S. interests,” Gabbard told lawmakers.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, blasted Pentagon and intelligence officials for engaging in the chat, which he said revealed secret information about U.S. plans to strike Yemen.

Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the leak “sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior.” 

Warner said that if a lower ranking officer had texted similar secret plans, “They would be fired.”

The comments came at the start of a Senate hearing featuring testimony from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel.

The Arkansas Republican delivered an opening statement in which he ticked through a litany of challenges facing the United States from a report on worldwide threats.

Cotton asked, “Are our intelligence agencies well-postured facing against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is ‘no,' at least not yet.”

Cotton said that after years of “drift,” the intelligence community “must recommit” to what he said is its core mission of “collecting clandestine intelligence from adversaries.”

Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the committee, called the report “one of the most complicated and challenging” during his 14 years on the panel.

The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has told the leaders of America's intelligence community that it has become too bureaucratic and political to keep up with emerging national security threats.

“As the world has become more dangerous, our intelligence agencies have gotten more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we have been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said in his opening statement.

At the hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are likely to face questions after it emerged that Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other national security officials texted war plans to a group chat that included a reporter.

The federal lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in New York by the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent members of Columbia's faculty. The groups allege the Trump administration violated free speech laws and federal procedures when it cut $400 million in funding for Columbia over allegations of antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.

Tolerating that at Columbia risks turning other colleges into “servile arms of the government, advancing only the political preferences of the latest president in order to secure federal funding,” the lawsuit says.

The Education Department did not immediately comment.

Columbia on Friday agreed to several demands from the administration as a condition for restoring its federal funding. It put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhauled its rules for protests and student discipline, measures that the suit calls an unprecedented intrusion on the school's autonomy.

The Atlantic editor-in-chief's account of being added to a Signal group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised questions about how highly sensitive information is supposed to be handled.

The National Security Council has since said the text chain “appears to be authentic” and that it is looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain.

Signal is an app that can be used for direct messaging and group chats as well as phone and video calls.

It uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services that prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls.

In a social media post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “war plans” were not discussed and that no classified material was sent to the thread.

She said the counsel's office has provided guidance on different platforms that Trump's top officials can use to communicate “safely and efficiently.”

Leavitt reiterated that the National Security Council is looking into how a telephone number for Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, was added to the thread.

She said U.S. military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen were successful, “terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump.”

Since plunging during the COVID-19 pandemic, international student enrollment in the U.S. has been rebounding — a relief to American universities that count on their tuition payments. Two months into the new Trump administration, educators fear that could soon change.

Unnerved by efforts to deport students over political views, students from other countries already in the U.S. have felt new pressure to watch what they say.

Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. As the U.S. government takes a harder line on immigration, cuts federal research funding and begins policing campus activism, students are left to wonder if they'll be able to get visas, travel freely, pursue research or even express an opinion.

Some students are waiting to see how policy changes will play out, while others already have deferred admission offers for fall 2025, he said. Student social networks are active, and news about immigration-related developments in America — like a Republican proposal to prevent Chinese students from studying in the U.S. — spreads quickly.

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas says the news that several top Trump national security officials texted war plans in a group chat that included a journalist on a secure messaging app will come up.

But Cotton said on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” that he'd like to keep the focus on the subject for the hearing, which is threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the officials set to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

When Ash Lazarus Orr went to renew his passport in early January, the transgender organizer figured it would be relatively routine.

But more than two months on, Orr is waiting to get a new passport with a name change and a sex designation reflecting who he is. The delay has prevented him from traveling overseas to receive gender-affirming care this month in Ireland since he refuses to get a passport that lists an “inaccurate sex designation.”

Orr blames the delay on President Donald Trump, who on the day he took office issued an executive order banning the use of the “X” marker as well as the changing of gender markers.

“This is preventing me from having an accurate identification and the freedom to move about the country as well as internationally,” said Orr, who is among seven plaintiffs — five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs — who have sued the Trump administration in federal court over the policy.

Whether to return to the federal workforce is a decision confronting thousands of fired employees after two judges this month found legal problems with how Trump is carrying out a dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government. One ruling by a California federal judge would reinstate 16,000 probationary employees.

On Monday, the Trump administration sought to stop giving fired workers any choice by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the rehiring orders. It was not clear how quickly the nation's high court could rule on the emergency appeal, which argued that U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, went beyond his legal authority.

Although it is unknown how many federal workers are taking up the offers to return to work, some employees have already decided to move on, fearing more reductions down the road.

Others who were asked to return were immediately put on administrative leave, with full pay and benefits, or offered early retirement. For those who chose to return, some say the decision came down to their dedication to the work and a belief that what they do is important.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week, their first opportunity since being sworn in to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration.

The Trump administration on Monday invoked a “state secrets privilege” and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law — a case that has become a flashpoint amid escalating tension with the federal courts.

The declaration comes as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg weighs whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process.

Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm “diplomatic and national security concerns.”

Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.

President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, is facing a Senate hearing on Tuesday morning about his qualifications to run the massive retirement system, as well as his plans for the agency at a time when it has been targeted for significant job cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. 

The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.

Here's what to know about the hearing. 

The Senate hearing will be streamed at 10:10 a.m. ET at the Senate Finance Committee's website, which can be found here.

Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020. 

Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.

In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits. 

"The objective isn't to touch benefits," Bisignano told CNBC. "The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there," adding that he views himself as "fundamentally a DOGE person."

The executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to find fraud, waste or abuse within the system. 

Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner. 

The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.

Washington — Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.

As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named "Pete Hegseth" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about "weapons packages, targets, and timing" of the attack shortly before it took place.

The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be "authentic" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.

"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain," a National Security Council spokesman said.  "The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security."

When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.

"I don't know anything about it," the president responded. "I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it."

In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president "continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz." Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz "has learned a lesson, and he's a good man."

Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified. 

"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that," Hegseth said. 

Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X that no "classified" material or "war plans" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.

In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name "Mike Waltz" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled "Houthi PC small group," which he took to be a reference to a "principals committee," or group of high-ranking officials. 

The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, according to Goldberg.

Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been "part of a disinformation campaign" or an effort to embarrass journalists. 

"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans," Goldberg wrote. 

The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would "suffer the consequences" of additional strikes. 

On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name "JD Vance" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security. 

"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices," Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. "I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc."

Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: "VP: I understand your concerns — and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what — nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded."

On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because "the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility." 

"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing," Goldberg wrote. 

Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET. 

"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city," he wrote.

He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others: 

"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left," Goldberg continued. "No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left — or, more to the point, who I was."

At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.

"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones," Mr. Trump wrote. "The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective."

Goldberg told CBS News: "People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me — they like convenience. They're just like you and me — they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life."

CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.

"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans — and that could put our own troops in harm's way," Vinograd said. 

The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.

Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, "represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen."

"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous," Reed said in a statement. "I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately."

At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.

"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again," the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed "top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again."

GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that "we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans."

"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this," Bacon said.

As fallout from the Signal scandal continues, the leaders of several intelligence agencies — some of whom were part of the group chat that inadvertently shared war plans with a journalist — are set to testify before Congress this week.

The country's top two intelligence officials, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, are among the five officials expected to appear as witnesses in a pair of hearings in the intelligence committees of the Senate on Tuesday and the House on Wednesday.

The others are FBI Director Kash Patel, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse and Timothy Haugh, head of the National Security Agency and Central Security Service. 

The previously scheduled hearings, to be livestreamed on YouTube, were planned to focus on the latest edition of an annual assessment of worldwide threats to U.S. national security, mainly from China, Russia and Iran. But they are also likely to address a security concern that originated closer to home.

The hearings begin just a day after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, revealed that a top Trump administration official had added him to a group chat — on the encrypted messaging app Signal — about the U.S.' highly sensitive plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen earlier this month.

Gabbard and Ratcliffe were among the 18 individuals who participated in the text chain, a group that Goldberg said also included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Michael Waltz.

The National Security Council confirmed the authenticity of the message thread on Monday, saying it was "reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain." President Trump denied any knowledge of the incident when asked on Monday, and Hegseth told reporters that "nobody was texting war plans."

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized the security breach, with several Democrats calling for the participating officials to be investigated and disciplined. This week's hearings give Congress a chance to press intelligence leaders directly.

The incident raises questions about the Trump administration's handling of sensitive information.

Goldberg told NPR that he was not vetted before being added to the chat, where he was exposed to "operational military information" with details including targets, weapons and attack sequencing.

Such conversations are supposed to take place in what's known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), a secure room that top-ranking officials have in their offices and homes.

National security experts have voiced alarm that they instead used a publicly available messaging app. In fact, a 2023 Department of Defense memo specifically cited Signal as an example of an "unmanaged" messaging app that is not authorized to transmit non-public DOD information.

Democrats in Congress had roundly criticized many of Trump's security and intelligence picks for their perceived lack of experience during the nomination process — and are now calling for further investigation.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have publicly called for an investigation into what they respectively called "this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach" and the "damage it created."

"Everyone on the public WAR PLANS group text should immediately lose their security clearances and be fired," tweeted California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. "Their idiocy just put a giant target on America. We are not safe."

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters, "We're very concerned about it, and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis."

While Republican lawmakers have largely downplayed the incident, several have been openly critical.

Rep. Don Bacon, R.-Neb., told CNN he thinks there should be accountability for what he called a "security violation."

"Everyone should know better than putting top secret war plans on an unclassified phone," he said.

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., tweeted that classified information should "not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters."

"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again," he added.

NPR disclosure: Katherine Maher, the CEO of NPR, sits on the board of Signal.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week, their first opportunity since being sworn in to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration. 

Former FBI Director Christopher Wray routinely has said he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career when the United States faced so many elevated threats at once, but the concerns he more regularly highlighted had to do with sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism.

“We have to change to the dynamic threat landscape that is changing constantly not just in America but abroad,” Patel said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, citing the elevated threat from “narco-traffickers." But, he added, “we're not going to forget or ignore national security — never.” 

The hearings are also unfolding against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine. 

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with President Donald Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”

The Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday morning meet for its "Worldwide Threats" hearing, an annual intelligence community oversight hearing with testimony from the heads of the intel agencies, and the first opportunity for top Trump Administration officials to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

The hearing comes hours after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, reportedly texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg.

The National Security Council said the text chain, which appeared to take place on messaging app Signal, “appears to be authentic.”

The group chat reportedly included two of the officials scheduled to testify at Tuesday's hearing: Director of National Intelligence Tusli Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, NBC News reported. Senators said they expect questions regarding The Atlantic's reporting. 

Ahead of the hearings, here's what we know about the reported group text, and where things stand. 

The material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” Goldberg reported.



It was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.

Just two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

Vice President J.D. Vance in the chain of the messages questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of “a moderate to severe spike in oil prices” and if the timing of the operation might be a “mistake.”

“I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,” Vance argued. “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

Vance also made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the U.S. by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.

“If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in a back-and-forth with Hegseth.

“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,” Hegseth replied. He added, “I think we should go.”

The National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Hegseth, it included Vance, Gabbard and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.

President Trump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic' Where No One Will Ever See Them."

In a statement late Monday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team.

Hegseth, in his first comments on the matter, did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain.

“Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he makes his way to the Asia Pacific on his first overseas travel as defense secretary. 

"You're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist whos made profession of pedaling hoaxes time and time again," Hegseth added.

The sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth's office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information.

Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.

The administration's handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.

“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.

“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.

He said American lives are “on the line."

"The carelessness shown by Trump's Cabinet is stunning and dangerous," he said. "I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”

Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.

Himes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday's previously scheduled committee hearing.

Some Republicans also expressed concerns.

Sen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday, “We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants to learn more about what happened.

“Obviously, we got to run it to the ground, figure out what went on there,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.

Some of the toughest criticism targeted Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, said on social media that Hegseth, “the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in history, is demonstrating his incompetence by literally leaking classified war plans in the group chat.”

The handling of national defense information is strictly governed by law under the century-old Espionage Act, including provisions that make it a crime to remove such information from its “proper place of custody” even through an act of gross negligence.

The Justice Department in 2015 and 2016 investigated whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law by communicating about classified information with her aides on a private email server she set up, though the FBI ultimately recommended against charges and none were brought.

In the Biden administration, some officials were given permission to download Signal on their White House-issued phones, but were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the Democratic administration.

The official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to communicate what they internally referred to as “tippers” to notify someone when they were away from the office or traveling overseas that they should check their “high side” inbox for a classified message.

The app was sometimes also used by officials during the Biden administration to communicate about scheduling of sensitive meetings or classified phone calls when they were outside the office, the official said.

The use of Signal became more prevalent during the last year of the Biden administration after federal law enforcement officials warned that China and Iran were hacking the White House as well as officials in the first Trump administration, according to the official.

The official was unaware of top Biden administration officials — such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan — using Signal to discuss sensitive plans as the Trump administration officials did.

Oops, something went wrong

By Echo Wang and Alexandra Alper

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cerebras Systems executives were hoping the Trump administration would wave through a national security review that has left the AI chipmaker's IPO in limbo for months, five sources familiar with the matter said.

Instead, the company's highly anticipated listing has been delayed further as executives wait for the White House to fill key appointments and to wrap up the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential.

The most recent delay, which has not been previously reported, is the latest example of how bets that U.S. President Donald Trump would be a boon for dealmaking have not panned out for Wall Street so far.

CFIUS, which is led by the Treasury Department, reviews foreign investment in American companies for national security risks. The sticking point for California-based Cerebras is CFIUS's review of a $335 million investment by Abu Dhabi-based cloud computing and AI company G42. The UAE company's past ties to China have drawn scrutiny in Washington before, but its stake in Cerebras appeared poised for approval late last year.

Cerebras, a smaller competitor to industry leader Nvidia in the booming AI chip market, faces risks in going public without clarity on G42's investment, two of the sources said. Investors like certainty, and without it, raising money on the open markets becomes more complicated.

With the change at the White House just two months ago, key political positions remain unfilled, including the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security, who oversees CFIUS. While career and political staff currently in place have the authority to approve the deal, the inclusion of G42 made it politically risky over its past ties to China's Huawei, several CFIUS attorneys said.

CFIUS staffers might be even less inclined to risk a controversial approval on big, politically sensitive deals after seeing billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency cut thousands of workers in a bid to slash federal payrolls and root out disloyalty, national security lawyers said.

Career staff also need to establish trust with the new administration on delicate national security issues, said Jim Secreto, a former Treasury and Commerce official in the Biden administration.

“With a new administration, CFIUS staff naturally want to brief incoming policymakers and get their sign off before moving forward with a high-profile case,” he said. “That's a delicate and difficult dance, especially with an administration who has been so openly hostile to nonpartisan technical experts they refer to as the 'deep state,'" he added.

Cerebras and the Treasury Department declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. It is not unusual for presidents to take months to fill non-cabinet-level positions at key agencies.

G42 declined to comment on the CFIUS process. "G42's progress in the U.S. and in key European markets reflects the growing confidence in our role collectively building the Intelligence Grid for responsible AI," it said in a statement to Reuters.

TOUGH ON CHINA

The easier regulatory environment envisioned by bankers and CEOs when Republican Trump took office from former Democratic President Joe Biden is not panning out as well as many had hoped, corporate executives and dealmakers say.

The Biden administration expanded CFIUS enforcement and created new rules governing U.S. investment in Chinese high-tech companies, and the Trump administration is unlikely to scale any of that back, Jason Chipman, a partner at law firm WilmerHale, wrote in a February analysis.

"Indeed, it is more likely that the new Trump team will build on Biden's efforts to aggressively evaluate inbound and outbound investment, particularly with regard to China," he said.

While Trump laid out new parameters last month that "fast-track" foreign investments in U.S. companies, they further restrict those coming from China, particularly in strategic sectors like tech.

That is bad news for companies like G42, which is a major investor in and the largest customer of Cerebras. It had close ties with China's Huawei before Microsoft gave it $1.5 billion. To get the investment cleared, it had to cut Huawei off and sign a national security agreement with the U.S. last year.

Despite the holdup, Cerebras executives remain confident that the deal will eventually go through and intend to proceed with the IPO once it receives approval, according to three people familiar with their thinking.

Cerebras and G42 jointly filed to notify CFIUS of the investment. They later amended the filing, stating that the shares G42 would acquire are non-voting securities, which they argued should not be subject to CFIUS review.

Last September, the companies requested to withdraw the filing altogether, and CFIUS is now considering that request, according to Cerebras' IPO filing.

Cerebras, valued at about $8 billion following G42's investment commitment in May last year, has since nearly doubled its valuation, one of the people said. If the investment wins approval, G42 would end up with a stake of more than 5% in the company.

Cerebras is currently building a series of AI data centers for G42, and its technology has been used to train the Arabic large language model that Microsoft is using in its Azure AI platform.

President says national adviser Mike Waltz had ‘learned a lesson'; senate intelligence committee chair criticizes handling of classified information

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Democratic senator Mark Kelly of Arizona pressed Gabbard and Ratcliffe on whether the information on the Signal chat was classified or not.

“Decisional strike deliberations should be conducted through classified channels,” Ratcliffe said, answering Kelly's question as to whether or not launching a strike on another country counts as classified information.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dodged questions about her involvement in the Signal group chat to which an Atlantic journalist was added.

“Senator, I don't want to get into this,” Gabbard said when Senator Mark Warner asked if she had participated in the chat.

She has repeatedly said there was no classified information in the conversation.

Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel declined to say whether the bureau would investigate claims that cabinet members improperly leaked national security information in the chat.

“I was just briefed about it late last night, this morning. I don't have an update”, said Patel.

Warner asked for an update “by the end of the day”.

Senator Angus King pressed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on why climate change was not included as a national security threat in the report.

“We recognize environmental changes and their potential impact on operations, but our focus remains on the direct threats to people's health, wellbeing, and security,” Gabbard said.

King rebutted by saying that climate change exacerbates mass migration, famine, displacement, and political violence.

Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, should resign amid Monday's leak.

Wyden called the Signal chat “obviously reckless, obviously dangerous, both the mishandling of classified information and the deliberate destruction of federal records or potential crimes that ought to be investigated immediately”.

“I'm of the view that there ought to be resignation, starting with the national security adviser and the secretary of defense, Director Radcliffe and Director Gabbard,” Wyden said.

Democratic senator Mark Warner grilled Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen.

Gabbard claims that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

Ratcliffe said that, when he was confirmed as CIA director, he was briefed by agency officials about “the use of Signal as a permissible work use” and “a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration”.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, delivered the intelligence community's annual threat assessment, listing China's military, Mexico's drug trade and Russia's nuclear weapons among some of the most alarming threats to the country's national security.

Before FBI director Kash Patel began his remarks, a protester yelled “Stop funding Israel!”

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, called the protester a “lunatic”.

Democratic senator Mark Warner went on to describe the leaking of the Yemen war plans in a Signal group chat as part of a pattern of actions taken by the second Trump administration that weakens US national security.

“I can just say this. If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired, as I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error,” said Warner, the Senate intelligence committee's vice-chairman.

He outlined a litany of grievances against the Trump administration, from its cancellation of foreign aid to its firing of probationary federal employees.

“No, the Signal fiasco is not a one-off. It is, unfortunately, a pattern we're seeing too often repeated. I fear that we feel the erosion of trust, from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners, [which] can't be put back in the bottle overnight. Make no mistake, these actions make America less safe,” he said.

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, largely confined his opening remarks to warning of the threats posed from traditional enemies such as Iran and China, while implying that the intelligence community had lost its focus under Joe Biden.

“Given these threats, we have to ask, are our intelligence agencies well postured against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is no, at least not yet. As the world became more dangerous in recent years, our intelligence agencies got more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions rather than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we've been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said.

News that the Atlantic's top editor was added to a group chat where US national security officials discussed their plans to bomb Yemen is looming over the Senate intelligence committee's annual hearing into global threats facing the United States.

Among the guests at the hearing are two reported members of the group chat, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, the CIA director. As the hearing began, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee, condemned the leak.

“Yesterday, we stunningly learned that senior members of this administration, and according to reports, two of our witnesses here today, were members of a group chat that discussed highly sensitive, likely classified information that supposedly even included weapons packages, targets and timing, and included the name of an active CIA agent,” Warner said.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me, all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101.”

Warner called Monday's leak “one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information”. He also called it a “pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information”.

“The erosion of trust from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners can't be put back in the bottle overnight,” he added.

Democratic senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, began his remarks by condemning the reckless use of a messaging app to discuss a sensitive military strike in Yemen.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” he said, “it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101. Who are all the names? Who are they? Well, it apparently included a journalist.”

The Senate intelligence committee has started its “World Wide Threats” hearing.

The hearing comes a day after the controversial leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen via a messaging app.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, director of the FBI, are appearing before the panel.

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Yesterday, Donald Trump said he was unaware of the alleged US data breach, but he did share a joke his close ally Elon Musk made on X in a post on his Truth Social platform.

The UK's deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has reacted to the alleged US data breach.

Rayner told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that she “doesn't have much more to add” in response to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly accusing Europe of “free-loading” off the US.

Rayner said, “I don't recognise that there is a challenge between the UK and US relations, they are as strong as they've always been.”

Rayner added that “people say things in private messaging” and insisted it was “for the vice-president to decide and to clarify what he means by those conversations”.

My colleague Peter Beaumont has noted five things US adversaries could learn from today's White House leaks.

“Friendly and hostile governments alike will also have learned that what Vance, Hegseth and others say in public – in disparaging Europe, for example – they say in private, too.

“Any notion that the Trump administration's bark is worse than its bite should be thoroughly disabused by the contempt expressed by Vance for Europe and by the transactional nature of the conversation.”

Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Britain is a “freeloading” country that expects the US to meet its defence needs.

At the lobby briefing this morning, prime minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson spoke at length about the contribution the UK makes to joint military operations with the Americans, following the extraordinary leak of messages showing the contempt President Trump's most senior allies have for Europe's record on defence.

But the spokesperson also refused to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical, JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

At the lobby briefing this morning, asked if Britain was a pathetic freeloader, the PM's spokesperson replied:

You can see, from the way in which the UK has worked closely with the US, supplying regional security and defence, our commitment to working with the US on matters of regional security.

You'll know the UK provided air-to-air refuelling support for recent strikes against Houthi key rebel targets [the raid discussed in the messages inadvertently shared with Godlberg].

We also continue to support the US-led coalition against Daesh with routine combat air patrol over Iraq and Syria.

And we'll continue to work with the US and other allies to ensure stability and security in the Middle East.

Asked again if Britons were freeloaders, the spokesperson repeated the point about the UK working with the US closely in the Middle East.

The Trump administration is facing political uproar after the White House confirmed that a journalist had been inadvertently added to an unsecure group chat in which US national security officials planned a military strike in Yemen.

The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a Signal message group which apparently included Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.

He said he had seen classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck. 

The report sparked a firestorm of criticism from opposition Democrats and concerns among several Republicans.

Goldberg said he had been added to the message chain, apparently by accident, after receiving a connection request from someone who appeared to be White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz. 

"If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn't somebody who supported the Houthis, because they were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people who were involved in that operation," he told PBS in an interview. 

President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday afternoon that he was not aware of the Atlantic article.

"The attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. 

"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz."



The defence secretary also defended the military operation discussed in the chat, citing its success. When pressed by reporters, Hegseth criticised Goldberg as a "deceitful and highly discredited" journalist and resisted questions about the content of the messages. 

House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said the breach had been a mistake, but argued that the chat showed "top level officials doing their job, doing it well".

Democratic lawmakers demanded an investigation, casting the episode as a national security scandal.

"This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said his panel planned to investigate the matter.

"It's definitely a concern," he added. "It appears that mistakes were made."

Atlantic editor-in-chief Goldberg writes in his article that he received a connection request on 11 March on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be Waltz's.

Goldberg said he was then added to a chat entitled "Houthi PC small group".

He had initially wondered if the messages in the chat might be a hoax until four days later, Saturday 15 March, when he was sitting in a supermarket car park, watching Signal communications about a strike.

When he checked X for updates about Yemen, he wrote, he was stunned to see reports of explosions in the capital city of Sanaa.

A Houthi official posted on X at the time that 53 people had been killed in the US air strikes.

Signal is generally used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and to send disappearing messages.

A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the 18-person chat, Goldberg reported.

Accounts labelled "JD Vance", the name of the vice-president; "Pete Hegseth," the defence secretary; and "John Ratcliffe," director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chain. 

Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared in it, including Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

At one point during the communications over the strikes, the account labelled "JD Vance" seemed to disagree with Trump, Goldberg reported.

"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now," the Vance account wrote at approximately 8:15 on 14 March.

"There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. 

"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. 

"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc."

In a statement to the BBC on Monday, Vance spokesman William Martin said the vice-president "unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy". 

"The president and the vice-president have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement," Martin said.

The National Security Council confirmed much of the Atlantic report.

Spokesman Brian Hughes told the BBC: "At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic. We are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.

"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy co-ordination between senior officials."

Goldberg reported that the officials had also discussed the potential for Europe to pay for US protection of key shipping lanes.

"Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes," the account associated with Waltz wrote on 14 March.

The message continued, saying that at Trump's request, his team was working with the defence department and state department "to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans".

At one point in the thread the Vance account griped that the strikes would benefit the Europeans, because of their reliance on those shipping lanes, adding: "I just hate bailing Europe out again." 

The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: "VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC."

It is a significant move given that the Haqqani network is accused of carrying out some of the most high-profile and deadly attacks in Afghanistan during the US-led war in the country.

Some of the key reactions to reports that a journalist was inadvertently added to a chat with high-level Trump officials discussing air strikes in Yemen.

The Trump administration has been clamping down on students who have attended pro-Palestinian protests. 

The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg talks about what he witnessed in the Signal group chat.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that national security adviser Mike Waltz, a former congressman from Florida, should not resign after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, reported on text messages he received this month via the Signal app from top officials detailing U.S. military plans in Yemen.

“Should Mike Waltz resign? Absolutely not. He's exceptionally qualified for the job. He is trusted, trustworthy. Was an extraordinary legislator, but he is, he was made for that, that job, and I have full confidence in him,” Johnson said today on Capitol Hill.

Johnson added he has been told that the administration is determining how Goldberg's number was included and that officials will “improve the process.”

Pressed about discussing classified information on the messaging app, Johnson said it would be a "terrible mistake" for those involved to face "adverse consequences."

“They were trying to do a good job. The mission was accomplished with precision. I think that's what matters in the end," he said.

A decade ago this month, America found out that Hillary Clinton used a private email server to communicate while serving as secretary of state — and later that a handful of the messages had classified markings.

The revelations dogged her 2016 presidential campaign, leading to a lengthy FBI investigation and Trump's promise to put her in prison — “lock her up!” his rally crowds chanted — if he won. He was the victor, but he didn't pursue a tough-to-win prosecution of Clinton.

Now, two months into Trump's second presidency, the top officials in his administration were discussing sensitive military operations using a commercial, encrypted cellphone app called Signal, The Atlantic reported today.

Sharing the article on X, Clinton was quick to suggest more than a whit of hypocrisy in the actions of Trump's national security officials — some of whom harshly criticized her for mishandling classified information and not properly following federal document-preservation laws.

Attorney General Pam Bondi defended a Trump administration decision over deportation flights and directly took aim at U.S. District Judge Boasberg during a Fox News interview tonight.

"Judge James Boasberg is trying to control our entire federal policy, our foreign policy, everything we do, one single district judge," Bondi told host Sean Hannity.

"I'm fairly confident we will be successful, and this judge will be knocked down in his ruling, his very poor ruling," she added.

The comments come after an appeals court hearing this afternoon in a case that centers on the Trump administration deporting immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act after Boasberg temporarily blocked the flights.

Bondi predicted yesterday that the Supreme Court "will get involved" in the case and also criticized Boasberg.

Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment.

The Trump administration is refusing to disclose the details of deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act by invoking the state secrets privilege, according to a new court filing tonight.

The administration's filing included declarations from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Rubio said in his statement that disclosing further information about the deportation flights “threatens significant harm to the United States' foreign affairs and national security interests.”

He added that doing so could cause “foreign state governments to face internal and international pressure,” making them and others less likely to “work cooperatively with the United States in the future.”

The court filing is in response to a deadline of tomorrow set by the judge in the case on whether the administration was invoking the state secrets privilege in this case.

In his first public comments since The Atlantic story broke today, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth came out swinging. But rather than address the alleged classified information shared on an unclassified app, Hegseth took aim at journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote the story.

Asked how information about war plans was shared with a journalist and whether the information was classified, Hegseth went after Goldberg, calling him a "so-called journalist."

Asked why military details were shared on Signal and how he found out a journalist was on the chain, Hegseth said: “I've heard I was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that.”

He then walked away from reporters.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., faces mounting pressure from Trump and some of his allies in Congress to impeach judges who are blocking his agenda.

But legislation introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., could provide Johnson with an off-ramp, allowing his members to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that are all but doomed to fail.

Issa's bill, the “No Rogue Rulings Act,” would bar district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, the sort of rulings that have hampered Trump's fully enacting his plans on issues from deportation to federal agency cuts two months into the new administration. Johnson, a former constitutional attorney, threw his support behind the bill over the weekend.

“We have a major malfunction in our federal judiciary, and practically every week another judge casts aside the tradition of restraint from the bench and opts to be the Trump resistance in robes,” Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, told NBC News today.

Trump issued an executive order today that imposes a 25% tariff on imported goods from any country that directly or indirectly imports Venezuelan oil.

The tariff will be enacted starting April 2.

Trump previewed the order in a Truth Social post today that described Venezuela as “very hostile” to the United States.

Republican leaders have grown privately alarmed about the massive fundraising disparity their candidate, Randy Fine, faces in a special House election in a deep-red Florida district and have swooped in to help resuscitate his campaign at the eleventh hour.

House GOP leaders have in recent days been calling donors to plead for financial help in the race to fill the seat previously held by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security adviser, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. In addition, Fine, a state senator, has made personal pleas to Florida-based lobbyists and donors for a quick infusion of cash, according to two sources familiar with those conversations, ahead of the April 1 election.

While party leaders in both Washington and Florida are ultimately confident that Fine will pull off a victory, Republicans say they're frustrated that they need to intervene in a district that Trump won by 30 percentage points last year.

Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who leads the House GOP's campaign arm, said Fine “needs to do better” on his fundraising. But Hudson was confident Republicans would hold onto the seat, and said he did not expect the National Republican Congressional Committee to spend in the race.

Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden. Rosie O'Donnell. Trump has a long list of foes, and this weekend he added another: a painting of himself.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump blasted a portrait of him that has been hanging in the Colorado state Capitol and demanded its removal.

“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump claimed in a lengthy post last night.

He added that he “would much prefer not having a picture than having this one.”

Today, he got his wish.

For Democrats, reaching male voters became a political necessity after last fall's election, when young men swung significantly toward Trump.

But for some — like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore — it's also a personal goal. The first-term governor, who has spoken about his own struggles as a teenager, recently announced plans to direct his “entire administration” to find ways to help struggling boys and men.

“The well-being of our young men and boys has not been a societal priority,” Moore said in an interview. “I want Maryland to be the one that is aggressive and unapologetic about being able to address it and being able to fix it.”

Moore's not the only Democrat vowing to help boys and men.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in a statement that he will retire today as the Postal Service's top official.

"After nearly five years as America's 75th Postmaster General, and after informing the Governors in February of my intention to retire, I have today informed the Postal Service Board of Governors that today will be my last day in this role," DeJoy said.

DeJoy said that he has been working closely with his deputy, Douglas Tulino, in preparation for the transition, noting that Tulino will serve as interim postmaster general until the board of governors names a permanent successor.

"The Governors have hired a search firm in support of those efforts, which are well underway," DeJoy added.

NBC News reported last month that the board is preparing for a possible takeover of the USPS. Trump told reporters last month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would be "looking" at the Postal Service, which has been a target of Republican criticism for years.

Trump announced this afternoon that he is nominating Susan Monarez, the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to permanently lead the public health agency.

The White House withdrew the nomination of Dr. Dave Weldon, a Republican for congressman from Florida, shortly before his Senate confirmation hearing three weeks ago.

“Dr. Monarez brings decades of experience championing Innovation, Transparency, and strong Public Health Systems,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that Monarez will “work closely” with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if she is confirmed.

The White House said it was reviewing how the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine was accidentally added to a group text in which people who appeared to be members of the Trump administration discussed plans to launch airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen.

“At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the National Security Council said in a statement.

The statement was in response to an article published today by The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran national security and foreign affairs journalist. Goldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called “Houthi PC small group” on March 13 via Signal, an encrypted messaging service widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications.

Trump said in remarks from the White House Roosevelt Room this afternoon that the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai is opening a steel plant in Louisiana. 

Trump said that Hyundai is announcing a $5.8 billion investment in American manufacturing by building a new steel plant in the state, which he said would produce more than 1,400 jobs. 

"This will be Hyundai's first-ever steel mill in the United States, one of the largest companies in the world, by the way, supplying steel for its auto parts and auto plants in Alabama and Georgia, which will soon produce more than 1 million American made cars every single year," he said. "The cars are coming into this country at levels never seen before."

The automaker's factory was part of a broader investment in the U.S. Trump claimed that the announcement is a "clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work." South Korea had requested an exemption from the tariffs the administration has imposed on other major trading partners.

India said its overseas nationals must “comply with local laws and regulations” after reports last week that a Georgetown University graduate student from India had been taken into custody and targeted for deportation by the Trump administration.

“When it comes to visa and immigration policy, it is something that lies within the sovereign functions of a country,” Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, told reporters on Friday. 

The Department of Homeland Security has accused Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow who teaches at Georgetown, of making pro-Hamas and antisemitic comments, which his lawyer denies, calling Suri's detention “beyond contemptible.”

Suri's deportation has been blocked by a federal judge in Virginia who has ordered that he not be removed from the country without court approval.

The judge presiding over the Alien Enemies Act case today denied the government's request to lift his hold on deportations under the rarely used wartime law, despite President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on him and his order. 

Denying the government's order to vacate his rulings, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that the Venezuelan nationals the administration wants to deport under the law should likely be given the opportunity to challenge allegations that they're members of the Tren de Aragua gang first.

The decision came just hours before a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments that the deportations should be allowed to continue while it considers the government's appeal of Boasberg's ruling.

Former Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, announced this morning that he's launching a nonprofit group called the Dignity of Work Institute. 

The Democrat, who lost his re-election bid in November for a fourth Senate term, said in a post on X that the group's goal is to create an economy where people are rewarded for their work. 

"Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, work for tips or a salary, care for a child or for an aging parent, your work has dignity," he said. "Today I'm launching the Dignity of Work Institute to create an economy where Americans' work is valued, where they benefit from the wealth they create, and where everyone can afford a decent living. Let's make workers the winners in our economy."

In a video launching the group, Brown argued that Americans aren't rewarded for their work appropriately as corporate profits increase and wages remain flat.

"While workers are more productive than ever, costs keep rising and it's impossible to get ahead. The system is rigged," he said. 

Former acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, who served under Biden, will sit on the group's advisory board.

The campaign for Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, said today it raised more than $17 million in the latest reporting period.

Crawford's latest haul will bring her overall fundraising total to $24 million, which the campaign says is a record-high for any judicial candidate in U.S. history.

The April 1 contest will determine the court's ideological balance for the second time in two years, and likely the future of several issues related to abortion rights, unions and congressional maps. 

The race is already the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign ever. More than $80 million had been spent as of Friday, according to WisPolitics.com. The majority of that has been spent by outside groups or disseminated through the state's political parties.

The Crawford campaign released its totals early; the deadline for the latest reporting period (from Feb. 4 to March 17) is tonight. Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate in the technically nonpartisan race, has not yet announced his latest fundraising haul

Schimel received an endorsement last Friday from Trump and has been the beneficiary of millions of dollars spent in the race by groups affiliated with Elon Musk. 

In a statement, Crawford tied her fundraising total to the role those groups have played in the race.

“I'm grateful for the historic outpouring of grassroots support across Wisconsin from folks who don't want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court," Crawford said in the statement. "I'm humbly asking Wisconsinites for their vote on April 1 as we fight back against Musk and Schimel's corruption and extremism.”

Pete Hegseth will make his first trip to Asia as defense secretary this week, visiting key U.S. allies the Philippines and Japan, the Pentagon said.

In the Philippines, which is facing growing military aggression from China in the South China Sea, Hegseth will meet with his Philippine counterpart as well as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., local media reported. In Japan, he will meet with Japanese leaders and U.S. forces and participate in a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the fiercest battles in World War II.

“These engagements will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our alliances and partnerships toward our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. 

Before arriving in the Philippines, Hegseth will travel to Hawaii to meet with leaders of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam to tour military facilities.

There are no winners in a trade war between the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, the Chinese premier told a group that included seven U.S. executives and a pro-Trump senator. 

“China always welcomes companies from all over the world, including the United States, to share development opportunities in China, and will actively address their legitimate demands, treat domestic and foreign companies as equals, and continue to foster a sound business environment,” Premier Li Qiang, China's No. 2 official, said at a meeting yesterday in Beijing.

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump returned to the White House, emphasized Trump's call for China to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors and to end their “devastating” impact on Americans, a spokesperson for Daines said. Trump has cited the fentanyl crisis as justification for tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.

The Chinese premier's comments echoed those made over the weekend by Chinese ambassador to the U.S. Xie Feng, who told a U.S.-China relations forum by video link that "weaponizing tariffs would be a boomerang that only backfires," according to the Chinese embassy website.

Trump posted on social media that he plans to implement “secondary tariffs” on Venezuela that would require any country purchasing oil or gas from them to face a 25% tariff on goods imported to the United States.

Trump announced to Truth Social that Alina Habba, who is serving as counselor to the president, will be the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.

"Alina will lead with the same diligence and conviction that has defined her career, and she will fight tirelessly to secure a Legal System that is both 'Fair and Just' for the wonderful people of New Jersey," he said in the post.

The move is "effective immediately," Trump said. He said John Giordano, the current interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey, is being nominated as the ambassador to Namibia.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, a mild-mannered moderate, issued a fiery statement slamming Elon Musk and the Trump administration for recent actions curtailing the Social Security Administration, which include the removal of workers and office closures.

“The Trump Administration's callous indifference to the millions of Americans who rely on the monthly Social Security checks they have earned — and the millions more Americans who are relying on social security for their planned retirements — is the most direct assault on this vital program in its almost 100 year history. It is disrespectful, destructive, and dangerous,” King said.

“Social Security is not social media; this ‘move fast and break things' approach they seem to be following is a betrayal of the public trust,” King said in a statement. “The President has said repeatedly, during the campaign and since, that he would protect social security — but what's happening now in his name is anything but protection, and he should put a stop to it.”

Musk's actions on Social Security have sparked an elevated level of concern among Republicans, who have looked the other way on various other “DOGE” activities. It's particularly salient in King's home state of Maine, where the agency initially issued — then rescinded — an order that would make it harder for parents to register newborns for Social Security numbers at hospitals.

King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, added: “When the Trump White House and its corporate-suite cabinet sends reckless DOGE computer engineers into the Social Security networks, threaten cuts to the committed workforce who carefully manage this system, make it harder for citizens to interact with that workforce, or scoff at older Americans justifiably worried about late payments — as one of his billionaire cabinet members did just this week — this dismissive public stance frightens the very people who literally built this country, and who deserve a hell of a lot better.'

Trump will gather his Cabinet secretaries for a third known meeting Monday morning with Elon Musk expected to attend, according to a senior administration official. 

The official described the 11 a.m. gathering as a “follow-up on the last DOGE meeting,” in reference to a meeting on March 6 where Trump placed limits on the billionaire tycoon's authority amid backlash to new cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency.

A majority of American voters say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine than Russia in the war between the two countries. At the same time, nearly half say they think Trump favors Russia, while most of the remainder believe he favors neither, according to the new national NBC News poll.

Sixty-one percent of registered voters choose Ukraine when asked which of the two countries has their sympathies more, while just 2% say Russia. Another 35% say they are more sympathetic to neither side, while 2% are not sure.

A new memo from Trump that authorized the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to sanction law firms that file lawsuits they deem “frivolous” is a major escalation of his intensifying assault on law firms, legal experts and former Justice Department officials told NBC News.

The presidential memorandum, “Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court,” also ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to recommend revoking attorneys' security clearances or terminating law firms' federal contracts if she deems their lawsuits against the administration “unreasonable” or “vexatious.”

A federal appeals court panel of three judges will hear arguments today over the Trump administration's deportation of five Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. 

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will listen to arguments by both sides on the government's request to reverse U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's temporary restraining order, which effectively blocked the administration from deporting more people under the rarely used wartime law.

The arguments will take place at 1:30 p.m., and each side will be allotted 30 minutes to make their case. 

Trump continued attacks on Boasberg over the weekend, calling him a "constitutional disaster" in a post to his Truth Social platform yesterday.

SALT LAKE CITY — Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died Sunday.

She was 49.

Love's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.

She had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University's brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.

The Republican-led Congress returns today after a weeklong recess with plans to shift focus to the party-line bill to pass Trump's multitrillion-dollar agenda after having dispensed with a separate government funding deadline.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has set a target of passing the legislation through the House in April before the Easter recess, which leaves Republicans in the House with three weeks — and a lot of work. And then the bill would go to the Senate, which has a different idea of how to proceed.

Yesterday, Ukrainian and U.S. delegations discussed proposals to protect energy facilities and critical infrastructure, Ukraine's defense minister said, part of a diplomatic push by Trump to end three years of war.

The meeting in Saudi Arabia, which preceded talks today between the U.S. and Russian delegations, came as U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff expressed optimism about the chances for ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

“I feel that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants peace,” Witkoff told Fox News yesterday.

The NAACP and the National Education Association, along with other groups, announced this morning that they are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.

"Eliminating or effectively shuttering the Department puts at risk the millions of vulnerable students, including those from low-income families, English learners, homeless students, rural students and others who depend on Department support," the groups said in a press release. 

The groups said that the lawsuit urges the court to "immediately halt the government's attempt to dismantle the Department."

Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing the Education Secretary to start dismantling the department. Eliminating the department entirely requires an act of Congress.

Former President Biden and Secretary of State Clinton drew their criticism.

Multiple Trump administration officials who allegedly held classified discussions on an open messaging platform have in the past condemned the mishandling of classified records by others, including former President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have called for "consequences" for individuals who improperly shared classified materials, regardless of their intention. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth lambasted Biden for "flippantly" mishandling classified documents and suggested that if he had behaved similarly, he would have expected to be "court-martialed."

The condemnatory language these senior administration officials have used about prior breaches of protocol in handling sensitive materials adds a layer of irony to what experts are calling an unconscionable misuse of classified information.

John Cohen, a former national security official in both Republican and Democratic administrations, said, "from a security perspective, there is no scenario that justifies this type of information being discussed over a non-government controlled communication platform."

"Communicating sensitive, operational information in this manner increases the likelihood of inappropriate disclosure which places military personnel at risk," said Cohen, who is also an ABC News contributor. "There will also be questions about whether doing so violated statutes governing the safeguarding and retention of government information."

More recently, many of these senior administration officials had much to say about the yearlong investigation into Biden's handling of classified materials. The investigation did not result in any charges.

In January 2023, Hegseth, than a "Fox & Friends Weekend" co-host, appeared on Fox News and called Biden's actions "nefarious, sloppy and dumb."

"If the top man in the job was handling classified documents this flippantly for that long, why was that the case? Was it really that he didn't know? When you take something out of the SCIF [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility] if you're a senator, you know exactly what you're doing. You had to sneak it out," he said. The report included photos of boxes, including one damaged one that contained classified materials, including documents about Afghanistan that was found in the garage of Biden's home in Delaware "near a collapsed dog crate, a dog bed, a Zappos box, an empty bucket, a broken lamp wrapped with duct tape, potting soil, and synthetic firewood."

In January 2023, Rubio, also appeared on Fox News, where he said, "Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting -- it's a problem, I don't care who did it."

During her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton drew controversy by using a private email server for official public communications rather than using official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. The way many officials reacted has come back to haunt them.

In 2016, Hegseth told Fox News, "If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now... because the assumption is in the intelligence community, if you are using unclassified means, there is likelihood that foreign governments are targeting those accounts."

Reacting to a Politico article on Clinton, Waltz, who apparently added Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, to the Signal chat, criticized the Department of Justice for its handling of the situation.

"Biden's sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton's private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing," Waltz said.

In January 2016, Rubio also appeared on Fox News, demanding that Clinton to be held accountable.

"Nobody is above the law … people are going to be accountable if they broke the laws of this country," he said.

In August 2022 Stephen Miller, now Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy who was also in the Signal chat group, also posted his thoughts on X reacting to the Clinton email scandal.

"One point that doesn't get made enough about Hillary's unsecure server illegally used to conduct state business (obviously created to hide the Clintons' corrupt pay-for-play): foreign adversaries could easily hack classified ops & intel in real time from other sides of the globe," he said.

Only two weeks ago, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced a crackdown on leaks within the intelligence community.

"Any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such," she said in a press release.

Oops, something went wrong

Investors are betting on new Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan to turn around the troubled chipmaker.

While it's unclear whether Intel's financial problems can be fixed quickly, Wall Street analysts — and current and former employees — generally agree on what steps Tan needs to take, short of a breakup. Those steps include everything from cutting jobs to turbocharging Intel's young foundry business.

A semiconductor industry veteran, Tan was appointed to his new role on March 12. Investors applauded the news: Intel stock rose more than 15% the next day. Analysts liked Tan's experience as former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a semiconductor design software company, and his experience on boards of some 14 semiconductor companies, including Intel.

Now the hard part.

Tan is inheriting a company whose financial losses have made it a takeover target in recent months. Many Wall Street analysts and investors believe Intel — which is the only American leading-edge chip manufacturer — would be better off splitting up and selling its struggling manufacturing business. Case in point: The stock has risen on various reports in recent months of potential deals, some of which were allegedly being worked on with the support of the Trump administration.

Reuters reported last week that Tan plans to keep Intel's manufacturing business running for now and is looking to bolster Intel's faltering AI chip efforts to catch up to Nvidia (NVDA). He said as much in a letter to employees on March 12: "Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before."

Yahoo Finance interviewed four Wall Street analysts and nine current and former Intel employees — including high-level executives. The employees were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance.

And Intel's product business, which designs the chips, can't outsource to rival manufacturers so easily — Intel semiconductors are specifically made in accordance with its own internal manufacturing processes. Not to mention, Intel's billions in CHIPS Act funding requires it to retain majority ownership of its foundry.

Intel declined to make Lip-Bu Tan available for an interview but told Yahoo Finance: "Lip-Bu is spending a lot of time listening to customers and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success."

Here's what company sources and Wall Street analysts said he has to do to to avoid a break up.

Intel is one of the few remaining chipmakers that both designs and makes its own chips.

On the design side, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as AMD (AMD) and, of course, Nvidia in an increasingly AI-dominated industry. On the manufacturing side, Intel has repeatedly faced delays.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger attempted to grow Intel's revenue by opening its in-house manufacturing business — a "foundry" — to outside customers on a large scale. Foundries such as Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) produce chips for other companies. Intel historically produced chips for its internal product business before Gelsinger launched Intel Foundry Services (IFS) in 2021.

The foundry strategy had mixed results. Intel is set to achieve a big feat by launching a new advanced chip manufacturing process called 18A this year, and IFS has deals with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). But analysts debate whether Intel can sustain the foundry, which lost $13.4 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue in 2024.

Bottom line: Intel needs to attract more big outside customers. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success.

In order for Intel's manufacturing business to survive, the company must succeed in launching 18A. While Intel manufacturing employees had previously suggested that the new technology was having trouble, those same employees said this week that 18A is progressing — and Intel manufacturing staff is feeling "positive" about its success.

As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said: "[I]f the results are good and companies are happy, they'll increase their capacity at" the foundry.

Per Reuters, Tan is looking to boost Intel's AI chip efforts to rival Nvidia and others.

Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, Intel scrapped a multiyear project, Larrabee, to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD's graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU, which ultimately failed. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores.

"Intel has a very good finance organization, but the company does sometimes make these decisions that are overly led by the early years' financial outcome," said a former high-level executive. "You only learn from deploying. If you intend to be in that market long term, you might as well have access to the market, even if it costs you through the first generation."

Former and current Intel employees describe the company, whose staffers refer to themselves as "Team Blue," as slow and bureaucratic. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management.

It's a tough balancing act. The two current employees said any layoffs could depress morale and risk slowing the progress of 18A. Tan already has said Intel has "hard decisions" ahead. One of the employees said their colleagues are bracing for a potentially "huge amount” of layoffs in the second or third quarter.

They said their teams are already understaffed, and cuts to middle management would result in those teams being moved around, creating chaos.

One of the high-level former executives said, "The depth of talent at Intel is immense, and the loyalty that people have is astounding," later adding, "The answer lies in inspiring the people you have."

Oops, something went wrong

Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler said Tuesday that she is in favor of holding interest rates steady for "some time" as some economic data shows signs of softness and progress on inflation slows.

The Fed's rate-setting committee "can react to new developments by holding at the current rate for some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new policies,” she said in a speech in Washington, D.C., citing a "heightened level of uncertainty."

The central bank last Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Kugler is particularly watching inflation amid an increase in consumer expectations for inflation in the short term because of Trump's tariffs.

"I am paying close attention to the acceleration of price increases and higher inflation expectations, especially given the recent bout of inflation in the past few years," Kugler said.

Kugler highlighted that prices of goods have started rising again after falling over the past year, which she says is "unhelpful" because it helped keep a lid on overall inflation and also impacts inflation expectations.

Fed officials will get a new reading on inflation during the month of February this Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge.

Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in February, up from the 2.6% seen in January. Over the prior month, economists project "core" PCE at 0.3%, unchanged from January.

Kugler said the PCE shows "welcome progress" from a peak of more than 7% in June 2022, but "that progress has slowed since last summer."

Kugler also noted that some economic data has shown weakness, pointing to recent retail sales, and that the pace of hiring during the first two months of the year has slowed compared with the strong gains in November and December, but she said that could reflect weather disruptions and seasonal adjustment challenges.

Overall, though, the economy's "solid position" allows the Fed to be patient for now as it weighs uncertainties stemming from Trump's economic policies.

Trump on Monday said he would like to see the Fed lower rates because inflation is coming down.

"I'd like to see the Fed lower interest rates," he said Monday during a Cabinet meeting, where he stressed that grocery and energy prices are coming down.

"That's just my opinion, because things are coming down. We have inflation under control. Tremendous amounts of money will be soon coming in from tariffs."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the same Cabinet meeting Monday also promised inflation would be contained, stressing that the administration is reducing "excess employment in the government sector ... so everyone laid off from the government will have an opportunity to go into the private sector."

That, Bessent added, "is going to lead to disinflation" and get inflation "under control."

Oops, something went wrong

By Tom Wilson and Elizabeth Howcroft

LONDON (Reuters) -Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial crypto venture will launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin, it said in a statement on Tuesday, after raising more than half a billion dollars from selling a separate digital token.

The stablecoin, called USD1, will be fully backed by U.S. Treasuries, dollars and other cash equivalents and is designed to keep a value of $1, World Liberty said in the statement.

Dollar-pegged stablecoins such as Tether and USDC have ballooned in recent years and now act as a key cog in the multi-trillion dollar crypto trading industry, helping move funds between different cryptocurrencies or into regular cash.

Stablecoins in circulation currently total over $237 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko.

The tokens have become lucrative for their issuers in recent years as interest rates spiked. Tether, the issuer of the world's biggest stablecoin, made over $13 billion in profits last year.

Zach Witkoff, World Liberty's co-founder, said "sovereign investors and major institutions" would be able to integrate USD1 "into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions."

USD1 will be "fully backed by a reserve portfolio audited regularly by a third-party accounting firm," World Liberty said, without giving details of the accounting firm, or the date of its launch.

Founded two months before his victory in the U.S. presidential election, World Liberty's creation was announced by Trump, his three sons and the wealthy real estate businessman Steve Witkoff, who is the father of Zach and now Trump's Middle East envoy.

Trump, who campaigned on promises to be a "crypto president," has pledged to overhaul U.S. rules on crypto and reverse a crackdown on the sector that took place under former President Joe Biden.

His crypto business interests, which include a so-called meme coin launched in January, have drawn criticism from government ethics experts and political opponents over potential conflicts of interest.

BITGO AND BINANCE

The World Liberty venture, which aims to allow people to access financial services without intermediaries like banks, said last week it has raised $550 million selling a crypto coin known as $WLFI.

Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of New York payments infrastructure firm Borderless.xyz said USD1 would face stiff competition from incumbents such as Tether and U.S. firm Circle, the issuer of USDC.

"While launching a stablecoin is easy, building an ecosystem that adopts it is a far harder task," he said. "Is the President competing with other American businesses or will they find ways to partner?"

USD1's reserves will be held in custody by California-based BitGo, World Liberty said. BitGo's prime brokerage service will support USD1 by "providing institutional clients with access to deep liquidity and trading," it added.

USD1 will be launched on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains - digital ledgers that underpin the movement of crypto coins. World Liberty plans to launch USD1 on other blockchains in the future, it added.

Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, launched its so-called Smart Chain in 2020. It is the world's fourth-largest blockchain by the value of assets held on it, according to CoinGecko.

Binance's founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao was last year sentenced to four months in a U.S. prison, after pleading guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering.

Binance paid a $4.3 billion fine after U.S. prosecutors said it had welcomed criminals and failed to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups.

A spokesperson for Binance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about how the partnership came about.

Business owners have welcomed Liverpool City Council's decision to suspend controversial parking restrictions near Everton's new stadium.

An Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (Etro), including heavy restrictions on street parking, was introduced earlier this year within a half-hour walking radius of the Bramley-Moore Dock stadium.

On Monday, the council agreed to pause the restrictions until August in areas where businesses have been most heavily impacted.

Paul Blair, who owns the Hot Water Comedy Club, led a petition against the restrictions. He said that while businesses welcomed the council's decision, they were still feeling the impact of the seven weeks the rules have been in place.

"They've obviously seen an impact in sales and customers," said Mr Blair, who also owns Blackstock Market.

"There's been loads of concern about it moving forward, especially if they started to implement it every day in August, which is a huge concern.

"Hopefully there will be a proper economic impact assessment done and we're listened to before changes are made."

The council said it had received more than 5,000 responses as part of a public consultation.

Business owners in the streets around the stadium said they were very worried about the council's initial plans to enforce traffic restrictions all year round, rather than only on matchdays. 

Some even claimed the rules could force them out of business.

Mr Blair said more than 200 companies had been affected by the restrictions and complained about what he regarded as a lack of communication. 

"Nobody knew about it," he said.

"These businesses operate every day. We have staff every day. We have about 5,000 customers a week and they were literally impacted straight away.

"It's just lack of foresight, lack of any economic impact assessment."

Fraser Smith, managing director of the Downland bedding company which is based about 30 minutes from the stadium, said the council's concessions were "fantastic news on face value".

But he sounded a note of caution.

"It is only a temporary measure - we'll have to see what happens in August. But for now it's good news for all the businesses that are affected by this."

Mr Blair said he was pleased with the way the local community had come together over the last few weeks.

He said he was hopeful that now there is an open line of communication with the council, any future changes will be discussed and agreed with residents and businesses before they introduced.

The council's cabinet member for transport and connectivity, Dan Barrington, said the restrictions were part of an "experimental traffic order" so changes could be made once it was live.

"It's given us this space to be able to listen to concerns from people, particularly as it went live, and we've taken that into consideration," he said.

"We really want to get the best situation for everyone in the area," added Barrington.

"It's complex and complicated - the whole reason we did this as an experimental traffic order was because we knew ultimately there would need to be tweaks and changes."

Everton will leave Goodison Park at the end of the season in May before kicking off life at Bramley-Moore Dock in August.

The Ladies European Tour has launched further statistical analysis in partnership with Upgame, the market leading golf analytics app, for both the LET and LET Access Series.

Starting today [March 25] and available on LET's website and app, Upgame will have a dedicated page to show strokes gained from each tournament. The new feature is the first time that Upgame has provided a bespoke webpage for a major golf tour, showcasing strokes gained insights. This will allow for improved performance analytics, data-driven decision making, and customisation of training for LET members, in addition to more digital content for engaged fans. 

Since 2023, players have been able to record shots and view how they have performed in relation to intended targets. In turn, both players and fans have been able to access enhanced data points like shot patterns, benchmarks, and strokes gained analytics, all helping to enhance performance while digitally enriching the LET product around the world.

Some interesting strokes gained data captured by Upgame in 2024 has given some good benchmarks for players to target. To finish in the top 10 of the LET Order of Merit, the top 10 players outperformed the rest of the LET players by 1.87 strokes overall, excelling on approach shots with a gain of 0.85 strokes, and showcasing strengths off the tee (0.47 strokes), short game (0.20 strokes), and putting (0.34 strokes).For players competing on the LET Access Series in 2025 and looking to achieve full LET status they should look to the top seven average of the 2024 season which had a raw strokes gained of -0.99. 

Alexandra Armas, CEO of the LET, said: “This is a great addition to what already seems to have been a hugely beneficial tool for our golfers and fans across the globe. These advanced statistics allow our elite women athletes to benchmark their performance on a specific course against others in the field, giving a clear picture of how they compare and where they need to focus. Through this enhanced digital output, it's a further step towards developing the women's game to be played at the highest level.” 

Sameer Sawhney, founder of Upgame, commented: “We are delighted to be working with the LET as the first global golf tour to have a bespoke Upgame performance insights page which displays enhanced Strokes Gained statistics for all players, media and fans. We look forward to developing the platform further to showcase even more of the unique metrics captured, such as dispersions to targets and target lines.”

Upgame is used globally by 40 national federations and more than 100 collegiate organisations, with thousands of players and coaches utilising the app to their advantage.

Economic data releases and earnings

"Liberation Day" came early. Wall Street hinted at the start of a comeback in the hopes that President Trump's next round of April 2 tariffs will be narrower than many had feared. Investors are scrambling back into Big Tech, and for good reason. The recovery doesn't have to wait for the tariff deadline. The inklings of them not happening is enough.

The swift tumble of the Magnificent Seven and the not-so-magnificent puns that followed bolstered the case for the end of the AI trade. The shock of DeepSeek's success and the frustration over ballooning investment costs without clear returns was the kindling for Big Tech's unraveling. Talk of a new high-tariff era was the spark. But a change of heart speaks to the allure of seeing any setback as a buying opportunity. And it gets at the staying power of trillion-dollar enterprises.

When the market was down, with steep tariffs as the backdrop, the AI trade was unwinding. Under a more limited set of duties, however, beaten-down stock prices now look like excuses to buy back in. If you can wait out the trough, why not buy AI stocks on sale?

But after so much uncertainty, any clarity — for tech, for the market, for businesses, and for consumers — will come with a big asterisk.

It helps that the perceptions of a gentler tariff regime are coming directly from the White House. Trump administration officials have tried to spread the message that the market may be overreacting to the scope of the reciprocal tariffs. Several reports in recent days signaled that the levies will be more targeted than the president has let on, focusing instead on specific countries, about 15% of nations, with persistent trade imbalances with the US.

The market rejoiced at this semblance of clarity — but there's a “for now” coming. After four weeks of losses, coinciding with Wall Street's response to Trump's global trade remake, it's hard to tell if this is the start of a revival or just the latest gyration in an erratic narrative of threats, walk-backs, anticlimaxes, and muddled deals.

Is the clever move to follow the White House's cues to get ahead of the deadline? Or to wait and see how the cement dries? This is a market that has been burned before.

"Investors shouldn't be overly optimistic yet," said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. "V-shaped recoveries are rare, and sustained stabilization typically requires a period of sideways movement before confidence can fully return."

But for the tech optimists out there, the peeling back of trade uncertainty leaves the fundamental case for the tech giants intact: a wide moat around the business, an array of recurring revenue streams, and a perception of irreplaceability.

In one sense, the ticking time bomb of tariffs will come as a relief. The next phase of the tech trade follows reset expectations with more modest valuations, alongside revenue growth and a reinvigorated sense of urgency around AI innovation and supremacy.

Investors for the past month were confronted with new reasons to sell. When peak tariff uncertainty subsides, it should become more clear why they bought in the first place.

COVINGTON, Ky. — Incentive programs in the city of Covington are set up to attract small businesses and help support them as they get up and running.

The city say it's been successful in giving Covington a small business-friendly reputation.

The owner of a chocolate shop is taking advantage, saying he couldn't find something like this anywhere else.

Paul Picton has taken an interesting career path, going from selling jet engines for years to now, to selling chocolate.

“I was always traveling around, and I would bring chocolate home. And when I left the corporate world, after a few weeks I ran out of chocolate, and so I started making it at home. And the more I made it, the more people were encouraging me to bring it to a bigger audience,” said Picton, owner and co-founder of the Maverick Chocolate Company.

Maverick Chocolate has been in Cincinnati's Findlay Market for 11 years. It also had a store in Norwood, but Picton said the business was recently “essentially kicked out” of that space. He knew he wanted a small business-friendly community to be the new home for his sweet treats.

“Covington is one of the few communities around that offers any kind of incentives for small business,” Picton said.

He's taking advantage of two Covington small business incentive programs. The first helps with up to $6,000 in rent during the first year.

Patrick Duffy, business retention and expansion manager for Covington's Economic Development Department, explained.

“We want them to focus more on growing their business and expanding their business, and less about the rent, making their rent every month,” Duffy said.

The second program aims to help prop up one of Covington's best assets: its historic buildings, by also offering up to $6,000 to help fix them up. This one is for building owners, who are often but not always business owners as well. 

In Maverick Chocolate's case, it applies, because besides the chocolate shop, Picton bought a building that will become a chocolate factory. He said the 60-year-old building was an eyesore, and he's looking forward to using the funds to “pretty it up.” 

“We have a really rich history here in Covington, so it helps us preserve that, and honestly, these old buildings need some work. They're great, they're really strong bones, but sometimes they just need a little love to make them more inviting,” Duffy said. “What we want to do is help them pay for their project, up to 50% of the project, up to $6,000, to help them revitalize their storefront, and do it in a historically appropriate manner.”

There's been four rounds a year of these incentives since 2017. The latest featured the West Sixth Brewery, a CPA and Maverick Chocolate.

“When you transition into a new space, there's always some growing pains. It takes time for people to know where you are, and so a rent subsidy really helps in the first year as you're trying to reestablish or establish in the first place,” Picton said.

Duffy said it's helping with the overall revitalization of the city.

“It's bringing a lot of diversity of businesses, and it really makes Covington a place where people want to not only work, but enjoy their leisure time,” he said. “The small business owners are what make up our identity as a city. And they really give us a lot of our character.”

The programs are all reimbursement-based. Once a business signs a lease, they can submit their invoice for rent and Covington will reimburse half the rent up to $500 per month for the first year, totaling $6,000. The facade grant will also reimburse up to half the cost of a project up to $6,000.

A month ago, City Council approved an ordinance allowing cars with expired tags to be towed. Monday night, the sponsors of that earlier plan pitched another proposal, this time aimed at cracking down business owners that don't pay pay their property taxes. After a contentious debate, council opted to take a different route, referring the proposal to a committee to review, delaying a vote on implementing the plan.

The proposal was another piece of public safety legislation authored by Mayor Ken McClure, who is less than a month away from leaving the post he's held for the past eight years, and Councilman Craig Hosmer. The pair co-sponsored the ordinance, which would require applicants seeking occupational licenses to be up to date on their personal property taxes.

The amendments to the current ordinance would require that an applicant include paid receipts for "all personal property taxes due Greene County for property held in the name of the applicant for the previous calendar year." For those who might not owe taxes that year, a statement of non-assessment would have to be included.

City Attorney Jordan Paul said such a requirement has been found to be allowable under state and federal laws and that a similar requirement is already in place in St. Louis and Kansas City.

Greene County Assessor Brent Johnson addressed council and noted that while the city has issued roughly 11,000 business licenses, he has only received a little more than 4,000 business assessment lists from within city limits for the year. He said business assessment lists are similar to personal property assessment — owners list their assets, which for businesses include any equipment, furniture, vehicles, and any other tangible property that is used for the business.

If that list is never filled out and returned, taxes cannot be billed. Johnson also noted it is a matter of education — some business owners do not know that they are required to fill out assessments or what assets would have to be assessed.

Unlike the requirement of an individual property tax receipt for vehicle registration, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said the county has no effective mechanism to crack down on businesses that are not declaring the property they own nor paying their taxes. While collections from property taxes do not make up a large portion of the city's budget, these tax revenues do fund Springfield Public Schools, Springfield-Greene County Library District, and other tax entities.

Hosmer and McClure's proposed change would require those who want to renew or receive a new business license to show they have paid their business' property taxes. Hosmer said this would be a similar process to what the state already uses for vehicle registration, ensuring all business owners are held to the same standards. He highlighted SPS' need for the revenue, particularly as discussions of job cuts have surfaced more recently.

Councilman Abe McGull was the one to suggest referring the proposal to the Plans and Policies Committee prior to voting on it. He emphasized that he was not against the goal of the ordinance and ensuring everyone pays their fair share but rather wanted the details to be more fleshed out and allow time for public feedback.

"When you send things through committee, all those things are hashed out, everybody in the community is aware of it," he said. "But you're asking us, in two weeks, to pass this major piece of legislation that's going to affect a lot of people, the small businesses and stuff like that, and they may not even know about it. Not everybody watches the city council meetings."

The towing ordinance passed by council Feb. 24 in a 5-3 vote also had not gone through committees prior to being presented to council for a vote. Hosmer questioned why committee work was brought up for an ordinance specifically dealing with businesses and not for the general public.

"It's a privilege to do business in the city of Springfield, and we should make people pay their fair share, businesses and individuals both," Hosmer said. "So, I think it's imperative that we go ahead and do this, and I don't think it should be sent to committee, because the last time my bills got sent to committee, they never seem to come back."

Councilwoman Monica Horton and Councilman Brandon Jenson, both of whom voted against the towing ordinance, noted that the discussion was not about showing favoritism to businesses but ensuring all questions are answered prior to making legislative decisions. Horton noted there is no rush to put the issue to a vote.

"We might have had a unanimous vote on the towing amendment, if it had went to committee and we had fleshed out some of the issues that came before us to the public," she said. "I think that, you know, because we're having this type of tug of war here, I think that there is some value-add and some benefit to flesh this out a little bit better, instead of doing this sloppily."

Jenson said that when he was onboarded, he was told that there should be no ordinance that comes before council without going to committee prior. He recently referred Right to Counsel to committee. While there is nothing that requires ordinances to go before committee, City Code does state that it is council policy "to encourage the referral of council bills involving policy issues and substantive changes to the appropriate city council committee." Likewise, there is no legislation or strict rules about how long an ordinance, program or topic can remain in committee or what must come out of the process.

"I am surprised that the sponsors of this bill, who gave me that instruction, now have brought two ordinances forward that have a substantial impact on people in our community without following the process that I was told is critically important to good policy," he said.

Ultimately, the referral passed 7-2 with McClure and Hosmer opposed. Hosmer said he does not have another future ordinance planned regarding property tax enforcement. With upcoming April 8 election, the issue will be taken up by a new mayor and possibly new council members.

When the towing ordinance was passed last month, Springfield Police Department declared there would be an educational period before enforcement began. With that period over, SPD may begin towing vehicles with inadequate registration starting Wednesday, March 26. Police Chief Paul Williams had previously said initially officers will go after cars that are a year or more expired.

Both Johnson and Icet said they have noticed effects already since the ordinance passed. Johnson said the assessment office is seeing large lines, which are not typical for this time of year, particularly with individuals getting their assessments for the past several past years.

Icet said over the few weeks that the new towing ordinance has been in place but not yet enforced, the collector's office has seen roughly a 30% increase in the taxes collected from the same period last year, totaling roughly $230,000 more. He said this increase is more than what he would anticipate in a normal year and attributed the change to council's action.

The Big Four giants—EY PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG—have all launched legal arms to compete against the traditional legal sector, but recent cracks show that their vision is not playing out.

The Legal Services Act 2007 introduced Alternative Business Structure (ABS) licenses, which allowed the Big Four to compete in the UK legal market.

It wasn't the firms' first time in the market, having had legal practices since the 1990s, but the ABS saw the Big Four aggressively reshape their legal businesses.

PwC was the first Big Four to launch a dedicated legal services arm, PwC Legal, in 2014, followed shortly by EY and KPMG.

Deloitte completed the group with the launch of Deloitte Legal in 2018.

The push into the legal market was starting to look positive. In 2023, data by Saïd Business School revealed the Big Four generated $1.5bn (£1.25bn) in revenues from their legal segments.

The figures increased from $900m in 2015 to $1.2bn in 2017.

However, the cracks have started to show.

Last week, news broke that EY was making more cuts, this time for around 30 staff in its legal department, EY Law.

In a statement EY said: “These proposals would continue to strengthen EY's existing legal capabilities in corporate law, company secretarial, tax litigation and immigration but would, regrettably, result in a reduction of roles across other areas of the UK Law business.”

This isn't the first time EY has taken the shears to its legal arm. In December 2023, news broke it was shutting EY Riverview Law, the Manchester-based legal services business it acquired in 2018.

On top of that its headcount has fallen to around 160 after a series of high-profile departures, including nearly a dozen lawyers leaving for the City office of Hunton Andrews Kurth in December.

According to Scott Gibson, director of Edwards Gibson: “If we exclude Deloitte's ill-fated lock-stock and barrel acquisition of 27-partner TMT boutique Kemp Little in 2021, between 2019 and 2024, the Big Four's legal divisions combined hired 35 partners in London.”

“Against this, the quartet lost 40 serving partners (including two-thirds of the laterals who joined during that time) to rival law firms,” he added.

So, why are the Big Four not storming the legal market?

Christopher Clark, director at Definitum Search, says: “One challenge lies in the conflicts with the audit businesses, preventing a large number of legal instructions from getting off the ground.”

The Big Four's bread and butter is their accountancy departments, which are tightly regulated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

Plainly put, if the firm is auditing a business's financials, the rest of its business can't touch any work for that client.

Another issue is the structure of the Big Four firms. Nick Woolf, partner at Woolf&Co, highlighted that “however big their legal practice, they are always going to pale into insignificance compared to other parts of the firm.”

He noted the culture this creates explaining lawyers “who take pride in their own book of business, winning work themselves and seeing their own name in lights, are likely to be very disappointed by seeing none of these traits rewarded or even applauded in a Big Four firm.”

Woolf added that the Big Four had recruited the wrong partners for their needs.

Out of the Big Four, it seems KPMG is keeping its head above the water.

Gibson noted that the firm hired eight partners for KPMG Law UK in London versus just one for the rest of the Big Four.

“In 2024, whilst KPMG only managed to hire one partner in London, this was still 100 per cent more than the rest of the quartet combined,” he noted.

Speaking to City AM last July, the head of KPMG Law UK, Stuart Bedford, explained that the firm is not looking to challenge traditional Big Law on the likes of big corporate M&A deals. However, as he points out, there is a Venn diagram that overlaps with these firms and those deals.

“What we do is slightly different and tends to be the sorts of projects that actually those firms don't really focus on,” he added. 

This comes after KPMG revealed last month it launched KPMG Law US, the first law firm owned by a Big Four firm serving the US market.

A spokesperson for KPMG told City AM: “Whilst there is a lot of market uncertainty, we continue to grow and there are opportunities to help clients to not only remain compliant but optimise their businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory environment all while finding cost-effective ways of meeting their regulatory needs.”

An overview of the Big Four market, Gibson noted that firms “were able to sell themselves to lawyers with their ready made global networks, blue-chip client base, legendary organisational abilities, and gargantuan turnover.”

“In their numerous set-piece growth plans, the Big Four have themselves often conflated the volume of partner hiring from other law firms with success.”

He stated, “on that basis, with the possible exception of KPMG, the Big Four are failing.”

“If this was not already clear enough, unfortunately, EY's latest retreat from Big Law in the UK is likely to make it even harder for the rest of the quartet to attract and retain quality lawyers – let alone rainmaker partners,” Gibson added.

A spokesperson for Deloitte Legal told City AM: “Deloitte Legal's approach is blending legal expertise with our ability to deliver scale and leverage technology, alongside the broader range of Deloitte capabilities.”

“Our focus is on business solutions to the chief legal officer and becoming their business partner – a strategy that continues to resonate strongly with our clients and also with our people,” they added. 

This comes as the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

After two years of redundancies after redundancies, recent news showed the situation has escalated to the senior partnership. City AM has a long read on what is next for the Big Four.

Emanuel will become executive chairman of the newly-named WME Group, Mark Shapiro will lead it as president and managing director, while Whitesell exits to launch a new Silver Lake-backed venture.

Media & Business Writer


Endeavor is private once more, as the $25 billion deal by Silver Lake closed Monday morning.


	With the take-private complete, a slew of changes are in order. For starters, the newly-private businesses will go by WME Group, retiring the Endeavor name for public-facing purposes.




	Ari Emanuel, who founded Endeavor in 1995 and most recently served as CEO of the public venture, will shift to a new role as executive chairman.


	Mark Shapiro, who had been president and COO of Endeavor, will become president and managing partner, working in conjunction with Christian Muirhead and Richard Weitz, the WME co-chairs who will be co-chairmen of WME Group.

	And as widely expected, former Endeavor executive chairman Patrick Whitesell will exit to launch a new venture backed by Silver Lake that will “invest in and scale properties and IP across sports, media, and entertainment.” When the take-private was announced a year ago, it was noted that Whitesell's employment agreement included a provision for a new company backed by $250 million from Silver Lake.


	Emanuel will continue as chairman and CEO of TKO Group Holdings, the public company that owns UFC and WWE, and Shapiro will continue as president and COO of TKO.


	WME Group will include the WME agency, marketing firm 160over90, IMG licensing, and the unscripted studio Pantheon Media Group (formerly named Asylum Entertainment).


	“This remarkable moment— and the even more exciting future it launches—is thanks first and foremost to Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, and to the relentless and ambitious strategic vision they have shared for more than twenty years to build Endeavor into a global powerhouse across talent, brands, and IP spanning entertainment, media, and sports,” Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban said in a statement, adding that his firm has never sold a share in the company. “Silver Lake is proud and honored to be their partners since 2012 as they have continued to build the company. Over this period, revenue has grown by twentyfold. Silver Lake has previously invested on six separate occasions to support Endeavor and now, with this latest investment, it is the single largest position in our global portfolio.”


	“Mark Shapiro is an impressive, hard charging, creative, and determined leader who is driving and orchestrating massive value creation,” he added. “We look forward to continuing our work and partnership with him and the rest of the management team — including Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead at WME Group and Dana White, Andrew Schleimer, and the collective TKO leadership — all of whom are industry best.”

	











	“Our ability to deliver landmark partnerships, career-defining business opportunities, and enduring cultural moments is amplified by this transaction and the formation of WME Group,” Shapiro added. “The Silver Lake team has proven time and again that they are all-in on representation and content, and our clients, partners, and employees will thrive under our new structure.”


	“I am grateful to Egon and the team at Silver Lake for the trust they have placed in me as a founder and entrepreneur,” Emanuel added. “Together, we have created and enhanced a foundation unlike any other to accelerate value creation for clients and partners across WME Group and TKO, which I am excited to continue to build and grow.”


	“Everything we built at Endeavor would not have been possible without the partnership of Egon and the entire Silver Lake team,” Whitesell said. “Our industry is in the very early stages of generational transformation. I have never seen a more promising time for bold and ambitious entrepreneurs, creatives, and athletes.”


	“Silver Lake is enormously pleased and energized to partner and invest with Patrick in support of his new platform,” Durban added of the Whitesell venture.

Right out of high school, Kevin McAllister began working at the Webster Hall Deli in 1987. The owner, William R. Lee, taught McAllister “everything he [knows].”

“[He] taught me how to do cooking, and we used to make egg salad, tuna salad and all those things,” McAllister said. “Cooking is easy. You just gotta pay attention. That's all cooking is — paying attention to what you're making and just loving what you do.”

McAllister worked at the deli for 17 years before taking over. In 2004, he renamed it Kevin's Deli. A framed photo of McAllister and Lee still hangs on the wall of the deli today.

McAllister is now the owner and sole worker at Kevin's Deli. Students voted Kevin's Deli the best Black-owned business in The Pitt News' annual “Best Of” survey. Located inside Webster Hall, he serves classics like buffalo chicken salad and Reubens, as well as breakfast options. According to McAllister, his steak hoagie is “the best in the city.”

“No one's touching my steak hoagie,” McAllister said. “Everything I make is good. You're going to like everything, because it's not just a worker working here, it's the owner, and when it's the owner, he makes everything good because he don't want no bad remarks on them.”

McAllister has formed relationships with a number of customers. During a typical day, he sits and talks with an 89-year-old woman who comes in for coffee each day as they wait for the lunch rush. Another customer recently started running McAllister's Clash Royale for him in exchange for a free coffee maker.

“I don't want just a customer, I want friends,” McAllister said. “That's the way I look at business.”

On the deli counter, McAllister has a number of trinkets — a Pikachu figurine, Hot Wheels and a Rubik's cube.

“People do my Rubik's cube for me,” McAllister said. “Every time the one customer comes in, he does it in seconds. I'm like, ‘Wow. You know, customers are cool.'”

McAllister decorated the walls of the deli with tokens from customers — paintings of the Pittsburgh skyline from former residents of Webster Hall, a bulletin board filled with foreign currencies, and posters signed by Pitt sports teams. McAllister said he loves people, and that for him, interaction is “everything.” The deli is even where McAllister met his wife of 34 years.

Working in a college neighborhood, McAllister's customers are constantly coming and going. Every year, McAllister receives Christmas cards from one past regular and his family. They even bring him cookies sometimes. Another former customer and his family send letters yearly updating him on the family's doings. Both the Christmas cards and letters are taped up on the wall behind the deli counter. 

“Every four years, I get new customers because a lot of college kids work and live around here and go to school around here, so I meet them and become good friends with them, and then they're off to life, and I gotta find new ones,” McAllister said.

Jessica Stanislaw, a property manager with Webster Hall, has worked around the corner from Kevin's Deli for 11 years and enjoys the “fantastic breakfast sandwiches.”

“We have a great relationship,” Stanislaw said. “We are proud to have Kevin as part of our Webster Hall community. We make sure to include him in our leasing tours.”

Stanislaw believes Kevin's Deli was voted “Best Of” because McAllister's personality “can't be beat.”

“He is friendly to everyone and brings a nice vibe to Webster Hall and the surrounding community,” Stanislaw said.

Manny Basnet, a senior media and professional communications major, first heard about Kevin's Deli from a friend who frequented the place. His first impression of the deli was centered around McAllister's personality.

“He was really nice, and just made me feel really welcomed,” Basnet said. “And I thought that it was pretty odd for just someone making food to be that hospitable towards me, and it was a really pleasant experience.”
Now, Basnet goes semi-regularly, and his favorite menu item is the steak hoagie with fries. He said he thinks Kevin's Deli won “Best Of” because of McAllister's welcoming personality.

“When it comes to what separates food places, whether it's a restaurant or just a grab-and-go place, I think there's a lot of places that have really good food, but my favorite places are always ones that give me a good experience, not just good food.”

To McAllister, winning “Best Of” meant he was “not a prick or a-hole,” as he tries to do good things and be kind.

“I lead with kindness always,” McAllister said. “If you don't have enough money, you can eat here. I don't say that to everybody, but if someone comes in and says they only have $5, I'm not going to turn them away. Not going to do it every day, but I'm not going to turn them away the first day.”

            Spinning bright red handkerchiefs and dancing in step to folk music, more than a dozen human-like robots took to China's biggest stage in January, making a splashy debut at the annual Lunar New Year gala.
    


            The remarkable performance, watched by more than a billion people, is a high-profile reminder of how far Chinese humanoid robots have come. Over the past two months, videos of the country's humanoid robots pulling off moves such as bike rides, roundhouse kicks and side flips have blown up the internet, often amplified by state media as a key potential driver of economic growth.
    


            Even though very few of the humanoids are in mass production, competition with Elon Musk's Tesla, one of the acknowledged frontrunners in the field, is heating up. The promise of an “I, Robot” future, where machines handle household chores and serve as caregivers, has drawn nearly every major tech company in both the United States and China to bet on humanoids or robotics.
    


            Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have invested in American humanoid maker Figure AI. Meanwhile, Meta is planning major investments in humanoids, according to a Bloomberg report last month.
    


            Musk, whose Optimus humanoid has sparked global interest since its debut in 2022, predicted last month that the project alone could generate more than $10 trillion in revenue.
    


            While it may take another five to 10 years for humanoid robots to make a real societal impact, they could eventually become the next widely adopted consumer electronics, according to Xi Ning, chair professor of robotics and automation at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            “Everybody will need them, like automobiles, like cellphones, and the potential market volume will be huge,” he told CNN.
    


Goldman Sachs projected last year that the global humanoid robot market will be worth $38 billion by 2035. In five years, they estimate that 250,000 humanoid units, mainly for industrial use, will be shipped, while consumers will be buying about one million units a year in about a decade.
    


            Beijing, which is looking to replicate China's success in the electric vehicle (EV) market, wants to be at the forefront of that growth.
    


            It's eager to position the country as a global tech powerhouse and build on the momentum of recent Chinese achievements in the field - such as AI startup DeepSeek's reasoning model that stunned the world in January - especially as the US tightens tech restrictions on Beijing.
    


            Despite entering the race later than American rivals including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Figure AI, experts say Chinese firms are rapidly closing the gap. With their preternatural ability to optimize supply chains and cut costs, Chinese firms are also accelerating the mass production of humanoids.
    


            China already dominates the space for industrial robots, deploying more of them every year since 2021 than all other countries combined, according to the International Federation of Robotics, a Germany-based non-governmental organization.
    


            Compared to humanoids, industrial robots typically feature less advanced technology and perform less sophisticated tasks. They're widely used in industrial settings for manufacturing or transportation.
    


            As with EVs, Tesla was one of the few big-name frontrunners for humanoids when Musk introduced the project in 2021 and showcased an Optimus prototype a year later. Since then, Beijing has publicly thrown its weight behind the humanoid robotics industry with increasing funding drives and government support.
    


            In a 2023 policy document, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology identified the humanoid robotics industry as a “new frontier in technological competition,” setting a 2025 target for mass production and secure supply chains for core components.
    


            “China started relatively late, but it has its own advantages like a huge market and a relatively complete supply chain for the technology, which enables them to easily develop similar kind of robots at lower price,” said Xi at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            Over the past three years, various local governments – including major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen – have announced plans to establish or have launched investment funds dedicated to developing robotics, totaling at least 73 billion yuan ($10 billion), according to a tally by CNN.
    


            Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping chaired a high-profile meeting with the country's top business executives. Among those seated in the front row was Wang Xingxing, CEO of Unitree, the company behind the viral dancing robots, an indication of Beijing's growing focus on this emerging sector.
    


            Aside from Unitree, other major domestic players include Shenzhen-based UBTech, Chinese EV giant BYD-backed Agibot, Beijing-based Robotera and Shanghai-headquartered Fourier Intelligence, as well as EV maker XPeng.
    


            Experts say China still trails the West in certain key technologies, even as it dominates the supply chain.  About 56% of the humanoid robot supply chain companies are based in China, according to a Morgan Stanley research report last month.

            But China still needs to achieve a breakthrough in “core technologies,” such as processor chips, high-precision sensor and robot operating systems, to reduce its reliance on foreign technology, said Zhang Dan, chair professor of intelligent robotics and automation at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
    


            Artificial intelligence chips underpin humanoids' operating systems, guiding their thinking, perception and motion. Many humanoid developers depend on AI chip giant Nvidia's products. At its annual developer conference last week, the company unveiled a new AI foundation model for humanoid robots.
    


            Citing national security concerns, the former Biden administration steadily tightened export restrictions on advanced chips that could power China's military. Beijing has sought to develop its domestic chip supply chain as part of its self-sufficiency drive.
    


            Additionally, European, American and Japanese companies continue to dominate higher-end components such as sensors, as well as motors and screws that power robotic motions with higher precision and stability, according to a Morgan Stanley report last month.
    


            To overcome those shortcomings, Chinese suppliers are actively trying to do business with Tesla. Many of them have sent component samples for Tesla's review, according to P.K. Tseng, a senior research manager at TrendForce, a market analysis firm.
    


            “After Chinese supply chain manufacturers supply components to Tesla, they refine them based on testing feedback and then offer the improved versions to domestic manufacturers,” he said.
    


            Over time, this creates a cycle of continuous technological advancements, enhancing the quality of the whole domestic humanoid robotics industry, he explained.
    


            While technological gaps remain, China has emerged as a price disrupter in the nascent industry.
    


            Shenzhen-based Engine AI released its PM01 model late last year for just 88,000 yuan ($12,175), while Unitree's G1, capable of executing a roundhouse kick, followed at 99,000 yuan ($13,697).

            At an event last year, Musk estimated Tesla's Optimus to be priced between $20,000 to $30,000. Lowering prices for humanoids would mark a major step to their eventual commercialization and wider adoption.
    


            Beyond startups, established EV players like BYD and XPeng have also ventured into the humanoids space. Experts said years of cutthroat competition and a price war in China have honed their ability to scale production rapidly while driving cost down.
    


            Since the manufacturing complexity of humanoid robots shares similarities to those of electric vehicles, particularly in components like sensors and batteries, EV makers have an advantage in this space, according to Brady Helwig, associate director for economy at Special Competitive Studies Project, a US thinktank.
    


            Late last year, XPeng unveiled its humanoid robot, Iron, with plans for mass production by the end of 2025. Around the same time, BYD launched a recruitment drive to develop its own version, having invested in other domestic humanoids makers.
    


            As the country's demographic crisis worsens, the Chinese leadership sees humanoid robots as a potential solution to offset the shrinking working force, Helwig said. China's population has shrunk for three consecutive years.
    


            “If humanoid robots were able to be scaled and deployed widely across the economy, this is the kind of wild card that could really help alleviate that gap,” he said.

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Tuesday launched its first bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded product in the U.S. with a new listing in Europe.

The move comes a little over a year after the world's largest asset manager rolled out the iShares Bitcoin Trust (

 The recent trade tensions could present an opportunity for American hardware manufacturers to help ramp up onshore Bitcoin mining, according to a US Bitcoin mining supplier. 

US President Donald Trump's trade war with China and efforts to ramp up on-shore Bitcoin mining will be a boon for US mining rig manufacturers, which currently only hold a small sliver of market share compared to their major Chinese counterparts. 

The United States accounts for over 40% of the Bitcoin network's global hashrate but still leans heavily on China-made mining rigs. China-based Bitmain reportedly holds as much as a 90% market share in the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. 

“Trump's continued focus to support the US BTC mining industry highlights the urgent need to address US reliance on foreign technology,” Auradine's chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, told Cointelegraph in a recent interview. 

US Bitcoin firms hit a major supply problem last year, with thousands of Bitcoin (BTC) miners held at ports of entry by the US Customs and Border Protection. 

One of the firms affected believed it was due to a mistaken belief that the chips were illegally imported Chinese radio frequency devices. It took months before they started being released. 

Gupta said that US-China trade tensions have also disrupted the flow of foreign Bitcoin miners. 

“These trade tensions have increased supply chain disruptions with many hardware shipments facing delays and uncertainties,” Gupta said.

The US was already competing with China to win the high-end chip manufacturing market, but the recent trade tensions have only “intensified” these challenges for US-based crypto miners, he added. 

China-based Bitmain is said to hold the majority of the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. It expanded its production line into the US last December to improve supply chain efficiency.

Gupta said his firm could also stand well-positioned amid Trump's plan to ramp up onshore manufacturing as a “dramatic increase in demand” for electricity would, in turn, “put a tremendous deal of pressure on the electric grid” — making it more important for Bitcoin miners to operate off-grid. 

Auradine recently announced the launch of its new Teraflux AH3880 hydro-cooled Bitcoin miner, competing with the likes of Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan.

Asked whether a further uptick in Bitcoin mining activity in the US could hurt Bitcoin decentralization, Gupta said that securing the Bitcoin network with more energy-efficient solutions in the US would be a “net positive” for Bitcoin but said there could be risks if the increase outpaces technology in sustainability and decentralization. 

Over 95% of the network's hash power already comes from the US and China alone, according to the Hashrate Index.

Bitcoin (BTC) options worth billions of dollars will expire on Deribit on Friday. The impending settlement, though big, may not yield significant market volatility, the exchange told CoinDesk.

More than 139,000 BTC option contracts, worth $12.13 billion, representing nearly 45% of the total active BTC contracts across all expiries, are due for settlement this Friday, according to data source Deribit metrics. 

More than 65% of the total open interest is concentrated in call options that provide buyers with an asymmetric bullish exposure, while the rest is in put options offering downside protection.

Quarterly expiries of such massive magnitudes are known to breed market volatility, but that may not be the case this time, going by the continued decline in the bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (DVOL). The index has dropped from an annualized 62% to 48% in the weeks leading up to the expiry, suggesting subdued volatility expectations.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the annualized perpetual futures basis of around 5% on the exchange, signalling a calmer funding environment.

"Despite the size of the expiry, the overall setup—low DVOL, moderate basis, and balanced options positioning—points to a relatively subdued expiry unless external catalysts emerge," Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

Options skew, which measures the difference between implied volatility (pricing) for calls relative to puts, shows downside concerns in the lead-up to Friday's expiry.

That said, the broader outlook remains constructive.

"3-Day Put-Call Skew is Slightly Positive indicating some immediate downside protection demand while 30-Day Put-Call Skew is slightly Negative indicating a more bullish outlook over the medium term," Strijers said.

Also expiring Friday are ether (ETH) options worth $2.8 billion.

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.

Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector."

Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity."

“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ... More high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin as traders pare back bets on Donald Trump's bitcoin and crypto policy.

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.

Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.

Last week, Saylor predicted there's about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

As Bitcoin proxy BlackRock IBIT's correlation with the Nasdaq nears 70%, historical trends point to the likelihood of a soon-to-come divergence in performance.

Bitcoin's (BTC) correlation with the Nasdaq appears to be inching closer to a level that has only been reached twice before right before BTC price crashed 20%, data from Singapore-based blockchain firm Matrixport reveals.

In a recent X post, Matrixport revealed that the 30-day realized correlation between Bitcoin proxy IBIT and the Nasdaq is likely due to such factors as the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions.

“This correlation reflects the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season, along with ongoing uncertainty and the negative overhang from tariff discussions. As a result, Bitcoin is trading in line with the tech sector.”

Matrixport

Despite the current trend, Matrixport cautions that such high correlations typically do not last for long, noting that “such high correlations have historically been short-lived, suggesting that a divergence in performance between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq may be on the horizon.” The last two times the correlation reached this level, Bitcoin's price dropped by more than 20%, according to data from crypto price aggregators.

While the latest correlation activity could point to Bitcoin potentially decoupling from the Nasdaq's influence in the near future, there's still no clear timeline or certainty that such a divergence will happen.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds returned to weekly inflows as BTC settled back above the crucial $85,000 support level, which analysts believe is necessary for the next leg higher. 10x Research's Markus Thielen noted in a March 23 report that Bitcoin's reversal indicators have turned bullish, with the 21-day moving average now at $85,200.

A newly launched reserve of 10 million Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), valued at approximately $1.83 million, has been established to advance the cryptocurrency's use in real-world payments.

What Happened: The initiative, spearheaded by House of Doge, a newly formed organization dedicated to expanding Dogecoin's adoption through business partnerships and integrations, aims to position DOGE as a mainstream payment tool for consumers and merchants alike, Decrypt reported on Monday.

Unlike traditional reserves such as the strategic Bitcoin reserve, which are primarily used as financial hedges, this Dogecoin reserve will serve as a liquidity pool to ease and support transactions across a global network of businesses.

"House of Doge is laying the groundwork for a robust payments ecosystem designed to deliver liquidity and reliability," said Michael Galloro, a board-elect member of House of Doge. "The reserve helps ensure that Dogecoin can be used practically for daily purchases by smoothing transaction processing times."

The reserve is intended to address blockchain-related delays, which House of Doge sees as a barrier to the widespread use of digital assets in retail payments.

Beyond liquidity, the organization plans to implement loyalty programs and offer incentives to merchants that accept DOGE.

An official announcement of its first major partnership is expected in the near future.

Dogecoin has been gaining increased recognition in financial markets.

Asset managers like Grayscale and Bitwise have recently filed for Dogecoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), reinforcing the meme coin's growing legitimacy.

Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 7% as majors staged a relief rally on Tuesday driven by talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being more measured than initially expected.

As per reports, President Donald Trump's planned "reciprocal tariffs" set for April 2 may be more targeted than previously threatened, with some countries exempt and existing metal levies possibly not stacking.

The tariffs unsettled markets in February, shocking stocks and cryptocurrencies alike with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 17.6% to below $80,000 from its January peak.

Last week, the Federal Reserve raised inflation forecasts and lowered growth projections, likely due to Trump's trade stance, but described the tariff-driven inflation as temporary while maintaining plans for two rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets.

This, along with the possibility of milder tariffs, has boosted market optimism, and memecoins are leading the charge. DOGE, pepecoin (PEPE), mog (MOG), floki (FLOKI), among others, are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with the meme sector up 5.6% on average, per CoinGecko data.

That has beaten a 3% run in bitcoin, Solana's SOL and XRP, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index up 2.7%.

Memecoins jump or act as beta bets when ether (ETH) or bitcoin rise because they're highly speculative assets with amplified sensitivity to broader crypto market trends.

Retail traders often see relief in majors as a signal of bullish sentiment across the crypto ecosystem — chasing higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities like memecoins, which are typically cheaper and can deliver rapid gains in relatively shorter periods.

Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence (AI) majors are stable after Alibaba's Joe Tsai said he sees sign of a bubble forming in the ecosystem, the category is up 4.5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

“I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” Tsai said during an HSBC conference in Hong Kong. “I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec. There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.”

Investment in AI appears to be occurring ahead of current demand, Tsai believes.

NEAR protocol, the largest AI token by market cap, is flat in trading today, but up 14% in the last week as the market continues to positively digest news that Coinbase and the biggest names in AI were working together to collaboratively develop AI agent technology.

Story's IP token also continues to do well, up 8% on-day, as the project continues to secure notable Hollywood and Korean popstar intellectual property to monetize on its chain. Story has pitched its project as a way for rights holders to survive the AI revolution by easily creating frameworks to license their content for AI training.

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a notable surge, gaining 3% in the last 24 hours, climbing from $84,000 to $88,600, following reports that upcoming US tariffs on major trading partners will be less severe than initially anticipated. 

However, altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have outperformed Bitcoin's surge in the 24-hour time frame, being the top gainers in the ten largest cryptocurrencies list. 

Bitcoin And Top Altcoins Experience Significant Gains

Scheduled for announcement on April 2, President Donald Trump had previously indicated that he would impose both reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs on countries including Canada, China, and Mexico. 

However, anonymous sources within the White House, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have suggested that the president may opt for a narrower approach, focusing solely on reciprocal tariffs. 

According to the reports, this shift in strategy appears to signal a tempering of the administration's approach to a “potential trade war”, which has historically led to increased volatility in both the cryptocurrency and equity markets.

Dan Greer, CEO of Defi App, a decentralized finance platform, noted the correlation between Bitcoin's recent price increase and the news of the tariff adjustments. “This surge in Bitcoin's price coincides with reports that the Trump administration is considering narrowing the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2,” he stated.

The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has extended to the broader cryptocurrency market, with nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization experiencing gains on Monday. 

Ethereum rose by 4%, XRP by 2%, Solana, DOGE and Cardano led the pack with increases of 8%, 7.8% and 4.5% respectively. The stock market reflected this optimism, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices rising 2% over the past 24 hours.

Expert Insights On BTC's Recent Fluctuations

Greer highlighted that this development has alleviated some market uncertainties, leading to increased investor confidence across both cryptocurrency and equity markets. 

The crypto sector, which has faced mixed reactions since Trump took office, has been grappling with the implications of his fluctuating tariff policies. These policies have introduced a considerable degree of economic uncertainty, prompting many investors to retreat from riskier assets.

The anticipated tariffs—expected to raise the prices of foreign goods—could lead to inflation, further complicating the economic landscape. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $109,000 in January, has seen a decline, dropping to $78,000 earlier this month amid fears that aggressive economic policies could trigger a recession.

Colin Closser, investor relations manager at crypto wallet company Exodus, expressed his understanding of the crypto market's reaction to Trump's policies. “I expect markets to show emotion and volatility during times of change and stress in the United States, and you can see that volatility in Bitcoin this morning,” he remarked.

Since the spike, Bitcoin has seen a bit of a pullback towards the $86,930 level, with the most notable support floor between $83,000 and $84,000.

A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) wallet valued at $250 million has sprung back to life after an eight-year hiatus, triggering a wave of speculation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

What Happened: A Bitcoin wallet, initially valued at around $3 million in 2017, has recently become active after eight years of dormancy. The wallet now holds a staggering $250 million worth of Bitcoin.

Such occurrences usually set off a storm of speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Some members have suggested that the wallet's owner may have rediscovered their private keys, leading to the sudden activity.



See Also: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.

Previously, a dormant Bitcoin whale holding $29.3 million also became active after several years of inactivity. In 2024, several Satoshi-era whales suddenly resumed activity, including a wallet containing 2,000 Bitcoins mined in 2010 that made a transfer for the first time in 14 years.

Earlier on Sunday, a massive $252 million was transferred to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert data. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,334.

Why It Matters: The sudden resurgence of dormant Bitcoin whales can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. The movement of such large amounts of Bitcoin can create waves in the market, potentially leading to price volatility.

This could potentially signal selling pressure, which may affect Bitcoin's price. The re-emergence of these whales, coupled with the recent transfer of $252 million to an unknown wallet, underscores the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Defunct Japanese crypto exchange Mt. Gox made waves early Tuesday, moving large amounts of bitcoin (BTC) to two wallets, according to on-chain data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence.

The address associated with the exchange transferred 893 BTC ($78.11M) to its hot wallet, labelled 1Jbez and 10,608 BTC ($927.48M) to a change wallet identified as 1DcoA during Tuesday's early Asian trading hours when the cryptocurrency traded above $87,000 in the spot market.

The latest action is the exchange's third significant on-chain movement of funds in four weeks. 

The exchange moved over $900 million in BTC on March 11 and over $1 billion in BTC on March 6. However, the latest coin shuffling has not impacted the spot price so far, as seen early this month.

That's in stark contrast to mid-last year, when Mt. Gox's transfer of coins spurred fears of creditor liquidations, causing price volatility.

However, last October, the exchange extended its complete creditor payout deadline by a full year to Oct. 31, 2025, citing ongoing verification and processing requirements for claimants.

Bitcoin could surge to $110,000 before pulling back to $76,500, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.

Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, believes Bitcoin may have already hit its local bottom and is now rebounding. He pointed to the Federal Reserve's dovish stance and President Trump's flexible position on tariffs as factors boosting confidence. He also highlighted a drop in selling pressure, with U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recording net inflows of around $744 million last week, including $537 million from BlackRock alone, according to Farside Investors.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Bitcoin's rise past $85,000 has been seen as a bullish signal. Analyst Emmanuel Cardozo expects liquidity conditions and discussions about a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve to drive Bitcoin toward $110,000. However, he also warned that a correction to $76,500 remains possible due to market volatility.

With Bitcoin trading around $87,000, investors are watching central bank policies and liquidity trends closely. While the outlook remains positive, market corrections could still happen as traders navigate price fluctuations.

XRP and Solana saw the highest inflows among altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the week ending March 21, with $6.71 million and $6.44 million.

Despite Ethereum's losses, the digital asset market ended a five-week streak of net outflows, bringing in $644 million. Bitcoin led the recovery, attracting $724 million in inflows—its largest since January. The bulk of this came from the U.S., where BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) played a significant role, contributing to the country's total inflows of $632 million. Switzerland recorded $15.9 million, Germany saw $13.9 million, and Hong Kong added $1.2 million. Meanwhile, Canada and Sweden experienced net outflows.

Ethereum's poor performance weighed on the altcoin market, with other assets also seeing losses. Sui and Polkadot each had $1.3 million in outflows, while Tron lost $950,000. However, Solana's strong inflows come amid anticipation of the first Solana futures ETF in the U.S., which could eventually pave the way for a spot Solana ETF.

XRP also benefited from regulatory developments. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, a case that had been ongoing for years. This decision likely increased investor confidence in XRP, contributing to its strong inflows for the week.

Bitcoin ETFs have been a major focus of the market, particularly with the SEC's shifting stance on spot ETFs. Initially, futures-based Bitcoin ETFs gained approval due to the regulated nature of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which eased concerns over market manipulation. However, a lawsuit from Grayscale challenged the SEC's rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs, forcing regulators to reconsider. This led to the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that has significantly impacted investor sentiment.

Bitcoin's strong inflows helped stabilize the digital asset market despite Ethereum's ongoing struggles. While the altcoin sector as a whole was dragged down by Ethereum's losses, XRP and Solana stood out as exceptions, benefiting from legal and market developments.

A new species of dinosaur with strange claws has been unearthed in Mongolia by paleontologists.

This new genus and species is a therizinosaur, plant-eating, two-legged giants with long claws, and was discovered buried in the Gobi Desert, according to a new study published Tuesday (March 25) in the journal iScience.

Unlike other therizinosaurs, which have three fingers on their hands equipped with long, sharp claws, this new species only has two fingers. This unique anatomy inspired its scientific name, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, which is Greek for "two digits" and honors the Mongolian paleontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.

"Many species of therizinosaurs have been discovered, and this group had pretty much been defined by their three-fingered hands sporting large claws," study co-author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, told Live Science in an email. "To find a specimen with only two fingers/claws was surprising as this was so out of the ordinary for this group of dinosaurs."

Therizinosaurs are a group of dinosaurs that lived across what is now Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (100 million to 66 million years ago). Despite being part of the theropod group of dinosaurs — typically associated with carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex — therizinosaurs were herbivorous. These dinosaurs are known for their enormous, sickle-shaped claws, with some species growing talons as long as 20 inches (50 centimeters).

All other therizinosaurs that have previously been discovered, including Therizinosaurus and Beipiaosaurus, have three clawed fingers on their hands, making the discovery of two-clawed D. tsogtbaatari unusual.

"Therizinosaurs are already some of the most unusual dinosaurs out there, but Duonychus tsogtbaatari takes it to another level," study lead author Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, a paleontologist at Hokkaido University in Japan, told Live Science in an email. "This newly discovered species from Mongolia breaks the mold with just two fingers instead of the typical three, offering a rare glimpse into how theropod hands evolved and adapted." "But what truly makes this discovery exciting is the incredibly well-preserved keratinous sheath on its claw — the first such case in a medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaur," Kobayashi added.

The new fossil was unearthed during the construction of a water pipeline in the Bayanshiree Formation in Ömnögovi Province, southern Mongolia. The specimen had excellently preserved hands, with a 3D sheath where the claw — made out of keratin, like our fingernails — would have been. Parts of the arms, spine and hips were also preserved.

"The hands, a hallmark of therizinosaurs, are exquisitely preserved with all the finger and wrist bones intact in this specimen," Zelenitsky said. "Even the keratinous sheath of the claw is preserved revealing how big and sharp its claws really were."

Other species of dinosaur, such as T. rex, had two fingers, but this marks the first time a therizinosaur has been found with fewer than three digits. This species likely evolved to lose one of the three fingers of its ancestors, the study authors suggested.



The researchers think that D. tsogtbaatari may have evolved this unique hand in order to better grip vegetation, allowing for more efficient feeding.

"The loss of the third finger in Duonychus tsogtbaatari might actually have made its remaining two fingers even better at what they were designed for — grasping," Kobayashi said. "Based on the shape of its well-preserved claw and how it curved, Duonychus was likely using its hands to grab onto branches and pull vegetation closer, kind of like how chameleons do today." "We think many therizinosaurs may have used their hands for foraging in a 'hook-and-pull' motion, but Duonychus takes this to another level with its extreme claw structure."

—Secrets of 1st dinosaurs lie in the Sahara and Amazon rainforest, study suggests

Additionally, Kobayashi suggested that the claws may have played other roles, such as in "defense, courtship, or even play."

The researchers are thrilled by this discovery, as it not only reveals unexpected diversity within therizinosaurs, but also marks the fifth time that a theropod dinosaur group has evolved to lose their third finger.

"While more fossils would help confirm this, all signs point to Duonychus representing a true evolutionary shift, not just a fluke," Kobayashi said. "It's a remarkable find that reshapes our understanding of therizinosaurs and theropod evolution as a whole."

Scientists have discovered the fossilized remains of a new fish species called Ferruaspis brocksi, which lived 15 million years ago, and some of the fish have their final meals preserved inside their stomachs.

Fossils of 15 million-year-old freshwater fish discovered in Australia represent a species completely new to science — and they still have the remains of their final meals in their stomachs.

The fossils of the new species, named Ferruaspis brocksi, were unearthed by paleontologists at the McGraths Flat fossil site in New South Wales, Australia, according to a new study published March 17 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Inside several of the fish's stomachs were the fossilized remains of their last suppers, including bits of insect larvae, two insect wings, and a bivalve (a mollusk with two hinged shells, such as a clam or a mussel).

The discovery is the first fossil of a freshwater smelt — a small, silvery fish — in the group Osmeriformes to have been discovered in Australia and will help scientists determine when these fish arrived on the enormous island.

"The discovery of the 15 million-year-old freshwater fish fossil offers us an unprecedented opportunity to understand Australia's ancient ecosystems and the evolution of its fish species, specifically the Osmeriformes group during the Miocene epoch, 11-15 million years ago," study lead author Matthew McCurry, a paleontologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, said in a statement.

Osmeriformes is a broad order of fish that includes various smelt species found worldwide, both in freshwater and marine environments. Smelt are relatively common across the U.S., particularly in the Great Lakes, the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska, though some species are also present in inland rivers and lakes. There are at least six species of smelt across the country, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), Eulachon or Columbia River smelt (Thaleichthys pacificus) and delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus).



Scientists have long wondered exactly when smelt and related species arrived in Australia because the fossil record for this group of fish and their ancestors has been notably sparse. "Without fossils it has been hard for us to tell exactly when the group arrived in Australia and whether they changed at all through time," McCurry said.

In the new study, the researchers describe how they discovered the fossilized remains of F. brocksi embedded in goethite, an iron-rich mineral. By analyzing the fossils with high-powered microscopes, the researchers discovered that the specimens had been preserved with a surprisingly high level of detail. The position of the fish's bones and fins, cells that gave the fish color, and their final meals had all remained frozen in time for 15 million years.

Because the paleontologists discovered several fish from this new species preserved at the same site, they could piece together what the ancient fish species might have looked like, as not every fish was entirely preserved. According to the researchers, F. brocksi represents an early ancestor of species in the Osmeriformes order found across Australia and New Zealand today.

"The fossils formed between 11 [million] and 16 million years ago and provide a window into the past," McCurry said. "They prove that the area was once a temperate wet rainforest and that life was rich and abundant in the Central Tablelands, NSW [New South Wales]."

Their stomach contents also offer a glimpse into the behavior of this ancient species. "We now know that they fed on a range of invertebrates, but the most common prey was small phantom midge larvae," McCurry said.

Additionally, the unexpected discovery of fossilized pigment cells called melanophores allowed the researchers to determine what color the fish might have been. "The fish was darker on its dorsal surface, lighter in colour on its belly and had two lateral stripes running along its side," study co-author Michael Frese, a researcher at the University of Canberra and Australia's national science agency CSIRO, said in the statement.

Melanophores are responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin, hair, eyes and feathers.

"Fossilised melanosomes have previously enabled palaeontologists to reconstruct the colour of feathers," Frese said, but melanosomes have never been used to reconstruct the color pattern of a long-extinct fish species.

Alef has billed its Model A electric vehicle, which is capable of operating both as a road-based car and as an aircraft, as the cure for congestion.

A new kind of road-legal flying car is now a step closer to hitting the roads, and skies, after its maker Alef Aeronautics signed an agreement with aerospace companies PUCARA Aero and MYC to build it.

The Alef Model A is designed to work as both a road vehicle and aircraft, with its aim being to beat commuter congestion, representatives say.

Styled as a "retro" flying car, the Model A will operate as an all-electric car capable of vertical takeoff and landing. When in flight, the chassis can rotate 90 degrees to become a large, fixed wing for aerodynamic flight, with the body of the car made from mesh, allowing air to flow through when in flight mode.

When the body rotates, the "cockpit" section of the vehicle stays in place to keep the pilot stabilized. “To have a good distance, you need good aeronautics, which means you need wings,” said Jim Dukhovny, founder and CEO at Alef Aeronautics, in an interview with CNN.

"When you tilt, when you do the transition, you look like a biplane, you actually have two wings — a top wing and a bottom wing — which makes it incredibly efficient, incredibly battery efficient and gives it the long distance."



Unlike other flying car prototypes, the Alef Model A is only a single-seater and therefore not envisaged as a taxi or passenger vehicle. In 2023, Alef Aeronautics told CNN that the vehicle would have a road range of 200 miles (321 kilometers) between charges, versus a flying range of 110 miles (177 km). On the road, it will have a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour) — below the minimum speed limit for highways in states such as Florida.

Engineers have been building this vehicle since 2015, the year that Alef Aeronautics was founded. While they initially thought they could build one in just six months, it wasn't until 2019 that a pilot first flew a full-scale prototype.

The Model A is expected to cost $299,999 when it launches, and the company has received a reported 3,200 pre-orders to date

There is still a great deal of uncertainty over how easily individual customers can take to the skies, however. In October 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced new rules for "powered-lift aircraft," defined as "an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff, vertical landing, and low speed flight" such as flying taxis.

However, the rules state that only those already certified as pilots with a Private Pilot License (PPL), Commercial Pilot License (CPL), or Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL) will be able to fly powered-lift aircraft. This means presently that Model A operators will need to have spent several months and logged a minimum 40 hours of flying time to attain a license before being allowed to fly it.

Scientists have gotten the best-ever view of 'space tornadoes' howling near the Milky Way's black hole. The cosmic twisters could play an important role in distributing organic molecules throughout the galaxy.

"Space tornadoes" are swirling near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, new telescope observations have revealed in unprecedented detail.

Astronomers recently zoomed in on the cosmic twisters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. Although these rotating structures had been seen previously, the new observations with ALMA are 100 times sharper than the earlier views, the team reported in a new paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The researchers began by pointing ALMA at a region of the galaxy known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), which surrounds our galaxy's core supermassive black hole and is filled with seething clouds of dust and gas. The team wanted to uncover the mechanism driving the relentless motion of these clouds.

They used ALMA to trace certain molecular compounds — such as silicon monoxide, which is particularly good at revealing shock waves — within the maelstrom. This allowed the team to detect previously unseen details in the cosmic dust storms — including a new type of long, slender filament that seems to form when shock waves ripple past.

"Unlike any objects we know, these filaments really surprised us," because they appear to move quickly and in a direction counter to the structures surrounding them, Kai Yang, an astronomer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and lead author of the study, said in a statement.



The researchers describe these filaments as space tornadoes. "They are violent streams of gas, they dissipate quickly, and they distribute materials into the environment efficiently," the authors said in the statement. The team's observations suggest that, in addition to emitting silicon oxide, these whirlwinds might disperse complex organic molecules — such as methanol, methyl cyanide and cyanoacetylene — throughout the CMZ and beyond.

"ALMA's high angular resolution and extraordinary sensitivity were essential to detect these molecular line emission associated with the slim filaments, and to confirm that there is no associations between these structures with dust emissions," Yichen Zhang, an astrophysicist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a co-author of the paper, said in a statement.

Further observations with ALMA will help the researchers determine how widespread these slim filaments are within the CMZ and how they contribute to molecular cycling in the region.

Where is it? Tofua, Ha'apai, Tonga [-19.73996943, -175.072336]

What's in the photo? Smoke coming from a volcanic cone near the island's summit

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? April 23, 2022

This stunning aerial shot highlights the "looming threat" of a volcanic island in Tonga, which could violently explode in the future. The island also has a colorful origin story in Tongan mythology, which involves quarreling gods, a stolen mountain and a brightly shining anus.

The island, named Tofua, consists mainly of a massive ring-like caldera left by an explosive eruption millions of years ago. The caldera's steep walls stand up to 1,690 feet (515 meters) above sea level and harbor a deep crater lake that is around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) across. The island is part of the Ha'apai island group, a chain of volcanic islands and reefs located along a fault line between the Pacific and Indo-Australian tectonic plates.

One of the Ha'apai region's most famous inhabitants is the underwater Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano, which violently erupted in January 2022, unleashing a gigantic plume of ash and steam above the ocean's surface. The explosive outburst, which occurred around 50 miles (80 km) south of Tofua, released as much energy as hundreds of atomic bombs, unleashed giant atmospheric shockwaves that reverberated across the globe, triggered a localized tsunami and wiped out a small nearby island. It also added record amounts of water vapor to Earth's atmosphere.

Tofua is docile compared to Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai. However, the smoke in the image, which was pumping out of a volcanic cone north of the crater lake, known as Lofia, is a reminder that the island is still very much active and could blow its top once again in the future, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

"There's the looming threat that Lofia could erupt explosively, much like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai did in 2022," though nothing suggests an eruption is imminent, NASA representatives wrote in October 2024.

Tofua has erupted at least 12 times since 1774, according to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program. The most recent and eruptive phase began in 2015 and is technically ongoing. However, the activity has mostly diminished as of May 2024.

In Tongan mythology, there is a colorful tale to explain Tofua's giant caldera and the creation of Kao — a tall cone-shaped island around 2.5 miles (4 km) northeast of Tofua, which is just out of shot in the satellite image.

In "Tongan myths and tales," (Kraus, 1924) which was compiled from oral tradition told by local people at the time, American anthropologist Edward Winslow Gifford wrote the story:

—Erupting 'sharkcano' spits out a giant underwater plume in Oceania

—Antarctica's 'Deception Island' is one of the only places on Earth where you can sail into an active volcano

—Eerily circular 'Goblin Forest' surrounds sacred volcano with human rights

"Three deities from Samoa, Tuvuvata, Sisi, and Faingaa, conspired to steal Tofua. So they came and tore up the high mountain by its very roots and its place was taken by a large lake. This enraged the Tongan gods very much and one of them, Tafakula, essayed to stop the thieves. He stood on the island of Luahako and bent over so as to show his anus. It shone so brilliantly that the Samoan deities were struck with fear, thinking that the sun was rising and that their dastardly works was about to be revealed. Hence, they dropped the mountain close to Tofua and fled to Samoa. The mountain became the island of Kao."

It is unclear from the account why Tafakula's anus shone like the sun.

Reducing the amount of agricultural sprays used by farmers — including fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides — could cut down the amount of polluting runoff that ends up in the environment while at the same time reducing farmers' costs and perhaps even enhancing their productivity. A classic win-win-win.

A team of researchers at MIT and a spinoff company they launched has developed a system to do just that. Their technology adds a thin coating around droplets as they are being sprayed onto a field, greatly reducing their tendency to bounce off leaves and end up wasted on the ground. Instead, the coated droplets stick to the leaves as intended.

The research is described today in the journal Soft Matter, in a paper by recent MIT alumni Vishnu Jayaprakash PhD '22 and Sreedath Panat PhD '23, graduate student Simon Rufer, and MIT professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi.

A recent study found that if farmers didn't use pesticides, they would lose 78 percent of fruit, 54 percent of vegetable, and 32 percent of cereal production. Despite their importance, a lack of technology that monitors and optimizes sprays has forced farmers to rely on personal experience and rules of thumb to decide how to apply these chemicals. As a result, these chemicals tend to be over-sprayed, leading to runoff and chemicals ending up in waterways or building up in the soil.

Pesticides take a significant toll on global health and the environment, the researchers point out. A recent study found that 31 percent of agricultural soils around the world were at high risk from pesticide pollution. And agricultural chemicals are a major expense for farmers: In the U.S., they spend $16 billion a year just on pesticides.

Making spraying more efficient is one of the best ways to make food production more sustainable and economical. Agricultural spraying essentially boils down to mixing chemicals into water and spraying water droplets onto plant leaves, which are often inherently water-repellent. “Over more than a decade of research in my lab at MIT, we have developed fundamental understandings of spraying and the interaction between droplets and plants — studying when they bounce and all the ways we have to make them stick better and enhance coverage,” Varanasi says.

The team had previously found a way to reduce the amount of sprayed liquid that bounces away from the leaves it strikes, which involved using two spray nozzles instead of one and spraying mixtures with opposite electrical charges. But they found that farmers were reluctant to take on the expense and effort of converting their spraying equipment to a two-nozzle system. So, the team looked for a simpler alternative.

They discovered they could achieve the same improvement in droplet retention using a single-nozzle system that can be easily adapted to existing sprayers. Instead of giving the droplets of pesticide an electric charge, they coat each droplet with a vanishingly thin layer of an oily material.

In their new study, they conducted lab experiments with high-speed cameras. When they sprayed droplets with no special treatment onto a water-repelling (hydrophobic) surface similar to that of many plant leaves, the droplets initially spread out into a pancake-like disk, then rebounded back into a ball and bounced away. But when the researchers coated the surface of the droplets with a tiny amount of oil — making up less than 1 percent of the droplet's liquid — the droplets spread out and then stayed put. The treatment improved the droplets' “stickiness” by as much as a hundredfold.

“When these droplets are hitting the surface and as they expand, they form this oil ring that essentially pins the droplet to the surface,” Rufer says. The researchers tried a wide variety of conditions, he says, explaining that they conducted hundreds of experiments, “with different impact velocities, different droplet sizes, different angles of inclination, all the things that fully characterize this phenomenon.” Though different oils varied in their effectiveness, all of them were effective. “Regardless of the impact velocity and the oils, we saw that the rebound height was significantly lower,” he says.

The effect works with remarkably small amounts of oil. In their initial tests they used 1 percent oil compared to the water, then they tried a 0.1 percent, and even .01. The improvement in droplets sticking to the surface continued at a 0.1 percent, but began to break down beyond that. “Basically, this oil film acts as a way to trap that droplet on the surface, because oil is very attracted to the surface and sort of holds the water in place,” Rufer says.

In the researchers' initial tests they used soybean oil for the coating, figuring this would be a familiar material for the farmers they were working with, many of whom were growing soybeans. But it turned out that though they were producing the beans, the oil was not part of their usual supply chain for use on the farm. In further tests, the researchers found that several chemicals that farmers were already routinely using in their spraying, called surfactants and adjuvants, could be used instead, and that some of these provided the same benefits in keeping the droplets stuck on the leaves.

“That way,” Varanasi says, “we're not introducing a new chemical or changed chemistries into their field, but they're using things they've known for a long time.”

Varanasi and Jayaprakash formed a company called AgZen to commercialize the system. In order to prove how much their coating system improves the amount of spray that stays on the plant, they first had to develop a system to monitor spraying in real time. That system, which they call RealCoverage, has been deployed on farms ranging in size from a few dozen acres to hundreds of thousands of acres, and many different crop types, and has saved farmers 30 to 50 percent on their pesticide expenditures, just by improving the controls on the existing sprays. That system is being deployed to 920,000 acres of crops in 2025, the company says, including some in California, Texas, the Midwest, France and Italy. Adding the cloaking system using new nozzles, the researchers say, should yield at least another doubling of efficiency.

“You could give back a billion dollars to U.S. growers if you just saved 6 percent of their pesticide budget,” says Jayaprakash, lead author of the research paper and CEO of AgZen. “In the lab we got 300 percent of extra product on the plant. So that means we could get orders of magnitude reductions in the amount of pesticides that farmers are spraying.”

Farmers had already been using these surfactant and adjuvant chemicals as a way to enhance spraying effectiveness, but they were mixing it with a water solution. For it to have any effect, they had to use much more of these materials, risking causing burns to the plants. The new coating system reduces the amount of these materials needed, while improving their effectiveness.

In field tests conducted by AgZen, “we doubled the amount of product on kale and soybeans just by changing where the adjuvant was,” from mixed in to being a coating, Jayaprakash says. It's convenient for farmers because “all they're doing is changing their nozzle. They're getting all their existing chemicals to work better, and they're getting more product on the plant.”

And it's not just for pesticides. “The really cool thing is this is useful for every chemistry that's going on the leaf, be it an insecticide, a herbicide, a fungicide, or foliar nutrition,” Varanasi says. This year, they plan to introduce the new spray system on about 30,000 acres of cropland.

Varanasi says that with projected world population growth, “the amount of food production has got to double, and we are limited in so many resources, for example we cannot double the arable land. … This means that every acre we currently farm must become more efficient and able to do more with less.” These improved spraying technologies, for both monitoring the spraying and coating the droplets, Varanasi says, “I think is fundamentally changing agriculture.”

AgZen has recently raised $10 million in venture financing to support rapid commercial deployment of these technologies that can improve the control of chemical inputs into agriculture. “The knowledge we are gathering from every leaf, combined with our expertise in interfacial science and fluid mechanics, is giving us unparalleled insights into how chemicals are used and developed — and it's clear that we can deliver value across the entire agrochemical supply chain,” Varanasi says  “Our mission is to use these technologies to deliver improved outcomes and reduced costs for the ag industry.”

Many businesses struggle to stand out in crowded markets and achieve significant growth due to ineffective brand differentiation and inefficient marketing strategies. This results in wasted resources and missed opportunities for expansion. Rival solves this problem by providing challenger marketing strategies that help businesses build strong, differentiated brands and implement effective go-to-market plans, enabling them to break through in competitive markets and drive sustainable growth.

Rival, a startup that develops technology to enable millions of users to create and share 3D content, has emerged from stealth today and announced it has raised $4.2 million in the pre-seed round, led by Speedinvest and with participation from New Renaissance Ventures and high-profile angels. The valuation was not disclosed to TFN. 

Operating in stealth mode allowed Rival to develop its groundbreaking technology away from competitors' scrutiny while refining its approach. This strategy enabled the company to perfect its 2D-to-3D conversion technology before revealing it to the market, giving it a significant competitive edge in the rapidly evolving spatial computing landscape.

With the new funding, the company plans to grow its team with more ML/AI engineers and expand its presence in the U.S. market.

Rival Technologies was founded in 2023 by Alexander Oppermann and Konrad Melzer (who previously developed security software for the German FBI) alongside a team of former Google, Meta, and Amazon engineers. Based in London, the startup aims to grow the spatial computing market by addressing the shortage of content for the expanding range of headsets.

Alexander Oppermann, CEO of Rival, told TFN: “Rival started as a small side project where we tried to produce 3D content for ourselves and our friends playing Population:One. After seeing how difficult it was to produce and distribute user-generated VR content, we developed the idea to build tools and a platform to help the creator economy transition to VR.”

The spatial computing market faces a paradox: while hardware capabilities advance rapidly with devices like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, adoption lags due to insufficient compelling content. This content gap presents both a challenge and a massive market opportunity, with spatial computing expected to grow from approximately $110 billion in 2023 to $1.7 trillion by 2033. Rival's approach tackles this bottleneck by democratising 3D content creation.

Rival has created a platform that lets users browse immersive 3D short-form content in their spatial computing headset, similar to TikTok or Instagram Reels. Beyond uploading conventional 3D content, users can transform any 2D video into an immersive 3D experience using the startup's first-of-its-kind 2D-to-3D foundational AI model. This technology leverages recent breakthroughs in AI-driven image processing, using sophisticated depth estimation algorithms and neural rendering techniques to create realistic 3D representations with appropriate textures and lighting.

Oppermann told TFN: “Our product is built from the ground up around AI. To enable user-generated content, you must solve both production and distribution — it's difficult, and no one else is doing that. Content production and editing are especially challenging compared to 2D. AI will drastically change the trajectory of spatial computing—we're one of the first to build it for this space.”

While spatial computing hardware advances rapidly, limited content availability slows mass adoption. Rival's 3D AI technology catalyses the unlock of spatial computing's potential, enabling users to create, share, and explore immersive content.

Their comprehensive platform approach sets Rival apart in the 2D-to-3D conversion space. Rather than just providing conversion tools, Rival is building an entire ecosystem for creating, sharing, and experiencing 3D content. “There are several players, including YoutubeVR, whose products overlap with parts of what we do, but no one is building the entire value chain from tools to distribution to enable user-generated content in VR,” noted Oppermann.

“Rival will become the essential infrastructure for the spatial computing era, making 3D creation accessible to millions of everyday users. We're building a platform that removes technical barriers, enabling a new generation of creators to shape immersive digital experiences. Our technology solves the critical content gap currently limiting spatial computing's potential,” added Oppermann.

As spatial computing evolves, Rival's technology could enable applications ranging from immersive educational experiences to virtual shopping environments where products can be viewed in 3D. The technology could also support professional visualisation in architecture, medicine, and industrial design.

Oppermann concluded, “We will relentlessly release tech to truly enable users to produce AR/VR content, and bring millions of VR users currently scattered across the many games and hardware platforms together”

Victor Huerbe, Principal with Speedinvest's Marketplaces & Consumer investment team, says: “Spatial computing is at an inflection point, but the biggest gap is content. Rival is solving this with AI that makes 3D creation effortless, unlocking a whole new wave of immersive experiences.

“Alex, Konrad, and the team move fast, and they've quietly built something game-changing. We backed them because they're not just iterating on existing tools, they're building the foundation for how we'll create and consume 3D content in the future.”

Han Jong-hee, co-CEO of the South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 63 from a heart attack. This sad news was confirmed by the company, which noted that Han died while receiving treatment for cardiac arrest at the hospital. As of now, Samsung has not revealed who will succeed him.


Han Jong-hee was a seasoned veteran with over thirty years of experience at Samsung, beginning his career in the display division. Just three years ago, he was appointed co-CEO of the company, where he played a pivotal role in transforming Samsung Electronics into a leading player in the TV market, surpassing competitors like Sony Group Corp.

In addition to his success in the television sector, Han headed Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile device divisions, which stand in competition with Apple's smartphone offerings. Recently, he took significant strides to incorporate AI technology into Samsung's Galaxy devices. Under his guidance, the company began integrating AI chips into various home appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners.

Han's untimely passing comes at a crucial moment for Samsung, as the company faces heightened competition from SK Hynix Inc. in the AI memory sector and navigates sluggish demand in consumer electronics. Last week, during Samsung's annual shareholder meeting, Han expressed that 2025 could pose challenges for the company, but hinted at plans for mergers and acquisitions to spur growth.

Han Jong-hee shared the leadership of Samsung with co-CEO Jun Young-hyun, who oversees Samsung's semiconductor business, while Han managed all other areas of the company.

Online fraud costs businesses $40 billion annually, while false declines result in $443 billion in lost sales yearly. With Burbank technology (CPoI), a merchant-friendly solution, these financial losses can be significantly reduced, offering a promising return on investment.

Justin Pike, founder of Burbank, noted: “Burbank's Card-Present over Internet (CPoI) is the world's first PCI-certified technology enabling card-present transactions online. Unlike solutions using stored credentials or wallets, CPoI lets consumers simply tap their card to their mobile device and enter their PIN — just like in stores. This enables a full liability shift, drastically reduces fraud, and eliminates false declines, costing merchants over $443 billion yearly. The SDK integrates directly into apps or via QR codes, enabling seamless deployment for app- and web-based retailers.”

To launch this groundbreaking online payment technology, Burbank secured £5M in seed funding, led by Mouro Capital, with participation from Anthemis (supported by Foxe Capital), Portfolio Ventures, and others. This funding will be primarily used to expand our team, enhance our technology, and accelerate the global rollout of Burbank's platform. This innovation enables tap-and-PIN payments in online transactions, bringing the same security and trust as in-store payments to e-commerce. The company's valuation was not disclosed to TFN.

With backing from major industry players, Burbank is positioned for rapid scaling. The funding will accelerate global partnerships with acquirers and payment providers eager to integrate the technology. At a recent live demonstration before payment executives and industry leaders, Burbank completed the world's first online card-present transaction, a significant milestone in digital payments.

Burbank, a Welsh fintech company founded in 2021 by Justin Pike, operates from its headquarters in Cardiff, Wales. Pike, who serves as CEO, previously founded MyPinPad, developing the original technology behind PCI standards SPoC and MPoC. He also pioneered cloud-based HSM deployment and has over a decade of experience in payment innovation.

Talking with TFN, Justin Pike explained: “Burbank emerged from market necessity and personal insight. During COVID, my mother-in-law, uncomfortable with online shopping, asked why she couldn't simply ‘tap her card on her phone' like in stores. This question, combined with rising online fraud and inadequate authentication systems, inspired me to develop CPoI. This online tap-and-PIN payment method brings card-present security to digital transactions.”

Burbank aims to transform e-commerce by reducing fraud and eliminating false positives in online transactions. Their innovative Card-Present over Internet (CPoI) technology aligns in-store and digital payments, allowing consumers to tap their payment card against their mobile device and enter their PIN, enhancing security and reducing fraud risks.

Pike said, “We're thrilled to bring this payment evolution to the world. Payment experiences should be consistent across all channels. In-store tap-and-PIN is globally trusted and familiar, and now we're bringing that same process online. It's simple, secure, and scalable—exactly as it should be.”

Through this technology, Burbank aims to revolutionise online commerce by mitigating fraud and establishing new standards for secure transactions. The company prioritises delivering a frictionless customer experience while maintaining the highest level of online shopping protection.

While many companies strive to improve online payment security, Burbank is the first to deliver a PCI-certified, fully card-present online experience, making it category-defining. Traditional fraud prevention tools and authentication technologies often function as add-ons to a flawed system. CPoI replaces that system entirely.

Burbank's advanced platform combines unparalleled convenience with robust security, empowering businesses to innovate in customer experience and unlock new revenue opportunities. By merging ease of use with cutting-edge security, Burbank's technology helps companies deliver exceptional customer interactions that drive growth and set new market standards.

The company's flagship solution, Card-Present over Internet (CPoI), enables Card-Present payments in online channels for the first time. This reduces fraud, processing fees, and chargebacks while eliminating false positives, offering a compelling value proposition. The groundbreaking technology integrates directly into mobile applications, delivering a simple yet robust payment experience with bank-grade security and exceptional scalability.

Pike concluded: “Burbank plans to scale globally through white-labelled partnerships with acquirers, PSPs, and payment gateways. Our go-to-market model focuses on enterprise adoption.” 

Manuel Silva Martinez, General Partner at Mouro Capital, explained the investment: “I'm thrilled to support Justin and his team of payments experts. Burbank offers a simple, seamless integration through a single while-label SDK, which securely integrates into existing technology stacks and supports multiple schemes on iOS and Android. It's what the market needs.”

Ruth Foxe Blader, General Partner at Foxe Capital, added, “CPoI is the first protocol that legally shifts liability away from the merchant. It's a massively scalable approach, with global demand.”

A low-profile yet fast-growing technology solution provider based in Cary, North Carolina is making waves in the hotel industry. Inn-Flow, a company providing integrated back-office management software for the hotel industry, has secured a $45 million growth capital investment from Mainsail Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm specializing in vertical SaaS. The funding marks the company's first institutional investment and sets the stage for major expansion across product, people, and market reach.

Founded in 2009 by John Erhart, a hospitality industry veteran with deep roots in hotel ownership through his family's company, CMC Hotels, Inn-Flow began as a solution to streamline operations within the family business. The platform officially launched to the broader industry in 2014, quickly gaining traction among hotel owners and operators seeking better tools to manage increasingly complex operations.

Fast forward to today, and Inn-Flow has evolved into a comprehensive, cloud-based platform designed specifically for hotel management companies. The software offers a suite of integrated modules covering accounting and bookkeeping, payroll, labor management, procurement, sales tracking, bank reconciliation, and business intelligence. These tools empower hotel operators to automate routine tasks, improve decision-making, control labor costs, and scale more efficiently.

In 2024 alone, Inn-Flow reportedly processed over 920,000 invoices, managed $2.7 billion in payables, and reconciled nearly 5,000 bank accounts across its customer base. It also supported over 100,000 labor-management users, tracking nearly 15 million labor hours and overseeing payroll volume in excess of $200 million. These metrics underscore the platform's growing impact on operational performance and financial visibility within the hospitality sector.

“This investment is a major milestone for our team and our customers,” said John Erhart, Founder and CEO of Inn-Flow in a statement. “We are committed to providing a robust, user-friendly platform that enables hotel owners and management companies to simplify their operations and grow their businesses profitably. Mainsail's experience in scaling vertical SaaS companies will help us take Inn-Flow to the next level.”

The investment will reportedly be used to accelerate product innovation, enhance customer experience, and expand the company's team, including the planned hiring of at least 20 new employees in the Cary area over the next 18 months. Mainsail's strategic support will also help Inn-Flow expand its presence in new market segments and further differentiate its platform in an increasingly competitive space.

As part of its expansion strategy, Inn-Flow will reportedly roll out new product offerings in the coming months, including solutions for facilities management, mobile access, and advanced business intelligence. These new capabilities aim to help hoteliers operate more efficiently, stay ahead of the technology curve, and ultimately drive higher profitability.

The hotel industry's push toward digital transformation—fueled by rising labor costs, leaner teams, and increased demand for automation—has created fertile ground for platforms like Inn-Flow. With a strong foundation, loyal customer base, and now, significant financial backing, the company is well-positioned to become a dominant force in hotel back-office technology.

From a family-owned hotel solution to a national leader in hospitality SaaS, Inn-Flow's journey is a compelling case study in how industry insiders can drive innovation by solving problems from the inside out.

NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Jarrard Inc., a U.S. Top 10 healthcare strategic communications and change management consultancy, is pleased to announce the addition of Jed Lam as Senior Vice President, Market Research & Insights. With more than 25 years of experience leading research-driven brand strategy and marketing communications, Lam deepens Jarrard's capability to deliver sophisticated, data-driven insights to healthcare organizations navigating reputational, branding and strategic hurdles.

Evinova, a clinical trial technology company, is partnering with Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative (QLHC) to integrate Evinova's remote patient monitoring (RPM) offering into I-SPY 2.2, a platform trial that provides a framework to study multiple novel therapeutic treatment arms for women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. 

A platform trial is a clinical trial design that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple interventions or treatments against a common control group within a single, ongoing protocol that could lead to efficient and adaptable research. 

Evinova's RPM module will be used to warn healthcare professionals of early symptoms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), a possible adverse event for one treatment arm in the study.

Evinova's RPM allows for real-time monitoring of patients' health status and treatment intake between clinical visits and notifies healthcare providers of the potential onset or worsening of symptoms related to a potential toxicity, specifically ILD. 

With this data, healthcare providers can triage patients requiring further clinical evaluation and intervene quickly based on guidelines.

According to Evinova, this could potentially reduce the likelihood of progression to high-grade ILD and dose reduction, hold or interruption of treatment.

"One of the primary goals of I-SPY 2.2 is to get better treatments to patients faster and with fewer side effects," Dr. Laura Esserman, founder of the I-SPY trials and QLHC, said in a statement.

"New bispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates have the promise of eliminating traditional chemotherapy, but they too are associated with potential serious side effects. One of those complications is ILD, but early identification may be the key to preventing it from becoming a serious complication. Evinova makes it possible for us to monitor people using the drug every day, from the comfort of their home."

Cristina Duran, president of Evinova, said that with real-time alerts to both patients and sites, Evinova's RPM solution for toxicity monitoring will give care teams the ability to review and take proactive actions based on guidelines.

"At Evinova, we're passionate about accelerating better health outcomes through technology like RPM that enables global life science leaders to overcome critical research challenges and deliver a better clinical trial experience for both sites and patients," Duran said.

THE LARGER TREND 

In 2023, AstraZeneca launched Evinova with the aim of bringing digital health solutions already in use globally by the pharma company to clinical research organizations, trial sponsors, and care teams and patients. 

The company uses established digital technology solutions to streamline clinical trial design and delivery in order to reduce time and costs in medicine development. The venture also dives into digital remote patient monitoring and therapeutics.

Other companies involved in remote patient monitoring include Sibel Health, a spin-out of Northwestern University, which closed a $30 million Series C equity financing round in March and received its seventh FDA clearance. 

Sibel Health's FDA-cleared ANNE One platform contains advanced wearable sensors, AI-enabled data analytics, and an integrated mobile software and cloud platform. It also offers wireless monitoring of patients' vital signs and can be used for patients 12 years and older. 

In 2024, Doccla, a provider of virtual ward and remote patient monitoring services, secured £35 million ($38.6 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. 

That same year, CoachCare secured a $48 million strategic growth investment.

CoachCare works with individual practices and hospital systems to provide a remote patient monitoring service for patients with acute and chronic conditions, and it offers connected devices for providers to capture patient data. The company also provides a virtual health platform for follow-ups and chronic care management.

Sacramento County's Department of Health Services seeks to gain more grant funding to provide health care for homeless people. Staff will present at the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday about their mobile and street medical service called Wellness Without Walls.

These mobile clinics have a variety of healthcare services, including HIV treatment, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and substance counseling, according to Sacramento County Department of Health Services' website. 

In partnership with the department's primary health services and sexual health promotion unit, the program was created to eliminate barriers to accessing health care. Homeless residents don't always have transportation needed for a doctor's visit, or they fear losing their belongings while away at a clinic. These mobile clinics attempt to bridge the gap of accessing health care, the resolution states.

“These programs not only address immediate health concerns but also build trust within the unhoused community, encouraging individuals to seek ongoing care,” the resolution states.

Originally established in 2014, there are currently three mobile clinics and one dental clinic, the department stated. These mobile clinics have primary care services for clients as young as 4 years old. They also have wound care equipment and labs and medical referrals. The Department of Health Services stated that this program has served more than 2,000 patients since its launch.

The Department of Health Services wants to expand services through providing additional locations in Sacramento County, according to the presentation prepared for the Board of Supervisors. Many of the mobile clinics work in silos and Medi-Cal resources can be restrictive, with clients facing difficulties meeting criteria. The agency added the program has faced obstacles with getting care for uninsured clients. Consistency with client follow-up has also been met with difficulty.

Wellness Without Walls holds pop-up medical clinics throughout the county. Tuesday, the day of the presentation to the Board of Supervisors, the a clinic will be 9 a.m. - noon at 1492 Northgate Blvd. Upcoming locations can be found at https://bit.ly/4jivLR9

My Ayur Health: Transforming Healthcare Through Ayurveda Innovation.

Virginia, United States, March 25, 2025 -- In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, the demand for holistic and natural healing methods has seen a dramatic rise. My Ayur Health, https://myayurhealth.com/, co-founded by Nandhakumar Raju and Dr. Mishra, is at the forefront of this transformation, offering an innovative platform that integrates the timeless wisdom of Ayurveda with cutting-edge technology. The platform aims to make Ayurvedic medicine accessible and affordable to people worldwide, addressing a critical gap in the healthcare ecosystem. By providing a comprehensive marketplace for virtual consultations, personalized health assessments, and natural remedies, My Ayur Health is redefining how people approach their health and well-being.



The Timeless Wisdom of Ayurveda Ayurveda, often referred to as the "Science of Life," is one of the world's oldest medical systems, originating in India over 5,000 years ago. It emphasizes a holistic approach to health, focusing on the balance between mind, body, and spirit to achieve overall well-being. Unlike conventional medicine, which often focuses on treating symptoms, Ayurveda seeks to identify and address the root cause of ailments. With its reliance on natural remedies, dietary guidance, and lifestyle modifications, Ayurveda has proven to be effective in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, stress, and digestive disorders. Despite its proven benefits, access to qualified Ayurvedic practitioners and authentic treatments remains a challenge for many, particularly in the modern era where fast-paced lifestyles often compromise holistic health practices.

Challenges in Modern HealthcareThe global healthcare system is grappling with numerous challenges, from rising costs to the growing prevalence of chronic diseases. Allopathy, the predominant system of medicine, while highly effective for acute and emergency care, often falls short in addressing the long-term management of chronic conditions. Additionally, the reliance on synthetic drugs has led to widespread concerns about side effects and over-medication. In developing nations, accessibility to quality healthcare remains a significant hurdle, while in developed countries, the focus on quick fixes often overshadows the importance of preventive and holistic care. These challenges have highlighted the need for alternative approaches that prioritize prevention, affordability, and accessibility, a gap that My Ayur Health aims to fill.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, today announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, will give $1.84 million to Mile High United Way to launch United for Healthy Starts, a national collaboration between four United Ways to help increase access to social, economic and educational support services for families. The effort is led by Mile High United Way in Denver and includes United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, United Way Miami and United Way of Greater Nashville.


“It's a privilege to help champion the overall health and well-being of families through United for Healthy Starts,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of the HCA Healthcare Foundation. “Meaningful community impact can be made when organizations come together to support and learn from one another.

United for Healthy Starts aims to increase access to services to improve social, economic and overall health outcomes for families. Through this new grant, the initiative is designed to help families have strong, healthy starts through home visitation and wrap-around services tailored to the needs of each family supported. By establishing a national, collaborative learning community, United for Healthy Starts will also work to help create new nonprofit partnerships, with the intention of strengthening service delivery and innovation and achieving a scalable impact beyond the grant.




"We are thrilled to continue this longstanding collaboration between two historic anchor institutions committed to improving the lives of families – HCA Healthcare and United Way,” said Christine Benero, Mile High United Way president and CEO. “Through United for Healthy Starts, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are truly putting a stake in the ground for mothers and young children, especially those facing barriers to healthy outcomes. This important grant in the Denver, Dallas, Nashville and Miami communities will help our work to develop new innovations in home visitation and support, and we hope the learnings will allow us to bring this model to more communities in the future.”

"We are thrilled to continue this longstanding collaboration between two historic anchor institutions committed to improving the lives of families – HCA Healthcare and United Way,” said Christine Benero, Mile High United Way president and CEO. “Through United for Healthy Starts, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are truly putting a stake in the ground for mothers and young children, especially those facing barriers to healthy outcomes. This important grant in the Denver, Dallas, Nashville and Miami communities will help our work to develop new innovations in home visitation and support, and we hope the learnings will allow us to bring this model to more communities in the future.”



HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have a long history of working with and supporting United Way. In 1981, HCA Healthcare co-founder Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. co-founded the first chapter of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society in Nashville, Tennessee and later received its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. Over the last 30 years, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have given more than $17 million in support of United Way's work to help improve communities nationwide.



The HCA Healthcare Foundation's Healthier Tomorrow Fund supports evidence-informed programs that address high-priority needs and advance community health by supporting efforts to pilot, replicate and scale meaningful, measurable initiatives in communities where HCA Healthcare has a presence. Since its inception, the fund has committed more than $17 million in grants to nonprofits across the country.

Long Beach, California-based Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH provides managed healthcare services to low-income families and individuals under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces. Valued at a market cap of $17.1 billion, the company participates exclusively in government-sponsored healthcare programs. 

Companies worth $10 billion or more are typically classified as “large-cap stocks,” and Molina fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the healthcare plans industry. The company operates with a cost-efficient business model, focusing on streamlined healthcare delivery to maintain strong profit margins. With a broad geographic presence across multiple U.S. states, the company continues to expand its reach while leveraging strategic acquisitions and operational efficiency to strengthen its market position.

Despite its notable strength, this healthcare company has dipped 26.2% from its 52-week high of $423.92, reached on Mar. 27, 2024. It has gained 5.9% over the past three months, lagging behind the SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF's XHS 8.7% uptick over the same time frame.

In the longer term, MOH has fallen 24.6% over the past 52 weeks, considerably underperforming XHS' 7.3% rise over the same time frame. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of MOH are up 7.4%, compared to XHS' 9.5% return.

To confirm its recent bullish trend, MOH has been trading above its 50-day moving average since late February. However, it has remained below its 200-day moving average since late April, with some fluctuations.

On Feb. 5, MOH released its mixed Q4 results, and its stock plummeted 10.1% the following day. While adjusted earnings rose 15.3% year-over-year to $5.05 per share, it fell 13.1% short of Wall Street expectations. Rising medical care costs, lower investment income, and weaker-than-expected membership growth further weighed on investor sentiment and led to its earnings miss. However, on the brighter side, higher premium revenues and new contract acquisitions resulted in a 16% increase in its revenue to $10.5 billion, which met analyst estimates. 

For fiscal 2025, MOH expects adjusted EPS to be at least $24.50, representing an approximately 8% growth compared to the previous year. 

MOH has lagged behind its rival, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's UNH 5.4% gain over the past 52 weeks but has outpaced UNH's 2.1% rise on a YTD basis. 

Despite MOH's recent underperformance relative to its industry peers, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from the 14 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $343.46 suggests a nearly 9.9% premium to its current levels.

The San Ramon, California-based company's products are primarily designed for solving vision challenges like astigmatism, presbyopia and ocular dryness. 

Companies valued at $10 billion or more are typically classified as “large-cap stocks,” and COO fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the medical instruments & supplies industry. With a strong global presence in over 100 countries, the company benefits from steady demand and a recession-resistant business model. It drives growth through continuous innovation and strategic acquisitions, expanding its product portfolio and market reach. 

Despite its notable strength, this vision care company has slipped 25.2% from its 52-week high of $112.38, reached on Sep. 16, 2024. Moreover, it has declined 9.4% over the past three months, considerably lagging behind the broader Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLV 5.6% gain over the same time frame. 

In the longer term, COO has declined 16.3% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming XLV's 1.2% rise over the same time frame. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of COO are down nearly 8.6%, compared to XLV's 7% uptick. 

To confirm its bearish trend, COO has been trading below its 200-day moving average since mid-December, 2024, with slight fluctuations, and has remained below its 50-day moving average since late October, 2024, experiencing some fluctuations. 

On Mar. 6, COO released its Q1 earnings results, leading to a 6.6% drop in its stock price the following day. The decline came as the company reported revenue of $964.7 million, which, despite growing 3.6% year-over-year, fell 1.6% short of analyst expectations. A key factor contributing to this revenue miss was a decline in CooperVision's Asia-Pacific revenue on a reported basis. However, on a positive note, adjusted earnings rose 8.2% year-over-year to $0.92 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $0.91. This earnings beat was supported by an increase in both adjusted gross and operating profit margins, reflecting improved efficiency and cost management.

Looking ahead, for fiscal 2025, the company expects adjusted EPS between $3.94 and $4.02, and anticipates revenue in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, representing organic growth of 6% to 8%. 

The Cooper Companies' underperformance looks even more pronounced when compared to its rival, Alcon Inc. ALC, which gained 10.5% over the past 52 weeks and 8.8% on a YTD basis. 

Despite COO's recent underperformance relative to its broader sector, analysts remain moderately bullish about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from the 16 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $110.36 suggests an ambitious 31.3% premium to its current levels.

Oops, something went wrong

A collaboration with hospital systems and their leaders, OnDefend's new Ransomware Defense Validation service reimagines defense strategies through proactive and continuous security control validation.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 25, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OnDefend, a leader in preventative cybersecurity testing and advisory services, today announced the launch of its Ransomware Defense Validation (RDV) service. Developed with direct input from prominent healthcare Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and launched in collaboration with major healthcare systems, RDV addresses the pressing need for organizations to proactively defend against ransomware threats.

The healthcare community faces a new pandemic—a cyber one—and the risks to patient safety, data security, and operational continuity have never been greater. As a managed service, RDV, powered by BlindSPOT, OnDefend's proprietary Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platform, equips organizations to regularly test and validate the effectiveness of their prevention, detection, and response security controls against known and emerging threats.

Data collected from OnDefend's global security testing services found:

24% of malicious emails bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs).

7 out of 10 attack simulation engagements identify exploitable security tool failures.

5 out of 10 incident emulations identify notification delays or failure to meet Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the response vendors.

A Collaborative Approach to Solving an Industry-Wide Challenge

RDV originated from conversations between OnDefend's security teams and healthcare leaders who shared concerns about common security control failures and the lack of regular visibility and validation.

"Cybersecurity isn't about setting up defenses and hoping for the best. It's about constantly testing, adapting, and staying ahead of threats. If you're not testing your security, the attackers will do it for you," said Larry Whiteside Jr., former CISO at Spectrum Health and Women's Care OBGYN.

These discussions highlighted the need for a proactive solution tailored to the unique challenges of healthcare cybersecurity, going above and beyond current healthcare standards and regulations.

How Ransomware Defense Validation (RDV) Works

RDV is delivered by OnDefend as a managed service using BlindSPOT to safely simulate real-world ransomware attacks on a healthcare systems' defenses to prove their:

Secure Email Gateways (SEGs): effectively filter malicious emails from reaching employee inboxes.

Threat Detection Tools (EDR, SIEM): effectively identify and alert security teams to real-world attack activity.

Threat Response Teams (SOC,MDR,NDR): immediately respond and neutralize real-world cyber threats in real-time.

"Ransomware Defense Validation provides security leaders with critical visibility into their defensive investments, ensuring they are resilient against the cyber threats targeting their industry," said Chris Freedman, CEO of OnDefend. "The goal of this managed service is to validate security tools and hold monitoring vendors accountable, all while empowering our customers to demonstrate they are achieving the return on investment they deserve."

RDV Outcomes & Industry Impact

Early access customers who implemented RDV found their security teams' overall posture improved, showcased continuous risk reduction, proved return on investments, and are prepared to safeguard essential healthcare operations.

This service is now available to healthcare organizations nationwide.

Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.

"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?" he said.

Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.

A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.

Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.

Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid "buy-in program," which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.

Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The "Work Without Worry" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.

Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. "It's a trap — a poverty trap," said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.

Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.

Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.

Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. "That's the trumpet I've been blowing," he said with a smile.

The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. "If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy," the Republican governor told legislators in January in her "Condition of the State Address." "Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency."

Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.

National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.

In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.

Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.

"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way," said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. "I don't think it has to be expensive" for the state and federal governments, she said.

Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.

Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. "Awareness of these programs is really limited," she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.

In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.

The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. "This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do," said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.

Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, "Zach of All Trades."

On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.

After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.

Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.

There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. "This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself," he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. "If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on."

Goldman Sachs Alternatives' Growth Equity division is leading a $55 million Series C funding round in Navina, an AI-powered clinical intelligence platform, bringing the company's total funding to $100 million. While this investment demonstrates GS's continued execution of its alternative investment strategy, the amount represents a minuscule fraction of Goldman's $180.4 billion market capitalization.

This investment aligns with Goldman's strategic expansion into growth-stage technology companies, particularly those positioned at the intersection of AI and healthcare transformation. Navina has established meaningful market traction with 10,000+ healthcare professionals across 1,300 clinics and relationships with notable healthcare organizations.

For Goldman Sachs, this represents business-as-usual activity for its Alternatives division, which encompasses private equity, growth equity, and venture investments. The deal size isn't material enough to impact GS's financial performance or stock valuation, but it does reflect the firm's ongoing diversification beyond traditional investment banking.

The healthcare AI sector offers substantial growth potential as the U.S. healthcare system transitions toward value-based care models that prioritize outcomes over volume. Goldman's participation signals institutional confidence in both Navina's technology and the broader market opportunity, though returns will materialize only over a multi-year horizon typical of growth equity investments.

Investment will fuel the advancement of its AI-powered clinical intelligence platform, transforming patient care and value-based care outcomes 

NEW YORK, March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Navina, a market leader in AI-powered clinical intelligence, today announced the successful completion of a $55 million Series C funding round, bringing the total funding to $100 million. The round is led by Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, with participation from existing investors, including Vertex Ventures Israel, Grove Ventures and ALIVE.







This significant investment will accelerate Navina's expansion across the U.S. healthcare market, enhance its proprietary AI technology, and further drive improvements in patient outcomes by bringing proactive clinical intelligence to every outpatient interaction.

"This investment is a powerful validation of Navina's vision to improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics by breaking down data barriers with AI," said Ronen Lavi, co-founder and CEO of Navina. "We're thrilled to partner with a best-in-class firm like Goldman Sachs, whose market leadership will be instrumental as we enter this pivotal growth phase and expand our market reach. With this additional capital, we will continue to accelerate AI innovation and revolutionize healthcare by making every patient interaction more empathic, personalized, and proactive."

Navina's AI copilot has rapidly established itself as the trusted solution for value-based care organizations, beginning with primary care and expanding to broader healthcare segments. The platform serves over 10,000 healthcare professionals across 1,300 clinics and supports the care of more than three million patients. The company has already secured partnerships with industry leaders including agilon health, InnovaCare Health, Millennium Physician Group, and Privia Health, and was recently recognized as Best in KLAS 2025 for Clinician Digital Workflow, further validating its exceptional customer satisfaction and trust.

"AI is rapidly transforming modern healthcare, and Navina stands at the forefront of that transformation – delivering real, measurable value to thousands of clinicians," said Irit Kahan, Managing Director in Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. "Their deep integration into clinical workflows, unparalleled provider trust, and demonstrated ROI make them uniquely positioned to drive meaningful impact across the healthcare ecosystem. We believe Navina's AI-powered platform is a game-changer, and we are excited to support their next stage of growth."

As healthcare continues to transition toward value-based care, the need for accurate and timely clinical intelligence has become more critical than ever. Yet fragmented data, inefficient manual workflows, and growing administrative burdens make it difficult for clinicians to deliver proactive, preventive patient care, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high cost of care.

Navina equips clinicians and care teams with real-time, data-driven insights that improve the quality of care and financial outcomes. Navina's AI copilot surfaces clinical insights that support effective decision-making throughout the care continuum–from the back office to the point of care–while significantly reducing the administrative burden. Navina natively integrates into the clinician workflow, and maintains an impressive 86% weekly active usage rate and high trust in its AI recommendations within daily practice.

With this funding, Navina will accelerate the development of its proprietary AI to ultimately become the definitive source of unified patient data that improves efficiency and care quality across the ecosystem from payers to providers. The company will expand its platform capabilities to further automate and optimize workflows from proactive population health management to effective point-of-care intervention.

Sustainability initiative Better Cotton has embarked on a two-year pilot project in Côte d'Ivoire aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for farmers while strengthening cotton supply chains.

Sustainability initiative Better Cotton has embarked on a two-year pilot project in Côte d'Ivoire aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for farmers while strengthening cotton supply chains.

This initiative is set to develop a health programme specifically designed to serve the needs of approximately 8,000 local residents initially.

In Côte d'Ivoire, nearly half of the populace endures living beneath the poverty threshold and health indicators rank among the poorest in West Africa.

Despite the Côte d'Ivoire government's endorsement of a comprehensive social protection strategy and the enactment of a Universal Health Coverage law in 2019, which requires citizens to enrol, participation rates remain low.

As of 2024, only 27% of the population has registered for the programme, with a mere 5% actively utilizing the health care services offered by this system.

With this project, Better Cotton aspires to establish a scalable model that could benefit underserved populations worldwide.

Better Cotton smallholder livelihoods manager Maria Kjaer said: “Farmer health and well-being are essential to supporting sustainable agriculture. We have the opportunity to remove healthcare barriers for farming communities to create a real, positive impact.”

The initiative has received financial backing from Better Cotton, ISEAL, and Olam Agri. Its execution is facilitated by the financial assistance provided through the ISEAL Innovations Fund. This fund garners support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the UK Aid from the British government.

For the project, Better Cotton has collaborated with SECO, an Olam Agri subsidiary, and Elucid, a social enterprise to develop an ecosystem that improves health which reducing costs.

Elucid's digital healthcare platform will be deployed across select farming regions in Côte d'Ivoire.

This platform will register cotton farmers and link them with local accredited healthcare providers while facilitating secure payments and gathering user feedback to enhance service offerings, notes Better Cotton.

Elucid managing director and co-founder Samuel Knauss said: “With this project, we are bringing our healthcare model to cotton farmers by strengthening the capacity of agricultural producer organisations. This will ensure that farmers can access essential and emergency care without financial hardship. Building on our success in the cocoa and coffee sectors, we aim to show that investing in healthcare not only improves farmer well-being but also strengthens cotton supply chains and creates lasting impact for communities.”

The partnership will involve agricultural producer organisations (APOs) to promote local engagement with the platform, monitor its usage effectively, and ensure it addresses pertinent issues faced by the community.

The project's success is expected to expand social protection coverage for farmer households, eliminate healthcare access barriers, and pave the way for continued investment in these services even after the project concludes.

SECO vice president and managing director Jean-François Touré said: “This project shall serve as a reference for the industry, particularly as Côte d'Ivoire advances the implementation of its Universal Health Coverage programme. Through this partnership with Better Cotton and Elucid, we aim to create a lasting, scalable impact for farming communities.”

Better Cotton's initiative not only seeks to offer valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices but also aims to provide data on the relationship between health outcomes and farmer incomes, potentially informing similar efforts across various commodities and regions.

Last month, Better Cotton completed its evolution into a certification scheme with the aim of upholding stringent sustainability and transparency protocols across the cotton sector.

Medicaid, a federal health insurance program for low-income children and adults, is facing dual challenges at both the state and federal level.

Nationally, Republicans in Congress are pushing to cut about $880 billion in spending on healthcare and energy over 10 years. The nonpartisan policy institute Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said this will be impossible to do without cuts to Medicaid, which covers about one in five Americans.

It is not yet clear what form those cuts could take, but proposals have included changing payments into fixed or per capita amounts, reducing the matching rate for Medicaid expansion population and adding work requirements. 

The Trump administration has promised cuts would not reduce benefits and has said taxpayers lose as much as $521 billion annually to fraud, most of which they claimed came from entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Meanwhile, Maine state lawmakers last week failed to pass the supplemental budget with the two-thirds majority required to immediately address the $118 million shortfall in the state's Medicaid program.

Most House Republicans did not vote for the measure, saying they wanted to see more reforms to the program. In response, the state said it would need to temporarily pause payments to certain healthcare providers.

On Thursday, Democrats, who hold the majority, advanced a budget over Republican opposition that bails out the Medicaid program, but only for the next year. The budget does not include anticipated $100 million increases in MaineCare costs in fiscal year 2027, the Portland Press Herald reported. Maine's governor signed the budget late Friday afternoon.

Alex Carter, policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, told The Maine Monitor that the state Medicaid deficit would be “just a small symptom — the tip of the iceberg — of what we would see if such massive cuts were made to federal Medicaid spending.”

So what does Medicaid actually cover in Maine?

First and foremost, it is important to note that Maine's version of Medicaid is called MaineCare. The program is jointly funded by the state and federal government. 

There are some services — such as hospital visits, nursing facility stays or home health services — that states are required to cover under Medicaid, and then there are additional services states can opt into. For example, Maine has opted to also provide coverage for older adults in residential care who are spending down their income to reach the threshold for Medicaid, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

Thirty-two percent of the state's total budget was spent on MaineCare in the 2023 fiscal year, according to the DHHS.

As of December, MaineCare had nearly 400,000 members enrolled in its various programs, which include Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and additional state-specific categories.

Nearly a fourth of those enrolled in MaineCare are part of the expansion of eligibility that Mainers approved by referendum in 2017 and Gov. Janet Mills adopted when she took office in 2019.

One possible way Congress could cut Medicaid would be to reduce financial support to states for this expansion population. Right now, Maine's federal funding match rate for the expansion population — about 94,000 Mainers — is 90 percent.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that if Congress reduces that matching rate for people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, Maine would lose $117 million in federal money, forcing state leaders to cover the cost or remove 25,000 people from Medicaid.

Last year, about two-thirds of Maine's nursing home residents and about half of Maine children were covered by MaineCare.

Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association, said MaineCare makes up about 18% of the hospital business across the state — although it ranges widely. 

Eighteen percent doesn't sound like a lot, said Michaud, “but it is in our world.”

Lisa Harvey-McPherson, vice president of government relations for Northern Light Health, said revenue from MaineCare payments is different for each hospital in the system and ranges from 12 to 64 percent.

“Some provider types in Maine are almost fully reliant on MaineCare, like nursing homes and community behavioral health services,” she said. “We rely on community services to provide care to our patients throughout the state of Maine.”

Nearly half of all births at hospitals across the state were covered by MaineCare, according to a three-year average from 2021 to 2023 by the Maine Hospital Association. For rural hospitals, that increased to 55 percent, Michaud said.

MaineHealth said 13 percent of its total revenue is from MaineCare payments, and 43 percent of behavioral health patients are on MaineCare.

Katie Fullam Harris, chief government affairs officer, added that MaineHealth is “exceedingly concerned” about any reductions in eligibility or payments to providers.

“Maine's healthcare infrastructure is teetering on the edge of real challenge right now,” she said. “There's no room to absorb additional costs.”

In Carson City, Nev., home health care workers will be at the statehouse on Tuesday asking lawmakers for a big raise, citing growing demand as the state's population rapidly ages.

It's the second such request in two years. A campaign in 2023 delivered a $16 minimum wage for home caregivers, who are employed by private agencies that are funded through Medicaid. Prior to that, their wages had been stuck between $10 and $12 an hour for more than a decade.

"It was just ridiculous," says Regina Brown-Ross, a home care worker and union organizer with SEIU Local 1107. "People can't function on $12 an hour."

In 2025, getting by remains a struggle for many caregivers, even on $16 an hour. Home care workers, who are mostly women and people of color, often lack health insurance. Like other low wage workers, they must contend with rising food and housing costs.

So now they're asking for $20 an hour, hoping that lawmakers will approve the request as part of the state's next budget bill.

Two years ago, the $16 minimum wage for caregivers was championed by Democrats, who still control both chambers of the Nevada legislature, but was eventually signed into law by Republican Governor Joe Lombardo.

Today, the workers also want the state to approve more hours of coverage for their clients, many of whom only qualify for part-time care.

"A lot of the clients — they don't have enough hours and they need more help," says Brown-Ross.

This would also be a benefit to the caregivers: If they could be paid for more hours with each client, they wouldn't need to take on so many, relieving them of long drives between clients.

Their push for higher wages is shining a spotlight on a struggle that caregivers across the country face as demand for their services soars.

Already, there's evidence that the previous wage bump in Nevada, which took effect in January 2024, has reduced turnover. Before their wages rose to $16, half of home care workers in the state didn't last a year in their roles. In the four months after the new minimum took effect, turnover fell to almost nothing, according to Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services.

Since then, the ranks of home health agencies and SEIU Local 1107 have grown. Since 2023, more than 1,300 home care workers have voted to unionize in 12 consecutive elections, adding muscle to their latest fight.

Irma Nunez, a longtime caregiver who took part in the lobbying effort in 2023, says that at the time, they had a receptive audience among state lawmakers when they shared stories of bathing and feeding patients and helping them go to the bathroom. The need for in-home help struck a chord.

"People told us personal stories about their dads, moms, grandparents, family members," she says. "They knew what we were talking about."

To make ends meet, Nunez used to pick up as much work as she could, taking on multiple clients, driving from house to house, working a couple hours here, a couple hours there, seven days a week.

The bump she received in January 2024, from $11 to $16 an hour, allowed her to reduce her workload slightly and take better care of her own health. But $20 an hour would provide her a better safety net, she says, and allow her to start saving a bit for her own retirement.

The push for higher caregiver wages has been cheered on by some of the seniors and people with disabilities who rely on the care, like Nunez's longtime client Thomas Draa.

A high school science teacher, Draa was in a car crash 20 years ago that left him unable to use his legs. Since then, he's needed help getting out of bed, washing, dressing, and getting in his van to go to school.

That help hasn't always been reliable. "We had people coming and going, or not showing up to get me up, and I wouldn't go to school that day," he says.

Then came Nunez. For the past 12 years, she's been at his house every day, arriving at 4:30 a.m. so Draa can make it to school by 6 a.m., an hour before the students arrive.

She returns in the afternoon to get him back into his house and back into bed. "I wouldn't be able to go to school or work if it wasn't for Irma," Draa says.

"I always thought it was just crazy," he says of caregivers' wages. "They make such a little amount of money, for what an important job it is."

Brown-Ross started working as a caregiver after a decades-long career as a singer, performing around the world in solo shows and as a backup singer to the likes of Gladys Knight, Ray Charles and Smokey Robinson.

But while touring in China in the early 2010s, she suffered damage to her voice.

"I couldn't sing my phrases. I couldn't hold a note. It was the most devastating time for me," she recalls.

She needed to find a job, and soon one came calling: Her mother-in-law had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Determined to keep her at home, Brown-Ross began taking care of her, eventually getting certified as a caregiver and formalizing the arrangement through a state program that allows family members to be paid for their work. She was hired by an agency and paid the going rate, then $12 an hour.

"To go from working with Ray Charles and Gladys Knight, making money, to being a home care worker … was difficult for me," says Brown-Ross.

It wasn't just the meager wages. It was the lack of respect for caregivers and recognition of their work.

"They deserve to have dignity in their own profession," she says.

Brown-Ross's mother-in-law died in 2018. Since then, she's taken on other clients, including an elderly cousin who fought in World War II, a teenager with autism, and a woman with disabilities.


                Regina Brown-Ross sings inside her home on January 24th, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. As a caregiver, her focus is on helping her clients maintain dignity, independence, and quality of life, often incorporating music therapy.

Recently, she's started to rehabilitate her own voice, and is getting back into singing — finding parallels between her two careers.

"I loved bringing joy to my audiences and taking them on a journey, helping them to feel better," she says. "I bring that same premise to my home caregiving. I help them to do the things that they're no longer able to do for themselves."

 The Ambassador of Turkmenistan to Georgia, Dovletmurat Seyitmammedov, met with Georgia's Minister of Health, Mikhail Sadrjveladze, to discuss key issues in the healthcare sector and broader bilateral cooperation. 

The parties discussed various issues of bilateral cooperation and interaction in the fields of healthcare, medical tourism, and exchange of experience between medical universities, as well as organizing joint conferences, seminars, and forums, News.Az reports citing local media.

During the meeting, the significant role of the official visit of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze to Turkmenistan in strengthening bilateral relations was highlighted. The sides particularly emphasized that Turkmenistan and Georgia are actively cooperating in the political, trade-economic, and cultural-humanitarian spheres, as well as within authoritative international organizations.

The ambassador informed the minister about the large-scale international events dedicated to the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan's permanent neutrality, as well as the proclamation of 2025 as the "International Year of Peace and Trust".

At the end of the meeting, both sides expressed confidence that joint activities would contribute to further deepening Turkmen-Georgian relations.

In 2024, trade volume between Turkmenistan and Georgia reached $81 million. Georgia's exports to Turkmenistan totaled $22.9 million, while imports from Turkmenistan to Georgia amounted to $58.09 million.

FRAMINGHAM — The state Department of Public Health will hold a public hearing April 9 at the Memorial Building in response to MetroWest Medical Center's plans to reduce the level of its maternity services at Framingham Union Hospital.

Tenet Healthcare Corp., the Dallas-based publicly traded company that owns Framingham Union, recently announced plans to shift the status of the hospital's maternity services from a Level IIB Special Care Nursery to a Level I Well Baby Nursery.

Level II nurseries treat babies born greater than 32 weeks or those that are full term and require close monitoring of problems that are expected to soon be resolved. The "IIB" designation means the hospital can provide some respiratory assistance for short periods of time.

Level I nurseries provide care only for healthy full-term babies or babies born close to their due date, typically 35 weeks or later.

The plan has been criticized by city officials and nurses at Framingham Union Hospital.

The Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents about 300 nurses at Framingham Union, opposes a reduction in services. The Daily News spoke with nursing staff about the move during a gathering outside of the hospital on March 11.

Ginnie Ford, a nurse in the unit since 1978, explained that mothers with more needs will have to be transferred to either UMass Memorial Health in Worcester or to a hospital in Boston.

"We need this (not to change). Most of our patients are low income," she said during the March 11 gathering. "Our mammas are really high risk." She explained that while Tenet said the unit won't lose any staff, it's already flexing the numbers down.

"Tenet could hire more OBs (obstetricians); when I started there were 32 OBs, now there's two," Ford added.

Mayor Charlie Sisitsky, who requested the hearing be held in Framingham, expressed concern about the discontinuing of more specialized maternity services in a letter to the DPH. He wrote that he was told by the CEO of Tenet that about 50 out of 500 deliveries each year require an advanced level of maternity services.

"We are further concerned that discontinuing the specialized maternity services may deter women from seeking maternity care at all from MWMC," he wrote. "This could have a cascading effect on overall maternity services and would eventually lead to lower delivery numbers that MWMC could then claim that any maternity services could no longer be justified."

In a statement to the Daily News about the closure, a Tenet spokesperson wrote that the hospital will still be able to create "a memorable and patient-centric" birthing experience for lower-risk deliveries while having the ability to transfer higher acuity patients to a facility that offers more specialized care.

In a Facebook post about the hearing, Sisitsky wrote: "We are thrilled that the DPH has agreed to hold the hearing here in Framingham."

"This decision reflects our commitment to ensuring that local voices are heard," the mayor continued. "We encourage all residents to attend and engage in this important conversation about the future of maternity care in our community."

The DPH's public hearing will take place on Wednesday, April 9, at Nevins Hall in the Memorial Building, 150 Concord St. Nevins Hall can hold more than 1,100 people and is equipped with technology for presentations and live broadcasts.

While no time has been provided, the city posted on Facebook that a time would be added later this week.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 25, 2025) – Hospitals can be overwhelming places for children and are often filled with unfamiliar sights, sounds and experiences. But specialists in the Child Life program at UK HealthCare's Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) work to make the environment less intimidating.  

Recently, the Child Life program expanded to three additional within KCH: the Pediatric Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic, the Center for Advanced Surgery and the pediatric specialty clinics located at Kentucky Children's Richmond Road. 

Previously, the Child Life Program only had dedicated specialists in the inpatient acute, progressive and critical care units of KCH, as well as the neonatal intensive care unit and the cardiac care unit. Specialists also assist patients in the Makenna David Pediatric Emergency Center, the DanceBlue Hematology Oncology Clinic and the Children's Sedation and Procedure Unit.  

Through play, education and emotional support, the Child Life Program helps young patients and their families navigate medical challenges with confidence. Their work goes beyond distraction; it empowers children to understand their medical experiences and cope with them in healthy ways.  

“Every interaction with a Child Life specialist has the potential to change a child's hospital experience for the better,” said Jennifer Guilliams, director of Child and Family Life at KCH. “There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Our specialists meet each patient where they are, using play, education and emotional support tailored to their unique needs. With this expansion, more young patients will receive the reassurance and care they deserve, delivered by an extraordinary team committed to making a difference.”

Child Life Specialists, Ashlee Amerine (Center for Advanced Surgery), Ashley Semones (KCH Richmond Road clinics) and Lyndsay Overton (Children's Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic) shared with UKNow their roles in Child Life program, the strategies they use to ease fears and the impact they have on young patients. 

UKNOW: Describe your roles in the Child Life program. 

Ashlee Amerine: I often tell my families I'm like the “teacher” of the hospital. My role is to help patients and families understand why they are here, teaching them about a diagnosis or a surgery they might be having. My role is also to provide support and normalization to their environment to help aid in coping. I help out with procedures such as IV starts or anesthesia inductions as well as providing support and positive coping to patients as they separate from their parents to go off to surgery. My job is to help make their experience a little less scary, and a little more fun. 

Ashley Semones: I help to prepare, educate, support, distract and play with kids to help reduce stress and anxiety. I know child development very well. There is so much power in play. 

Lyndsay Overton: My role is to help explain to patients and families what is going to happen while they are with us in the Pediatric Infusion & Diagnostic Clinic. Many of these patients and families have been coming for years and know our nursing staff well. These patients have chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, lupus and many others. The patients might come a few days in a row, once a week, once a month or once every six months. It depends on what the doctor's plan of care is for them. The treatments can take an hour or sometimes all day. I help with IV placements, lab draws, port access/de access and dressing changes to help patients cope, and give activities, games, toys and craft kits to do to help pass the time. 

UKNOW: What inspired you to pursue a career in Child Life? 

Ashlee Amerine: I always loved working with children and had a draw to working in the health care field. I originally thought I may want to be a physician's assistant, but then changed my path after learning about child life. A family friend is a certified child life specialist in Minnesota and told me about the profession and it felt like it was meant to be for me.  

UKNOW: What unique challenges do children face in specialized medical settings that child life can help address? 

Ashlee Amerine: Children often have misconceptions within the health care environment because most of what they are experiencing is new and unfamiliar. Child life specialists can help children understand through developmentally appropriate language, preparation of pictures and even using medical equipment to play out a procedure they may be having. Helping children understand what will be happening to their bodies can help ease fears. As child life specialists we can also work to normalize the environment such as bringing in familiar toys to play with or help celebrate their birthday.  

UKNOW: What prompted the expansion of Child Life services into specialized areas of care? 

Lyndsay Overton: When the Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic opened in 2023, the request for child life services came from staff, families and patients who had received previous treatments at KCH. The KCH Leadership team advocated for this service for these patients and families who have frequent visits. 

UKNOW: How does your approach change when working with children in specialized medical fields? 

Ashley Semones: Meeting every child and family where they are in a developmentally appropriate way. Doing a child life assessment to figure out what works best for each child and family. Every child is different and has unique things that impact their coping and their journey. 

UKNOW: What strategies do you use to support parents and siblings of children undergoing complex medical treatments? 

Lyndsay Overton: I always try to approach meeting every patient and family with open eyes and ears. I think to myself that maybe I can find something that some other of our medical team missed to better this patients experience. Common strategies are medical play, comfort positions and nonpharmaceutical management techniques. 

UKNOW: Can you share a success story where Child Life interventions made a significant impact in a specialized setting? 

Ashley Semones: I spend half my day with KCH Richmond Road clinics and half my day with Easter Seals (a local nonprofit for children and adults with special health care needs). For the clinics, organizing the Halloween trick-or-treat trail and clinic Christmas market were wonderful holiday events. For Easter Seals, watching kids take their first steps, learn to talk, and daily hugs and smiles. Kids are so amazing, and I am so proud of these kids.

March is Child Life Month, a time to recognize the profound impact of child life specialists on young patients and their families. Their work extends far beyond the walls of a hospital room, turning fear into confidence, uncertainty into strength and hospital stays into opportunities for healing and growth. Through their dedication, every child feels seen, heard and supported when it matters most.

Child life specialists rely on community support to bring comfort and joy to young patients. Learn more about how to support the Child Life Program through monetary or in-kind donations.

Ant Group Unveils Major Upgrades to Its Full-Suite AI Solutions in Healthcare for Hospitals, Doctors and Users

HANGZHOU, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ant Group has announced major upgrades to its comprehensive suite of AI solutions for the healthcare sector, aiming to enhance the capabilities of hospitals and doctors, and collaboratively benefit users through advanced AI innovations.


Empowering Hospitals with Secure and Efficient AI Integration



As industries increasingly adopt AI technologies, hospitals are leveraging latest innovations, including large models, to streamline operations and enhance patient care. To better support its healthcare service partners and with its extensive industry knowledge and technical expertise, Ant Group has collaborated with IT industry leaders to integrate its advanced healthcare large model into various types of All-in-One Large Model Machine for Healthcare. This solution allows hospitals to deploy AI models on-premises, ensuring efficient and secure use of AI to optimize daily operations and improve patient services. To date, the solution has already been adopted by seven leading hospitals and healthcare institutions across Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo.




Being built on advanced foundation models including DeepSeek R1/V3, Alibaba's Qwen, and Ant Group's self-developed BaiLing, Ant Group's healthcare large model is equipped with medical reasoning and multimodal interaction capabilities, and has consecutively won first place in several categories, including medical knowledge Q&A, in the MedBench evaluation of medical models.




The all-in-one machines also benefit from Ant Group's privacy-preserving computation solution, which safeguards data privacy and ensures traceability, enabling secure and mutually trusted collaboration between hospitals and other stakeholders.




Beyond the backend technological support, Ant Group is also helping hospitals develop user-facing applications. Angel, an AI agent developed in collaboration with public medical institutions in China's Zhejiang Province, has served over 1,000 medical facilities, handling more than 30 million user interactions. Additionally, Ant Group has supported local basic medical insurance services across China in developing Yibaoer, an AI agent designed to assist users with medical insurance-related inquiries.




Upgraded AI Doctor Assistant for Advanced Research



In January 2025, Ant Group completed the acquisition of Haodf, a leading healthcare platform focused on online doctor consultations. This acquisition strengthens Ant Group's commitment to innovating AI-powered healthcare solutions. Together, Ant Group and Haodf launched the AI Doctor Assistant to support the platform's 290,000 doctors with tasks such as patient education and medical record management.




The assistant has now been upgraded to support scientific research by integrating DeepSeek, helping doctors quickly locate relevant research articles and providing comprehensive summaries. It also offers AI-assisted diagnoses based on patient records and medical reports, citing relevant research articles to support doctors in their decision-making process.




Enhanced AI Healthcare Manager for Individual Users' Personalized Services



In September 2024, Ant Group launched the AI Healthcare Manager within the Alipay app. Available through voice and text conversations, this healthcare manager connects users to over 30 services, including doctor mapping, medical report interpretation, in-hospital navigation, and personalized medical advice. Since its launch, the AI Healthcare Manager has assisted 40 million users.




The latest upgrade brings more detailed and personalized health advice. New features include health status self-detection and medical report analysis, offering users a comprehensive approach to managing their well-being.




Since 2014, Ant Group has been supporting the digital and intelligent transformation of China's healthcare sector to fulfill the growing demands of its population, helping medical institutions, doctors and health insurers provide more efficient, accessible, and personalized services for all users.




Ant Insurance, Ant Group's online insurance brokerage platform, has supported leading insurers in providing more accessible insurance services. In 2024, insurers in China processed 7.25 million health claims through Ant Insurance, marking a 55% year-over-year increase, driven by ongoing innovations in product offerings and user experience.




Five years ago, with the introduction of China's Medical Insurance Code—the e-certificate for basic medical insurance—Chinese citizens no longer needed to carry a physical medical insurance card when visiting hospitals or drugstores. By the end of 2024, over 700 million people had activated their e-certificates via Alipay.




About Ant Group



Ant Group aims to build the infrastructure and platforms to support the digital transformation of the service industry. Through continuous innovation, we strive to provide all consumers and small and micro businesses equal access to digital financial and other daily life services that are convenient, sustainable and inclusive.

Aurora Public Schools is partnering with Community College of Aurora to launch the state's first health science high school. Aurora voters approved a bond in 2024 that will fund the project. The school will prepare students for careers in health care and address the growing demand for health care workers.

The magnet school, which doesn't have a name yet, will give students a head start in the workforce by offering hands-on experiences and college-level courses. Lisa Adams, Ed.D., the director of Career and Technical Education (CTE) at APS, says this health science high school is the first of its kind in Colorado.

The program is especially important now, as the health care sector continues to face challenges related to workforce shortages, particularly after the pandemic.

"There are about 50,000 health care worker positions available right now, including a deficit of 10,000 registered nurses," Adams explained. "This school is part of our effort to bridge that gap."

The school's curriculum will provide students with the opportunity to explore various health care fields before they graduate. Programs offered will include nursing, behavioral health, medical imaging (X-ray focus), respiratory therapy and surgical technology.

"We are really excited about this project because we understand that students are asking for more hands-on learning, particularly in health care," Adams explained. "What could be better than upskilling our students, preparing our students for their future, but also upskilling the community?"

Each pathway is built to include concurrent enrollment in college-level courses through a partnership with the Community College of Aurora (CCA). Students will have the chance to earn college credits and industry certifications that are stackable and transferable to further education or immediate employment.

Through collaboration with UCHealth, students will receive hands-on training in these fields.

David Mafe, chief diversity officer and vice president of human resources at UCHealth, says this approach will prepare students for health care fields that serve Aurora and its surrounding communities.

"Students will not just learn the theory behind health care, they will have the chance to work directly with medical professionals in real-world environments, including simulation labs and clinical settings," Mafe explained.

The school will be located near North Middle School. Its proximity to UCHealth will allow students to gain experience through onsite opportunities.

Students who complete the program may have the opportunity to work for UCHealth, where they could benefit from the Ascend program, a debt-free education program that helps employees continue their education while working in health care.

Once fully operational, the school is expected to graduate around 120 students annually, offering the community a steady pipeline of qualified, industry-ready workers.

The health science high school is set to open in 2027.    

"Our hope is to be able to hire as many of them as we possibly can," Mafe said. "We need workforce pipelines. We need people who are excited about this work, and this is exactly the demographic that we need in our organization."

Raducanu on feeling competitive and happy off court

Emma Raducanu has, by her own admission, never been afraid to do things "a little bit differently".

So it feels on brand that the British number two has reached the first WTA 1,000 quarter-final of her career without a full-time coach.

Raducanu secured her fourth win in a row at the Miami Open by beating American 17th seed Amanda Anisimova on Monday.

It is the first time the 22-year-old has strung together that many victories in one tournament since the 2021 US Open - when she sealed a fairytale triumph as a teenage qualifier.

"I'd say I'm a bit of a free spirit so I don't need restrictions or being told what to do," Raducanu, ranked 60th in the world, said.

"I think when I'm being really authentic, that's when I'm playing my best."

As she prepares to play US Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wednesday's quarter-final, BBC Sport analyses how Raducanu is thriving without a full-time coach.

Emma Raducanu is set to regain her place in the world's top 50 after the Miami Open

Whether it has been winning a Grand Slam title as an unknown rookie, employing a carousel of coaches, or tailoring her schedule outside of the accepted norm, Raducanu regularly does what she thinks is right for her.

That doesn't always work out for the best, but she continues to stay true to her convictions.

Ending a short-lived partnership with Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of this tournament was another decision which was initially met by surprise.

But her run on the hard courts in Miami - a faster surface which suits her style - suggests the move has paid off.

Raducanu has played with a freedom and confidence only seen sporadically since her stunning US Open success.

"I feel when I am boxed into a regimented way then I am not able to express myself in the same way," Raducanu told Sky Sports.

In Florida she has been guided by Mark Petchey - a well-known figure in British tennis circles who worked with her as a teenager.

Petchey, who used to coach Andy Murray in his salad days on the ATP Tour, has been giving pointers on the practice courts and offering coaching advice from Raducanu's box.

Petchey has been working alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue and fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura.

What Raducanu describes as a "different approach" has brought an emphasis on having fun at the right times, with shorter, less intense practice and warm-up sessions.

"This week has been a great eye-opener to just when I'm happy and expressive and myself," Raducanu said.

"Having people that I've known for a very long time, since before the US Open, is the most valuable thing for this week at least."

Raducanu's chopping and changing of coaches has been well documented - and the reasons behind their departures have varied.

In 2023, after splitting with a fifth coach in two years, Raducanu believed her "provoking" and "challenging" questions went some way to explaining the high turnover.

When she came back from wrist and ankle surgeries in 2024, the Briton turned to a trusted figure in childhood coach Nick Cavaday.

He provided stability and a solid sounding board, but the partnership ended in January when he stepped down because of a health issue.

Raducanu's father Ian secured the services of Platenik, but her results in Miami without him have left some wondering if she even needs a full-time coach.

Examples of players competing for long periods of time without a coach are rare. A recent one is Nick Kyrgios, who reached the 2022 Wimbledon final. 

Never one to miss an opportunity to be provocative, the controversial Australian responded to Raducanu's run by calling coaches "overrated".

"People awfully quiet that Raducanu is winning now - where all the experts at now?" Kyrgios posted on X.

Raducanu seems committed to finding a new full-time coach - but the availability of suitable candidates is limited with a third of the season gone.

Mark Petchey has been working with Raducanu in Miami alongside her long-time confidante Jane O'Donoghue

Raducanu's representatives describe Petchey - balancing the role in Miami with his work as a television commentator - as a "familiar face" who is providing "support".

It is not clear, though, how long the arrangement will go on for.

Former British number one Tim Henman, who has advised Raducanu over the years, believes Petchey's involvement "makes sense" given he knows "Emma's game".

"It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts for," said Henman, who will return to the coaching box himself at this year's Laver Cup as a vice-captain.

"Emma has been fairly vocal that she is comfortable switching coaches - and that's her prerogative. 

"I started playing professional tennis at the end of 1992 and finished in 2007. I had three coaches. 

"I liked the consistency and continuity of working with a coach for a period of time. It was right for me but that doesn't mean it is right for Emma."

Questions have regularly been raised about Raducanu's resilience, given the amount of injuries and issues she has dealt with since her US Open win.

This season has also been challenging. A back injury disrupted her pre-season before a traumatic stalking experience in Dubai and then Cavaday's exit. 

The gritty manner in which she beat world number 10 Emma Navarro in the Miami second round answered some of the sceptics. 

She also showed steel to swat aside third-round opponent McCartney Kessler and Anisimova, who were both hampered physically.

Raducanu feels she has rediscovered her "competitive spirit", conceding: "I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times."

Whatever she goes on to achieve in Florida, the next challenge is sustaining her level over a longer period - something she has so far been unable to do.

Henman points to Raducanu playing more tournaments - even though she lost six of nine matches before the Miami Open - as a reason behind her improved durability.

Raducanu has competed in seven events this year - more than she ever has in the opening three months of the season.

After Miami she will move back inside the world's top 50 for the first time since August 2022.

"It is easy to look at the results but I would look more at the journey of tournament play - that's a big, big positive," said Henman.

"There is no doubt in my mind she's a great player and should be back knocking on the door of the top 30, seeded at Slams and the top 20 if she stays healthy."

MIAMI, March  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Tennis star Leylah Fernandez and her family's nonprofit, the Leylah Annie & Family Foundation, have joined forces with First Serve Miami to launch a new community tennis initiative aimed at underserved youth. Announced during the Miami Open celebrations, the program will kick off this summer at Buccaneer Park in Miami Gardens and offer free tennis instruction, mentorship, and academic enrichment for children ages 5 to 18.

“This partnership truly means a lot to me, as it brings together two things I'm incredibly passionate about – giving back to the community and sharing the love of tennis,” said Fernandez, who lives in Miami. “Together, we'll help empower local youth by giving them the tools to grow both on and off the court.”



The initiative will combine the Leylah Annie & Family Foundation's mission to uplift communities through sport with First Serve Miami's longstanding commitment to providing tennis, life skills, and educational opportunities to Miami-area youth. The after-school program will focus on character development, leadership, teamwork, and academic success—alongside athletic training.

“First Serve Miami is thrilled to join forces with the Leylah Annie & Family Foundation to create lasting impact for Miami's youth,” said Angie Rivera, Executive Director of First Serve Miami. “Our shared vision will help provide these young people with the tools they need to succeed in all areas of life.”

The partnership was officially announced at First Serve Miami's fundraising luncheon at Hard Rock Stadium. This year's theme, “Serving Up Tennis through Programs, Parks and Partnerships,” highlights the tennis community's growing efforts to expand access and equity in the sport.

Raducanu has struggled with form and fitness issues since her only Grand Slam triumph as a teenager and has worked with a string of different coaches without much success, Vladimir Platenik the latest to leave her team last week after 14 days.

After reaching the third round of this year's Australian Open, Raducanu lost five out of her next six matches but has hit her stride in Miami, easing to a 6-1 6-3 fourth-round win over former French Open semi-finalist Amanda Anisimova on Monday.

"Circumstances change all the time, but for me the biggest thing I'm proud of is finding the competitive spirit and being there for every ball and drawing that out of myself," the 22-year-old told reporters after making her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.

"I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.

"That's the biggest win for me, feeling a lot of hunger, feeling on the court competitive, wanting to run down every ball, and that's the biggest win I from this week."

Raducanu, who is being helped by coach Mark Petchey in Miami, next plays fourth-seed Jessica Pegula.

"I feel like in my environment, in my surroundings with the people I'm with, pretty relaxed, and I can be myself and expressive and true to myself. That's important," she added.

"I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just also happy that I was able to transfer onto the court."

Australia Air Force Pilots Also Heard Chinese Navy Live-Fire Warning on Radio

By Kirsty Needham

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), monitoring a Chinese navy warship as it circumnavigated Australia last month, heard it warn it would use live fire in its exercises on a civilian radio broadcast, defence pilots said on Tuesday.

A People's Liberation Army Navy frigate conducted the unprecedented live-fire exercise in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand in February, causing 49 commercial flights to be rerouted.

China has said it gave adequate warning about the drill under international law, but Australian and New Zealand authorities said it fell short of best practice for notifications.

Commercial airlines first heard about the live-fire drill when a Virgin Australia pilot picked up a Chinese navy broadcast on the 121.5 MHz emergency radio channel.

Ahead of a national election due by May, opposition Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton criticised the Labor government for "a situation where our national maritime surveillance was outsourced to a Virgin airline pilot".

At the Australian International Airshow in Avalon on Tuesday, RAAF maritime surveillance pilots said Australia's P-8A Poseidon were flying "high duration, high frequency sorties" and monitoring the Chinese navy warship's transmissions on UHF and VHF at the time, in details that had not previously been made public.

"The transmissions that came through are just standard warnings of their positions as well as their intent of live-fire exercises," said P-8A Poseidon flying officer Patrick Makeham.

He described this as "similar to saying that we will be conducting live firing exercise in those areas".

Air Commodore Gus Porter, director-general of RAAF air combat capability, said the P-8A aircraft were used for anti-submarine warfare and to deter aggression.

"You don't need to be on top of a task group 24 hours a day to be tracking exactly what they are doing," he added.

The RAAF P-8A aircraft conduct routine surveillance patrols in international waters in the South China Sea, which China has criticised.

Australia last month complained to China over what it was "unsafe and unprofessional" actions by a Chinese fighter jet releasing flares within 30 metres (100 feet) of an Australian P-8A aircraft.

                            2025 Miami
                        


WTA Staff


World No. 2 Iga Swiatek of Poland moved one step closer to her first title of the year with a hard-fought 7-6(5), 6-3 victory over No. 22 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the Round of 16 at the Miami Open.

Swiatek needed 2 hours and 5 minutes to battle past former World No. 3 Svitolina, completing the quarterfinal lineup at the year's fourth WTA 1000 event just after midnight on Tuesday morning.

Miami: Draws | Scores | Order of play 

"It was much tougher to problem-solve, especially because Elina was also putting on some pressure," Swiatek said on court after her win. "I needed to adjust, and I'm happy that I picked the right moments at the end to play more aggressively, and sometimes I was more patient."

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Fast facts: Swiatek is still alive in her quest for a second Miami Open title -- she won this event in 2022 to complete the Sunshine Double (winning Indian Wells and Miami in the same year). The only other women to complete the Sunshine Double are Stefanie Graf (twice), Kim Clijsters and Victoria Azarenka.

Swiatek is indeed titleless so far in 2025 -- but despite that fact, she is still the tour leader in main-draw match-wins for the year. Her win over Svitolina was her 21st of the season, moving her ahead of Mirra Andreeva and Aryna Sabalenka's 20 victories apiece.

Swiatek is also now 13-1 against Ukrainian players at Hologic WTA Tour events. Her only WTA Tour-level loss to a Ukrainian player was against Svitolina, in the 2023 Wimbledon quarterfinals.

Match moments: Swiatek was up a break on three separate occasions in the first set, but each of those times, Svitolina broke back in the very next game, and the pair naturally settled the opening frame in a tiebreak.

Svitolina battled back from 3-0 down in the breaker, but Swiatek used deep, heavy forehands on the humid night to keep herself from falling behind. Swiatek earned her first set point at 6-5 with a crosscourt backhand winner, and the Pole closed out the one-set lead with one last forehand winner after 62 grueling minutes.

In the second set, Swiatek had three break points to take a dominant 5-1 lead, but Svitolina swatted those away and was eventually able to pull back on serve at 4-3. However, Swiatek broke again in a challenging 5-3 game, and she powered her way to victory from there. Swiatek finished the match with 34 winners to Svitolina's 22.

Wild card awaits: Swiatek will now face an unexpected opponent in the quarterfinals: 19-year-old wild card Alexandra Eala of the Philippines.

Eala moved into the first Hologic WTA Tour quarterfinal of her career when her fourth-round opponent, No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, withdrew in advance of their match due to a lower back injury.

Even though she received a walkover today, World No. 140 Eala is not to be taken lightly. Eala had been 0-4 against Top 40 players coming into Miami, but had a breakthrough win over No. 25 Jelena Ostapenko in the second round and an even bigger win over No. 5 Madison Keys in the third round.

With those wins, Eala became the first Filipina woman in the Open Era to defeat Grand Slam singles champions at any WTA Tour event -- and now she will play another in five-time major champion Swiatek.

Spring has sprung, the sun is out and Duke men's tennis stayed hot with a pair of conference victories.

This weekend, No. 13 Duke cruised to two ACC wins at home, clearing out the SMU Mustangs 4-0 Friday before defeating Boston College 6-1 two days later. With the win Sunday, the Blue Devils improved their record to 14-4 overall and 7-1 in ACC play. 

After a tough loss to Clemson last weekend snapped its streak of five conference wins, all Duke wanted was to get back on track. And after two weeks on the road, the Blue Devils got to do it on their home court. 

Right off the bat, the Blue Devils crafted a 1-0 lead after a pair of doubles victories. 

Junior Pedro Rodenas and senior Connor Krug dealt the first blow: After an early 1-2 deficit, the duo claimed five of the next six games en route to a 6-3 win. On court one, sophomore Cooper Williams and graduate student Andreja Petrovic were in a similar position, trailing the Mustangs 1-2. As the set went back and forth to settle at a 3-3 tie, the Duke pair persevered to win the next three games, grabbing the doubles point for the Blue Devils. 

Off to an early lead, the Blue Devils were dialed in. As the singles matches unfolded, the Blue Devils won the first set on all six courts.

Up against SMU's Maks Silagy in the No. 5 spot, a three-game run was exactly what Krug needed to secure his first set 6-2. Without stepping off the gas, Krug followed it up with another 6-2 set, claiming the first singles contest and setting the tone for the rest of the day.

On court two, both No. 71 Williams and SMU's Georgi Georgiev were having a good day. After the Duke sophomore surged to an early 5-0 advantage, it was Georgiev's turn. But although the Mustang managed to win three straight games, that was all Williams would give him, delivering a final blow to secure the set 6-3. Before long, Williams took the second set too, 6-1, propelling Duke to a 3-0 lead.

“They're a dangerous team and played well, but I thought across the board we came out ready to go,” head coach Ramsey Smith said. 

Even though his opponent took the early lead, 1-2, it was merely a falter in Rodenas' step. The 36th-ranked Blue Devils' answer was clear as he took the next three games, pushing to a 4-2 lead. After the two competitors traded hit after hit, Rodenas emerged victorious in the end, taking the first set 6-3. The second set proved much the same as Rodenas wrestled his way to 6-3, bringing the team score to 4-0— straight sets across the board.

“It was a collective win,” Smith said. “I was very impressed with the guys today.”

With a resounding win behind them, the air reeked of confidence in Ambler Tennis Stadium, evident as the doubles matches unfolded. 

On court three, junior Gerard Planelles Ripoll and graduate student Remy Dugardin wasted no time establishing dominance with a 6-0 victory. From there, all eyes were on court one, where Williams and Petrovic were trying to recreate their doubles clinch. 

“They both compete extremely well, and they're so good from the ground,” Smith said. “They call themselves the two back team, because when they're two back, they're just pretty dominant.”

As the score hovered at 3-2, the duo went on a four-game run to clear their opponents 6-2, claiming the doubles point for the Blue Devils to give them an early 1-0 advantage. 

It didn't stop there, as Duke took to singles play.

Jake Krug drew first blood for the Blue Devils. Fending off a series of deuces, the senior powered through to a decisive 6-0 set win before dropping the first game of the second set to Boston College's Connor McDonald. Krug went on to win four games in a row. 

With the set at 4-2, McDonald fought back, managing to break Krug's serve and edge closer to a tie. With a fire lit under him, the Blue Devil responded by giving the Eagle a taste of his own medicine. After breaking McDonald's serve to make the score 5-3 — Krug finished the set off with a three-point lead, clinching the second team point of the day for the Blue Devils. A dominant straight-set victory and the Blue Devils's first singles win of the day, a more impressive result given it was only his fourth appearance this season.

“I just know I can count on [Krug],” Smith said. “And I don't know how he does as well as he does, because it's hard when you're not building rhythm.”

Fortunately for Duke, Petrovic kept the rhythm building with a two-set win over Boston College's Caleb Saltz. In set one, the Oslo, Norway, native delivered a masterclass in tennis, taking game after game after game to amass a 5-0 lead. And after conceding a single game to Saltz, Petrovic closed out the set 6-1. A few games later, Petrovic did it again — this time on a break point — winning the set 6-2 and extending Duke's lead to 3-0. 

On court six, a pair of four-game runs built Eagles junior Aidan Pack's straight-set victory. Graduate student Oscar Brown tried but failed to respond, dropping the sets 2-6, 1-6, respectively. 

Still, the Eagles only delayed the inevitable: It wasn't long before Ripoll certified the team win for Duke in the No. 3 spot. After his opponent surged to an early 5-2 lead in the first set, a Boston College win seemed imminent. But Ripoll countered back with a five-game run, claiming the set 7-5. In the next set, the score was 5-2 and the Blue Devil was cruising. Ripoll then spun an ace to win the set and the match, crowning Duke the team victor for the day. 

From there, the dominoes kept falling. Although Duke had already secured the team win on paper, both coaches chose to play through the remaining matches. 

“Every match is a big deal,” Smith said. “We don't have too many of these opportunities left.”

Back in the No. 2 spot, the game was intense. Even with the winning team decided, everyone's eyes were on Connor Krug and the scoreboard. He'd won the first set 6-3, but the second set was a tougher battle. He'd started strong, gliding to a 3-0 lead. But before long it was 3-3, then 4-4 and then 5-5. A match that should've ended a while ago became agonizingly drawn out by Boston College's Andrew Ilie. 

Ilie took the lead for the first time, breaking Krug's serve to get to 6-5. Krug fought back, and then it was a tie. Again. As the seven-point tiebreaker played out, Krug stayed resolute, claiming the match as he broke the tie 7-2. 

With Duke now 5-1, only one match remained. After dropping his first set 2-6, freshman Saahith Jayaraman rallied back to claim the second, 6-4. From there, Jayaraman went on a rampage, clearing out his opponent in a 10-1 tiebreaker; the cherry on top for a weekend of conference victories.

All aboard the ACC train, the Blue Devils look to keep the momentum going as they face No. 37 Florida State and No. 34 Miami at home next weekend.

“The whole goal is to be playing our best tennis in April and May,” Smith said. “I think we're positioning ourselves well for that.”

Djokovic's 7-1 record against Musetti is pretty standard fare for him. When you're No. 1 for 428 weeks, you tend to build a strong head-to- head history against just about everybody. But look a little closer and you can see that the matchup—I won't call it a rivalry—between the Serb and the Italian is more complicated than it might seem.Twice at Roland Garros, Djokovic has come back to beat Musetti in five sets. In 2021, he lost the first two; in 2024, they played until 3 in the morning. The one time that Musetti prevailed was also a marathon three-setter in Monte Carlo. These two like to construct points, they mix in a lot of slice, and they'll finish at net when they can. All of which makes for entertaining, if prolonged, matches.

The other oddity between these two is that they've only played once on hard courts, in Dubai in 2022. The surface should favor Djokovic, who is a six-time champion in Miami. But will his current form favor him, too?In his first two rounds, Djokovic has jumped out to early leads and won in straight sets. But both times he had to go to a tiebreaker, and fight through some shaky patches, to win the second set. The Andy Murray era still seems to be a work in progress as far as how Djokovic wants to play.

Musetti, meanwhile, hadn't found a groove before Miami, either; he was just 4-2 in 2025 coming into the tournament. But he has competed well at this event, coming back from a set down to beat Quentin Halys and Felix Auger-Aliassime. He may find himself hard at work in a third set again on Tuesday.

Korda and Monfils have met just once, but neither of them will need to be reminded of what the other guy plays like. Their lone encounter happened in Indian Wells not much more than a week ago. Monfils won, but it was as tight as two sets can get, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4).Korda is one of a numbers of a players who started slowly in 2025, but have started to show signs of life during the Sunshine Double. The American beat Stefanos Tsitsipas two days ago for his first notable win of the season. Korda is comfortable here; he made his breakthrough in Miami when he reached the quarters as a 20-year-old in 2021.

Monfils, on the other hand, has been very much alive for this entire year so far. Each week, the 38-year-old seems to break another age-related record. In January, he became the oldest man since 1990 to win a title; this week, he became the oldest to reach the round of 16 at a Masters 1000.Befitting a tennis player of his age, though, he hasn't done it the easy way. Monfils won his first match 6-4 in the third, and his last two 7-6 in the third. He'll be on court at noon on Tuesday, after staying to watch his wife, Elina Svitolina, play late into the evening on Monday.

As those scores show, just about every match Monfils plays can go either way, and every one of them can seem to be decided randomly, by a couple of points late in the final set. Maybe after three tight victories, the old dad is due to lose a close one. And maybe Korda, who should be entering his prime at 24, is due to start a surge.

A clenched fist is exactly what Sunday's result felt like for Virginia.

After a gut-wrenching loss Friday to No. 14 California that tested the resilience of the squad, No. 6 Virginia bounced back, taking down No. 8 Stanford 4-2 in a statement win at home Sunday. The weekend served as a full-circle moment for the Cavaliers (12-6, 4-4 ACC), who leaned on their resilience, embraced lineup experimentation and found answers under pressure. 

“This adversity, these tough times — you need to have them to have great times,” Coach Andres Pedroso said he told his team following the match against the Golden Bears. “I don't know when those great moments will come, but they will. And this is a real test of our culture.” 

In Friday's battle against the Golden Bears (13-2, 6-2 ACC), the Cavaliers found themselves in another close match against a top-20 team, but the Golden Bears proved just a little sharper in big moments, handing the Cavaliers a 4-3 loss.

The doubles point slipped just out of the reach for Virginia. With yet another new lineup — graduate student James Hopper and freshman Keegan Rice playing Line 1, sophomore Dylan Dietrich and freshman Rafael Jódar playing Line 2, and juniors Mans Dahlberg and Ty Switzer debuting at Line 3 — the Cavaliers found promise but could not seal the deal. 

After breaking early, Dietrich and Jódar rode their strong baseline games to a 6-4 win on Court 2. The top singles duo turned Line 2 doubles partners capitalized on their strong forehands, translating their strong singles play into doubles.

“It's different,” Dietrich said of partnering with Jódar. “[Jódar] and I play a quicker doubles — hit the ball big and try to finish points fast. It's a different dynamic than with [Dahlberg], where it's more about building the point and being tricky at the net.”

But Hopper and Rice, despite having an early 3-1 lead, couldn't hold the momentum and fell 5-7, while Dahlberg and Switzer were broken midway through and lost 3-6. 

In singles, it was a day of tight sets. At Line 1, Jódar earned a top-10 win 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3), overcoming a controversial call late in the second set that nearly swung the momentum. The win gave Jódar his 14th-straight win and improved his record to 10-0 on the top singles court. At Line 2, Dietrich continued with his strong play, breezing through his match 6-3, 6-3 and dominating points with his big forehands and a handful of aces. 

In the middle of the lineup, freshman Roy Horovitz made his Line 4 singles debut. Still regaining strength after his ACL surgery, Horovitz showed flashes of promise, especially in a dominant second set, but fell 5-7, 6-1, 2-6 in a hard-fought battle. 

“He's dying to play,” Dietrich said of Horovitz. “He's probably the hardest-working guy on the team right now — in rehab, in fitness, in practice. It was awesome to see him back out there. It didn't go his way today, but he fought hard. And we need him. He's working on becoming that rock for us, and I know he'll get there.”

Hopper brought his trademark intensity and fight to Line 5, winning the first set 6-2 and then surviving an epic third-set tiebreak. Down 7-8 at one point, Hopper fought back to win 11-9, drawing cheers from teammates and spectators.

At Line 6, Dahlberg played one of the most intense matches of the day. Up 5-4 in the third set, the match slipped into another tiebreaker, where Dahlberg had a match point at 6-5 but ultimately fell 5-7, ending the match in the Golden Bear's favor.

Less than 48 hours later, the Cavaliers faced off against No. 8 Stanford (13-5, 5-3 ACC) and flipped the script — just as Pedroso had predicted. 

“We're going to make some adjustments from today and just continue to fight hard,” Pedroso said after the California loss. “I challenged the guys to be problem-solving machines, and I think they will be. I think you'll see a better Virginia.”

Another new doubles configuration — this time featuring Rice and Dietrich together for the first time — paid off immediately. The pair brought a fast-paced and aggressive style to Line 2, attacking returns early and controlling rallies to dictate points. Rice's volley game complemented Dietrich's steady presence from the back of the court, allowing the duo to roll to a dominant 6-2 win. 

At Line 3, Hopper and Horovitz showed composure under pressure. The duo earned a crucial break at 5-5 and held serve to clinch the doubles point with a 7-5 victory — a strong debut pairing that blended Hopper's experience with Horovitz's quick energy at the net. 

In singles, freshman Jangjun Kim reentered the lineup and immediately delivered a steady, composed performance at Line 5. Known for his steady play and smart point-building, Kim controlled tempo from the baseline and took advantage of short balls to close quickly at the net. His 6-3, 6-4 win gave Virginia its first singles point and early breathing room in the match.

Stanford, however, clawed back into the match. At Line 6, the Cardinals defeated Dahlberg 6-3, 6-4 and Line 4 saw the Cardinals edge out Hopper in a rollercoaster three-setter, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2. These results leveled the match at 2-2.

With pressure mounting, Dietrich delivered a response. He bounced back from a dropped second set by stepping inside the baseline and overwhelming his opponent with pace to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 at Line 2. He raced through the third set to put the Cavaliers back in front. 

That left it to Rice at Line 3. After dropping the first set 4-6, Rice responded with more energy. He surged through the second set 6-2 to force a decider, but the third was anything but smooth sailing. Rice fell behind multiple times, down a break, but each time, he found answers — grinding out rallies, redirecting pace, and keeping his footwork steady under pressure. Down in the third set, Rice rallied back, breaking his opponent at 5-4 to clinch the match 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 and secure the 4-2 victory for Virginia. 

At Line 1, Jódar's match was left unfinished. He had taken the first set 6-3, dropped a narrow tiebreak in the second, and was tied 1-1 in the third when Rice sealed the win. 

Virginia, despite a rocky ACC slate in which losses, so uncommon in the last handful of seasons, have come with regularity. But Sunday's win felt like a monumental marker and a massive result.

“Any culture can be great when we're winning, but this is a real, true test of our culture, and I know the guys are going to handle it great,” Pedroso said.

The Cavaliers will look to build on Sunday's win as they hit the road next weekend for a pair of ACC matchups, facing Notre Dame and Louisville.

Penn men's tennis junior Manfredi Graziani isn't at Penn to play — he is here to win.


“My first impression of him was that he was a super fiery competitor,” coach Rich Bonfiglio said. “He brought a lot of emotion and just fired it up on court.”
		

Graziani's tennis career began at age four in Italy, and later in Switzerland. He played on the junior circuit until coming to Penn in the fall of 2022. 


His freshman season actually overlapped with the senior season of his brother, who was an Ivy League Player of the Year, three-time first-team All-Ivy, and a two-time NCAA tournament qualifier.

“Having my brother here definitely made my decision easier for where I wanted to play in college,” Graziani said. “So when I got offered a spot, it was hard for me to say no.”


Graziani's decision to compete for Penn and also study Accounting and Finance at Wharton has definitely led to much success for the program. During his freshman year, he led the team in wins with 16, only dropping three matches throughout the season. Graziani also ended Temple's nation-leading 16-match win streak that spring season. During his freshman and sophomore year, Graziani was named an ITA Scholar-Athlete. 
	

Now as a junior, Graziani plays the top seeds in both singles and doubles and continues to be a reliable player for the Quakers.


“He was someone that we could always rely on for a point,” Bonfiglio said. 


Earlier this season, Graziani reached 50 career singles wins. A couple of standout matches came against Yale and Harvard earlier in the season where he took down nationally ranked opponents. Bonfiglio told the DP in an interview that he's expecting Graziani to enter the rankings himself any week now.


According to Graziani, the next goal is to qualify for NCAAs not only as an individual but also as a team. The team recorded a program record for most home wins after a sweep of Liberty and Wagner last weekend. Graziani notably won in singles at No.1 in two sets against Liberty that weekend. Looking ahead to senior year, Graziani also has his eye on an All-American title. 


“He can be a top 50 player in college tennis,” Bonfiglio said. “And he definitely has the ability to make NCAA singles and doubles. He has lofty goals but he also has the ability to go after them.”


Graziani recognizes that he was always talented but credits Penn for helping him develop the skills necessary to succeed at the highest level.


“I've always been talented and a good competitor," Graziani said. “But Penn has helped me with consistency. I don't think I achieved my full potential when I was younger because I was lazy, but the coaches here have pushed me and helped me succeed.”


Bonfiglio also recognized Graziani's drive, crediting his ability to find and fix his mistakes while on the court.


“His tennis has obviously improved and he's quite fitter than his freshman year,” Bonfiglio said. “That's something he learned … He knew he wanted to play a very physical game. So he definitely pushes himself, especially in the gym and during speed drills.”

Graziani's success this year has led him to consider possibly taking a year after graduation to play on the professional circuit. 


Although he has yet to make up his mind, he has one more goal he'd like to achieve during his time at Penn.


“My brother was one of the best tennis players Penn has seen,” Graziani said. “So I'm trying to break a few of his records before I leave.”

Tennis fans have condemned the "terrible" and "disrespectful" treatment that Alex de Minaur received from the crowd in his stunning win over Brazilian young gun Joao Fonseca at the Miami Open on Monday night. De Minaur dropped the first set before coming back to win 5-7 7-5 6-3 to advance to the Round of 16.

The Aussie World No.11 had to overcome a raucous crowd that was packed with Brazilians cheering on Fonseca, who has become a fan favourite in recent months amid a meteoric rise. Spectators were going wild for Fonseca all throughout the match, but they crossed the line with some of their treatment of de Minaur.

The Aussie had to stop his service motion a number of times because fans were yelling out, with many also cheering when he made an error or served a fault. Chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani asked fans to be more respectful on a number of occasions, and appeared to grow highly frustrated when he was ignored.

A number of boos also rang out around the Hard Rock Stadium when de Minaur sealed the victory on match point. The Aussie showed his class by applauding his 18-year-old opponent as he left the court.

Taking to social media, viewers blasted the ugly scenes and said the crowd had gotten out of control. One person wrote: "I think the support that Fonseca is getting is really cool in one way, but cheering at a fault is kinda disgusting behaviour. And it's very satisfying to see a player win when the crowd is against them. Shout out Alex de Minaur."

Another person commented: "The crowd is being so disrespectful, it's been incredibly hard to watch. The most disruptive ones need to be kicked out because why are they allowed to yell consistently during de Minaur's service games?"

While a third added: "A few matches ago this was fun but it's just becoming disrespectful. Both great players but you can see the noise getting to De Minaur."

De Minaur won widespread praise for the way he handled the crowd and Fonseca to progress. "A lot of it was mental and staying focused in the moment," said on court after the match. “There's no other way. You can go out there and complain and get rattled. You can do a lot of different things. But that won't help you win the match.

"Ultimately, that's what I told myself. It's gonna be a battle not only against the player, but against the crowd. Just put your head down, do the work, and try to compete every single point.”

The Aussie is attempting to find some form amid a worrying slump that has seen him slide from World No.6. The 18-year-old Fonseca is a staggering 27-5 in his last 32 matches - including four titles - but the Demon prevailed to face 29th seed Matteo Berrettini.

It was awful. It was an incredible match and the crowd couldn't even cheer for the winner.

Crowd was pathetic for cheering every first serve fault from De Minaur.

— DjDoug4ever (@djdoug4ever) March 25, 2025

Just incredible composure by De Minaur, especially with the questionable egging on of the crowd by Fonseca in the last gameHe'll remember that win (potentially because he won't be able to beat Fonseca that way again)

— Trenton Jocz (@TrentonJocz) March 25, 2025

God, how disrespectful Brazilians are to De Minaur... they don't even shut up when he's about to serve. What a shame.

— Devonne (@Dev0nne10) March 25, 2025

This crowd at De minaur vs Fonseca is terrible

— Homachi (@Oma_with_a_H) March 25, 2025

What do you guys think of the De Minaur vs Fonseca match? Fonseca is playing lights out but goodness, it's the worse crowd I've ever seen in my whole life and Fonseca is hyping them even more. Alex definitely feels it.

Earlier on Monday (local time), 'lucky loser' Adam Walton advanced to the Round of 16 to continue his stunning run at the ATP 1000 event. The stunned Australian beat Hong Kong wildcard Coleman Wong 7-6 (8-6) 4-6 6-4 to set up a duel with American third seed Taylor Fritz in what will be the biggest match of his life.

The 26-year-old Queenslander had been knocked out in the qualifying stages, but hung around hoping to snag a place as a 'lucky loser' should any of the other players drop out. No.21 seed Hubert Hurkacz then withdrew with injury, and because the Pole had a bye in the first round, Walton replaced him and was sent straight into the second round.

He then beat Italian player Luciano Darderi, before knocking off Wong to make the last 16. "I'm very happy right now, it's just very good fortune this week," Walton said. "I got thrashed in qualifying and got the call three days later to play again, it almost feels like a new start, a new tournament. I'm just happy to be through to the last 16."

Meanwhile, top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to beat fellow Aussie Jordan Thompson 7-5 6-4. The German World No.2 was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.

Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his haul of seven Masters 1000 titles. "Jordan made it difficult for me for sure. He's a quality player," said Zverev. "When you're in rhythm, he knows how to break it a little bit. So he did extremely well today. I'm happy with my level from 1-4 onwards."

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Dick Van Dyke and his wife, Arlene Silver, changed up their looks to match two musical icons.

On Sunday, March 23, Silver, 52, took to her Instagram account to post a video montage with photos of her and the 99-year-old entertainment legend dressed up as country stars Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers performing their 1983 chart-topping song "Islands in the Stream."

The Mary Poppins star wore a cream-colored suit with a white button-down shirt underneath and sported white facial hair similar to the late singer's. Meanwhile, Silver donned a bedazzled purple dress paired with a large diamond necklace and blonde wig, which emulated Parton's voluminous hair and signature look.

Silver captioned her post, "Dick & Arlene Van Dyke as Dolly Parton & Kenny Rogers 🏝️ 🌊 Luke Adams as Anything For A Laugh: The Chuck Barris Page ❤️🎈❤️."

The husband and wife duo, who wed in 2012, were seemingly dressing up for a "Vandy Manor" show. It is unclear when the photos were taken. The couple has been throwing a Halloween "Spooktacular" event for years called "Vandy Manor" at their Malibu California home and are now doing another event called "Vandy Camp," which they started earlier this month.

A post shared by Arlene Silver (@bijoubox)

They held their first "Vandy Camp" event on Saturday, March 8, consisting of a Q&A for the six-time Emmy Award winner and multiple musical performances from him and Silver. Fans and friends attended the intimate event.

In July 2024, the comedian spoke to Entertainment Tonight about meeting his sweetheart at the SAG Awards in 2006.

"I never approached a strange woman in my life," Van Dyke told the outlet. "And she walked by and I jumped and said, 'Hi, I'm Dick.' I had no idea she was half my age. Beautiful."

Silver was a makeup artist then, and the former sitcom star explained, "She had one [business] card left, which I took and hired her," he noted.

Silver revealed Van Dyke was the person who got her comfortable to sing, telling the publication, "He's always happy and just positive. Always singing, and I would never sing in public. He got me to sing. He got me to sing up on a stage and sang in front of 1,500 people for the first time. He's just the most joyful person. He influences everybody else to be more joyful, playful."

Drew Barrymore was abruptly ghosted after a first date and did not see it coming. 

The 50 First Dates actress opened up about the "cryptic" experience during Monday's (March 24) episode of her eponymous talk show. 

"Drew Crew" members Valerie Bertinelli and Ross Matthews agreed with Barrymore before the host highlighted the relatability of her circumstance. 

 "It does happen to all of us! The best of us, good people, who wouldn't treat other people like that necessarily."

The Never Been Kissed star also read the text message to her friends, who helped her analyze its meaning. 

"Today, my friend said, ‘Well, did he answer the ha with one a?' I'm not kidding. This happened. And I was like, ‘No, it was like five or six a's.' And they were like, 'Oh no, that's great!'"

Barrymore revealed that the surprising text ultimately saved her time because she would never continue to date someone who communicated so poorly, encouraging the audience to steer clear of "people who waste our time."

Watch Barrymore describe her most recent dating experience below.

Nia Long shared a cryptic message amid speculation that she and daytime talk show host Sherri Shepherd had a heated confrontation at a Broadway show.

During Monday's (March 24) broadcast of the "Sherri" show, Shepherd revealed that she had a tense exchange with an unnamed celebrity during Sunday's (March 23) premiere of "Othello," a Broadway production starring Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal. 

Shepherd said she was conversing with friends when the celebrity physically turned her around and accused her of "shading" them on her daytime show.

“I'm standing there talking. Somebody grabbed my arms, and they forcefully turned me around,” Shepherd recalled on Monday's broadcast. “So I'm in a good mood, so I go, ‘Hi, what's going on?' 'cause I know her. And she says to me, she goes, ‘You've been shading me a lot.'”

Despite Shepherd denying the accusation, "She goes, ‘Yes you have,' and then she just walked off,” the host said.

The comedian said she was confused by the confrontation because she doesn't "shade many people."

"It might be one person I shade and I … I never have shaded this unnamed celebrity," she said.

“I would say to unnamed celebrity because you think I shaded you — which means you watch my show — I don't know who you think I am. I think you got me confused with somebody, one of the bloggers or the influencers, because I know I didn't shade you," Shepherd added.

As fan speculation swirled over who the unnamed celebrity was, Page Six reported that the confrontation unfolded between Shepherd and Long.

Long shared a cryptic post on Instagram on Monday as rumors swirled about the alleged Broadway battle.

"About last night..." the actress wrote with a kissing face emoji.

One fan interpreted the post as a "classy" response from Long amid the reports.

“Classy, no response is the response,” one person commented.

"Gangsta Nia Long, rolling up to Sherri on Broadway, I can't 😩😆," another said.

Singer Sonu Nigam's performance at the Delhi Technological University's (DTU) Engifest 2025 took an ugly turn when a section of the crowd began hurling stones and bottles at the stage during the Sunday event. The circumstances led to Sonu Nigam halting his performance midway, as he, without losing his calm, urged the crowd not to behave in such a rash manner.

"Main aapke liye aaya hun yahan pe so that we can all have a good time. I'm not asking you to not enjoy, but please aisa na kariye (I have come here for you so that we can all have a good time. I'm not asking you to not enjoy, but please don't do this)," he said to the audience, reported Hindustan Times.

The famous singer shared several videos of the event, but did not mention anything about the said incident. Reportedly, he continued the show after the audience was brought under control. 

It was reported that the event consisted of over one lakh attendees. Speaking to the media, a few students later called the incident shameful. "It was shameful to see that just because of a few unruly students, a legend like him had to pause and request the audience to behave," they said.

It's been over two years since Pedro Pascal's Starbucks coffee order went viral online, and he's finally speaking out about it.

If you didn't see, in March of 2023, a video of Pedro holding his Starbucks drink drew a ton of comments, because the sticker on the plastic cup revealed exactly what he ordered.

He was drinking an iced quad espresso in a venti cup with extra ice and six shots.

At the time, fans figured out that he was likely consuming around 384 mg of caffeine with this drink, at around 64 mg per shot.

Now, he's speaking out about his morning brew.

On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Pedro said of his coffee order going viral, “I cannot begin to tell you how violating this was!”

“There's so much context to why it has become six shots of espresso. It was always a quad but then I feel like the cups got bigger and, I don't know, the shots got less strong. At some point, it became six," he said. “It was an incredibly private morning ritual that I never wanted anyone to know about."

“You sip it and you get really high, and you answer emails and stuff,” he added, noting that he doesn't drink any additional coffee besides this drink.

Pedro was recently linked romantically to this major star, but a source just clarified the nature of their relationship.

Michael Caine's 70-plus years in Hollywood allowed him to form friendships with some major stars — and the actor has no qualms when it comes to sharing stories about them.

Caine's latest memoir (his eighth published book) Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life was released in the United States on Tuesday, March 25, and features “life hacks” from the legendary star. While sharing tricks of the trade he's learned along the way, Caine couldn't help but spill the tea on his famous friends. (This book was initially released in the U.K. late last year.)

From anecdotes about working with Beyoncé to referring to the late Quincy Jones as his “celestial twin,” Caine has some pretty epic anecdotes up his sleeve.

Keep scrolling for stories from the actor about his famous friends:



Ledger worked with Caine on 2008's The Dark Knight, the second movie in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Caine recalled the late Ledger as a “lovely guy, very gentle and unassuming,” but noted that the late star really turned it on when it became time to transform into The Joker.

“It was chilling. Absolutely floored me the first time I saw him in action – I was terrified!” Caine wrote of Ledger's portrayal, noting that the late star will be remembered as a “great actor.” Ledger died at age 28 from an accidental overdose in January 2007.

“You think of what he might have gone on to achieve, it's just heartbreaking. We were all terribly shocked, and it made doing the publicity for The Dark Knight that summer much more intense, because all the journalists wanted to talk about his death,” he recalled. “I was so pleased when he was awarded the posthumous Oscar, because it must have been at least some sort of comfort for his poor family. The truth is, we'd all hoped he would win an Academy Award and thought he should, even while we were still filming the movie.”

Caine worked with “the amazing” O'Toole in the 1959 stage show The Long and the Short and the Tall, and they struck up quite the friendship.

“We became great friends and one night he took me out on the Saturday after the show to get pissed. Which I did, as did he,” Caine recalled. “We woke up the next morning and we had no idea where we were. We were both fully clothed lying on top of a double bed.”

When they woke up, it was Monday!

Caine and Allen frequented the same restaurant and once, Farrow asked to meet the famed director.

“She said, ‘Well, if you're ever there and you see Woody Allen at another table, invite me along to dinner.' And so I did. Which is how they really met,” Caine recalled, noting elsewhere in the book that he didn't anticipate how things would end between them. (Farrow accused Allen in 1992 of molesting their adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow, which he has vehemently denied.)

Caine immediately clocked the late Jones as “a great person” when they first met. After Caine invited Jones to his birthday party, the two stars realized that they share a birth date and time.

“We call ourselves ‘celestial twins,'” Caine wrote, noting that it became “a bit of a tradition” for him and Jones to celebrate their milestone birthdays together.

“For our sixtieth birthdays in 1993, we had a great bash in L.A. Ice-T came along and challenged me to rap with him!” he recalled. “Then we had another great party for our eightieth in Vegas, with Stevie Wonder singing ‘Happy Birthday' and Chaka Khan doing the theme song from Alfie.”

Jones died in November 2024 but was still alive when Caine wrote this book.

“Those are amazing memories, to be cherished,” he wrote. “We had a sense of humor in common, and he was such easy company from the get-go. I think that's the heart of friendship, isn't it? You don't have to watch yourself and what you say, you can relax and be natural. When I say we are twins, I do mean that he feels like another brother to me. A great addition to my life, and I hope I was to his. I can't remember a bad moment in our friendship.”

Caine called the actor “special” in his book, recalling the first time they crossed paths.

“I just instinctively greeted him with a hug and announced to the whole room, ‘This is my son!' Sometimes, you sense a connection,” Caine shared. “I just liked the guy immediately, he has a big heart. It turned out he was going through some tough times back then, so I think perhaps it made an impression upon him to be embraced and treated with love. Anyway, we've been great friends ever since.”

The actor said that he always has dinner with the “multi-talented” Diesel when they're in the same place at the same time.

Caine got a chance to work alongside Beyoncé in the 2002 movie Austin Powers in Goldmember. The singer shared her big dreams with the legendary star.

“You could already tell how focused she was and how big a star she was going to be,” he recalled. “I remember the first day on set, I asked her what her ambition was, and she said, ‘I want to win an Academy Award for a movie.' Not a trace of arrogance, just clarity. She was nominated a couple of years ago. I'm sure she'll win an Oscar eventually.”

PARIS (AP) — French actor Gérard Depardieu acknowledged Tuesday that he used crude and heated language around a woman who accuses him of sexual assault and grabbed her hips but denied assaulting her, as he testified for the first time at his landmark trial in Paris.

She told the court that he'd behaved “like a madman” who took “pleasure in frightening me.”

Day 2 of the Paris trial centered on the Oscar-nominated actor's behavior during the filming in 2021 of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.

The 76-year-old has denied assaulting the women. But during more than an hour of testimony Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.

Depardieu said he'd been in a “bad mood" because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.

“I understand perfectly if she's a bit upset,” he said in his gruff, deep voice so familiar to cinemagoers. “I don't have to talk like that, get angry like that, voilà."

But he insisted that he isn't a sexual predator. “I'm not touching the butts of women,” Depardieu said.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict isn't expected immediately after the trial.

Plaintiff details alleged assault

The set dresser testified after Depardieu. She described the alleged assault in detail, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.

She said he grabbed her hips then started “palpating” her behind and "in front, around.” She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.

“That's when I had a reflex of ‘My God.' I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn't do it," she testified. “He terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman."

“It was very brief, there was no shouting,” she said, adding that she'd been too “petrified” to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu's hands from her.

“I saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that's what I felt, it's savagery,” she said. "He terrified me, and that amused him.”

She said Depardieu's calm and cooperative attitude in court bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.

“Here, he's exemplary, he doesn't move, he's quiet, he doesn't make any noise," she said. “He's not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women."

On the movie set, “he started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities,” she said.

The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.

Depardieu acknowledges boorish behavior

Because of Depardieu's fame and impact on the French movie industry, his trial is seen as an important test of French willingness to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.

His long and storied career — he told that court that he's made more than 250 movies — has turned him into a giant of the French movie industry. French President Emmanuel Macron has included himself among Depardieu's many admirers, calling him a “great actor” who "makes France proud.” That was in 2023, when the star was already facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.

In his testimony, Depardieu said he'd noticed that the set dresser had been taken aback by his behavior and language. He acknowledged that he sometimes has a potty mouth and that his behavior can be boorish.

“I've always been told I have a Russian nature, I don't know if it's because of the drinking or the vulgarity,” he said. “I have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob."

But he said he “never, ever” would have pincered a woman between his legs against her will.

“I'm not like that," he said.

Jason Issacs is passing his wand over to another wizard.

The actor, who played Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, has a specific actor in mind to take over the role for the upcoming HBO TV series. In fact, Issacs would like to see the role gender-swapped, he told Variety in a recent interview.

"Meryl Streep," Issacs said when asked who he would cast in the part. "She can do anything, that woman. There's literally no limit to what she can do."

As for any advice for those entering the Wizarding World, Issacs said he doesn't have any to give.

"I wouldn't have any advice at all. Why would I bother? I know some of the people they're casting already. They're brilliant actors. It's going to be fantastic, and the last thing they need is advice from some old fart like me," Issacs said.

HBO announced in June 2024 that Francesca Gardiner will serve as the series' showrunner, while Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct episodes. The network also released an official synopsis for the show at that time.

The show "will be a faithful adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter book series by author and executive producer J.K. Rowling," the synopsis reads. "The series will feature a new cast to lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail and much-loved characters Harry Potter fans have loved for over twenty-five years."

Sam Nivola, who plays Lochlan Ratliff on The White Lotus, revealed why he broke the HBO show's strict NDA and who now knows the fate of his character on the drama series.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for season three, episode six of The White Lotus.

One guest of The White Lotus ignored the hotel's strict do not disturb sign.

Indeed, Sam Nivola—who plays the Ratliff family's youngest child Lochlan alongside Patrick Schwarzenegger's Saxon and Sarah Catherine Hook's Piper on season three—admitted that he broke the show's notoriously strict non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to reveal the fate of his character on the HBO series to a few people closest to him.

“I told my parents, but I haven't told my sister,” the 21-year-old told Variety in an interview published March 23. “She's bad at keeping secrets.”

Sam also told girlfriend Iris Apatow, whose parents are Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, for one simple reason. “I told my girlfriend,” he added, “because she was there while we were shooting it. That's about it.”

And ever since he blabbed to a select few, Sam—who, along with his sister May, is the child of English actress Emily Mortimer and her husband Alessandro Nivola—confessed he has a fear of retribution. 

“I'm not supposed to have told anyone, because I'm under a lot of NDAs,” he quipped. “I'm really scared about getting sued by HBO.”

While Sam has made sure to keep the show's final episodes (mostly) close to his chest, the Perfect Couple alum was up front about his experience filming this season's most recent developments—namely, the shocking alcohol- and drug-fueled moments of incest between his and Patrick's characters. 

"It was very weird kissing Patrick because he's a really good friend of mine,” he explained. “And, you know, I'm straight, he's straight. It's already weird."

Plus, the much-discussed plot point—which also included Charlotte Le Bon, who plays Chloe—was actually the first sex scene of Sam's career.

"I was totally nervous," he shared. "I'm a very anxious person, so I'm always nervous, especially on a big job like that. Doing the sex scene was nerve-racking, and we were on a boat, and I get seasick, so that was f--king stressful.”

Despite the nerves and discomfort, though, the days on set went well, thanks to the show's creator Mike White.

“The actual scene itself went smoothly,” Sam said. “Mike White was sort of calming about it, and I really trusted Patrick and Charlotte."

Read on to learn more about the cast of The White Lotus' third season. 

Lalisa Manobal

How you like that? The singer known mononymously as Lisa went from being a rockstar on world stages as part of K-pop group Blackpink—alongside Jisoo, Jennie and Rosé—to donning the White Lotus staff uniform for her big debut as Mook.

Jason Isaacs

Looks like Lucius Malfoy missed the train to Hogwarts and instead landed at The White Lotus. That's right: He may look different without the luscious blond hair, but the Harry Potter star is returning to the screen as another uppity father figure, playing Timothy Ratliff, described as a "wealthy businessman vacationing with his wife and three children."

Isaacs has also made more recent appearances on TV shows like Robot Chicken, The Great and Sex Education (alongside his White Lotus costar Aimee Lou Wood.)

Parker Posey

Don't scream when you see it, but Posey—who plays Timothy's wife Victoria Ratliff—may look familiar from her movies Superman Returns, Blade: Trinity, Scream 3 and Dazed and Confused. She's also had brief stints on such TV shows as Parks and Recreation, New Girl, Portlandia and Search Party.

But the real rom-com fans will know her from the 1998 classic You've Got Mail, in which she played Joe Fox's (Tom Hanks) girlfriend Patricia Eden.

Patrick Schwarzenegger

While you may know him best from family photos as the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, he has already made a name for himself acting in Gen V, The Terminal List and The Staircase before playing Saxon Ratliff in season three. 

Sarah Catherine Hook

Prior to taking on the part of the Ratliffs' daughter Piper, Hook got her feet wet in the horror and fantasy genres, portraying Debbie Glatzel in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, Juliette Fairmont in First Kill and Elena Milak in Monsterland.

You may also know her from the 2024 Cruel Intentions remake as Caroline Merteuil or from the Ryan Murphy cinematic universe, in which she played Catherine Allday Davis in Impeachment: American Crime Story about the Bill Clinton–Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Sam Nivola

Nivola—who is dating Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann's daughter Iris Apatow—rounds out the Ratliff family as young Lochlan. But before hitting the shores of Thailand, he was in another show about a rich family at the beach: The Perfect Couple, playing Will Winbury, the son of Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber's Greer and Tag Winbury. He even costarred on the Netflix drama with White Lotus alum Meghann Fahy, who appeared as Daphne Sullivan on season two of the HBO show before playing Merritt Monaco on The Perfect Couple.

Nivola has also acted in White Noise with Adam Driver, Maestro with Bradley Cooper and With/In with Anne Hathaway. 

Natasha Rothwell

Of course, White Lotus fans will recognize Rothwell from season one, in which she played spa guru Belinda in Maui. Not only is she reprising the part for season three, but the actress has also graced the screen in Insecure, Wonka, A Year and Change and Love, Simon. Plus, she lent her comedy chops to Saturday Night Live as a writer from 2014 to 2015.

Leslie Bibb

The Iron Man alum is assembling to play Kate in The White Lotus after portraying Christine Everhart in the Marvel franchise. More recently, she starred in Palm Royale as Dinah Donahue and Jupiter's Legacy as Grace Kennedy-Sampson.

Carrie Coon

The Gilded Age star—who may also look familiar from The Sinner, Fargo and The Leftovers—steps into the role of Laurie, who joins pals Kate and Jaclyn for a girls' trip in Thailand this season.

Michelle Monaghan

While Monaghan plays TV star Jaclyn on The White Lotus, she's also a TV star IRL, having been on True Detective, Bad Monkey, Messiah and The Path. On the big screen, she's starred as Julia in Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Angie Genaro in Gone Baby Gone.

Walton Goggins

You'll feel justified in knowing that it's not all in your head—Goggins really does look familiar. In addition to starring in two Quentin Tarantino movies (playing Billy Crash in Django Unchained and Sheriff Chris Mannix in The Hateful Eight), he is also known for being Boyd Crowder in Justified from 2010 to 2015.

Aimee Lou Wood

The English actress joins the cast in season three as free-spirited Chelsea, who has an age-gap romance with Goggins' character Rick Hatchett. Yet, she is best known for her role as Aimee Gibbs on Netflix's Sex Education and also appeared in Seize Them! and Daddy Issues.

Lek Patravadi

Her acting credits may trace back 50 years—starting with Grounded God in 1975—but she most recently portrayed Prani Chiraanan on In Family We Trust in 2018.

Tayme Thapthimthong

The singer and former military man has acting credits that include Mechanic: Resurrection, Skin Trade and Paradox, as well as playing Pao on the TV series Farang.

Christian Friedel

If 13 minutes wasn't enough time to figure out where you recognize the German actor, allow us to refresh your memory. He played Rudolf Höss in The Zone of Interest, Reinhold Gräf in Babylon Berlin and Georg Elser in 13 Minutes.

BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Kangana Ranaut has entered the ongoing controversy surrounding comedian Kunal Kamra's parody video, where the comedian aimed at Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister, Eknath Shinde. Although Kamra did not explicitly name Shinde, he used the term ‘gaddar' (traitor) and included several subtle references to the Maharashtra politician, including mentions of Thane and a leader who “hides in Guwahati.”


Ranaut, known for her outspoken views, strongly condemned Kamra's actions, accusing him of “abusing Indian people and culture” for the sake of fleeting attention. She expressed her displeasure, stating that such parodies degrade the integrity of society. “We should think where society is heading when someone does this only for 2 minutes of fame,” Kangana said during a media interaction.

Drawing a parallel between Kamra's recent controversy and her legal struggles, Ranaut compared the BMC's action at The Habitat venue, where Kamra recorded the parody, to the demolition of her own property. While the BMC action was deemed legal, Ranaut called the demolition of her bungalow “illegal.” Her comments further focused on the broader issue of defaming individuals and their reputations.

In a particularly sharp critique, she questioned the credibility of individuals like Kamra, who engage in such parody acts. “You might be anyone, but insulting and defaming someone. A person for whom his/her respect is everything, and you insult and disregard them. Who are these people, and what are their credentials? If they can write, they should do so in literature,” she remarked.

Ranaut continued her criticism, adding, “Abusing people and our culture in the name of comedy... This has been done legally, but what had been done (demolishing of my bungalow) was illegally done.”



Kamra's parody video, which poked fun at Eknath Shinde, was a satirical take on the political turmoil following the Maharashtra elections, where Shiv Sena split from the BJP and internal shifts within the NCP created confusion. In the video, Kamra sang a parody of a popular song, mocking Shinde's political actions and labelling him a “dalbadlu” (turncoat). The lyrics of the parody included references to Thane, and a playful jab at Shinde's alleged hiding in Guwahati, a reference to his brief stay there during the political crisis.

The parody, which entertained the audience at the venue, also sparked a significant backlash from Shiv Sena workers. They stormed The Habitat, where the video was recorded, and vandalised the property. The enraged workers later filed a police complaint against Kamra. An FIR has been lodged against both the comedian and the Sena workers who were involved in the vandalism.

The ongoing divorce saga of cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal and choreographer Dhanashree Verma continues to stir up public attention, with new twists emerging almost daily. After their split, rumors and claims have been circulating regarding the reasons behind their separation. Some suggest that Chahal cheated on Dhanashree, while others accuse her of being a "gold digger." Despite numerous cryptic social media posts from both, neither has openly discussed the real reasons for their divorce.

A recent incident further fueled the fire when a video surfaced, criticising Dhanashree Verma. The video, shared by YouTuber Shubhankar Mishra, portrayed Dhanashree as a "gold digger." In the clip, Mishra claimed that Dhanashree faced difficulties starting her new life post-divorce and insinuated that she was benefiting financially from the split. He also mocked her, saying, “If you're getting money, that gives you empowerment. So, shouldn't you also say that you are a self-made woman?”

What caught the public's attention was the reaction of Ritika Sajdeh, the wife of cricketer Rohit Sharma. She liked the video, which many interpreted as a subtle endorsement of the criticism aimed at Dhanashree. The move sparked outrage among fans, with many speculating that Ritika was supporting Chahal in this messy situation and blaming Dhanashree for the divorce.

The viral clip and Ritika's "like" have set social media abuzz, with netizens discussing whether Ritika's action was intentional or simply a casual gesture. While some believe it indicates her support for Chahal, others are uncertain of her motives.

Yuzvendra Chahal and Dhanashree Verma's relationship had been a subject of public fascination ever since they tied the knot in 2020. However, within just three years, the couple announced their separation. The divorce was finalised on March 20, 2025, and they have reportedly been living apart for the past 18 months.

The divorce has drawn significant media attention, especially after Chahal's lawyer confirmed the split in a statement to ANI. While Chahal has been busy with his IPL commitments, Dhanashree has continued to be active on social media, releasing new music videos, which fans speculate may also be linked to her personal life.

As the controversy unfolds, both Chahal and Dhanashree seem to be keeping their personal reasons under wraps, letting the public and social media speculate on the real cause of their split. However, Ritika Sajdeh's recent actions have only added fuel to the fire, and it seems that the drama surrounding their divorce is far from over.

Bollywood's popular playback singer, Neha Kakkar, is once again making headlines, but this time not for her musical talent. The singer, known for her hit songs like "Badri Ki Dulhaniya," "Coca Cola," and "Sunny Sunny," has recently found herself at the center of controversy after a video of her emotional outburst at a live concert in Melbourne went viral.

Neha, who gained fame as a contestant on Indian Idol before becoming one of Bollywood's top singers, was performing at a concert in Melbourne, but arrived three hours late. In the viral video, the singer is seen breaking down in tears on stage, apologising to her fans for the delay. "You guys are so sweet! You've waited for so long. I hate making anyone wait. I'm so sorry!" Neha said through her tears, clearly overwhelmed. She continued, "This means a lot to me. I will always remember this evening. You guys have managed time for me, and I'll make sure to make you all dance tonight."

Despite her emotional apology, the video has sparked mixed reactions from the audience. Some fans defended her, appreciating her sincerity, while others were far less forgiving. The live crowd can be heard in the video expressing frustration with the situation. "This is not India, you're in Australia!" one person can be heard saying. Others sarcastically mocked her by commenting, "Go back! We've been waiting for three hours. Great acting!" and "This is not Indian Idol."



The singer, who has also been a judge on Indian Idol, has faced criticism for being inconsiderate toward her audience. Many social media users pointed out that as a professional, she should have ensured better timing and communication with her fans. Some even accused her of creating a "drama" for attention, while others expressed concern over why she was so late in the first place.

While Neha's fans are divided over the incident, many are curious to know the real reason behind her late arrival. Although she hasn't publicly addressed the delay, this incident has certainly overshadowed her musical achievements for the moment.

Neha Kakkar, who has long been a favorite in Bollywood music, is known for her catchy tracks and vibrant personality, but her recent Melbourne concert drama has ignited debate across social media. Whether it's an emotional outpouring or a PR mishap, only time will tell how this incident impacts her public image.

Production on the next James Bond film is reportedly underway.

Following Amazon's US$1 billion (S$1.34 billion) acquisition of the franchise, sources say the movie has been "fast-tracked" and is being dubbed Bond 26.

It was revealed last month Amazon MGM had taken full creative control of the 007 film franchise after the company struck a deal with its long-time producers Michael G Wilson, 82, and Barbara Broccoli, 63.

While the pair remain co-owners of the franchise, Amazon now has control over all future productions — a decision that has sparked concern among fans it will spawn a flood of content featuring 007.

According to The Sun, the next instalment in the film series is expected to have a budget of £250 million (S$432.5 million), in line with the cost of Daniel Craig's final outing as 007 in No Time to Die.

The newspaper reported the film is due to be released by the end of 2027, with a source stating: "The Bond bosses had already proposed broad plots and reboot ideas. The writers' rooms are being assembled in the hope of recouping their investment ASAP."

Bond films have traditionally been released in October or November.

The search for Daniel's replacement has intensified in recent weeks, with actors including Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 33, Harris Dickinson, 27, and James Norton, 38, rumoured to be in contention to fill his shoes as 007.

According to Puck, producers David Heyman, 62, known for his work on the Harry Potter films, and Amy Pascal, 65, who produced Tom Holland's Spider-Man films, are in talks to develop the project.

In March 2024, reports emerged Aaron Taylor-Johnson had secured the role, but the actor distanced himself from the claims, stating: "I don't feel like I need to have a future drawn out for me. I feel like, whatever's drawn out for me, I can f****** do better."

Amazon's acquisition of the Bond franchise is expected to lead to spin-off projects, though a source stated the company "knows fans want and expect a movie" and "wants filming to be done by the end of next year".

Sydney Sweeney is fueling rumors that she has broken up with longtime love Jonathan Davino.

The couple has been together since 2018 and they got engaged in 2022. Recent reports claimed that they had postponed their wedding due to busy schedules, but there are now rumors that Sydney, 27, and Jonathan, 41, might not be together anymore.

Eagle-eyed fans have noticed that Sydney has deleted a photo of her and Jonathan kissing, which she had included in an Instagram carousel that was posted right after New Year's Day 2025.

"the last few days of 2024 will forever be some of my favorite," Sydney captioned the slideshow of photos, that previously included the kissing photo. You can see that photo on People.com.

It was recently reported that Sydney was living at the Beverly Hills Hotel without Jonathan, though he has been seen at their shared home that is under construction.

President Donald Trump has slammed George Clooney as a "second-rate movie 'star'".

The US leader has blasted the actor and the TV show 60 Minutes following the 63-year-old's appearance on the programme over the weekend in a rant in which he also dismissed George as a "failed political pundit".

Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump fumed: "Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total 'puff piece' on George Clooney, a second-rate movie 'star', and failed political pundit.

"He fought hard for Sleepy Joe's election and then, right after the debate, dumped him like a dog. Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for Kamala, only to soon realise that that was not going to work out too well."

"60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before election day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history... And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!"

In his 60 Minutes interview to promote his Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck, George discussed the parallels between the turbulent media and political landscape in the play and in the US today.

He said: "When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed.

"ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration. And CBS News is in the process... We're seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations — to make journalists smaller.

"Governments don't like the freedom of the press. They never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you're on. They don't like the press."

He also addressed the op-ed piece he wrote for the New York Times last year calling on then-President Joe Biden to step down as the Democrat candidate in the 2024 election.

He said: "I'll make it kind of easy. I was raised to tell the truth.

"I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised. And so I feel as if there were a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that.

"And I was not proud of that. And I also believed I had to tell the truth."

When his essay was published, George was again blasted by Trump, who branded him a "fake movie actor" who "never came close to making a great movie".

He added: "What does Clooney know about anything?

"Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television. Movies never really worked for him!"

Drew Barrymore is experiencing a common dating woe.

The 50-year-old former actress revealed that she was recently "ghosted" by a potential suitor after a first dinner date.

"I texted him, and I was like, 'Lovely to see you again the other night.' We went back and forth twice, and then he ended with, 'Haaaaa.' And I haven't heard anything," she explained on a recent episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, per People.

"It just happens. I don't know why. I would never do that. It doesn't cross my mind to behave like that. Like, if you put a fishing pole in it, why are you not going to follow through? It does happen to all of us — the best of us. Good people who wouldn't treat other people like that," she lamented. 

The 50 First Dates star said not to take those situations too personally, while also reminding herself to be self-aware. "It could be a look in the mirror to yourself. It could be when you said something ridiculous, which I do all the time," she said. 

If you didn't see, back in February, Drew revealed her best on-screen kiss partner.

Grant Ellis has given out his final rose.

After being torn between his final two, Juliana and Litia, on the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor, the 31-year-old broke up with Litia, 31, and got engaged to Juliana, 28 — but not without a little drama.

“I love you very much. I want to give you everything you deserve, but I'm not your person,” Grant told Litia on proposal day. “I'm sorry that it got to this point. My emotional connection is farther somewhere else.”

“When did it change?” she replied.



“It didn't change. I do love you — I don't want you to feel like I haven't been open or honest,” he said. “I hope you don't look at me differently.”

“Well, I do, for sure,” Litia fired back, noting that Juliana is a “beautiful person” who should have “a lot of questions” about Grant based on how things played out.

As he walked Litia to her car, Grant asked if he'd been misleading. “The switch-up is crazy,” she replied. “I'm disappointed. … I just want to be so clear that I'm confused and I'm sad. And I'm mad.”

During the live portion of the show, Litia claimed that Grant said during their dates that he could “stop the show right now” because he was so sure Litia was his “No. 1 emotional connection.”

When Grant jointed her on stage, she revealed more details — hinting that Grant “said a lot” during overnights and revealing that he gave her a journal to write down her feelings during their time on the show for them to read at the end. He apologized for speaking with such confidence and speaking “too soon.” Litia shot back and said there was “no transparency” from Grant that he was conflicted.

Back in the Dominican Republic, Juliana arrived and told Grant that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.

“Through this whole journey, you've been someone who has inspired me,” Grant said. “I truly believe that you are somebody who is my best friend and I'm so grateful for our journey. … I'll be there for you as your man, as your friend, as your partner. Juliana, will you marry me?”

Juliana said “a million times yes” as she cried tears of joy.

Earlier in the episode, Grant said “I love you” to both women (he first told Litia during last week's episode) after they met his parents. He was subsequently torn over who to pick. “I went to bed last night thinking I knew what I wanted, but I woke up and realized I don't,” he told the cameras. “I feel alone and I have to make a decision. … I don't know.”

As he struggled, Grant's dad came to see him — and told him to go with his heart. “I'm just scared that when I leave here, things will be different,” Grant said, to which his dad reminded him that his fears were normal but not a reason to be scared to make a choice.

Grant's agony over his final pick has been teased all season, with host Jesse Palmer hinting that it got down to the wire. In his Us cover story last month, Grant shed light on what was going through his mind as he struggled with his decision.

“It definitely wasn't [down to] one hour,” he said of the show making it seem like he made his decision at the final moment. “There were external factors that played into me being hesitant. You don't wanna hurt people. You have a lot of weight in terms of being a lead of a different ethnic group. There's a different level of pressure that comes with being a man of color in this role — and a different expectation. It leads to some added thinking that deserves a little extra time. There were some things that really weighed and were hard for me.”

He added, “But ultimately, you go with what makes you happy and you go with what you feel is gonna be the best decision for your future.”

For Grant, he hopes his future includes two kids.

“Preferably a boy and a girl. But if I have two girls or two boys, it doesn't matter,” he said, adding that he's willing to relocate for his partner. “If things play out the way they should, I'll do whatever is gonna make us happy, whether that's me moving or us traveling or us getting another piece of property. I'm willing to go that distance.”

While he's caught some heat on social media for falling in love with both women, Grant is confident he handled things the best way he could.

“I don't live with regret. I'm very happy, and I wouldn't have it any other way,” he said at the time. “If I could rewind time, I would make the same decision.”

The Bachelor finale continues with After the Final Rose on ABC.

Despite years of experience coaching on The Voice, Adam Levine wasn't prepared for this talented battle round.

During the Monday, March 24, episode of NBC's singing competition series, viewers watched Conor James and Tinika Wyatt get paired up to perform a unique rendition of “How Deep Is Your Love” by The Bee Gees.

“Tinika is sneaky amazing. She's so good,” Adam, 46, shared in a confessional interview before his two contestants took to the stage. “Conor's sheer ability — the range, the tone, there's a million things I could say — I wish I could keep everybody, but unfortunately I can't. I think this will be a tough one.”

The Maroon 5 frontman was quickly reminded that coaching contestants on The Voice isn't for the weak.



After Conor and Tinika sang their hearts out, fellow coach Kelsea Ballerini called it her “favorite battle” of the season. Michael Bublé said he couldn't choose a winner because he loved them both so much.

And while John Legend gave a slight edge to Conor, he admitted, “It's going to be hard to say” a favorite.

When host Carson Daly made the announcement that it was time for Adam to pick his winner, the “Moves Like Jagger” singer expressed just how difficult the decision was.

“Both of you guys, it's just energy I want to be around,” he said. “Having to make this choice sucks particularly badly because I don't want to be without either one of you guys.”

“Tinika came in here and made my life hell because it would be a loss not to have you,” he continued. “It would be a horrible spot. From the bottom of my heart, you guys are both incredible.”

After careful thought and consideration, Adam picked Conor as the winner of the battle and reiterated his belief that the contestant could win the whole show.

“I had to pick Conor just because Conor has a unicorn quality to him,” Adam explained in a confessional. “The dude can sing anything and make it feel like it means something special.”

In an unexpected twist, Kelsea, 31, chose to steal Tinika in the final moments of the episode. As a result, Adam's former contestant was not eliminated from the competition after all.

“With my steal, I just wanted to feel something,” the country singer said. “Hearing her voice, I just knew. Tinika adds a level of soul to Team Kelsea that I'm very excited about.”

The Voice airs on NBC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Stream old episodes anytime on Peacock.

Jennifer Coolidge opened up about how she was stuck in a typecasting rut before The White Lotus and her new film Riff Raff.

“When I did Best in Show for the longest time, I was just offered these sort of trophy wife parts over and over,” the actress exclusively told Us Weekly. “There would be scripts at my front doorstep. And I'd pick 'em up and I'd be like, ‘Ah, I know exactly what these are gonna be.'”

Coolidge's intuition was right on the money as most of the offers coming her way had a similar theme.

“And sure enough, a lot of 'em were just sort of the same woman and a rich guy, spoiled wife being offered continually as if that was all I could do,” she confessed.



As Coolidge hoped to find variety in her projects, she found game-changing success with The White Lotus. Coolidge played Tanya McQuoid on Mike White's critically acclaimed HBO anthology series, the only character to return for both seasons 1 and 2 of the show, and a role that earned her multiple Emmys.

Coolidge then got the offer for Riff Raff, the crime comedy drama which also stars Ed Harris, Pete Davidson, Gabrielle Union, Lewis Pullman, Bill Murray and more. Coolidge portrays Harris' “self destructive” ex-wife, Ruth.

“I was so thrilled because I wouldn't have ever guessed, you know, especially with the way my career's been going,” she admitted. “I could be asked to be in Legally Blonde and in a movie like that. And then, you know, I would eventually be able to down the line be in something where it was so not Legally Blonde.”

The film follows Harris's character Vincent, a former criminal, as his idyllic life is turned upside down when his son (played by Pullman) and ex show up for a messy family reunion turned reckoning that forces him to face his past.

“Ruth was a part that I've never been offered before, someone like that, that was just really rough around the edges,” Coolidge said of the role. “I thoroughly enjoyed myself. [It was] really great getting to do just something different.”

The thriller (with hints of comedy) isn't a film Coolidge would have “normally” gotten the chance to do, she said, which made taking on the part even more attractive to the beloved star.

“I think it was the thriller side. I get cast in a lot of comedies. I really don't get offered roles like this,” she told Us. “White Lotus is comedic and dramatic at the same time, too. But I think this movie is even darker than White Lotus.”

In addition to showing off her acting range, Coolidge gushed about working with such a stellar cast.

“It was all quite intimidating, to be honest,” she said. “I've been very lucky and I've gotten to work with some really cool people. But I have to say I really did keep pinching myself when I was there filming. It never occurred to me that I would be able to work with these guys . I couldn't believe that I was able to work with these people that I've admired.”

Riff Raff is available to rent and purchase on demand now.

When it comes to playing a love interest for someone from the Wayans family, Essence Atkins is determined to catch them all.

“I just need to be Kim [Wayans'] love interest, and then I'll have the trifecta,” Atkins, 53, joked during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly. “I have been the love interest of all of them. So at this point, I feel kind of like an honorary member of the family.”

Atkins poked fun at how it also “feels a bit incestuous,” adding, “But not really. I love them so much and I love working with them. It's always such a pleasant, professional and fun experience. I would love to dispense it as medicine. Are you going through something difficult? Work with the Wayans — you'll feel better. It'll bring some healing to your soul.”



The actress currently stars on CBS' Poppa's House with Damon Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr., but it's a family affair behind the scenes with Kim Wayans and Damien Dante Wayans directing several episodes, Shawn Wayans and Michael Wayans being credited as writers and Marlon Wayans appearing in the Monday, March 24, episode as Damon Sr.'s onscreen brother.

Before Poppa's House, Atkins played Marlon's ex-wife on his short-lived sitcom and Shawn's girlfriend in Dance Flick.

“The truth of the matter is that it's always going to be an immediate yes when I hear ‘Wayans.' This is my sixth project with that family. I have met all of them at this point and worked with the majority of them,” she shared with Us. “I really wanted to work with Damon Wayans Jr. again [after Dance Flick] and I had always wanted to work with Damon Wayans, so that's really all I needed to know. It was an immediate yes.”

Poppa's House, which premiered in October 2024, follows legendary talk radio host Poppa (Damon Sr.), who has his point of view challenged at work when a new female cohost (Atkins) is hired. At home, Poppa finds himself still parenting his adult son (Damon Jr.), who is trying to pursue his passion while balancing the responsibilities associated with being a father and husband.

Atkins's Ivy has been introduced as a potential love interest for Damon Sr.'s Poppa — but she's not in a rush to see them get together.

“Initially when we were beginning the series, we thought it would happen sooner. But I think that there's something really beautiful about them becoming friends first and that they really grow in respect for one another and admiration for one another,” Atkins explained. “Also in being able to see behind the curtain of one another, they have a little bit more trepidation and a little bit more caution about leaping forward.”

Atkins noted that both Ivy and Poppa are starting to develop an “awareness” of their connection, adding, “He's gaining an awareness of like, ‘Well, what do I get? It looks good, but what does the inspection report say when you buy a home?' That's wisdom, and I think that that leads to a much more satisfying take when it actually happens. It won't feel so jumped or rushed.”

She continued: “These characters have earned this closeness. We've seen them grow on each other. We've seen them get on each other's nerves. I like the pace that we're continuing at. As far as how long it will take, I don't know. I definitely think that there'll be moments this season where you'll be rooting for it to happen.”

Poppa's House airs on CBS Mondays at 8:30 p.m. ET. New episodes stream the next day on Paramount+.
