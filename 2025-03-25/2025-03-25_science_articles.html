                <p>Bright auroras could be visible tonight in the Northern U.S. as Earth passes through a corridor of charged particles leaking out of a "coronal hole" in the sun’s atmosphere.

The Northern Lights could be visible as far south as New York and Idaho tonight due to a "coronal hole" sending streams of charged particles toward Earth.

A G2 geomagnetic storm watch was issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for Tuesday, March 25. 

G2 storms are considered "moderate" in strength and could cause minor technological disruptions such as radio blackouts, GPS malfunctions, and an increased chance of spotting auroras at lower latitudes than usual.

"Watches of this level are not uncommon," according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center; G2-strength geomagnetic storms hit Earth about 360 days in each 11-year solar cycle. 

These storms can affect spacecraft orbits and cause weak power grid fluctuations at high latitudes, but they mostly cause "manageable effects to some technological infrastructure," according to NOAA.

The Space Weather Prediction Center issued today's storm watch because a "coronal hole" on the sun is facing Earth. Coronal holes are cooler, darker regions of the sun's outermost atmosphere (the corona) that are less dense than normal, allowing high-speed solar winds — streams of charged particles — to escape from the sun and gush outward into space.

Today, one of these escaped high-speed streams will be pointed directly at Earth.

Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, but some charged particles make it through into the upper layers of the atmosphere. When the solar wind hits Earth's atmosphere, charged particles shoot toward Earth's poles, agitating atmospheric molecules along the way and forcing them to emit energy in the form of colorful auroras.

In October 2024, the sun reached its solar maximum period, the most active part of its 11-year cycle. During this period, the sun's magnetic poles flip, and space weather events like geomagnetic storms and solar flares occur more frequently.

On Tuesday, "the aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho," according to a statement from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.</p></b>

                <p>A giant luminous swirl was seen clearly across large parts of England, captured from Billingborough, Lincolnshire.

On Monday (March 24), a giant swirl of light was spotted floating across the night sky in Europe like an ethereal whirlpool. The baffling light show wasn't caused by aliens, as some speculated, but a dying SpaceX rocket preparing to crash back to Earth, shortly after deploying secret cargo into orbit around our planet.

At around 8 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET), people across the U.K. reported seeing the luminous swirl grow as it slowly streaked across the sky like something from a sci-fi movie, according to the BBC .

The light show was most clearly visible above parts of England, including Lincolnshire , Yorkshire, Leicestershire , Suffolk and Essex , as well as in Wales and further afield in Sweden, Croatia, Poland, and Hungary . 

Photographer Simon Minnican captured the ethereal scene in a stunning video that showed a bright spot appear and then grow in size before swelling into an ever-expanding vortex. The entire spectacle lasted around 12 minutes, with the spiral of light dissipating roughly 4 minutes after it unfurled.

There was initially some wild speculation about what had caused the unusual light show, with at least one observer blaming UFOs. However, experts quickly pointed out that it was a "SpaceX spiral" — an increasingly common phenomenon triggered by light reflecting off rocket fuel dumped into space by spinning SpaceX rockets before they reenter Earth's atmosphere.

In this case, the spacecraft responsible for the luminous swirl was a Falcon 9 rocket that had launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1:48 p.m. ET, more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) from where the bright spiral was later spotted. This rocket was carrying a secret payload for the National Reconnaissance Office.

SpaceX spirals are caused by Falcon 9 rocket stages dumping their remaining fuel in space before reentry. The second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket de-orbits and prepares to reenter Earth's atmosphere, where it either burns up or falls into the ocean. During this maneuver, the spacecraft dumps its remaining fuel into space, which then freezes into a cloud of tiny crystals that reflect sunlight to Earth.

The second stage is normally spinning when the fuel is released, which is what causes the spiral shape of the resulting cloud — and explains why the vortex continually expands before dissipating. These spirals were once rare but are becoming more common as the number of Falcon 9 rocket launches increases .</p></b>

                <p>A series of advances by the Sudanese military has led some observers to posit that the African nation’s yearslong civil war could be at a crucial turning point.

Even if it were to end tomorrow, the bloody conflict would have left the Sudanese people scarred by violence that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions of people. But the recent victories by the military do not spell the end of its adversary, a rebel paramilitary group that still holds large areas in Sudan.

The Conversation turned to Christopher Tounsel, a historian of modern Sudan at the University of Washington, to explain what the war has cost and where it could turn now.

On April 15, 2023, fighting broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF – led by de facto head of state Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, led by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known colloquially as “Hemedti.” The RSF emerged out of the feared Janjaweed militia that had terrorized the Darfur region of Sudan.

While the SAF and RSF previously worked together to forcibly remove longtime President Omar al-Bashir from power in 2019, they later split amid a power struggle that turned deadly.

The major point of contention was the disputed timeline for RSF integration into the national military, with the RSF preferring a 10-year process to the SAF’s preferred two-year plan.

By early April 2023, the government deployed SAF troops along the streets of the capital, Khartoum, while RSF forces took up locations throughout the country. Matters came to a head when explosions and gunfire rocked Khartoum on April 15 of that year. The two forces have been in conflict ever since.

The major point of contention was the disputed timeline for RSF integration into the national military, with the RSF preferring a 10-year process to the SAF’s preferred two-year plan. 

The human toll of the civil war has been staggering. As of February 2025, estimates of those killed from the conflict and its related causes, including lack of sufficient medical facilities and hunger, have ranged from 20,000 to 150,000 – a wide gulf that, according to Humanitarian Research Lab executive director Nathaniel Raymond, is partially due to the fact that "we don’t have a complete count of all those who died."

The conflict has also displaced millions of people. The World Food Programme estimates that 7 million people in Sudan are at risk of hunger, with 2 million internally displaced.

The RSF has been accused of committing human rights abuses and war crimes, including killing civilians, detaining opposition politicians and activists, and burning villages to the ground.</p></b>

                <p>The longest molecules ever found on Mars have been unearthed by NASA's Curiosity rover, and they could mean the planet is strewn with evidence for ancient life.

Molecule chains containing up to twelve carbon atoms linked together were detected in a 3.7 billion-year-old rock sample collected from a dried-up Martian lakebed named Yellowknife Bay.

These long carbon chains are thought to have originated from molecules called fatty acids, which, on Earth, are produced by biological activity.

The fact that fragile linear molecules are still present at Mars' surface 3.7 billion years after their formation allows us to make a new statement: If life ever appeared on Mars billions of years ago, at the time life appeared on the Earth, chemical traces of this ancient life could still be present today for us to detect.

The molecules were detected by Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument. No stone unturned

The Curiosity Rover arrived on Mars in 2012 at the Gale Crater, a massive impact crater formed by the planet's collision with an ancient meteorite.

In the years since, the rover has traveled about 20 miles across the crater, investigating places including Yellowknife Bay and Mount Sharp.

Nicknamed "Cumberland", the sample analyzed for the new study was drilled by Curiosity in 2013 from Yellowknife Bay.

The hydrocarbon strings were actually discovered by accident as part of an attempt to find the building blocks of proteins — known as amino acids — in the sample.

To test this theory, the researchers mixed undecanoic acid into a Mars-like clay in the lab before performing a test similar to that carried out by the SAM instrument.

On Earth, molecules like these are overwhelmingly produced by biological processes, but they can also occur naturally without life.

However, non-biological processes usually only result in fatty acids with fewer than 12 carbon atoms.

There is evidence that liquid water existed in Gale Crater for millions of years and probably much longer, which means there was enough time for life-forming chemistry to happen in these crater-lake environments on Mars.</p></b>

                <p>In the age of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the phrase “I’ll believe it when I see it” no longer stands. Not only is GenAI able to generate manipulated representations of people, but it can also be used to generate entirely fictitious people and scenarios.

My research team conducted a survey where nearly 300 participants were asked to classify a set of images as real or fake. The average classification accuracy of participants was 61 per cent in 2022.

Researchers began exploring the use of GANs for image and video synthesis in 2014. The seminal paper “Generative Adversarial Nets” introduced the adversarial process of GANs.

Some early examples of GenAI art which used GANs include the “DeepDream” images created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev in 2015.

In 2017, the term “deepfake” was officially born after a Reddit user, whose username was “deepfakes,” used GANs to generate synthetic celebrity pornography.

The release of the deepfake detection challenge, which sought new and improved deepfake detection models, garnered widespread attention in 2019. 

About a decade later, one of the authors of the “Generative Adversarial Nets” paper — Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio — began sharing his concerns about the need to regulate AI due to the potential dangers such technology could pose to humanity.

Big tech companies have indeed been encouraging the development of algorithms that can detect deepfakes. These algorithms commonly look for the following signs to determine if content is a deepfake:

Facial expressions, based on known co-ordinates of the human eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, teeth and facial contours,

Reflections in the eyes, which tends to be unconvincing (either missing or oversimplified),

Image saturation, with AI-generated images being less saturated and containing a lower number of underexposed pixels compared to pictures taken by an HDR camera.

Despite flimsy and inadequate attempts at regulation, rogue players continue to use deepfakes and text-to-image AI synthesis for nefarious purposes.</p></b>

                <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has snapped a spectacular image of a "cosmic tornado" being burped out from a baby star.

Herbig-Haro 49/50 is an outflow of hot gas from a newborn star situated about 625 light-years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon. The image reveals a plume of gas, named Herbig-Haro 49/50 (HH 49/50), which is a composite of images captured by two of JWST's instruments.

Herbig-Haro objects are bright, nebula-like objects formed when jets of ionized gas ejected by newborn stars collide with surrounding interstellar material at hundreds of miles per second. They can evolve quickly on astronomical timescales, often changing in a matter of years or decades.

They are usually found in star-forming regions and were first observed in the late 19th century, but were formally identified as a distinct class of objects by astronomers George Herbig and Guillermo Haro in the 1940s. Astronomers have discovered over 1,000 Herbig-Haro objects across various star-forming regions.

Herbig-Haro 49/50 was first discovered by NASA's now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope in 2006, and nicknamed the "cosmic tornado" for its funnel-like appearance. It is located in the Chamaeleon I Cloud complex, which is one of the nearest star-forming regions to Earth.

The JWST image shows HH 49/50 as a cluster of arc-shaped shock waves, showing the movement of gas through space away from the protostar. Past observations show that the outflow is moving away from us at speeds of 60-190 miles per second and is just one feature of a larger outflow.

Astronomers think that the protostar responsible for the gas outflow causing HH 49/50 is a newborn star named Cederblad 110 IRS4, located about 1.5 light-years away from HH 49/50. This protostar is a Class I protostar, which means it is a relatively young star in stellar terms.

The JWST image also reveals that a fuzzy object at the top of the pillar of gas originally seen in images taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope is actually a distant spiral galaxy in the background. Over time, the distant galaxy will be obscured by the roiling gas of HH 49/50.</p></b>

                <p>A bright new star could emerge in the night sky later this week if a distant star system erupts as expected, data suggests.

T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova that repeatedly explodes, creating frequent and somewhat predictable pulses of light that linger in our skies for up to a week. These flashes come from a binary star system made up of a hefty red giant circling a super-dense white dwarf that's around the same size as Earth.

TCrB, also known as the "Blaze Star," last appeared in our skies in 1946 but has been recorded at multiple points throughout history, potentially dating back as far as 1217. By looking at the past outbursts, scientists have determined that the nova explodes roughly every 80 years, meaning it is due to appear anytime now.

Hopes of the nova's imminent appearance were first raised in late 2023, when the T CrB system dimmed, just like it did before the 1946 appearance. However, we have already had multiple false alarms predicting exactly when it will appear.

The Blaze Star nova is triggered when too much stolen hydrogen accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf in the T CrB system.

Another study published last year proposed a different set of likely dates for the celestial spectacle after analyzing the finer details of its previous iterations. The first potential window for the Blaze Star's appearance is marked as beginning on Thursday (March 27), the study's author Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in France, wrote in the paper.

The T CrB system has already exploded again, and we are just waiting for the light of the next blast to reach us as it travels 3,000 light-years across the space between it and us.

When will the nova appear? The Blaze Star is hard to pin down because the amount of time between each of its recorded appearances can either increase or decrease by around 1.4 years on average, and there is no pattern suggesting which way it will swing.

However, in the newest study, Schneider reanalyzed the time differences between eruptions and found that each gap is almost perfectly divisible by the orbital period between the red giant and white dwarf stars, which circle one another every 228 days. Following this rule, the next nova should appear around March 27.

But if it does not show, the next dates for its potential arrival are 228 days later, on Nov. 10, followed by June 25, 2026 and Feb. 8, 2027.

However, Schneider postulates that if there were a hidden third star in the T CrB system, then there would be a specific point in each orbit where a third star is also closest to the white dwarf. At this point, there could be an extra helping of material being dumped on the super-dense star, which may be what triggers the explosion.

How to see the Blaze Star Predicting exactly when the nova will reappear is tricky. But what researchers do know for certain is where the Blaze Star will appear once the light from T CrB finally reaches us, because its position in our sky is fixed.

The temporary star will shine in the Corona Borealis constellation, which translates to "the Northern Crown" in Latin. This constellation is not very large, but it can be easily found using websites such as TheSkyLive.com</p></b>

                <p>The New Zealand government has announced plans to purchase a standardised tool to assess reading, writing, and mathematics for school children between Year 3 and 10.

This move has caught parents, schools, and education groups by surprise, as it resembles the National Standards policy introduced in 2008 under John Key's National government.

Under this policy, children were compared against the level of achievement expected for their age and time at school, with the goal of improving results across the education system.

The policy was ended by Labour in 2017 due to little improvement in international testing results and criticism from the sector.


There is research highlighting the negative consequences of standardised testing in education, including a narrowing curriculum, pressure on teachers to focus on assessed subjects, and "teaching to the test".

Teachers may be inclined to employ rote learning strategies, where children memorise correct answers rather than developing deeper understanding.

Standardised tests can also be detrimental to children's attitudes towards learning and their belief that they could learn.


The introduction of a standardised test is happening without consultation with the education sector, and it contradicts previous public statements on testing made by Education Minister Erica Stanford in 2024.

Stanford had announced plans to allow schools to choose between two tools to assess students, with the goal of preventing comparison across schools.

However, documents later released revealed that the government already had a plan to rely on a single standardised assessment tool.


The Ministry of Education claims the new tool will deliver a long-term solution to support all schools and kura, but there are reasons to be sceptical about its potential impact.</p></b>

                <p>Psychopathy has long been associated with murderers, notorious criminals, and the griping true crime stories that dominate Netflix documentaries. But our recent research is showing they have a complex relationship with pain which may in part be responsible for their lack of empathy.

Typically, people who are higher on the psychopathic traits spectrum show greater pain tolerance. And this is usually reflected in their physiology. For instance, in a 2022 study people higher in psychopathic traits showed lower brain activity with pressure pain.

Participants with high levels of psychopathy seemed to process pain differently to people low in psychopathy. We applied pressure pain to our participants using a device that gently pressed a small circular probe onto the participant’s fingernail using compressed air. We measured their reactions from their sweat responses.

This is called skin conductance response (SCR), and is activated in times of “fight or flight”, or even when we need to pay attention. And this normally increases sweat production. That’s what we used to measure participants’ response to pain and empathy in our experiment.

Before our experiment began, we slowly increased the levels of pressure that participants felt until they told us they had reached their pain threshold (the most pain they could bear). The low and high psychopathy groups chose similar levels of pressure for their pain threshold. Next, we delivered varying levels of pressure to ensure participants did not become used to the stimulations.

Following each stimulation, participants were asked to rate how much pain they felt using a self-report measure ranging from 0-100. We found that participants higher in psychopathy reported feeling less pain than participants who were lower in psychopathy. The high psychopathy group even rated their own pain thresholds as less painful than the low psychopathy group.

The results of our study suggest that the difference in pain perception between high and low psychopathic people may be psychological rather than physiological. This could explain why there were differences in self-reports, but not in sweat responses. We don’t know whether they are pretending to feel pain or are less connected to their body’s physiology.

But a 2019 study on children suggests those high in psychopathic traits may engage in extreme coping when scared. For instance, those children showed blunted emotional responses, disengagement or risky behaviour to cope with the stress.

We also tested our participants’ responses to other people’s pain by showing them images, such as a hand trapped in a door or a bare foot stepping on glass. Previous research has shown that people higher in psychopathy show reduced levels of physiological arousal to other people’s distress.

For example, a 2015 study found people higher in psychopathy demonstrated lower levels of brain activity when seeing other people in painful situations. In our study, we found that people higher in psychopathy not only reported feeling less empathy but also showed lower sweat responses when viewing other people’s pain.

This lower SCR has also been found in male prisoners with psychopathic traits. And it typically indicates less attention or focus on other people’s pain.

Our study shows that a lack of empathy for others may not be a conscious choice. Our recent systematic review, where we looked at eight previous studies on psychopathy and pain perception, also helped to corroborate these findings.

Research has shown that lower levels of empathy for other people can be influenced by a higher tolerance for pain. If someone does not understand the feelings of pain the same way as other people, they probably don’t understand the pain that other people may be experiencing.

Also, a 2020 review showed that the brain networks used in processing pain are also used to process empathy. This could mean that if people higher in psychopathy don’t feel as much pain themselves, their perceptions of other people’s pain could also be reduced via this shared network.

Recent research has noted psychopathic traits can be positive and help people regulate their emotions. Surgeons and other medical professionals show high levels of psychopathic traits, particularly the stress immunity part of the personality trait.

This is what allows medical professionals high in psychopathic traits to stay calm under pressure, allowing them to make quick, rational decisions without being overwhelmed by stress.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>The inaugural season of the TGL golf league closes this week with a final championship-deciding series.

The upstart, team-based, men’s league has made headlines for its celebrity backers, including star golfers Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.

Even more noteworthy is TGL’s unique format. Events are played inside SoFi Center, a custom-built venue in Florida with an audience capacity of 1,500.

At one end lies the “ScreenZone,” where a golf simulator is used for longer shots such as drives and iron play. At the other end, players chip and putt along the physical surface of the “GreenZone” to record a final score on each hole.

TGL is the latest commercial venture to shake up the golf world in recent years.

The league is no doubt novel in some ways, yet it can also be explained as the convergence of two longstanding trends: the “mediatization” and “indoorization” of sport.

Mediatization is a concept that speaks to relationships of interdependence between media and other institutions, such as sport. More than simply conveying sport content, communication technologies have helped change sport over the years — consider “television timeouts” or the use of instant replay.

In return, sport is a source of live, unpredictable and exciting media content, something that is highly valuable in a competitive attention economy.

TGL stands out as an especially tech-infused venture. First, there is the golf simulator. The ScreenZone is so named because players hit into a massive screen measuring 64 by 53 feet. Tracking technology is used to map and represent the flight of the ball on screen. This allows for a thoroughly datafied sport experience as an array of performance metrics are available to both players and fans.

Also relevant are TGL’s seemingly made-for-TV conventions, some of which might be anathema to golf traditionalists. Among them, a 40-second shot clock keeps a brisk pace of play. Players are also mic’d up, making strategy conversations and reactions accessible to the audience.

In all, TGL is a media spectacle. It is not uncommon for sports leagues to adopt new rules and formats, seemingly in a bid to capture consumer attention. But, through TGL’s video game-like components, media representation — golf on a simulated volcano, among other places — becomes part of the sport competition itself.

Sport moves indoors. Outdoor sports from surfing to skiing, rock climbing and many more have moved indoors in recent years (while remaining outdoor sports too).

A potential trade-off is that, while outdoor sports often foreground adventure, uncertainty and danger, their indoor analogues often trade this for control, predictability and calculability. The authenticity of indoor sport might therefore be debated, especially in historically counter-cultural sports such as surfing.

Yet indoorization can also lead to expansion. From the late 1800s onwards, artificial ice in North American arenas allowed for reliable skating conditions and helped hockey move to new locations, growing the game as a commercial endeavour and cultural institution.

There was also the benefit of escaping the elements. As architectural historian Howard Shubert writes: “Covered rinks allowed patrons to escape winter’s cold temperatures, harsh winds, and blowing snow and eliminated the immediate danger of falling through thin ice on ponds and streams.”

Indoorization is not new, even for golf: golf simulators can be found in converted garages; Topgolf facilities offer high-tech, all-weather golf experiences. But TGL is a high-profile entrant in a history of moving sport indoors.

Researchers assessing the prospects for outdoor skating against recent climate projections have concluded the future looks bleak for outdoor rinks, and that indoor arenas and synthetic surfaces will grow more important in the years ahead.

Likewise, sport mega-events have implemented various climate adaptation measures over time, from snow-making on ski slopes to refrigeration of sliding tracks and far beyond. The future is likely to see host cities become climate unreliable to an even greater extent.

It’s not just winter sports. From air-conditioned stadiums to relocated events in search of cooler conditions to indoor recess for students escaping poor-quality outdoor air, the changing climate is a point of vulnerability year-round — and for sport and physical activity participation at various levels.

Our point here is not that TGL was conceived with the climate crisis in mind. Nor do we expect outdoor golf to disappear. Rather, the climate crisis will demand adaptation in sport in the years ahead.

In a time of technological innovation — augmented and virtual reality experiences are being used in sports — it can be seen as foreshadowing “solutions” to much greater problems that are beginning to seem inevitable.</p></b>

                <p>In his second inauguration address, United States President Trump began by declaring “the golden age of America begins right now” and closed with, “and our golden age has just begun.” Between these lines, he vowed to “tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.”

Tying his trade policies to dubious claims about fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration, Trump’s approach appears less about economic strategy and more about asserting dominance. Invoking the language of imperial expansion, he even proposed the idea of making Canada the “cherished 51st state.”

Historians like Richard White, emeritus professor at Stanford University, quickly drew parallels to the 19th-century Gilded Age when robber barons thrived, leaving social inequality in their wake.

The celebrated Canada-U.S. friendship — further entrenched over the past three decades by the 1989 Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement, cross-border activity and snowbirds wintering in Florida and elsewhere in the U.S. — has long balanced underlying tension stemming from the two nations’ power differences.

This alludes to tensions inherent in friendships that have long been explored by philosophers.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole Burston

A ‘great relationship?’

Trump’s recent sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports are only the latest chapter in a long history of economic clashes. From the U.S.’s Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which hit Canada hard during the Great Depression, to Richard Nixon’s 10 per cent import surcharge in 1971 and the long fight over softwood lumber that persisted through the early 2000s despite Canada’s favourable World Trade Organization rulings, these conflicts expose the fragility of Canada-U.S. relations.

The uneasy reality is that friendship between nations is never as stable as it seems.

The trade war has triggered a wave of cultural and economic nationalism in Canada that has gone beyond the “Buy Canadian” movement. At the National Ballet of Canada’s Swan Lake, recently, a stirring rendition of O Canada brought the audience to its feet.

Chrystia Freeland, now minister of transport and internal trade, spoke about the relationship between the two countries.

Derrida’s model applies to the Canada-U.S. relationship, which has long been framed as one of mutual respect, built on democratic values and shared economic interests. But its underlying structure is transactional.

The rhetoric of friendship has always served a function: to justify co-operation when it is useful and to smooth over conflict when it is not. The moment those interests diverge, the limits of the relationship become clear.

Trump’s tariffs have exposed this dynamic in the clearest possible terms. Canada’s position as a friend to the U.S. is fragile and contingent, shaped by the fluctuating interests of the more powerful side.

But the rupture is not new, nor is it a break from the norm. It’s simply a reminder of how the relationship has always worked. The question now is not whether Canada can restore its friendship, but whether it can afford to continue believing in it on the same terms.


Derrida’s model of friendship offers a way forward. His model defies the simplistic binary of friend and foe, loyalty and betrayal, as these terms are ultimately mutually constitutive.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>A new species of dinosaur with strange claws has been unearthed in Mongolia by paleontologists.
This new genus and species is a therizinosaur, plant-eating, two-legged giants with long claws.

Unlike other therizinosaurs, which have three fingers on their hands equipped with long, sharp claws, this new species only has two fingers.
This unique anatomy inspired its scientific name, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, which is Greek for "two digits" and honors the Mongolian paleontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar .

Therizinosaurs are a group of dinosaurs that lived across what is now Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (100 million to 66 million years ago).
Despite being part of the theropod group of dinosaurs — typically associated with carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex — therizinosaurs were herbivorous.

All other therizinosaurs that have previously been discovered, including Therizinosaurus and Beipiaosaurus, have three clawed fingers on their hands, making the discovery of two-clawed D. tsogtbaatari unusual.
Therizinosaurs are already some of the most unusual dinosaurs out there, but Duonychus tsogtbaatari takes it to another level.

This newly discovered species from Mongolia breaks the mold with just two fingers instead of the typical three, offering a rare glimpse into how theropod hands evolved and adapted.
The new fossil was unearthed during the construction of a water pipeline in the Bayanshiree Formation in Ömnögovi Province, southern Mongolia.

The specimen had excellently preserved hands, with a 3D sheath where the claw — made out of keratin, like our fingernails — would have been.
Even the keratinous sheath of the claw is preserved revealing how big and sharp its claws really were.

Other species of dinosaur, such as T. rex, had two fingers, but this marks the first time a therizinosaur has been found with fewer than three digits.
This species likely evolved to lose one of the three fingers of its ancestors, the study authors suggested.

The loss of the third finger in Duonychus tsogtbaatari might actually have made its remaining two fingers even better at what they were designed for — grasping.
Based on the shape of its well-preserved claw and how it curved, Duonychus was likely using its hands to grab onto branches and pull vegetation closer.

The researchers think that D. tsogtbaatari may have evolved this unique hand in order to better grip vegetation, allowing for more efficient feeding.
The claws may have played other roles, such as in "defense, courtship, or even play."

While more fossils would help confirm this, all signs point to Duonychus representing a true evolutionary shift, not just a fluke.
It’s a remarkable find that reshapes our understanding of therizinosaurs and theropod evolution as a whole.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Nearly a billion light-years away, a massive spiral galaxy is screaming into the void.

The behemoth, nicknamed J2345-0449, is a giant radio galaxy, or "super spiral" galaxy roughly three times the size of the Milky Way . Like our own spiral galaxy, it harbors a supermassive black hole at its center. But unlike the Milky Way's center, J2345-0449's supermassive black hole emits powerful radio jets — streams of fast-moving charged particles that emit radio waves — stretching more than 5 million light-years long.

Though scientists don't yet know what fuels the radio jets, a new study hints at how giant spiral galaxies could form.

Such strong radio jets are "very rare for spiral galaxies," Patrick Ogle , an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said. Data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array suggest that the radio jets currently prevent stars from forming near the galaxy's center.

The giant radio jets stretching more than 5 million light-years across and a supermassive black hole at the center of spiral galaxy J23453268−0449256, as imaged by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.

Jets in our neighborhood?

Sagittarius A* , the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, is likely too small to produce radio jets as powerful as the ones observed in J2345-0449.

Based on the shape of the group of stars at the center of the galaxy, it's possible that this black hole and its massive host galaxy have grown together in relative isolation.

In the future, detailed studies of the galaxy's supermassive black hole could also explain what powers its massive radio jets.</p></b>

                <p>For nearly 15 years almost no information was available on the population status of Uganda’s large carnivores, including those in its largest national park, Murchison Falls.

These species represent a critical part of Uganda’s growing tourism economy.

The country is home to the famed tree-climbing lions, which are much sought after for this unique behaviour.

Together, lions and leopards generate tens of thousands of dollars annually from safari viewing and allied activities.

When wildlife isn’t monitored rigorously, populations can disappear within just a few years, as tigers did in India’s Sariska tiger reserve.

Our two recent studies in Murchison Falls and six protected areas across the country sought to address the problem by drawing on a wide range of local and international experts who live and work in Uganda.

Working with the Ugandan government’s Uganda Wildlife Authority research and monitoring team, we set out to identify and bring together independent scientists, government rangers, university students, lodge owners and conservation managers in the country’s major savanna parks.

We hoped to cover more ground with people and organisations that wouldn’t traditionally work together.

Doing so exposed many of these individuals for the first time to the science and field skills needed to build robust, long term monitoring programmes for threatened wildlife.

The result is the largest, most comprehensive count of African lions, leopards and spotted hyenas.

We found spotted hyenas to be doing far better than we expected.

But lions are in worrying decline, indicating where conservation efforts need to be focused.

Beyond that, our count proved the value of collaborating when it comes to generating data that could help save animals.

Our unique approach was inspired by Kenya’s first nationwide, science-based survey of lions and other carnivores in key reserves.

The first important step of this study was to secure the collaboration of the Uganda Wildlife Authority’s office of research and monitoring.

Together, we identified the critical conservation stakeholders in and around six protected areas.

These are Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve, Kidepo Valley, Toro Semliki, Lake Mburo, Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls.

Leopards and hyenas occur in some other parks (such as Mount Elgon and Rwenzori National Park) but resource constraints prevented us from surveying these sites.

We had no predisposed notions of who could or would participate in our carnivore surveys, only that we wanted people living closest to these species in the room.

We shortlisted lodge owners, government rangers, independent scientists, university students from Kampala, NGO staff and even trophy hunters.

All came together for a few days to learn about how to find carnivores in each landscape, build detection histories and analyse data.

We delivered five technical workshops showing participants how to search for African lions in the landscapes together with mapping exactly where they drove.

We also taught participants:

how to identify lions by their characteristics

how to identify leopards by their characteristics

how to identify spotted hyenas by their characteristics

We had a total of 100 km² studied.

We found that spotted hyenas have proven far more resilient than we expected, occurring at densities ranging from 6.15 to 45.31 individuals/100km² across surveyed sites.

In Queen Elizabeth, their numbers could be rising as lion populations decline, likely due to reduced competition and ongoing poaching pressure targeting lions.

These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted conservation interventions, particularly for lions in Uganda’s struggling populations.

Our approach shared the load of data collection, and gave people an opportunity and skills to engage in wildlife science.</p></b>

                <p>Scientists have unearthed the remains of five enormous 25,000-year-old woolly mammoths in Austria — and they appear to have been hunted and butchered by ancient humans.

The mammoths were discovered during an excavation of the Langmannersdorf site, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Vienna; the bones and tusks were clustered in two distinct zones about 49 feet (15 meters) apart.

In one of the two zones, the research team found the mammoth bones of several individuals piled up together, many of which had marks and scars from human tools — a sign they had been butchered — as well as stone tools scattered nearby.

In the second zone, the team unearthed the remains of at least three separate mammoths. They found the fragmented and whole remains of the mammoth's enormous tusks clustered together, separate from the bones, which shows Paleolithic humans were likely processing the mammoths' ivory.

This ivory could have been used to make spearheads, the archaeologists suggested. Previous evidence has shown that ancient humans used mammoth ivory to craft tools, such as implements to make ropes, ornaments , accessories and spears and arrowheads for hunting.

Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) were large, elephant-like mammals that measured about 11 feet tall (3.5 meters) and had huge, curved tusks.

They roamed across North America, Europe and Asia during the last ice age , which ended around 11,700 years ago.

The Langmannersdorf site was first excavated between 1904 and 1907, and evidence of two mammoth hunter camps was unearthed in 1919 and 1920.

Around 25,000 years ago, just before the peak of the last ice age about 20,000 years ago, herds of mammoths are thought to have used the Perschling Valley in Austria as a migration route, where they grazed on grasses and shrubs as they traveled.</p></b>

                <p>Fossils of 15 million-year-old freshwater fish discovered in Australia represent a species completely new to science — and they still have the remains of their final meals in their stomachs.

The fossils of the new species, named Ferruaspis brocksi, were unearthed by paleontologists at the McGraths Flat fossil site in New South Wales, Australia.

Inside several of the fish's stomachs were the fossilized remains of their last suppers, including bits of insect larvae, two insect wings, and a bivalve (a mollusk with two hinged shells, such as a clam or a mussel).

The discovery is the first fossil of a freshwater smelt — a small, silvery fish — in the group Osmeriformes to have been discovered in Australia.

Osmeriformes is a broad order of fish that includes various smelt species found worldwide, both in freshwater and marine environments.

Smelt are relatively common across the U.S., particularly in the Great Lakes, the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska.

The researchers describe how they discovered the fossilized remains of F. brocksi embedded in goethite, an iron-rich mineral.

By analyzing the fossils with high-powered microscopes, the researchers discovered that the specimens had been preserved with a surprisingly high level of detail.

The position of the fish's bones and fins, cells that gave the fish color, and their final meals had all remained frozen in time for 15 million years.

Because the paleontologists discovered several fish from this new species preserved at the same site, they could piece together what the ancient fish species might have looked like.

According to the researchers, F. brocksi represents an early ancestor of species in the Osmeriformes order found across Australia and New Zealand today.

The fossils formed between 11 [million] and 16 million years ago and provide a window into the past.

Their stomach contents also offer a glimpse into the behavior of this ancient species.

"We now know that they fed on a range of invertebrates, but the most common prey was small phantom midge larvae," said Matthew McCurry.

Additionally, the unexpected discovery of fossilized pigment cells called melanophores allowed the researchers to determine what color the fish might have been.</p></b>

                <p>About half of adults in the U.S. report feeling lonely – what former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has characterized as an epidemic.

The increase in social isolation has extensive costs for “schools, workplaces, and civic organizations, where performance, productivity, and engagement are diminished,” he wrote in 2023.

As a business school professor who studies intergenerational relationships, I believe that our workplaces hold untapped potential for alleviating isolation. When colleagues do form friendships at work, they often gravitate toward people their own age.

But fostering meaningful connections across generational lines can benefit not just organizations, but workers’ own sense of purpose and mental health.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected all ages differently. Prior to 2020, it seemed that younger generations were leading a strong push away from working in the office.

Once many Americans were working remotely, however, Generation Z – those born 1997-2012 – reported the highest levels of loneliness.

The problem is how organizations’ early questions about working through the pandemic centered on efficiency. Was it possible do our jobs remotely? Would we be as productive?

For many jobs, the answer was yes, resulting in persistent work-from-home options even after it became physically safe to return to offices.

Companies overlooked crucial elements that contribute to employees’ commitment and well-being, particularly strong relationships between colleagues.

These factors are especially vital during early career years as young workers establish networks, learn their roles and develop professional identities – all considerably more challenging in remote or hybrid environments.

Just 31% of U.S. employees feel engaged on the job, according to January 2025 data from Gallup – a 10-year low. Only 39% of employees strongly feel that someone at work cares about them as a person.

Only 30% strongly agree that someone cares about their development. Workers under 35, especially members of Gen Z, experienced a more significant decline in engagement than other age groups, dropping 5 points compared with the previous year.

Since hybrid and remote work appear to be here to stay, we need innovative solutions to combat disconnectedness. One overlooked opportunity might lie in a demographic reality that many organizations view as a challenge.

Today, there are five generations in the workplace, more than any other time in history. This increase in diversity is primarily due to older workers remaining in the workforce longer than in the past.

In 2024, 18% of the U.S. workforce belonged to Gen Z. They’ve surpassed the baby boomers, born 1946-1964, who make up 15%. 

Gen X, meanwhile – the generation born 1965-1980 – comprise 31%. The largest group are millennials, born 1981-1996, who represent 36% of workers.

Finally, 1% of the workforce belong to the Silent Generation, born 1928-1945. While such age diversity presents challenges, it also holds unique potential.

The importance of workplace friendships is well documented. Research has found positive workplace relationships are beneficial to teamwork, career development and building a sense of community.

They help employees find more meaning in their work. Workplace friendships can help offset job stress and exhaustion and contribute to mental health.

The benefits of such relationships can reach beyond the workplace, increasing overall well-being. However, these friendships rarely cross generational lines.

A phenomenon known as “age similarity preference” often causes us to gravitate toward people our own age.

This can limit the opportunities for meaningful connections across different age groups. The experience was “a reminder that regardless of age, we all have something to contribute.

Bridging generational gaps can lead to innovative solutions and a richer understanding of the world.”</p></b>

                <p>Picture an ocean world so deep and dark it feels like another planet – where creatures glow and life survives under crushing pressure.

This is the midwater zone, a hidden ecosystem that begins 650 feet (200 meters) below the ocean surface and sustains life across our planet. It includes the twilight zone and the midnight zone, where strange and delicate animals thrive in the near absence of sunlight.

Whales and commercially valuable fish such as tuna rely on animals in this zone for food. But this unique ecosystem faces an unprecedented threat.

As the demand for electric car batteries and smartphones grows, mining companies are turning their attention to the deep sea, where precious metals such as nickel and cobalt can be found in potato-size nodules sitting on the ocean floor.

Deep-sea mining research and experiments over the past 40 years have shown how the removal of nodules can put seafloor creatures at risk by disrupting their habitats. However, the process can also pose a danger to what lives above it, in the midwater ecosystem.

If future deep-sea mining operations release sediment plumes into the water column, as proposed, the debris could interfere with animals’ feeding, disrupt food webs and alter animals’ behaviors.

Beneath the Pacific Ocean southeast of Hawaii, a hidden treasure trove of polymetallic nodules can be found scattered across the seafloor. These nodules form as metals in seawater or sediment collect around a nucleus, such as a piece of shell or shark’s tooth.

They grow at an incredibly slow rate of a few millimeters per million years. The nodules are rich in metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese – key ingredients for batteries, smartphones, wind turbines and military hardware.

As demand for these technologies increases, mining companies are targeting this remote area, known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, as well as a few other zones with similar nodules around the world.

So far, only test mining has been carried out. However, plans for full-scale commercial mining are rapidly advancing.

The International Seabed Authority was established in 1994 under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to regulate deep-sea mining. But it was not until 2022 that The Metals Company and Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. fully tested the first integrated nodule collection system in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

The companies are now planning full-scale mining operations in the region and expect to submit their application to the ISA by June 27, 2025. The ISA will convene in July 2025 to discuss critical issues such as mining regulations, guidelines and benefit-sharing mechanisms.

The proposed mining process is invasive. Collector vehicles scrape along the ocean floor as they scoop up nodules and disrupt habitats.

Disturbances like these have the potential to disrupt ecosystems, extending far beyond the discharge depth. Declines in zooplankton populations can harm fish and other marine animal populations that rely on them for food.

The midwater zone also plays a vital role in regulating Earth’s climate. Phytoplankton at the ocean’s surface capture atmospheric carbon, which zooplankton consume and transfer through the food chain.

A 2023 study in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone found that 88% to 92% of species in the region are new to science. Current mining regulations focus primarily on the seafloor, overlooking broader ecosystem impacts.

The International Seabed Authority is preparing to make key decisions on future seabed mining in July 2025, including rules and guidelines relating to mining waste, discharge depths and environmental protection.

These decisions could set the framework for large-scale commercial mining in ecologically important areas such as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Yet the consequences for marine life are not clear.</p></b>

                <p>Heads of state are the symbolic leader of a country. Some of them, like King Charles III of the United Kingdom, carry out largely ceremonial roles these days.

Others, like Saudi Arabian King Salman, are absolute monarchs and involved in governing the country’s day-to-day activities and policies.

In the United States, the president is both the head of state and head of government. The head of government works with legislators and meets with other world leaders to negotiate agreements and navigate conflicts, among other responsibilities.

Some presidents, like Jimmy Carter, got so bogged down in the specifics that the nighttime comedy show “Saturday Night Live” made fun of it in 1977.

President Donald Trump loves the power and prestige that comes with being head of state, but does not seem to particularly enjoy the responsibility of being head of government.

Trump rarely talks about the often-tedious process of governing, and instead acts with governance by decree by signing a flurry of executive orders to avoid working with other parts of the government.

He has also likened himself to a king, writing on Feb. 19, 2025, “Long Live the King!”

As much as Trump loves hosting sports teams and talking about paving over the White House’s rose garden in a remodeling project, he seems to begrudgingly accept the role of head of government.

Trump became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl on Feb. 9, 2025.

A week later, he attended the Daytona 500 at Daytona Beach, Florida, where his limousine led drivers in completing a ceremonial lap.

In the televised Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump repeatedly told Zelenskyy, “You have to be thankful.”

The beginning of Trump’s second term in office has been filled with announcements of changes – mostly through executive actions.

The administration has ordered the Pentagon to stop cyber operations against Russia and fired hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The administration has also closed the Social Security Administration’s civil rights office and named the president chair of the Kennedy Center, a performance arts venue in Washington.

Trump has enacted policy changes almost exclusively through executive orders, instead of working with Congress on legislation.

Executive orders do not have to be negotiated with the legislative branch and can be written by a small team of advisers and approved by presidents.

Within the first six weeks, Trump has signed more than 90 executive orders.</p></b>

                <p>President Donald Trump argued in an interview with Tucker Carlson that the US under Joe Biden had mistakenly pushed China and Russia together, and that he would prioritize separating them.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has been eager to negotiate with Russia, hoping to end the war in Ukraine quickly.

This policy can be seen as a shift of attention to containing Chinese power.

After a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told Fox News that "you don't want Russia and China to get together."

The history Trump alludes to is the Nixon-era strategy of aligning with China as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union, encouraging a split between them in the process.


Russia and China have at various times been adversaries when it suited their interests, but today's geopolitical landscape is different from the Cold War era.

Their relationship has grown close since the fall of the Soviet Union and they now share major strategic goals - challenging the Western liberal order led by the US.


Both countries have adopted an increasingly assertive stance in projecting military strength: China in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, and Russia in former Soviet satellite states, including Ukraine.

In response to a unified Western stance against them, China and Russia have grown closer together.

Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping announced a "friendship without limits" just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, showing their unified intent against the West.


China has become an indispensable partner for Russia, serving as its top trading partner for both imports and exports.

Bilateral trade between China and Russia reached a record high of US$237 billion in 2024.

Russia relies heavily on China as a key buyer of its oil and gas.


Areas of disagreement remain between the two countries, but Trump could exploit these if he were to succeed in driving a wedge between them.


Putin knows that with Trump in office, the Western sanctions regime remains a serious threat.


Trump's transactional mindset prioritizes short-term benefits over long-term strategic interests requiring sustained investment.

This has changed the calculation over whether the US may be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan.</p></b>

                <p>Every morning in Miami, our fieldwork begins the same way. Fresh Cuban coffee and pastelitos – delicious Latin American pastries – fuel our team for another day of evolutionary detective work.

As an assistant professor of ecology and evolution at Georgia Tech, my journey with these remarkable reptiles has taken me far from my London roots.

The warm, humid air of Miami feels natural now, a far cry from the gray, drizzly and lizard-free streets of my British upbringing.

Our research takes place on a South Florida island roughly the size of an American football field – assuming we’re successful in sidestepping the American crocodiles that bask in the surrounding lake.

We call it Lizard Island, and it’s a special place.

Here, since 2015, we’ve been conducting evolutionary research on five species of remarkable lizards called anoles.

By studying the anoles, our team is working to understand one of biology’s most fundamental questions: How does natural selection drive evolution in real time?

Each May, coinciding with the start of the breeding season, we visit Lizard Island to capture, study and release all adult anoles – a population that fluctuates between 600 to 1,000.

For the entire summer, female anoles lay a single egg every seven to 10 days. By October, a whole new generation has emerged.

Anoles aren’t early risers, so we don’t expect much activity until the Sun strengthens around 9:30 a.m.; this gives us time to prepare our equipment.

Our team catches anoles with telescopic fishing poles fitted with little lassos, which we use to gently pluck the lizards off branches and tree trunks.

We recently converted – we’re now on Team Fishing Line.

Picture yourself as an anole: every lizard we catch is a crucial measurement for our research.

Each measurement helps us answer fundamental questions about evolution: Do faster lizards live longer? Do stronger biters produce more offspring?

These are the essential metrics of evolution by natural selection.

As afternoon approaches, the team relocates each piece of bright pink tape and returns the corresponding lizard to the exact branch it was caught on.

The anoles now sport two tiny 3-millimeter tags with a unique code that lets us identify it when we recapture it in future research trips, along with a small dot of white nail polish so we know not to catch it immediately after we let it go.

At 8:30 p.m., with the Lizard Olympics done for the day, we return to the island donning headlamps.

Night brings a different perspective. Some of the most wily lizards are difficult to catch when fully charged by the midday Sun, so our nocturnal jaunts allow us to find them while they sleep.

However, it’s often a race against time. Hungry lizard-eating corn snakes are also out hunting, trying to find the anoles before we do.

As we wrap up another 16-hour day around 11:30 p.m., the team shares stories of the night.

Evolution on the island

Now spanning 10 years, 10 generations and five species, our Lizard Island dataset represents one of the longest-running active studies of its kind in evolutionary biology.

By tracking which individuals survive and reproduce, and linking their success to specific physical traits and performance abilities, we’re documenting natural selection with unprecedented detail.

So far we have uncovered two fascinating patterns. Initially, it didn’t pay to be different on Lizard Island. Anoles with very average shapes and sizes lived longer compared with those that are slightly different.

But when the crested anoles arrived, everything changed: Suddenly, brown anoles with longer legs had a survival advantage.

The Lizard Olympics is helping us understand why. The larger, more aggressive crested anoles are forcing brown anoles to spend more time on the ground, where those with longer legs might run faster to escape predators – allowing them to better survive and pass on their long-leg genes, while shorter-legged anoles might be eaten before they can reproduce.

By watching natural selection unfold in response to environmental changes, rather than inferring it from fossil records, we’re providing cutting-edge evidence for evolutionary processes that Charles Darwin could only theorize about.</p></b>

                <p>Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.

The two of us had some experience with participatory design coming into this course, and we had a shared interest in bringing virtual reality into a first-year design class at the University of Michigan.

It seemed like a good fit to help students learn about nuclear technologies, given that hands-on experience can be difficult to provide in that context. We both wanted to teach students about the social and environmental implications of engineering work, too.

Aditi is a nuclear engineer and had been using participatory design in her research, and Katie had been teaching ethics and design to engineering students for many years.


Broadly, the course explores engineering design. We introduce our students to the principles of nuclear engineering and energy systems design, and we go through ethical concerns. They also learn communication strategies – like writing for different audiences.

Students learn to design the exterior features of nuclear energy facilities in collaboration with local communities. The course focuses on a different nuclear energy technology each year.


In the first year, the focus was on fusion energy systems. In fall 2024, we looked at locating nuclear microreactors near local communities.

The main project was to collaboratively decide where a microreactor might be sited, what it might look like, and what outcomes the community would like to see versus which would cause concern.


Students also think about designing nuclear systems with both future generations and a shared common good in mind.

The class explores engineering as a sociotechnical practice – meaning that technologies are not neutral. They shape and affect social life, for better and for worse.


To us, a sociotechnical engineer is someone who adheres to scientific and engineering fundamentals, communicates ethically and designs in collaboration with the people who are likely to be affected by their work.

In class, we help our students reflect on these challenges and responsibilities.


Nuclear energy system design is advancing quickly, allowing engineers to rethink how they approach design. Fusion energy systems and fission microreactors are two areas of rapidly evolving innovation.

Microreactors are smaller than traditional nuclear energy systems, so planners can place them closer to communities. These smaller reactors will likely be safer to run and operate, and may be a good fit for rural communities looking to transition to carbon-neutral energy systems.


But for the needs, concerns and knowledge of local people to shape the design process, local communities need to be involved in these reactor siting and design conversations.

We use virtual reality models of both fission and fusion reactors, along with models of energy system facilities. AI image generators are helpful for rapid prototyping – we have used these in class with students and in workshops.


This year, we are also inviting students to do some hands-on prototyping with scrap materials for a project on nuclear energy systems.

Students leave the course understanding that community engagement is an essential – not optional – component of good design. We equip students to approach technology use and development with users’ needs and concerns in mind.


Specifically, they learn how to engage with and observe communities using ethical, respectful methods that align with the university’s engineering research standards.

As instructors, we have an opportunity – and probably also an obligation – to learn from students as much as we are teaching them course content. Gen Z students have grown up with environmental and social concerns as centerpieces of their media diets, and we’ve noticed that they tend to be more strongly invested in these topics than previous generations of engineering students.</p></b>

                <p>Lula "Mae" Reeves, one of the first Black women in Philly to own her own business, created one-of-a-kind and custom hats for celebrities, socialites, professionals, and churchgoing women in downtown Philadelphia for over 50 years.

She made hats for everyday wear, hats for special occasions, and magnificent "showstoppers," as she called them. Her celebrity clients included Eartha Kitt, Marian Anderson, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, and members of the du Pont and Annenberg families.

The author is a museum specialist at the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian Institution and an expert in costumes, textiles, and millinery fashion. In 2009, she was called upon to visit Mae's Millinery, Reeves' former store, to help select objects for a new permanent exhibition that recreates Reeves' shop and showcases some of her stunning designs.

A few years later, the author returned to Philadelphia to attend Reeves' 100th birthday celebration. During this visit, she learned that Reeves had also used her millinery shop as a polling station.

Reeves recalled creating a black velvet turban that she placed in the window, which caught the attention of a young woman who purchased it for about US$20 – roughly $430 in today's dollars. To open her West Philly millinery store, Reeves secured a $500 business loan from the Citizens and Southern Bank and Trust, a Black-owned bank that catered to Philadelphia's African American community.

Reeves was proud to tell the author how she had secured the loan entirely on her own – with no co-signer – by maintaining a reputation of "good standing" and having sound business plans. She was also extremely proud that she "paid back all of the loan."

To transition her millinery shop to a polling station, Reeves told the author that she and her second husband would remove the beautiful furniture and decorative items to accommodate the polling machines.

Reeves and her husband distributed handbills and hung posters throughout the neighborhood to get the word out about the designated polling station. She offered plates of food to politicians who stopped by and cake to the voters, wanting to create a safe and welcoming polling place while also emphasizing the importance that Black Philadelphians exercise their right to vote.

Reeves was a longtime member of the Freedom Day Association, a group formed in 1941 in Philadelphia to ensure younger African Americans understand the importance of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the U.S; and the 15th Amendment, which prohibits denying any citizen's right to vote on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

The association was started by Maj. Richard Robert Wright Sr., a former U.S. Army paymaster, educator, politician, civil rights advocate, and founder of the Citizens and Southern Bank – the bank that had offered Mae that $500 loan. Reeves admired Wright, who had been born into slavery, and considered him a close friend and business associate.

Reeves kept a copy of his portrait photo on display in her millinery shop.</p></b>

                <p>The Cape Verde date palm (Phoenix atlantica) is native to the island nation of Cape Verde.

It is one of three trees in the country that don’t grow in the wild anywhere else.

Researchers analyzed DNA from various Cape Verde date palms, including a 1934 specimen used to define the species.

The analysis found that the isolated island palms arose from the Phoenix dactylifera species, a commercial and domesticated date palm.

One or a few seeds may have escaped from their grove at some point, giving rise to feral offshoots on Cape Verde.

This new information could be beneficial for breeders of the commercial species.

Diseases and climate change are threats to dates worldwide, and researchers can explore the genetic aids offered by the wild island cousin.

However, it is not clear whether the Cape Verde date palm should still be considered a separate species.

Taxonomists, conservation experts, and island people need to discuss this issue.

The palm has strong cultural and ecological significance in Cape Verde and is currently endangered.</p></b>

                <p>Alef Aeronautics has signed an agreement with PUCARA Aero and MYC to build its new flying car, the Alef Model A.

The Model A is designed as a road vehicle and aircraft that can beat commuter congestion, according to representatives.

Styled as a "retro" flying car, the Model A will operate as an all-electric car capable of vertical takeoff and landing.

When in flight, the chassis can rotate 90 degrees to become a large, fixed wing for aerodynamic flight.

The body of the car is made from mesh, allowing air to flow through when in flight mode.

Jim Dukhovny, founder and CEO at Alef Aeronautics, said that the vehicle's design allows for good distance with its wings.

Unlike other flying car prototypes, the Model A is only a single-seater and not intended as a taxi or passenger vehicle.

The vehicle will have a road range of 200 miles between charges, versus a flying range of 110 miles.

Engineers at Alef Aeronautics have been building the vehicle since 2015, with a pilot first flying a full-scale prototype in 2019.

The Model A is expected to cost $299,999 when it launches and has received 3,200 pre-orders to date.</p></b>

                <p>The legal profession accounts for approximately 20 million jobs worldwide, including 12 million lawyers, around 4 million paralegals, and 4 million operational and administrative workers. 

Additionally, it involves another 14 million jobs within its broader ecosystem, encompassing notaries, translators, and other related professionals.

Law is undergoing a major transformation with the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Law firms use both open AI tools and specialised platforms tailored for legal services.

Specialist tools provide precision, real-time updates, and legal-specific functionalities that generic AI tools do not. 

A recent survey found that 210 law firms out of 333 respondents reported using AI in their operations. Larger firms are leading this shift: among firms with over 500 lawyers, 100% reported AI integration.

Smaller firms (those with 1–100 lawyers) showed a much lower adoption rate, with 68% not yet using AI. 

AI use is most prevalent in Europe (including the UK) and the US, as well as among firms operating in multiple jurisdictions.

The report identifies several primary challenges associated with AI implementation in the legal profession: Developing AI policies and governance frameworks to foster trust, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance.

Rigorous testing and ongoing assessment of AI tools before and during their deployment. Training lawyers and administrative staff to effectively integrate AI into their workflows.

Addressing client concerns regarding the use of data for AI training. Ensuring compliance with legal and ethical obligations.

Legal education institutions cannot afford to wait for all these challenges to be resolved – they must actively contribute to shaping the future of AI in the profession.

While law firms and legal departments are rapidly integrating AI, many law schools have been slow to adapt.

Some AI tools are not even accessible to academic institutions yet, creating a gap between legal training and professional realities. 

For legal education to evolve and prepare students for an AI-intensive profession where many tasks will be automated, law schools can integrate AI at three different levels: Content.

Adding courses on AI ethics and regulation in different regions is important, but it is only the first step – law curricula need to be completely overhauled to align with an increasingly AI-driven profession. 

They must also be analysed to determine the how each legal discipline will be impacted by AI. Constitutional law, for instance, will not be affected in the same ways as commercial and labour law.

Methodology: Teaching staff must make deliberate choices about when students are allowed to use AI tools or not. They should also design debates and assignments in the knowledge that students will likely use AI in the way legal professionals increasingly do.

Skills: Far from just learning statutes and codes by rote, legal education is about developing students’ skills. 

AI should be a tool that enhances legal analysis, and its proper use should strengthen students’ ability to evaluate different perspectives, construct rigorous arguments, and make well-founded decisions.

The case method has traditionally been used by many law schools around the world to make students “think like a lawyer”. It is time to review this methodology, which was first implemented by Professor Langdell at Harvard Law School in 1870.

Law schools must become centres of innovation, equipping students not only to work with AI but to lead its ethical and responsible implementation in the legal profession.</p></b>

                <p>Canadians are currently learning tough lessons about national security thanks to United States President Donald Trump’s repeated annexation threats.

It’s clear that American proclamations of support for universal human rights, national sovereignty and a rules-based international order can vanish with a change of leadership.

Although it seems unthinkable that Trump will invade Canada, we live in an increasingly unstable world and Canadians need to be prepared for the worst.

In the midst of a federal election campaign, party leaders need to present innovative ideas to fight Trump and potential American aggression.

More than military defence

Unfortunately, the common assumption is that national security depends wholly on military strength and alliances.

But the emergency Canada is now facing demands a rethink.

Of course, Canada would not dispense with its military. It’s needed, especially to defend Canada’s northern frontier.

However, Canada cannot match the U.S. in military power, nor would anything be achieved if it broke its commitments to the United Nations’ Non-Proliferation Treaty — a pact designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons — by acquiring nukes.

Either of these tactics would be suicidal.

Canada’s real strength is its unity and institutions.

Canadians can paralyze military might through civil, non-violent resistance.

Familiarity with these techniques could empower Canadian citizens to preserve a vibrant democracy.

Non-violent resistance can not only be a more effective defence, but also much less devastating in terms of lives lost and property destroyed.

Responding to an invasion with military force would only mean widespread casualties and the destruction of Canada’s largest cities.

Canada should therefore aim to subvert the will of the occupying force, not drive it, through armed defence.

What is civil defence?

Non-violent resistance involves using a country’s citizens and institutions to deter an invasion, and if that fails, to defeat and drive out the invaders.

It has a long history both as a spiritual practice and a strategic weapon.

Civil defence, however, only emerged as a strategic concept in the 1980s and 1990s.

It is a system of deterrence and defence that relies on a united and resolute citizenry employing only non-violent tactics.

An early American proponent was the Albert Einstein Institution’s Gene Sharp.

Nonviolence International's manual includes more than 300 tactics for civil resistance.

The history of friendship with Americans would likely mean that the morale of the occupiers would be low.</p></b>

                <p>A radio-wave map of the Milky Way's turbulent center, taken with the MeerKAT telescope.

Space tornadoes are swirling near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy, new telescope observations have revealed in unprecedented detail. Astronomers recently zoomed in on the cosmic twisters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. Although these rotating structures had been seen previously, the new observations with ALMA are 100 times sharper than the earlier views.

The researchers began by pointing ALMA at a region of the galaxy known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), which surrounds our galaxy's core supermassive black hole and is filled with seething clouds of dust and gas. They used ALMA to trace certain molecular compounds — such as silicon monoxide, which is particularly good at revealing shock waves — within the maelstrom.

The team was able to detect previously unseen details in the cosmic dust storms — including a new type of long, slender filament that seems to form when shock waves ripple past. "Unlike any objects we know, these filaments really surprised us," because they appear to move quickly and in a direction counter to the structures surrounding them.

The researchers describe these filaments as space tornadoes. They are violent streams of gas, they dissipate quickly, and they distribute materials into the environment efficiently. The team's observations suggest that, in addition to emitting silicon oxide, these whirlwinds might disperse complex organic molecules — such as methanol, methyl cyanide and cyanoacetylene — throughout the CMZ and beyond.

The researchers will continue their observations with ALMA to determine how widespread these slim filaments are within the CMZ.</p></b>

                <p>Most cancer patients undergo radiation therapy as part of their treatment, often leading to devastatingly painful side effects.

People undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer can develop damaged throats or mouths, making eating and drinking extremely painful. Prostate cancer patients may experience rectal bleeding.


“I treat cancer patients with radiation, and I see a lot of side effects from treatment itself — side effects that can be really debilitating and severe,” says James Byrne, a radiation oncologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

Tardigrades may be as tiny as dust mites, but they are tough little creatures — even capable of tolerating extreme conditions like outer space. Nicknamed “water bears,” they can survive radiation doses about 1,000 times the lethal dose to humans.


The duo and their colleagues used lipid nanoparticles — tiny particles composed of fat molecules that can carry chemicals — to deliver messenger RNA, or mRNA, with instructions for creating the Dsup protein directly into mouse cheek and rectum cells. Byrne and his colleagues discovered that when exposed to radiation, the DNA of mice producing Dsup proteins showed fewer signs of radiation-induced damage compared to the DNA of mice that couldn’t make Dsup.


“It highlights some of the value of research into areas where one might not immediately see a clinical outcome, like studies of DNA damage in tardigrades,” says Zachary Morris, an oncologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved with the study. “You can take findings from more basic or fundamental science and pair them with new delivery mechanisms and suddenly be in a situation where you have a very impactful finding with immediate relevance to human health.”


The researchers now plan to carefully evaluate the safety of this system before testing it on humans. Since tardigrade mRNA is foreign to humans, they want to ensure that injecting it doesn’t lead to adverse reactions. Instead of directly injecting cells as they did with mice, they also want to develop patient-friendly ways to deliver the mRNA to human cells, such as using hydrogels.

“We were hoping to use what nature has really perfected as [this] optimized radiation protection, to potentially help patient care in the long term,” Byrne says.</p></b>

                <p>The Albanese government’s fourth budget is a pitch for the votes of a sour and alienated electorate, framed against a background of extraordinary international uncertainty.

US President Donald Trump isn’t mentioned by name. But he is the colossus in the background of this budget and indeed the imminent election campaign.

While the opinion polls and the public mood have been turning marginally in Labor’s direction in recent weeks, voters still feel (and are) financially under the pump.

Interest rates have fallen slightly and inflation has declined. But public sentiment is still in a relatively dark place. The government for months has been desperately trying to lift it.

It started behind the eight-ball. It had let people’s anger about rising living costs get away from it, even as a per capita recession (from which we’ve just emerged) baked itself in. Why? Largely because Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was over-occupied with the Voice referendum.

Battling to catch up, a plethora of announcements has come in recent months and weeks that have been sold as responses to the cost-of-living crisis – evidence the government understands and cares.

They have been concentrated in Labor’s core areas of health and education, with initiatives to boost bulk billing and improved access to childcare. The government was willing to “sell” these in the pre-budget period, rather than leave them for the night.

At the end, there was the expected and inevitable promise to extend energy bill relief – a bandaid on the continuing sore produced by the necessary transition to a clean economy.

But people want more and the government knew it. The default answer? Tax cuts.

These go to all taxpayers but they will proportionately most benefit lower-to-middle income earners.

Chalmers admits the tax relief is “modest” – although it costs A$17 billion across the forward estimates.

And it doesn’t start for another year – and isn’t fully delivered until the second year.

That’s the government being cautious, with an eye to the Reserve Bank. If it threw out too much money, too quickly, that could undermine the prospect of future interest rate cuts.

The tax initiative put the onus squarely on the opposition. So far it has refused for months to detail its tax policy.

Immediately after the budget the Coalition declared it would oppose the government’s tax changes. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor derided the “seventy cent a day” tax cuts, saying they were a “hoax” and would do nothing to restore household budgets.

The Coalition may be setting up a battle of competing tax packages. If, on the other hand, it says the budget can’t afford any tax cuts, that would be a bold call.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will have to make the opposition’s position clear quickly, before or in his Thursday budget reply, which is critically important for him. Some would argue this budget week is actually more important for Dutton than for the government.

Chalmers spelled it out. The global economy is volatile, storm clouds are gathering.

Even this week, Trump has been muddying the messages about what his big April 2 tariff announcement will bring. Australia could be hit, or treated leniently. No one knows.

Chalmers says the Australian economy has turned the corner, that the soft landing “is looking more and more likely”.

But everything could be turned upside down by Trump – more by the flow-through effects of what he might do to the international economy than to Australia directly.

Commentators often tend to question budget assumptions, but in this case the Trump factor could toss those assumptions aside.

His April 2 announcement on tariffs will play directly into the election campaign. But the real challenges his actions bring will be a matter for whoever is in power next term.

Despite what the government might like us to believe, this budget is devoid of serious economic reform, let alone hard decisions.

Predictably, the savings are chicken feed – something over $2 billion. The first budget of the next term is likely to be harsher, all things being equal. That’s so even with a Labor government. It would certainly be much nastier if there were a change of government.

Given it comes on the cusp of the election, the bland, unambitious nature of this budget is not surprising. But when we consider the extent of the challenges Australia faces – on needed tax reform, sagging productivity and much else – it is depressing.

There is not much sign these issues will be more robustly addressed in the campaign.</p></b>

                <p>John Green, a renowned author, met a boy named Henry at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. Everyone at the hospital seemed to know and love him, making Green believe he was the child of a health care worker.

However, staff revealed that Henry was a patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis — and that he was 17. 

Henry's small stature was due to malnourishment; he grew up ill with tuberculosis, which waxed and waned within his body for most of his youth.


Green's latest nonfiction book, Everything is Tuberculosis, weaves Henry's story into the social and medical history of tuberculosis — one of the world's deadliest bacterial diseases. Over 1 million people died of tuberculosis in 2023.

People living with tuberculosis have told Green that fighting stigma is even harder than fighting the disease itself. Through stories of Henry and others like him, Green argues convincingly that 21st century tuberculosis is caused not by bacteria but by injustice.


Green retraces the path of this injustice from the disease's racialization in the 19th and 20th centuries to the ongoing global misallocation of treatments. He contends, for instance, that Henry might have accessed safer and more appropriate medication sooner if it weren’t for where he lives.

Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health couldn’t afford the high costs set by U.S. pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson for a treatment that might have cured Henry earlier.


Green reminds readers that we all must care. “In a world where everyone can eat, and access healthcare, and be treated humanely, tuberculosis has no chance. Ultimately, we are the cause,” Green writes.</p></b>

                <p>Tofua is home to a large crater lake nestled within a striking caldera. Smoke has been frequently seen coming from a volcanic cone north of the lake during a recent eruptive phase, which began in 2015.

The island consists mainly of a massive ring-like caldera left by an explosive eruption millions of years ago. The caldera's steep walls stand up to 1,690 feet (515 meters) above sea level and harbor a deep crater lake that is around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) across.

Tofua is part of the Ha'apai island group, a chain of volcanic islands and reefs located along a fault line between the Pacific and Indo-Australian tectonic plates.

One of the Ha'apai region's most famous inhabitants is the underwater Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano. It violently erupted in January 2022, unleashing a gigantic plume of ash and steam above the ocean's surface.

Tofua has erupted at least 12 times since 1774, according to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program. The most recent and eruptive phase began in 2015 and is technically ongoing.

The activity has mostly diminished as of May 2024, but smoke is still visible coming from a volcanic cone north of the crater lake, known as Lofia.

In Tongan mythology, there is a colorful tale to explain Tofua's giant caldera. Three deities from Samoa conspired to steal Tofua and tore up the high mountain by its very roots.

This enraged the Tongan gods very much and one of them, Tafakula, essayed to stop the thieves. He stood on the island of Luahako and bent over so as to show his anus, which shone so brilliantly that the Samoan deities were struck with fear.

They dropped the mountain close to Tofua and fled to Samoa. The mountain became the island of Kao.</p></b>

                <p>Being robbed is a horrible experience under any circumstances. But being robbed by your employer involves a unique betrayal of trust.

So it was a sign of real progress when “wage theft” finally became a crime in New Zealand earlier this month with the passage of the Crimes (Theft by Employer) Amendment Act.

Heralded by trade unions and the Labour Party as a victory for workers, the new law makes it a criminal offence under the Crimes Act for an employer to intentionally (and without reasonable excuse) fail to pay workers what they’re entitled to.

Wage theft can include deliberately underpaying wages or holiday pay, or making unlawful deductions from pay packets. The question now is how well the new law will be enforced.

While there is little research on how widespread wage theft in New Zealand is, we do know it all too often affects temporary migrant workers and those in labour-intensive industries such as hospitality, construction and horticulture.

But if, as seems likely, the police are tasked with investigating allegations of wage theft, the new law may struggle to be enforced effectively.

Who investigates wage theft?

Until the law change, wage theft was only addressed through the civil system, not the criminal courts. Underpaid employees could take an employer to court to recover what was owed – if they had the means to navigate what could be a complex process.

It took an initiative by former Labour MP Ibrahim Omer – who as a refugee in New Zealand had experienced wage theft – to begin the reform process. He introduced a members’ bill to parliament in 2023 seeking to make wage theft a criminal offence.

Under the new law, the maximum penalties for wage theft are the same as for general theft. For serious offences, this means employers can be imprisoned for stealing their workers’ pay.

The trouble is, the law doesn’t state which government agency will be responsible for investigating such crimes. This is important because adequately enforcing the law is the whole point.

A 2024 report by the Ministry of Justice had suggested investigative responsibility might sit with New Zealand’s workplace regulator, the Labour Inspectorate. 

But when the legislation was being debated in parliament, it became clear MPs assumed enforcement responsibility would lie with police. Confirming the law change this month, Labour MP Camilla Bellich said:

Theft is theft, and before this bill was law workers had to take up a civil case. Civil wage claims are difficult for any employee to initiate and often time consuming and expensive.

Now workers can go to the police and report wage theft as a crime.

How Australia does it

On the face of it, the police might seem like the logical enforcement agency. They investigate crimes and play an important role in crime prevention.

But wage theft isn’t an area they have dealt with before. And uncovering wage theft in practice is very difficult.

First, those most at risk – such as migrant workers and young employees – are the least likely to report it, often for fear of the consequences or because they simply don’t know how to make a formal complaint.

Secondly, bad employers are good at covering their tracks, leaving no paper trail or fudging the books.

Without specialised knowledge or experience in these areas – as well as dealing with their existing resourcing challenges – the police will potentially struggle to uncover wage theft offending.

A better model might be Australia’s criminal wage theft regime, which came into effect at the start of this year. 

Overall, it is tougher and more targeted than New Zealand’s.

The Australian law applies hefty maximum penalties for wage theft offences – up to ten years’ imprisonment and monetary fines in the millions.

Investigations are the responsibility of the national workplace regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman.

This makes sense, because it’s the Fair Work Ombudsman which has significant experience in uncovering breaches of national employment laws, not the police.

Put the Labour Inspectorate in charge

The equivalent enforcement agency in New Zealand is the Labour Inspectorate, whose entire remit is to uncover breaches of employment standards.

The Labour Inspectorate, far more than the police, will understand the intricacies of wage theft, including which workers and industries are most vulnerable, and what methods dodgy employers use to hide wage theft.</p></b>

                <p>Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and planning to authorize the state's first "healing centers," where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.

The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research. But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years.

“In Oregon and Colorado, we’re going to learn a lot about administration of psychedelics outside of clinical, religious, or spiritual ceremonies," said Dr. Joshua Woolley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California-San Francisco.

Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. The Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials are underway.

Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use, and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.

Despite the retail ban, adjacent businesses have mushroomed. Inside the warehouse and laboratory of Activated Brands in Arvada, brown bags of sterilized grains and plastic bags of soil substrate are for sale, along with genetic materials and ready-to-grow kits.

Co-founder Sean Winfield sells these supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion's mane to people hoping to grow their own at home. Soon, Activated Brands will host cultivation and education classes for the public, Winfield said.

Psilocybin has a long history in Indigenous cultures, and provisions for its use in spiritual, cultural, or religious ceremonies are included in Colorado law, along with recognition of the cultural harm that could occur to federally recognized tribes and Indigenous people if natural medicine is overly commercialized or exploited.</p></b>
