Bright auroras could be visible tonight in the Northern U.S. as Earth passes through a corridor of charged particles leaking out of a "coronal hole" in the sun's atmosphere.

The Northern Lights could be visible as far south as New York and Idaho tonight due to a "coronal hole" sending streams of charged particles toward Earth.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a G2 geomagnetic storm watch for Tuesday, March 25, around 7 a.m. Eastern Time yesterday. The alert was upgraded to a storm warning just before midnight.


Watches of this level are not uncommon, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center; G2-strength geomagnetic storms hit Earth about 360 days in each 11-year solar cycle. These storms can affect spacecraft orbits and cause weak power grid fluctuations at high latitudes.

A "coronal hole" on the sun is facing Earth. Coronal holes are cooler, darker regions of the sun's outermost atmosphere (the corona) that allow high-speed solar winds to escape from the sun and gush outward into space.


Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, but some charged particles make it through into the upper layers of the atmosphere. When the solar wind hits Earth's atmosphere, charged particles shoot toward Earth's poles, agitating atmospheric molecules along the way and forcing them to emit energy in the form of colorful auroras.


In October 2024, the sun reached its solar maximum period, the most active part of its 11-year cycle. During this period, the sun's magnetic poles flip, and space weather events like geomagnetic storms and solar flares occur more frequently.

On Tuesday, "the aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho," according to a statement from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The best chances of spotting an aurora are on dark, clear nights between 10pm and 2am, far from artificial lights.


Conditions for weaker G1 storms will last through Wednesday (March 26). These weaker geomagnetic storms affect technological systems less strongly, but they still produce auroras at high latitudes.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/space/space-exploration/dying-spacex-rocket-triggers-giant-spiral-of-light-above-uk-and-europe-during-secret-mission'>Dying SpaceX rocket triggers giant spiral of light above UK and Europe during secret mission</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 18:36:40 <p>
On Monday (March 24), a giant swirl of light was spotted floating across the night sky in Europe like an ethereal whirlpool.

The baffling light show wasn't caused by aliens, as some speculated, but a dying SpaceX rocket preparing to crash back to Earth, shortly after deploying secret cargo into orbit around our planet.

At around 8 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET), people across the U.K. reported seeing the luminous swirl grow as it slowly streaked across the sky like something from a sci-fi movie, according to the BBC .

The light show was most clearly visible above parts of England, including Lincolnshire , Yorkshire, Leicestershire , Suffolk and Essex , as well as in Wales and further afield in Sweden, Croatia, Poland, and Hungary .

Photographer Simon Minnican captured the ethereal scene in a stunning video that showed a bright spot appear and then grow in size before swelling into an ever-expanding vortex.

The entire spectacle lasted around 12 minutes, with the spiral of light dissipating roughly 4 minutes after it unfurled.


There was initially some wild speculation about what had caused the unusual light show, with at least one observer blaming UFOs.

However, experts quickly pointed out that it was a "SpaceX spiral" — an increasingly common phenomenon triggered by light reflecting off rocket fuel dumped into space by spinning SpaceX rockets before they reenter Earth's atmosphere.


In this case, the spacecraft responsible for the luminous swirl was a Falcon 9 rocket that had launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1:48 p.m. ET, more than 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) from where the bright spiral was later spotted.

This rocket was carrying a secret payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com .

SpaceX spirals are caused by Falcon 9 rocket stages dumping their remaining fuel in space before reentry.


The second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket de-orbits and prepares to reenter Earth's atmosphere, where it either burns up or falls into the ocean.

During this maneuver, the spacecraft dumps its remaining fuel into space, which then freezes into a cloud of tiny crystals that reflect sunlight to Earth.


These spirals were once rare but are becoming more common as the number of Falcon 9 rocket launches increases .</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A series of advances by the Sudanese military has led some observers to posit that the African nation’s yearslong civil war could be at a crucial turning point.

Even if it were to end tomorrow, the bloody conflict would have left the Sudanese people scarred by violence that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions of people. But the recent victories by the military do not spell the end of its adversary, a rebel paramilitary group that still holds large areas in Sudan.

The Conversation turned to Christopher Tounsel, a historian of modern Sudan at the University of Washington, to explain what the war has cost and where it could turn now.

On April 15, 2023, fighting broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF – led by de facto head of state Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, led by Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known colloquially as “Hemedti.” The RSF emerged out of the feared Janjaweed militia that had terrorized the Darfur region of Sudan.

While the SAF and RSF previously worked together to forcibly remove longtime President Omar al-Bashir from power in 2019, they later split amid a power struggle that turned deadly. 

The major point of contention was the disputed timeline for RSF integration into the national military, with the RSF preferring a 10-year process to the SAF’s preferred two-year plan.

By early April 2023, the government deployed SAF troops along the streets of the capital, Khartoum, while RSF forces took up locations throughout the country. Matters came to a head when explosions and gunfire rocked Khartoum on April 15 of that year. The two forces have been in conflict ever since.

The human toll of the civil war has been staggering. As of February 2025, estimates of those killed from the conflict and its related causes, including lack of sufficient medical facilities and hunger, have ranged from 20,000 to 150,000 – a wide gulf that, according to Humanitarian Research Lab executive director Nathaniel Raymond, is partially due to the fact that the dead or displaced are still being counted.

The conflict has displaced more than 14 million people, a number that demographically makes the Sudan situation the world’s worst displacement crisis. Additionally, roughly 2½ years into independence, South Sudan continues to struggle with intergroup violence, food insecurity and sanctions resulting from human rights violations.

Recent Sudanese history has shown that partition is not a risk-free solution to civil war. President Donald Trump's executive order freezing contributions from the U.S. government’s development organization, USAID, has shuttered approximately 80% of the emergency food kitchens established to help those impacted by the conflict.

An estimated 2 million people have been affected by this development. Russian financial and military contributions have been credited with helping the SAF achieve its gains in recent months.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The longest molecules ever found on Mars have been unearthed by NASA's Curiosity rover, and they could mean the planet is strewn with evidence for ancient life.

Molecule chains containing up to twelve carbon atoms linked together were detected in a 3.7 billion-year-old rock sample collected from a dried-up Martian lakebed named Yellowknife Bay.

These long carbon chains are thought to have originated from molecules called fatty acids, which, on Earth, are produced by biological activity.

The fact that fragile linear molecules are still present at Mars' surface 3.7 billion years after their formation allows us to make a new statement: If life ever appeared on Mars billions of years ago, at the time life appeared on the Earth, chemical traces of this ancient life could still be present today for us to detect.

The Curiosity Rover arrived on Mars in 2012 at the Gale Crater, a massive 96-mile-wide impact crater formed by the planet's collision with an ancient meteorite.

Nicknamed "Cumberland", the sample analyzed for the new study was drilled by Curiosity in 2013 from Yellowknife Bay, and previous analyses found it to be rich in clay minerals, sulfur, and nitrates.

But despite many thorough tests, the hydrocarbon strings in the sample remained undetected for more than a decade.

The researchers behind the new study thought to test out a new method for finding these molecules by pre-heating the sample to 1,100°C (2,012°F) to release oxygen before analysis.

Their results showed no amino acids, but, by pure luck, they discovered the fatty molecules hiding there instead.

To test this theory, the researchers mixed undecanoic acid into a Mars-like clay in the lab before performing a test similar to that carried out by the SAM instrument As expected, the undecanoic acid broke down to decane, indicating that the carbon chains could indeed have originated from fatty acids.

On Earth, molecules like these are overwhelmingly produced by biological processes, but they can also occur naturally without life.

However, non-biological processes usually only result in fatty acids with fewer than 12 carbon atoms, the researchers say.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In the age of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the phrase “I’ll believe it when I see it” no longer stands.

Detecting GenAI-generated images is becoming increasingly difficult due to their improvement in quality.


A computer science researcher and PhD candidate at the University of Waterloo conducted a survey where nearly 300 participants were asked to classify a set of images as real or fake, with an average classification accuracy of 61 per cent in 2022.

The participants were more likely to correctly classify real images than fake ones, and it's likely that accuracy is much lower today due to the rapidly improving GenAI technology.


Researchers analyzed the responses using text mining and keyword extraction to learn the common justifications participants provided for their classifications.

A person’s eyes were considered the telltale indicator that the image was probably AI-generated.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has snapped a spectacular image of a "cosmic tornado" being burped out from a baby star.

The image reveals an outflow of hot gas from a newborn star — known as a Herbig-Haro object — situated about 625 light-years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon. This stunning plume of gas, named Herbig-Haro 49/50 (HH 49/50), is a composite of images captured by two of JWST's instruments, NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument).

Herbig-Haro objects are bright, nebula-like objects, formed when jets of ionized gas ejected by newborn stars collide with surrounding interstellar material at hundreds of miles per second. The shockwave of the gas hitting this material heats the gas to immense temperatures, causing it to glow in both visible and infrared wavelengths of light.

They are usually found in star-forming regions — dense, gassy areas where baby stars are actively being born — and can evolve quickly on astronomical timescales, often changing in a matter of years or decades. These strange cosmic structures were first observed in the late 19th century, but were formally identified as a distinct class of objects by astronomers George Herbig and Guillermo Haro in the 1940s.

Herbig-Haro 49/50 was first discovered by NASA's now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope in 2006, and nicknamed the "cosmic tornado" for its funnel-like appearance. It's located in the Chamaeleon I Cloud complex, which is one of the nearest star-forming regions to Earth.

Astronomers think that the protostar responsible for the gas outflow causing HH 49/50 is a newborn star named Cederblad 110 IRS4, located about 1.5 light-years away from HH 49/50. This protostar is a Class I protostar, which means it is a relatively young star in stellar terms.

The new JWST image of HH 49/50 reveals that a fuzzy object at the top of the pillar of gas originally seen in images taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope is actually a distant spiral galaxy in the background.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Roughly every 80 years, a new star appears in the night sky when a white dwarf star repeatedly explodes in the T CrB system, around 3,000 light-years from Earth.

A bright new star could emerge in the night sky later this week if a distant star system erupts as expected, data suggests. However, scientists have been predicting the imminent arrival of this spectacle since early last year, suggesting this long-awaited phenomenon is much harder to predict than previously realized.

T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova that repeatedly explodes, creating frequent and somewhat predictable pulses of light that linger in our skies for up to a week. These flashes come from a binary star system made up of a hefty red giant circling a super-dense white dwarf that's around the same size as Earth.

The smaller star is slowly stripping hydrogen gas from its partner and will eventually devour it over millions of years. However, as material falls onto the white dwarf, some of it accumulates on its surface until the pressure gets so great that it ignites in a powerful, super-bright blast. (This type of cyclical blast is called a nova — not to be confused with a supernova, in which a large star explodes completely, leaving only a shriveled core behind.)

TCrB, also known as the "Blaze Star," last appeared in our skies in 1946 but has been recorded at multiple points throughout history, potentially dating back as far as 1217. By looking at the past outbursts, scientists have determined that the nova explodes roughly every 80 years, meaning it is due to appear anytime now.

However, we have already had multiple false alarms predicting exactly when it will appear. Hopes of the nova's imminent appearance were first raised in late 2023, when the T CrB system dimmed, just like it did before the 1946 appearance.

The hype around the once-in-a-lifetime spectacle really took off in 2024, first in March and then again in August, as different researchers claimed it was close to happening. Ever since, stargazers have been waiting for the Blaze Star to appear — but it has remained elusive.

The Blaze Star nova is triggered when too much stolen hydrogen accumulates on the surface of the white dwarf in the T CrB system.

However, another study, published October last year in the journal Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, a lone researcher proposed a different set of likely dates for the celestial spectacle after analyzing the finer details of its previous iterations.

The first potential window for the Blaze Star's appearance is marked as beginning on Thursday (March 27), the study's author Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in France, wrote in the paper. However, if we do not see the nova within around a week of this date, we will have to wait for more than seven months for the stellar explosion to appear, he claimed.

In reality, the T CrB system has already exploded again, and we are just waiting for the light of the next blast to reach us as it travels 3,000 light-years across the space between it and us.

When will the nova appear? The Blaze Star is hard to pin down because the amount of time between each of its recorded appearances can either increase or decrease by around 1.4 years on average, and there is no pattern suggesting which way it will swing.

As a result, researchers have had to rely on monitoring the T CrB system for changes in brightness to predict its next appearance.

The exact locations of these constellations in the night sky depend on where you are on Earth and the time of year when the nova emerges.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Why the government’s latest plan for schools might fail the history test</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 17:39:45 <p>
The New Zealand government has announced plans to purchase a standardised tool to assess reading, writing, and mathematics for school children between Year 3 and 10.

This plan has caught parents, schools, and education groups by surprise as it is reminiscent of national standards introduced in 2008 under John Key's National government. The policy aimed to improve results across the education system by comparing children against their age and time at school.

However, Labour ended this policy in 2017 due to little improvement in international testing results and criticism from the sector. A survey found that only 16% of teachers and principals believed standardised testing had a positive impact.

The planned introduction of a new standardised assessment tool is concerning for several reasons, particularly its long-term consequences for schools and student learning.

A narrowing curriculum is one concern as research shows that standardised testing can lead to schools being ranked against each other. This can pressure teachers to focus on assessed subjects at the expense of the broader curriculum.

The New Zealand government's "Teaching the Basics Brilliantly" policy has already narrowed the curriculum, and a standardised assessment could exacerbate this trend.

Teachers may also be inclined to "teach to the test," which can result in high test scores but questionable deeper learning. Standardised tests can also damage children's belief that they can learn and their attitudes towards learning.

The introduction of a new national testing standard is happening without consultation with the education sector, which has been caught off guard by the plan.

In 2024, Education Minister Erica Stanford announced plans to allow schools to choose between two tools to assess students. However, it was later revealed that the government planned to rely on a single standardised assessment tool.

This decision contradicts Stanford's statement that the data would not be used to pit schools against each other.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Psychopathy has long been associated with murderers, notorious criminals, and true crime stories.

Typically, people who are higher on the psychopathic traits spectrum show greater pain tolerance, which is usually reflected in their physiology.

When we conducted our recent research on pain and people with different levels of psychopathy, our results surprised us.

Participants with high levels of psychopathy seemed to process pain differently to people low in psychopathy.

We applied pressure pain to our participants using a device that gently pressed a small circular probe onto the participant’s fingernail using compressed air.

We measured their reactions from their sweat responses. 

Before our experiment began, we slowly increased the levels of pressure that participants felt until they told us they had reached their pain threshold (the most pain they could bear).

The low and high psychopathy groups chose similar levels of pressure for their pain threshold.

Next, we delivered varying levels of pressure to ensure participants did not become used to the stimulations. 

Following each stimulation, participants were asked to rate how much pain they felt using a self-report measure ranging from 0-100.

We found that participants higher in psychopathy reported feeling less pain than participants who were lower in psychopathy.

The high psychopathy group even rated their own pain thresholds as less painful than the low psychopathy group (on the 0-100 scale).

However, their SCRs were the same as those lower in psychopathy.

It suggests that people higher in psychopathy interpret pain differently. 

Perhaps this explains why psychopathy relates to greater risk-taking and increased levels of violence or aggression towards others – they do not recognise feelings of pain in the same way as other people.

We also tested our participants’ responses to other people’s pain by showing them images, such as a hand trapped in a door or a bare foot stepping on glass.

Previous research has shown that people higher in psychopathy show reduced levels of physiological arousal to other people’s distress.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The inaugural season of the TGL golf league closes this week with a final championship-deciding series.

The upstart, team-based, men's league has made headlines for its celebrity backers, including star golfers Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.

Even more noteworthy is TGL's unique format. Events are played inside SoFi Center, a custom-built venue in Florida with an audience capacity of 1,500.

At one end lies the “ScreenZone,” where a golf simulator is used for longer shots such as drives and iron play. At the other end, players chip and putt along the physical surface of the “GreenZone” to record a final score on each hole.

TGL is the latest commercial venture to shake up the golf world in recent years. The league is no doubt novel in some ways, yet it can also be explained as the convergence of two longstanding trends: the “mediatization” and “indoorization” of sport.

Mediatization is a concept that speaks to relationships of interdependence between media and other institutions, such as sport.

In this context, TGL stands out as an especially tech-infused venture. First, there is the golf simulator. The ScreenZone is so named because players hit into a massive screen measuring 64 by 53 feet.

Tracking technology is used to map and represent the flight of the ball on screen. This allows for a thoroughly datafied sport experience as an array of performance metrics are available to both players and fans.

Also relevant are TGL's seemingly made-for-TV conventions, some of which might be anathema to golf traditionalists.

Among them, a 40-second shot clock keeps a brisk pace of play. Players are also mic'd up, making strategy conversations and reactions accessible to the audience.

In all, TGL is a media spectacle. It is not uncommon for sports leagues to adopt new rules and formats, seemingly in a bid to capture consumer attention.

But, through TGL's video game-like components, media representation — golf on a simulated volcano, among other places — becomes part of the sport competition itself.

Sport moves indoors. In this sense, it contributes to the indoorization of outdoor sports.

Outdoor sports from surfing to skiing, rock climbing and many more have moved indoors in recent years (while remaining outdoor sports too).

A potential trade-off is that, while outdoor sports often foreground adventure, uncertainty and danger, their indoor analogues often trade this for control, predictability and calculability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/how-donald-trumps-trade-war-against-canada-reveals-tensions-inherent-in-friendship-252260'>How Donald Trump’s trade war against Canada reveals tensions inherent in friendship</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:13:48 <p>
In his second inauguration address, United States President Trump began by declaring “the golden age of America begins right now” and closed with, “and our golden age has just begun.” Between these lines, he vowed to “tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.”

Tying his trade policies to dubious claims about fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration, Trump’s approach appears less about economic strategy and more about asserting dominance. Invoking the language of imperial expansion, he even proposed the idea of making Canada the “cherished 51st state.”

Historians like Richard White, emeritus professor at Stanford University, quickly drew parallels to the 19th-century Gilded Age when robber barons thrived, leaving social inequality in their wake.

The celebrated Canada-U.S. friendship — further entrenched over the past three decades by the 1989 Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement, cross-border activity and snowbirds wintering in Florida and elsewhere in the U.S. — has long balanced underlying tension stemming from the two nations’ power differences.

This alludes to tensions inherent in friendships that have long been explored by philosophers.

A ‘great relationship?’

Trump’s recent sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports are only the latest chapter in a long history of economic clashes. From the U.S.’s Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which hit Canada hard during the Great Depression, to Richard Nixon’s 10 per cent import surcharge in 1971 and the long fight over softwood lumber that persisted through the early 2000s despite Canada’s favourable World Trade Organization rulings, these conflicts expose the fragility of Canada-U.S. relations.

The uneasy reality is that friendship between nations is never as stable as it seems.

The trade war has triggered a wave of cultural and economic nationalism in Canada that has gone beyond the “Buy Canadian” movement.

At the National Ballet of Canada’s Swan Lake, recently, a stirring rendition of O Canada brought the audience to its feet. Chrystia Freeland, now minister of transport and internal trade, voiced the nation’s outrage on CNN: “Canadians are standing strong for our economy and our people.”

Even at its most personal, friendship is marked by power dynamics — who holds it, who benefits from it and who can be cast aside.

Derrida contends: “‘Good friendship’ supposes disproportion. It demands a certain rupture in reciprocity or quality, as well as the interruption of all fusion or confusion between you and me.”

For Canada, this doesn’t mean abandoning the discourse of friendship with the U.S. entirely, but rather acknowledging the bond’s fragile, conditional nature — always deferred, always on the brink of rupture.

The challenge for Canada is to redefine its position in North America beyond the framework of mutuality and dependence. At the policy level, with Canada-U.S. relations, this means diversifying trade and diplomatic ties, resisting automatic alignment and asserting independent leadership in global affairs.

At home, it means forging a national identity that is self-defined and free from the shadow of comparison.

Derrida calls for relationships that embrace their inherent fragility.

His model defies the simplistic binary of friend and foe, loyalty and betrayal, as these terms are ultimately mutually constitutive.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/animals/dinosaurs/exquisitely-preserved-ginormous-claws-from-mongolia-reveal-strange-evolution-in-dinosaurs'>'Exquisitely preserved' ginormous claws from Mongolia reveal strange evolution in dinosaurs</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:01:10 <p>
A new species of dinosaur with strange claws has been unearthed in Mongolia by paleontologists.

The new genus and species is a therizinosaur, plant-eating, two-legged giants with long claws, and was discovered buried in the Gobi Desert, according to a new study published Tuesday (March 25) in the journal iScience. Unlike other therizinosaurs, which have three fingers on their hands equipped with long, sharp claws, this new species only has two fingers.

This unique anatomy inspired its scientific name, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, which is Greek for "two digits" and honors the Mongolian paleontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar. 

Therizinosaurs are a group of dinosaurs that lived across what is now Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (100 million to 66 million years ago). Despite being part of the theropod group of dinosaurs — typically associated with carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex — therizinosaurs were herbivorous.

These dinosaurs are known for their enormous, sickle-shaped claws, with some species growing talons as long as 20 inches (50 centimeters). All other therizinosaurs that have previously been discovered, including Therizinosaurus and Beipiaosaurus, have three clawed fingers on their hands, making the discovery of two-clawed D. tsogtbaatari unusual.

The researchers think that D. tsogtbaatari may have evolved this unique hand in order to better grip vegetation, allowing for more efficient feeding. "The loss of the third finger in Duonychus tsogtbaatari might actually have made its remaining two fingers even better at what they were designed for — grasping," Kobayashi said.

Additionally, Kobayashi suggested that the claws may have played other roles, such as in "defense, courtship, or even play." The researchers are thrilled by this discovery, as it not only reveals unexpected diversity within therizinosaurs, but also marks the fifth time that a theropod dinosaur group has evolved to lose their third finger.

The new fossil was unearthed during the construction of a water pipeline in the Bayanshiree Formation in Ömnögovi Province, southern Mongolia. The specimen had excellently preserved hands, with a 3D sheath where the claw — made out of keratin, like our fingernails — would have been.

Parts of the arms, spine and hips were also preserved. "The hands, a hallmark of therizinosaurs, are exquisitely preserved with all the finger and wrist bones intact in this specimen," Zelenitsky said.

Nearly a billion light-years away, a massive spiral galaxy is screaming into the void.

The behemoth, nicknamed J2345-0449, is a giant radio galaxy, or "super spiral" galaxy roughly three times the size of the Milky Way. Like our own spiral galaxy, it harbors a supermassive black hole at its center. But unlike the Milky Way's center, J2345-0449's supermassive black hole emits powerful radio jets — streams of fast-moving charged particles that emit radio waves — stretching more than 5 million light-years long.

Though scientists don't yet know what fuels the radio jets, a new study hints at how giant spiral galaxies could form. Such strong radio jets are "very rare for spiral galaxies," Patrick Ogle , an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science.

Data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array suggest that the radio jets currently prevent stars from forming near the galaxy's center. That's likely because the jets heat up nearby gases so much that they can't collapse into new stars — or push them out of the galaxy entirely.

The giant radio jets stretching more than 5 million light-years across and a supermassive black hole at the center of spiral galaxy J23453268−0449256, as imaged by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. 

Though both J2345-0449 and the Milky Way are spiral galaxies, it's unlikely that we'll observe these powerful jets in our galactic hometown.

Sagittarius A* , the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, is likely too small to produce radio jets as powerful as the ones observed in J2345-0449, Ogle told Live Science. Still, studying these rare galaxies could help scientists understand how the growth of supermassive black holes and of their host galaxies are related.

In the future, detailed studies of the galaxy's supermassive black hole could also explain what powers its massive radio jets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For nearly 15 years almost no information was available on the population status of Uganda’s large carnivores, including those in its largest national park, Murchison Falls.

These species represent a critical part of Uganda’s growing tourism economy. The country is home to the famed tree-climbing lions, which are much sought after for this unique behaviour.

Together, lions and leopards generate tens of thousands of dollars annually from safari viewing and allied activities.

When wildlife isn’t monitored rigorously, populations can disappear within just a few years, as tigers did in India’s Sariska tiger reserve.

Our two recent studies in Murchison Falls and six protected areas across the country sought to address the problem by drawing on a wide range of local and international experts who live and work in Uganda.

Working with the Ugandan government’s Uganda Wildlife Authority research and monitoring team, we set out to identify and bring together independent scientists, government rangers, university students, lodge owners and conservation managers in the country’s major savanna parks.

We hoped to cover more ground with people and organisations that wouldn’t traditionally work together.

Doing so exposed many of these individuals for the first time to the science and field skills needed to build robust, long term monitoring programmes for threatened wildlife.

The result is the largest, most comprehensive count of African lions, leopards and spotted hyenas.

We found spotted hyenas to be doing far better than we expected. But lions are in worrying decline, indicating where conservation efforts need to be focused.

Beyond that, our count proved the value of collaborating when it comes to generating data that could help save animals.

Inspired by Kenya’s first nationwide, science-based survey of lions and other carnivores in key reserves, the first important step of this study was to secure the collaboration of the Uganda Wildlife Authority’s office of research and monitoring.

Together, we identified the critical conservation stakeholders in and around six protected areas. These are Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve, Kidepo Valley, Toro Semliki, Lake Mburo, Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls.

We had no predisposed notions of who could or would participate in our carnivore surveys, only that we wanted people living closest to these species in the room.

We shortlisted lodge owners, government rangers, independent scientists, university students from Kampala, NGO staff and even trophy hunters. All came together for a few days to learn about how to find carnivores in each landscape, build detection histories and analyse data.

More than 100 Ugandan and international collaborators joined in the “all hands on deck” survey, driving over 26,000km and recording 7,516 camera trap nights from 232 locations spanning a year from January 2022 to January 2023.

Our scientific approach focused on how to achieve the best possible counts of carnivores. In the process, we encountered some unexpected results.

In Queen Elizabeth national park, home to the tree-climbing lions, we found a marked decline of over 40% (just 39 individuals left in 2,400km²) since our last survey in 2018.

In the country’s north, Kidepo Valley, the best estimate is just 12 individual lions across 1,430km², in stark contrast with the previous estimate of 132 lions implemented nearly 15 years ago.

Leopards appeared to continue to occur at high densities in select areas, with Lake Mburo and Murchison Falls exhibiting strong populations.

Pian Upe and Queen Elizabeth’s Ishasha sector recorded the lowest densities.

Spotted hyenas have proven far more resilient. They occur at densities ranging from 6.15 to 45.31 individuals/100km² across surveyed sites.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Scientists have unearthed the remains of five enormous 25,000-year-old woolly mammoths in Austria — and they appear to have been hunted and butchered by ancient humans.

The mammoths were discovered during an excavation of the Langmannersdorf site, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Vienna; the bones and tusks were clustered in two distinct zones about 49 feet (15 meters) apart. 
In one of the two zones, the research team found the mammoth bones of several individuals piled up together, many of which had marks and scars from human tools — a sign they had been butchered — as well as stone tools scattered nearby.

The fact that we found not just individual bones here, but intensively used areas in which several animals were processed, has more than exceeded our expectations," Marc Händel said. Previous evidence has shown that ancient humans used mammoth ivory to craft tools.

Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) were large, elephant-like mammals that measured about 11 feet tall and had huge, curved tusks. They roamed across North America, Europe and Asia during the last ice age, which ended around 11,700 years ago.

These enormous animals were a crucial resource for Paleolithic hunter-gatherers; they provided food, bones for tools and shelter, and hides for warmth. Most went extinct around 10,000 years ago, likely due to climate change and human hunting.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Fossils of 15 million-year-old freshwater fish discovered in Australia represent a species completely new to science.

The fossils, named Ferruaspis brocksi, were unearthed by paleontologists at the McGraths Flat fossil site in New South Wales, Australia.

Inside several of the fish's stomachs were the fossilized remains of their last suppers, including bits of insect larvae, two insect wings, and a bivalve.

The discovery is the first fossil of a freshwater smelt — a small, silvery fish — in the group Osmeriformes to have been discovered in Australia.

Osmeriformes is a broad order of fish that includes various smelt species found worldwide, both in freshwater and marine environments.

Smelt are relatively common across the U.S., particularly in the Great Lakes, the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska.

Scientists have long wondered exactly when smelt and related species arrived in Australia because the fossil record for this group of fish and their ancestors has been notably sparse.

Without fossils it has been hard for us to tell exactly when the group arrived in Australia and whether they changed at all through time, McCurry said.

The researchers describe how they discovered the fossilized remains of F. brocksi embedded in goethite, an iron-rich mineral.

By analyzing the fossils with high-powered microscopes, the researchers discovered that the specimens had been preserved with a surprisingly high level of detail.

The position of the fish's bones and fins, cells that gave the fish color, and their final meals had all remained frozen in time for 15 million years.

F. brocksi represents an early ancestor of species in the Osmeriformes order found across Australia and New Zealand today.

Their stomach contents also offer a glimpse into the behavior of this ancient species.

We now know that they fed on a range of invertebrates, but the most common prey was small phantom midge larvae, McCurry said.

Additionally, the unexpected discovery of fossilized pigment cells called melanophores allowed the researchers to determine what color the fish might have been.

The fish was darker on its dorsal surface, lighter in colour on its belly and had two lateral stripes running along its side.

Melanophores are responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin, hair, eyes and feathers.

Fossilised melanosomes have previously enabled palaeontologists to reconstruct the colour of feathers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

About half of adults in the U.S. report feeling lonely – what former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has characterized as an epidemic.

The increase in social isolation has extensive costs for “schools, workplaces, and civic organizations, where performance, productivity, and engagement are diminished,” he wrote in 2023.

As a business school professor who studies intergenerational relationships, I believe that our workplaces hold untapped potential for alleviating isolation.

When colleagues do form friendships at work, they often gravitate toward people their own age.

But fostering meaningful connections across generational lines can benefit not just organizations, but workers’ own sense of purpose and mental health.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected all ages differently.

Prior to 2020, it seemed that younger generations were leading a strong push away from working in the office.

Once many Americans were working remotely, however, Generation Z – those born 1997-2012 – reported the highest levels of loneliness.

Organizations’ early questions about working through the pandemic centered on efficiency.

Was it possible do our jobs remotely? Would we be as productive?

Was remote work viable long term?

For many jobs, the answer was yes, resulting in persistent work-from-home options even after it became physically safe to return to offices.

Companies overlooked crucial elements that contribute to employees’ commitment and well-being, particularly strong relationships between colleagues.

These factors are especially vital during early career years as young workers establish networks, learn their roles and develop professional identities.

Just 31% of U.S. employees feel engaged on the job, according to January 2025 data from Gallup – a 10-year low.

Only 39% of employees strongly feel that someone at work cares about them as a person, and only 30% strongly agree that someone cares about their development.

Workers under 35, especially members of Gen Z, experienced a more significant decline in engagement than other age groups, dropping 5 points compared with the previous year.

Since hybrid and remote work appear to be here to stay, we need innovative solutions to combat disconnectedness.

One overlooked opportunity might lie in a demographic reality that many organizations view as a challenge.

Today, there are five generations in the workplace, more than any other time in history.

This increase in diversity is primarily due to older workers remaining in the workforce longer than in the past.

In 2024, 18% of the U.S. workforce belonged to Gen Z.

They’ve surpassed the baby boomers, born 1946-1964, who make up 15%.

Gen X, meanwhile – the generation born 1965-1980 – comprise 31%.

The largest group are millennials, born 1981-1996, who represent 36% of workers.

Finally, 1% of the workforce belong to the Silent Generation, born 1928-1945.

While such age diversity presents challenges, it also holds unique potential.

The importance of workplace friendships is well documented.

Research has found positive workplace relationships are beneficial to teamwork, career development and building a sense of community, and they help employees find more meaning in their work.

Workplace friendships can help offset job stress and exhaustion and contribute to mental health.

However, these friendships rarely cross generational lines.

A phenomenon known as “age similarity preference” often causes us to gravitate toward people similar in age, including among our co-workers.

This broader tendency to connect with people we deem similar to ourselves is not beneficial for all parties involved.

The article continues by mentioning a Gen Xer, Jonna, who sought out a Gen Z mentor at her office and was grateful for the partnership.

Hannah, her mentor-mentee, also found the partnership just as beneficial.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The midwater zone is a hidden ecosystem that begins 650 feet below the ocean surface and sustains life across our planet.

This zone includes the twilight zone and the midnight zone, where strange and delicate animals thrive in the near absence of sunlight.

Whales and commercially valuable fish such as tuna rely on animals in this zone for food.

As the demand for electric car batteries and smartphones grows, mining companies are turning their attention to the deep sea.

Precious metals such as nickel and cobalt can be found in potato-size nodules sitting on the ocean floor.

Deep-sea mining research and experiments have shown how the removal of nodules can put seafloor creatures at risk by disrupting their habitats.

The process can also pose a danger to what lives above it, in the midwater ecosystem.


Beneath the Pacific Ocean southeast of Hawaii, a hidden treasure trove of polymetallic nodules can be found scattered across the seafloor.


These nodules form as metals in seawater or sediment collect around a nucleus, such as a piece of shell or shark’s tooth.

They grow at an incredibly slow rate of a few millimeters per million years.

The nodules are rich in metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese – key ingredients for batteries, smartphones, wind turbines and military hardware.


Exploratory deep-sea mining began in the 1970s, and the International Seabed Authority was established in 1994 under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to regulate it.

However, plans for full-scale commercial mining are rapidly advancing.

The Metals Company and Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. fully tested the first integrated nodule collection system in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in 2022.


The proposed mining process is invasive.

Collector vehicles scrape along the ocean floor as they scoop up nodules and stir up sediments.

This removes habitats used by marine organisms and threatens biodiversity, potentially causing irreversible damage to seafloor ecosystems.

Once collected, the nodules are brought up with seawater and sediments through a pipe to a ship, where they’re separated from the waste.


The leftover slurry of water, sediment and crushed nodules is then dumped back into the middle of the water column, creating plumes.


While the discharge depth is still under discussion, some mining operators propose releasing the waste at midwater depths, around 4,000 feet.

However, there is a critical unknown: The ocean is dynamic, constantly shifting with currents, and scientists don’t fully understand how these mining plumes will behave once released into the midwater zone.


As an oceanographer studying zooplankton in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, I am concerned about the impact of deep-sea mining on marine life.

The midwater zone plays a vital role in regulating Earth’s climate.


Phytoplankton at the ocean’s surface capture atmospheric carbon, which zooplankton consume and transfer through the food chain.


When zooplankton and fish respire, excrete waste, or sink after death, they contribute to carbon export to the deep ocean, where it can be sequestered for centuries.

The process naturally removes planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Heads of state are the symbolic leader of a country, while heads of government work with legislators and navigate conflicts.

In the United States, the president is both head of state and head of government. Some presidents, like Jimmy Carter, got bogged down in specifics that made them the target of satire.

As a political scientist who studies American presidents, I see that President Donald Trump loves the power and prestige that comes with being head of state, but does not seem to particularly enjoy the responsibility of being head of government.

Trump rarely talks about the often-tedious process of governing, and instead acts with governance by decree by signing a flurry of executive orders to avoid working with other parts of the government. He has likened himself to a king, writing on Feb. 19, 2025, “Long Live the King!”

As much as Trump loves hosting sports teams and talking about paving over the White House’s rose garden in a remodeling project, he seems to begrudgingly accept the role of head of government.

Trump revels in social events where he is heralded as the most important person in the room. On Feb. 9, 2025, Trump became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. A week later, he attended the Daytona 500 at Daytona Beach, Florida, where his limousine led drivers in completing a ceremonial lap.

The beginning of Trump’s second term in office has been filled with announcements of changes – mostly through executive actions. The Trump administration has ordered the Pentagon to stop cyber operations against Russia and fired hundreds of employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In an Oct. 31, 2024 interview with right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson, President Donald Trump argued that the United States under Joe Biden had pushed China and Russia together. Separating the two powers would be a priority of his administration.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has been eager to negotiate with Russia, hoping to quickly bring an end to the war in Ukraine. One interpretation of this Ukraine policy is that it serves what Trump was getting at in his comments to Carlson: pulling the U.S. out of the European conflict and repairing ties with Russia.

Indeed, after a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told Fox News: “As a student of history, which I am – and I’ve watched it all – the first thing you learn is you don’t want Russia and China to get together.”

The history Trump alludes to is the strategy of the Nixon era, in which the U.S. sought to align with China as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union.

However, if creating a fissure between Moscow and Beijing is indeed the ultimate aim, Trump’s vision is likely both naive and shortsighted.

Although Russia and China have at various times in the past been adversaries when it suited their interests, today's geopolitical landscape is different from the Cold War era. The two countries, whose relationship has grown steadily close since the fall of the Soviet Union, have increasingly shared major strategic goals – chief among them, challenging the Western liberal order led by the U.S.

Both China and Russia have, in recent years, adopted an increasingly assertive stance in projecting military strength: China in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, and Russia in former Soviet satellite states, including Ukraine.

In response, a unified stance formed by Western governments to counter China and Russia’s challenge has merely pushed the two countries closer together.

This changes the calculation over whether the U.S. may be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan.

Rather than increasing the chances of a Sino-Russia split, such a shift could instead divide an already fragile Western coalition.

China has taken another key lesson from Russia’s experience in Ukraine: The U.S.-led economic sanctions regime has serious limits.

Even under sweeping Western sanctions, Russia was able to stay afloat through subterfuge and with support from allies like China and North Korea.

Moreover, China remains far more economically intertwined with the West than Russia, and its relatively dominant global economic position means that it has significant leverage to combat any U.S.-led efforts to isolate the country economically.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Every morning in Miami, our fieldwork begins the same way. Fresh Cuban coffee and pastelitos – delicious Latin American pastries – fuel our team for another day of evolutionary detective work.

As an assistant professor of ecology and evolution at Georgia Tech, my journey with these remarkable reptiles has taken me far from my London roots. The warm, humid air of Miami feels natural now, a far cry from the gray, drizzly and lizard-free streets of my British upbringing.

Our research takes place on a South Florida island roughly the size of an American football field – assuming we’re successful in sidestepping the American crocodiles that bask in the surrounding lake. We call it Lizard Island, and it’s a special place.

Here, since 2015, we’ve been conducting evolutionary research on five species of remarkable lizards called anoles. By studying the anoles, our team is working to understand one of biology’s most fundamental questions: How does natural selection drive evolution in real time?

Each May, coinciding with the start of the breeding season, we visit Lizard Island to capture, study and release all adult anoles – a population that fluctuates between 600 to 1,000. For the entire summer, female anoles lay a single egg every seven to 10 days.

By October, a whole new generation has emerged. The secret lives of lizards Anoles aren’t early risers, so we don’t expect much activity until the Sun strengthens around 9:30 a.m.; this gives us time to prepare our equipment.

Our team catches anoles with telescopic fishing poles fitted with little lassos, which we use to gently pluck the lizards off branches and tree trunks. Ask any lizard biologist about their preferred lasso material and you'll get different answers – some swear by nylon while others prefer a more traditional cotton rope.

These aren’t arbitrary measurements – each represents a potential evolutionary advantage. Fast lizards might better escape predators. Strong bites might determine winners in territorial disputes. Excellent grip is crucial for tree canopy acrobatics.

Each measurement helps us answer fundamental questions about evolution: Do faster lizards live longer? Do stronger biters produce more offspring? These are the essential metrics of evolution by natural selection.

At 8:30 p.m., with the Lizard Olympics done for the day, we return to the island donning headlamps. Night brings a different perspective. Some of the most wily lizards are difficult to catch when fully charged by the midday Sun, so our nocturnal jaunts allow us to find them while they sleep.

However, it’s often a race against time. Hungry lizard-eating corn snakes are also out hunting, trying to find the anoles before we do. As we wrap up another 16-hour day around 11:30 p.m., the team shares stories of the night.

Now spanning 10 years, 10 generations and five species, our Lizard Island dataset represents one of the longest-running active studies of its kind in evolutionary biology.

By tracking which individuals survive and reproduce, and linking their success to specific physical traits and performance abilities, we’re documenting natural selection with unprecedented detail.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Uncommon Courses is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.

The two of us had some experience with participatory design coming into this course, and we had a shared interest in bringing virtual reality into a first-year design class at the University of Michigan.

It seemed like a good fit to help students learn about nuclear technologies, given that hands-on experience can be difficult to provide in that context. We both wanted to teach students about the social and environmental implications of engineering work, too.

Aditi is a nuclear engineer and had been using participatory design in her research, and Katie had been teaching ethics and design to engineering students for many years.

Broadly, the course explores engineering design. We introduce our students to the principles of nuclear engineering and energy systems design, and we go through ethical concerns. They also learn communication strategies – like writing for different audiences.

Students learn to design the exterior features of nuclear energy facilities in collaboration with local communities. The course focuses on a different nuclear energy technology each year.

In the first year, the focus was on fusion energy systems. In fall 2024, we looked at locating nuclear microreactors near local communities.

The main project was to collaboratively decide where a microreactor might be sited, what it might look like, and what outcomes the community would like to see versus which would cause concern.

Students also think about designing nuclear systems with both future generations and a shared common good in mind.

Nuclear energy system design is advancing quickly, allowing engineers to rethink how they approach design. Fusion energy systems and fission microreactors are two areas of rapidly evolving innovation.

Microreactors are smaller than traditional nuclear energy systems, so planners can place them closer to communities. These smaller reactors will likely be safer to run and operate, and may be a good fit for rural communities looking to transition to carbon-neutral energy systems.

But for the needs, concerns and knowledge of local people to shape the design process, local communities need to be involved in these reactor siting and design conversations.

We use virtual reality models of both fission and fusion reactors, along with models of energy system facilities. AI image generators are helpful for rapid prototyping – we have used these in class with students and in workshops.

This year, we are also inviting students to do some hands-on prototyping with scrap materials for a project on nuclear energy systems.

Students leave the course understanding that community engagement is an essential – not optional – component of good design. We equip students to approach technology use and development with users’ needs and concerns in mind.

Specifically, they learn how to engage with and observe communities using ethical, respectful methods that align with the university’s engineering research standards.

As instructors, we have an opportunity – and probably also an obligation – to learn from students as much as we are teaching them course content.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lula "Mae" Reeves, one of the first Black women in Philly to own her own business, created one-of-a-kind and custom hats for celebrities, socialites, professionals and churchgoing women in downtown Philadelphia for over 50 years.

Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture/Gift from Mae Reeves and her children Donna Limerick and William Mincey, Jr. She made hats for everyday wear, hats for special occasions, and magnificent "showstoppers," as she called them.

Her celebrity clients included Eartha Kitt, Marian Anderson, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald and members of the du Pont and Annenberg families.


In 2009, I was called upon to visit Mae's Millinery, her former store at 41 N. 60th St. in West Philadelphia, to help select objects for a new permanent exhibition at the Smithsonian that recreates Reeves' shop and showcases some of her stunning designs.

I also met Reeves in person for the first time that day at a nursing home in Darby, Pennsylvania. She was 96 years old.


During my first meeting with Reeves, she shared her memory of the first hat she created after she opened her 60th Street store, a beautifully decorated shop, in 1941.

Her original millinery shop was at 1630 South St., and many of her famous clients followed her to the new location in West Philadelphia.


Reeves recalled creating a black velvet turban that she placed in the window. A young woman walked by on her way home from work and was enthralled. The woman returned to try it on and, Reeves told me, visualized the impressive fashion statement she would make.

She purchased the turban for about US$20 – roughly $430 in today's dollars.


To open her West Philly millinery store, Reeves had secured a $500 business loan in 1940 from the Citizens and Southern Bank and Trust.

The Black-owned bank catered to Philadelphia's African American community, as most white-owned banks refused to loan money to Black customers.


Reeves was proud to tell me how she had secured the loan entirely on her own – with no co-signer – by maintaining a reputation of "good standing" and having sound business plans.

She was also extremely proud that she "paid back all of the loan."


From millinery shop to polling station To transition her millinery shop to a polling station, Reeves told me that she and her second husband, Joel Reeves, who sold newspaper advertisements, would remove the beautiful furniture and decorative items to accommodate the polling machines.

To get the word out about the designated polling station, the couple distributed handbills and hung posters throughout the neighborhood.


Reeves offered plates of food to politicians who stopped by and cake to the voters. She wanted to create a safe and welcoming polling place while also emphasizing the importance that Black Philadelphians exercise their right to vote.


The association was started by Maj. Richard Robert Wright Sr., a former U.S. Army paymaster, educator, politician, civil rights advocate and founder of the Citizens and Southern Bank – the bank that had offered May that $500 loan.

Reeves admired Wright, who had been born into slavery, and considered him a close friend and business associate.


Barbecues and beach trips In March 2025, I spoke with Reeves' daughter, Donna Limerick, by phone. She told me Reeves had been a member and president of the 60th Street Business Association, which promoted good business practices, shared marketing strategies and encouraged support for other businesses in the association.


Reeves was also active in the National Association of Fashion and Accessory Designers, a Black trade group sponsored by the National Council of Negro Women.

The group's purpose was to promote Black women in the fashion industry by developing their business skills and fostering collaboration and access to mainstream fashion.


Despite her many professional and civic commitments, Reeves also took care of those closest to her. Limerick shared with me how her parents would take neighborhood kids to their summer home in Mizpah, New Jersey.

They would ply the children with delicious homemade meals and desserts, organize regular barbecues and beach trips, and teach the kids to fish.


Reeves passed away in 2016 at the age of 104.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Cape Verde date palm (Phoenix atlantica), native to the island nation, is one of three trees there that don’t grow in the wild anywhere else.

Now a new DNA and seed-shape analysis adds weight to the idea that the remote palms aren’t desert-island wildlings at all. Researchers analyzed DNA from various Cape Verde date palms including a precious bit of the original 1934 specimen that a roving French botanist used to define the species.

The isolated island palms arose from the most famous, economically important and definitely domesticated date species on the planet, the analysis finds. This commercial date palm species, Phoenix dactylifera, at some point gave rise to feral offshoots that sustain themselves on sandy, dry Cape Verde, researchers report.

Knowing that there’s a close gone-wild cousin on Cape Verde could cheer breeders of the commercial species. With diseases spreading and the climate changing, researchers can explore the wild island cousin for some genetic aids for coping with many dangers to dates in the rest of the world. 

The palm is endangered and also has “strong cultural and ecological significance” in Cape Verde, so taxonomists, conservation experts and island people need to talk.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Alef Aeronautics signed an agreement with PUCARA Aero and MYC to build its flying car, the Alef Model A.

The Model A is designed to work as both a road vehicle and aircraft, aiming to beat commuter congestion.

Styled as a "retro" flying car, the Model A operates as an all-electric car capable of vertical takeoff and landing. 
When in flight, the chassis can rotate 90 degrees to become a large, fixed wing for aerodynamic flight.

The body of the car is made from mesh, allowing air to flow through when in flight mode.

Jim Dukhovny, founder and CEO at Alef Aeronautics, said "To have a good distance, you need good aeronautics, which means you need wings."

When the body rotates, the cockpit section stays in place to keep the pilot stabilized.

The Model A has a road range of 200 miles (321 kilometers) between charges and a flying range of 110 miles (177 km).

Engineers have been building this vehicle since 2015, with a full-scale prototype first flown in 2019.

The Model A is expected to cost $299,999 when it launches, with 3,200 pre-orders received to date.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/ai-transformation-in-the-legal-sector-begins-in-law-schools-252007'>AI transformation in the legal sector begins in law schools</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 11:59:59 <p>
The legal profession accounts for approximately 20 million jobs worldwide, including 12 million lawyers, around 4 million paralegals, and 4 million operational and administrative workers.

Additionally, it involves another 14 million jobs within its broader ecosystem, encompassing notaries, translators, and other related professionals.

Law, like many other professions, is undergoing a major transformation with the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).

Law firms use both open AI tools and specialised platforms tailored for legal services. Specialist tools provide precision, real-time updates, and legal-specific functionalities that generic AI tools do not.

A recent survey found that, out of 333 respondents, 210 law firms reported using AI in their operations.

Larger firms are leading this shift: among firms with over 500 lawyers, 100% reported AI integration, whereas smaller firms (those with 1–100 lawyers) showed a much lower adoption rate, with 68% not yet using AI.

AI use is most prevalent in Europe (including the UK) and the US, as well as among firms operating in multiple jurisdictions.

The report identifies several primary challenges associated with AI implementation in the legal profession: developing AI policies and governance frameworks to foster trust, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance; rigorous testing and ongoing assessment of AI tools before and during their deployment; training lawyers and administrative staff to effectively integrate AI into their workflows; addressing client concerns regarding the use of data for AI training; and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical obligations.

The speed of AI adoption in the legal sector varies, leading to disparities in legal service quality and access to justice.

However, legal education institutions cannot afford to wait for all these challenges to be resolved – they must actively contribute to shaping the future of AI in the profession.

For legal education to evolve and prepare students for an AI-intensive profession where many tasks will be automated, law schools can integrate AI at three different levels: content; methodology; and skills.

Content: Adding courses on AI ethics and regulation in different regions is important, but it is only the first step – law curricula need to be completely overhauled to align with an increasingly AI-driven profession.

They must also be analysed to determine the how each legal discipline will be impacted by AI. Constitutional law, for instance, will not be affected in the same ways as commercial and labour law.

Methodology: Teaching staff must make deliberate choices about when students are allowed to use AI tools or not.

They should also design debates and assignments in the knowledge that students will likely use AI in the way legal professionals increasingly do.

Both faculty and students should use AI to make learning more efficient (more accurate feedback, research, and so on), and treat it as an ally rather than an adversary.

Skills: Far from just learning statutes and codes by rote, legal education is about developing students’ skills. 

AI should be a tool that enhances legal analysis, and its proper use should strengthen students’ ability to evaluate different perspectives, construct rigorous arguments, and make well-founded decisions.

The case method has traditionally been used by many law schools around the world to make students “think like a lawyer”.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Canadians are currently learning tough lessons about national security thanks to United States President Donald Trump’s repeated annexation threats.

It’s clear that American proclamations of support for universal human rights, national sovereignty and a rules-based international order can vanish with a change of leadership.

Although it seems unthinkable that Trump will invade Canada, we live in an increasingly unstable world and Canadians need to be prepared for the worst.

In the midst of a federal election campaign, party leaders need to present innovative ideas to fight Trump and potential American aggression.

More than military defence

Unfortunately, the common assumption is that national security depends wholly on military strength and alliances.

But the emergency Canada is now facing demands a rethink.

Canada would not dispense with its military, it’s needed especially to defend Canada’s northern frontier.

However, Canada cannot match the U.S. in military power, nor would anything be achieved if it broke its commitments to the United Nations’ Non-Proliferation Treaty — a pact designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons — by acquiring nukes.

Canada’s real strength is its unity and institutions.

Canadians can paralyze military might through civil, non-violent resistance.

Familiarity with these techniques could empower Canadian citizens to preserve a vibrant democracy.

Non-violent resistance can not only be a more effective defence, but also much less devastating in terms of lives lost and property destroyed.

Responding to an invasion with military force would only mean widespread casualties and the destruction of Canada’s largest cities.

Canada should therefore aim to subvert the will of the occupying force, not drive it, through armed defence, to fear, hatred and further violence.

What is civil defence?

Non-violent resistance involves using a country’s citizens and institutions to deter an invasion, and if that fails, to defeat and drive out the invaders.

It has a long history both as a spiritual practice and a strategic weapon.

Civil defence, however, only emerged as a strategic concept in the 1980s and 1990s.

It is a system of deterrence and defence that relies on a united and resolute citizenry employing only non-violent tactics.

An early American proponent was the Albert Einstein Institution’s Gene Sharp, an American political activist who advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience to achieve social change.

Non-violent resistance is most effective with nation-wide training, organization and leadership.

The national government is best equipped to provide the facilities. 

Training of volunteers could include responding to natural disasters and emergencies, as well as implementing a civil defence strategy.

However, partisan divides and apathy make such nationwide training difficult.

It would likely be viewed with suspicion by right-wing populist forces in this era of conspiracy theories and misinformation.

Apathy might also be a problem.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Space tornadoes are swirling near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, new telescope observations have revealed in unprecedented detail.

A team of astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile to zoom in on the cosmic twisters. Although these rotating structures had been seen previously, the new observations with ALMA are 100 times sharper than the earlier views.

The researchers began by pointing ALMA at a region of the galaxy known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), which surrounds our galaxy's core supermassive black hole and is filled with seething clouds of dust and gas. They used ALMA to trace certain molecular compounds — such as silicon monoxide — within the maelstrom.

This allowed the team to detect previously unseen details in the cosmic dust storms — including a new type of long, slender filament that seems to form when shock waves ripple past. The filaments appear to move quickly and in a direction counter to the structures surrounding them.

The researchers describe these filaments as space tornadoes. They are violent streams of gas, they dissipate quickly, and they distribute materials into the environment efficiently, the authors said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-mice-radiation-protein'>A tardigrade protein helped reduce radiation damage in mice</a></h2><b>Source:</b> sciencenews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 10:00:00 <p>
Most cancer patients undergo radiation therapy as part of their treatment, often leading to devastatingly painful side effects.

These unintended consequences can lead people to stop treatment before their tumors are under control. While at MIT, Byrne and biomedical researcher Giovanni Traverso had “started to explore possibilities of creating radiation protection,” Byrne says, when they realized they could use a little help from tardigrades.

Tardigrades may be as tiny as dust mites, but they are tough little creatures — even capable of tolerating extreme conditions like outer space. Nicknamed “water bears,” they can survive radiation doses about 1,000 times the lethal dose to humans.

The duo and their colleagues used lipid nanoparticles — tiny particles composed of fat molecules that can carry chemicals — to deliver messenger RNA, or mRNA, with instructions for creating the Dsup protein directly into mouse cheek and rectum cells. Byrne and his colleagues discovered that when exposed to radiation, the DNA of mice producing Dsup proteins showed fewer signs of radiation-induced damage compared to the DNA of mice that couldn’t make Dsup.

“It highlights some of the value of research into areas where one might not immediately see a clinical outcome, like studies of DNA damage in tardigrades,” says Zachary Morris, an oncologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved with the study. “You can take findings from more basic or fundamental science and pair them with new delivery mechanisms and suddenly be in a situation where you have a very impactful finding with immediate relevance to human health.”

The researchers now plan to carefully evaluate the safety of this system before testing it on humans. Since tardigrade mRNA is foreign to humans, they want to ensure that injecting it doesn’t lead to adverse reactions.

“We were hoping to use what nature has really perfected as [this] optimized radiation protection, to potentially help patient care in the long term,” Byrne says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Albanese government’s fourth budget is a pitch for the votes of a sour and alienated electorate, framed against a background of extraordinary international uncertainty.

US President Donald Trump isn’t mentioned by name. But he is the colossus in the background of this budget and indeed the imminent election campaign.

While the opinion polls and the public mood have been turning marginally in Labor’s direction in recent weeks, voters still feel (and are) financially under the pump.

Interest rates have fallen slightly and inflation has declined. But public sentiment is still in a relatively dark place. The government for months has been desperately trying to lift it.

It started behind the eight-ball. It had let people’s anger about rising living costs get away from it, even as a per capita recession (from which we’ve just emerged) baked itself in. Why? Largely because Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was over-occupied with the Voice referendum.

Battling to catch up, a plethora of announcements has come in recent months and weeks that have been sold as responses to the cost-of-living crisis – evidence the government understands and cares.

They have been concentrated in Labor’s core areas of health and education, with initiatives to boost bulk billing and improved access to childcare. The government was willing to “sell” these in the pre-budget period, rather than leave them for the night.

At the end, there was the expected and inevitable promise to extend energy bill relief – a bandaid on the continuing sore produced by the necessary transition to a clean economy.

But people want more and the government knew it. The default answer? Tax cuts.

These go to all taxpayers but they will proportionately most benefit lower-to-middle income earners.

Chalmers admits the tax relief is “modest” – although it costs A$17 billion across the forward estimates.

And it doesn’t start for another year – and isn’t fully delivered until the second year.

That’s the government being cautious, with an eye to the Reserve Bank. If it threw out too much money, too quickly, that could undermine the prospect of future interest rate cuts.

Still, the promised tax cuts represent money in the hand – the government hopes the reward will be voter gratitude.

The tax initiative put the onus squarely on the opposition. So far it has refused for months to detail its tax policy.

Immediately after the budget the Coalition declared it would oppose the government’s tax changes. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor derided the “seventy cent a day” tax cuts, saying they were a “hoax” and would do nothing to restore household budgets.

The Coalition may be setting up a battle of competing tax packages. If, on the other hand, it says the budget can’t afford any tax cuts, that would be a bold call.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will have to make the opposition’s position clear quickly, before or in his Thursday budget reply, which is critically important for him. Some would argue this budget week is actually more important for Dutton than for the government.

It’s been years since a budget has been delivered in such a time of disruption and confusion in the world.

Chalmers spelled it out. The global economy is volatile, storm clouds are gathering.

Even this week, Trump has been muddying the messages about what his big April 2 tariff announcement will bring. Australia could be hit, or treated leniently. No one knows.

Chalmers says the Australian economy has turned the corner, that the soft landing “is looking more and more likely”.

But everything could be turned upside down by Trump – more by the flow-through effects of what he might do to the international economy than to Australia directly.

Read more: The 2025 budget has few savings and surprises but it also ignores climate change 

Commentators often tend to question budget assumptions, but in this case the Trump factor could toss those assumptions aside.

His April 2 announcement on tariffs will play directly into the election campaign. But the real challenges his actions bring will be a matter for whoever is in power next term.

Despite what the government might like us to believe, this budget is devoid of serious economic reform, let alone hard decisions.

Predictably, the savings are chicken feed – something over $2 billion. The first budget of the next term is likely to be harsher, all things being equal. That’s so even with a Labor government. It would certainly be much nastier if there were a change of government.

Given it comes on the cusp of the election, the bland, unambitious nature of this budget is not surprising.

John Green met a boy named Henry at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. Henry was small and looked about 9 years old, but he was actually 17 and had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

Green's latest nonfiction book, Everything is Tuberculosis, weaves Henry's story into the social and medical history of tuberculosis.

Over 1 million people died of tuberculosis in 2023, despite our ability to cure infections with antibiotics and prevent them with vaccines. "We know how to live in a world without tuberculosis," Green writes. "But we choose not to live in that world."

That's partly due to stigma, a central theme of the book. Negative, unfair beliefs about tuberculosis have been used to dehumanize and blame people for their illness.

In some communities, the sick have been shunned, thought to be cursed or possessed by demons. In 18th and 19th century Europe, the disease was romanticized as an affliction of poets and artists.

Today, people living with tuberculosis have told Green that fighting stigma is even harder than fighting the disease itself. Through stories of Henry and others like him, Green argues convincingly that 21st century tuberculosis is caused not by bacteria but by injustice.

Green retraces the path of this injustice, from the disease's racialization in the 19th and 20th centuries to the ongoing global misallocation of treatments.

He contends that Henry might have accessed safer and more appropriate medication sooner if it weren’t for where he lives. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health couldn't afford the high costs set by U.S. pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson for a treatment that might have cured Henry earlier.

In the end, Green reminds readers that we all must care. "In a world where everyone can eat, and access healthcare, and be treated humanely, tuberculosis has no chance. Ultimately, we are the cause," Green writes. "We must also be the cure."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tofua is home to a large crater lake nestled within a striking caldera. Smoke has been frequently seen coming from a volcanic cone north of the lake during a recent eruptive phase, which began in 2015.

Where is it? Tofua, Ha'apai, Tonga [-19.73996943, -175.072336] What's in the photo? Smoke coming from a volcanic cone near the island's summit Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9 When was it taken? April 23, 2022

The island consists mainly of a massive ring-like caldera left by an explosive eruption millions of years ago. The caldera's steep walls stand up to 1,690 feet (515 meters) above sea level and harbor a deep crater lake that is around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) across.

One of the Ha'apai region's most famous inhabitants is the underwater Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano, which violently erupted in January 2022, unleashing a gigantic plume of ash and steam above the ocean's surface.

Tofua is docile compared to Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai. However, the smoke in the image, which was pumping out of a volcanic cone north of the crater lake, known as Lofia, is a reminder that the island is still very much active and could blow its top once again in the future.

This 2018 photo shows smoke rising from Lofia earlier on in the current eruption phase. (Image credit: Mike Korostelev via Getty Images)

Tofua has erupted at least 12 times since 1774, according to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program. The most recent and eruptive phase began in 2015 and is technically ongoing.

In Tongan mythology, there is a colorful tale to explain Tofua's giant caldera and the creation of Kao — a tall cone-shaped island around 2.5 miles (4 km) northeast of Tofua.

The story goes that three deities from Samoa conspired to steal Tofua. They tore up the high mountain by its very roots, and its place was taken by a large lake.

This enraged the Tongan gods very much and one of them, Tafakula, essayed to stop the thieves. He stood on the island of Luahako and bent over so as to show his anus.

It shone so brilliantly that the Samoan deities were struck with fear, thinking that the sun was rising and that their dastardly works was about to be revealed. Hence, they dropped the mountain close to Tofua and fled to Samoa.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Being robbed is a horrible experience under any circumstances. But being robbed by your employer involves a unique betrayal of trust.

So it was a sign of real progress when “wage theft” finally became a crime in New Zealand earlier this month with the passage of the Crimes (Theft by Employer) Amendment Act.

Heralded by trade unions and the Labour Party as a victory for workers, the new law makes it a criminal offence under the Crimes Act for an employer to intentionally (and without reasonable excuse) fail to pay workers what they’re entitled to.

Wage theft can include deliberately underpaying wages or holiday pay, or making unlawful deductions from pay packets. The question now is how well the new law will be enforced.

While there is little research on how widespread wage theft in New Zealand is, we do know it all too often affects temporary migrant workers and those in labour-intensive industries such as hospitality, construction and horticulture.


But if, as seems likely, the police are tasked with investigating allegations of wage theft, the new law may struggle to be enforced effectively.

Who investigates wage theft?

Until the law change, wage theft was only addressed through the civil system, not the criminal courts. Underpaid employees could take an employer to court to recover what was owed – if they had the means to navigate what could be a complex process.


It took an initiative by former Labour MP Ibrahim Omer – who as a refugee in New Zealand had experienced wage theft – to begin the reform process. He introduced a members’ bill to parliament in 2023 seeking to make wage theft a criminal offence.

Under the new law, the maximum penalties for wage theft are the same as for general theft. For serious offences, this means employers can be imprisoned for stealing their workers’ pay.


The trouble is, the law doesn’t state which government agency will be responsible for investigating such crimes. This is important because adequately enforcing the law is the whole point.

A 2024 report by the Ministry of Justice had suggested investigative responsibility might sit with New Zealand’s workplace regulator, the Labour Inspectorate.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://undark.org/2025/03/25/colorado-psychedelic-mushrooms/'>Colorado’s Experiment With Psychedelic Mushrooms Begins</a></h2><b>Source:</b> undark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 00:00:00 <p>
Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and planning to authorize the state’s first “healing centers,” where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.

The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research.

But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years, and many eyes are turned toward Oregon’s and Colorado’s state-regulated programs. “In Oregon and Colorado, we’re talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,” said Sean Winfield, co-founder of Activated Brands.

Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and the Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials, often a precursor to application for FDA approval, are underway.

Studies have also shown that people can change hard-set habits with psilocybin and psychotherapy. As of mid-March, Colorado has received applications for at least 15 healing center licenses, nine cultivation licenses, four manufacturer licenses, and one testing facility license for growing and preparing the mushrooms.

Activists had long advocated for decriminalizing psilocybin and other psychedelics, which they say have therapeutic benefits. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado declined to comment on its policy toward state-regulated psychedelic programs or personal use provisions.

Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use, and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.

The state also includes provisions for the use of psychedelic mushrooms in spiritual, cultural, or religious ceremonies. Activated Brands sells supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion’s mane to people hoping to grow their own at home.

Winfield said he looks forward to the upcoming rollout and potential addition of other plant psychedelics, such as mescaline. “We’re talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,” he said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
