Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.

If such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives – and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.

Fortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.

Unfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.

That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.

And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.

Kayla EpsteinUS reporter

On 15 March, the US launched what it described as a ""decisive and powerful"" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Four days earlier, on 11 March, Jeffrey Goldberg writes that he received a connection request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz's.

Signal is used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and send disappearing messages.

Two days later, Goldberg said he was added to a Signal chat entitled ""Houthi PC small group"".

A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the chat, Goldberg reported.

Accounts labelled ""JD Vance,"" the name of the vice-president; ""Pete Hegseth,"" the Defence Secretary; and ""John Ratcliffe,"" the director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chat. Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared to be added.

Goldberg says he watched as the group chat discussed targets and timings for military strikes. And those plans appeared accurate when US later launched air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that matched details from the group chat.

Welcome back to our live coverage as the White House confirms that a journalist was accidentally texted classified US military information.

The Trump administration is facing political uproar after the Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a Signal message group in which US national security officials planned a military strike in Yemen.

The group apparently included Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.

Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, said he had seen classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck.

The report sparked a firestorm of criticism from opposition Democrats and concerns among several Republicans.

We'll bring you live updates, analysis and reaction to this extraordinary story during the UK morning and as the US wakes up, so stay with us.

We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly, and will start back up again in a few hours' time.

Congress is expected to grill Trump officials over the incident in an upcoming Senate intelligence hearing.

Two key witnesses set to appear at that hearing were reportedly members of the Signal chat: Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and John Ratcliffe, director of the CIA.

Thanks for joining us.

Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, a
Washington DC-based magazine that publishes articles on politics, business and
the economy, foreign affairs, culture and the arts, technology, and science.

He has worked there since 2007, when he joined as a national
correspondent before taking over as editor-in-chief in 2016. The magazine won
its first Pulitzer Prizes under his leadership in 2022, as well as a variety of
other awards.

And, as we know now, Goldberg was also part of a classified
conversation where senior US government officials discussed military strikes on
a foreign country.

Read the full story of how he ended up here on The Atlantic's website, external.

The vice-president pushed back against the planned attack, expressing concern over the prospect of ""bailing Europe out""

In the messages revealed by the Atlantic one of the most notable things was Vice President JD Vance's disagreement with Trump's Yemen strategy. 

Vance argued, in the messages, the administration didn't need to rush to attack Yemen and he experienced concern over what should be expected of the Europeans and others for the US doing this. 

“3%  of US trade runs through the Suez. 40% of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message,” Vance reportedly wrote in a message.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,"" Vance says in a later message. ""There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

After pushback from other members of the Trump administration, Vance appears to address Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying ""If you think we should do it let's go"". 

""I just hate bailing Europe out again,"" Vance writes.

""This is blatantly illegal and dangerous beyond belief,"" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren says of the group chat breach. ""Our national security is in the hands of complete amateurs,"" she said on social media.

""What other highly sensitive national security conversations are happening over group chat? Any other random people accidentally added to those, too?""

Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said: ""Think about what we would do if Biden were president and this came out... we would raise the roof"", according to a reporter for Semafor, external. 

""It's going to be interesting to see if anybody loses their job over this,"" she added.

Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono posted: ""Egregious, reckless, and illegal. No amount of spin can change that.""

Max MatzaUS reporter

""It's baffling. It's shocking. It's dangerous,"" says Samar Ali,
a professor of politics and law at Vanderbilt University, saying that the text
chain appeared to be ""a clear violation of our national security laws and our archive
norms"".

Sensitive government communications are required to take
place in a sealed-off room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facility (SCIF), Ali says.

Ali says these rooms are “virtually impossible to penetrate,” unlike the messaging app Signal.

Ali speaks from experience, recalling when she once used a SCIF to hash out negotiations
between the US and EU.

One question Ali raises with me is what accountability those involved in the Signal chat might face? She notes that she would have lost her job and security clearance if she committed similar violations.

Kayla EpsteinUS reporter

Some of the Signal messages National Security Adviser Michael Waltz sent to the chat were set to 
disappear after one week, Jeffrey Goldberg reported in his article for The Atlantic.

That raises concerns about two federal laws that require the preservation of government records: the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act.

“The law requires that electronic messages that take
place on a non-official account are preserved, in some fashion, on an official electronic
record keeping system,"" said Jason R Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and
Records Administration. 

Such regulations would cover Signal, he said.

Official government communications are supposed to be either automatically archived, or the individuals involved are supposed to forward, copy, or preserve the messages.

“The open question here is whether these communications
were automatically archived,"" Baron told the BBC. ""It's not clear whether that occurred.""

It was also unclear whether the individuals in the chat had taken other steps to preserve the records.

The use of Signal to discuss the military strikes also raised security questions.

“Assuming that any of the conversations on
Signal could be considered classified, then under Department of Defense guidance
those communications should have taken place on a classified government network,
or on a network with government-approved encrypted features,"" Baron said.

“We should all be concerned about the use of these
electronic messaging apps to evade federal record keeping requirements,"" he said.

Former defence adviser Mara Karlin says group chat mishap 'not normal'

Mara Karlin, who served under six Secretaries of State and was assistant Secretary of Defence, told the BBC the story from The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg is ""stunning"" and ""not normal"".

Karlin says these types of conversation should take place in a secure space, in the Pentagon or in the situation room in the White House, not in a Signal group chat.

Karlin says she expects both allies and adversaries to pay attention to this, saying they will ask: ""Can the US government keep sensitive information in a secure manner?"" 

Inspector general investigations and congressional investigations will be carried out, Karlin predicts.

""This is historic,"" she adds.

Goldberg says officials got 'lucky' it was him inadvertently added to group chat

Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was inadvertently invited to the Signal group chat with US officials, has been speaking with PBS News Hour about his experience. 

""They got quite lucky that they included my phone number,"" Goldberg told PBS News. 

""If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn't somebody who supported the Houthis, because they were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people who were involved in that operation.""

Goldberg said he doesn't disagree with the administration's statement that the messages show a debate among senior levels, but says that point matters less when considering the security concerns.

'Nobody was texting war plans', says Pete Hegseth in response to The Atlantic report

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth just spoke with reporters in Hawaii about the messages published in The Atlantic's article. 

He mostly deflected questions from reporters, saying Goldberg was not a serious journalist and claiming that he ""peddles garbage"".

""So you're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist,"" he alleged.

He then praised the military operation, saying, ""We will ultimately decimate the Houthis"".

Pressed again on the group chat, Hegseth deflected.

""Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,"" he said.

On Sunday, the US launched what it described as a ""decisive and powerful"" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Messages among top White House officials show not everyone was on board with the plan from the start, in part because American actions would help Europe. Officials in the chat, including Vice President JD Vance, said they wanted Europeans to offer something in exchange for the American action in Yemen.

The White House confirmed the content of the messages as reported in The Atlantic was authentic. 

@PeteHegseth if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.

- JD Vance

VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.

- Pete Hegseth

We've compiled a timeline of the events leading up to a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, gaining access to a chat for top US officials.

Tuesday March 11: Goldberg receives an invitation request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account identified as White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz

Thursday March 13: The editor-in-chief receives a notification that he has been added to a group chat on the app, called ""Houthi PC small group"". A message to the group said it would be used for the coordination of strikes against the Houthis, ""particularly over the next 72 hours"", Goldberg reports

Friday March 14: Now on the second day of communications, Goldberg says conversations diverted as an account called JD Vance spoke of a trip to an economic event in Michigan. Attention then turned back to the Houthis, with an account identified as Pete Hegseth showing support for the proposals to be raised with President Donald Trump

Saturday March 15: Goldberg receives a message in the chat about the attacks on the Houthis at 11:44 local time, just over two hours later the account purported to be that of Waltz says the ""operation was a success""

Among the details shared by journalist Jeffrey Goldberg from the
group chat he was inadvertently invited to are the reactions from White House
officials after military strikes were launched.

Michael Waltz shared a fist emoji, a US flag emoji and a fire
emoji, Goldberg's messages show.

A user with the initials MAR, whom Goldberg believes could be
Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio, said ""good Job Pete and your
team!!”

Pete is in reference to Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense
who apparently shared the details of the planned strikes in the Signal group.

Goldberg says the username Steve Witkoff responded with five
emojis - two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. Witkoff is
Trump's special envoy to the Middle East.

The BBC has not independently verified the individual users in
the chat, but the White House has said it appeared to be ""an authentic
message chain"".

Joe Biden's former transport secretary Pete Buttigieg has just reacted to news of the security breach on his social media account. 

""From an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of (expletive) imaginable,"" the high-profile Democrat says.

""These people cannot keep America safe.""

This is the moment senator Chuck Schumer demands a ""full
investigation"" of the Yemen strike group chat.

Schumer says ""very harsh consequences"" should be faced
by any government employee who shared the sensitive military plans.

Mike Johnson defends Trump administration after Yemen group chat mishap

Reporters on Capitol Hill just asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson about the Signal group. 

""The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it on to that thread, they're going to track that down and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" Johnson tells reporters. 

Johnson said the Trump administration ""acknowledged it was a mistake"".

""What you did see, though, I think, was top level officials doing their job, doing it well,” he added. 

US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz (L) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (R)

As we've been reporting, Editor-in-Chief of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a group chat with US national security officials.

The White House confirmed the texts published by Goldberg ""appears to be an authentic message chain"" and they were investigating how Goldberg had been added to it.

Goldberg says he received an invite from an account purporting to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz on 11 March, four days before the US launched what it described as a ""decisive and powerful"" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Also in the chat, Goldberg reports, were accounts that matched the names of Vice-President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) John Ratcliffe.

He also says top officials from various agencies also appeared to be added.

We've been talking a lot about Signal, the app that was used to discuss war plans.

It's a free, open-source encrypted messaging app that was launched in 2014. 

Conversations within the app are end-to-end encrypted - meaning they can only be read or heard by the recipients.

It is often used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and the ability to send disappearing messages.

The White House says both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and stop military strikes in the Black Sea

Washington releases separate statements after American officials met representatives from both countries in Saudi Arabia in recent days

Ukraine agrees to stop military force in the Black Sea, but adds any movement of Russian naval vessels would be a violation of the agreement, its defence minister says

Earlier the Kremlin said talks with the US focused on creating safe shipping lanes in the Black Sea, but the details would remain private

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov added that Russia was in favour of resuming the Black Sea grain initiative - a deal allowing Ukraine to safely export grain, state-owned Tass news agency reports

Edited by James Gregory

The Ukrainian defence ministry has released its own statement on the deal, which largely follows the same wording as the White House. 

But it also adds that the movement of Russian warships outside of the ""eastern part of the Black Sea"" will be treated as a violation of the agreement and a ""threat to the national security of Ukraine"". 

""In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence,"" the defence ministry statement says on X. 

The defence ministry adds that ""additional technical consultations"" will be needed for the ""effective implementation"" of what has been agreed.

Here are the key points from the statement released by the White House following its talks with Russia in Riyadh:

The US also says Ukraine has agreed to these two points.

The statement adds: 

The White House says both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and stop military strikes in the Black Sea.

We'll bring you more details and lines from the White House statement on US talks with the Russian delegation in the next post. 

We've just received a statement from the White House on the talks between the US and Ukrainian delegations in Riyadh. It says:

It adds the US reiterated to both sides in the war that the killing has to stop and it will continue facilitating negotiations. 

Europe must acquire all means
to defend itself against military aggression, the president of the European
Council has said.

""If Russia considers that Ukraine's
borders are just a line on a map, why should it respect any other
country's borders,"" Antonio Costa asks in a speech at the European Policy
Centre.

Costa adds that peace without
defence is an ""illusion"" and that Europe needs to continue to stand shoulder to
shoulder with Ukraine to create lasting peace in Europe. 

“Russia's aggression gave a new
sense of urgency to our strategic autonomy, not only on energy but also on
defence,” he says, adding there needs to be a “collective effort to boost our defence
spending by more than 30%, paving the way for decisions which are shaping a Europe
of defence”.

Russian officials met American counterparts for 12 hours of talks

If you're just joining us this lunchtime, here's the latest we know about the talks in Saudi Arabia, as well as what's been happening on the frontline in Ukraine:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be meeting French President Emmanuel Macron tomorrow at the Elysée Palace in Paris, French media is reporting.

The two leaders will hold talks ahead of the next iteration of meetings as part of the ""coalition of the willing"", due to take place on Thursday.

Talks are continuing between European leaders on how to ensure any ceasefire agreement secured between Russia and Ukraine is maintained, as well as how Kyiv can be given assurances about its future security. 

As we've been reporting, among the topics said to have been discussed in Riyadh is the potential revival of the 2022 Black Sea grain deal - which had allowed cargo ships travelling to and from Ukraine to safely navigate without being attacked by Russia.

Both Ukraine and Russia are major grain exporters, and prices rocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

A reluctance on the part of international shipping companies to do business with Moscow also hampered Russian exports.

Two deals were brokered by the UN and Turkey - one with Ukraine, and one with Russia - that together were intended to allow both countries to resume and scale-up shipments to amounts closer to pre-war levels.

The deal facilitated the movement of grain, sunflower oil and other products required for food production such as fertiliser through the Black Sea. 

It was initially put in place for a period of 120 days but, after multiple extensions, Russia pulled out in July 2023, claiming key parts of the agreement had not been implemented.

Sergei Lavrov and Antonio Guterres pictured in January 2024

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says United Nations chief Antonio Guterres is in constant contact with Russia on the issue of easing Russian grain and fertiliser exports.

According to the Kremlin, Guterres is ""trying to help"" and looking for ways around current Western sanctions. 

We have not heard anything yet from the UN in response to Lavrov's comments. 

The UN, alongside Turkey, brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative in 2022. But inthe summer of 2023, Russia pulled out of the agreement and stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine.

A separate agreement, called the Memorandum of Understanding, was signed between the UN and Russia to facilitate the export of Russian food products and fertilisers.

The US and Russia did not issue a joint statement after their peace talks in Riyadh because of ""Ukraine's position"", a Russian politician claims. 

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and apparently agreed a joint statement – which wasn't however adopted because of Ukraine's position – that is very typical and symptomatic,"" Vladimir Chizhov, first deputy head of the defence committee at the Russian parliament's upper house, has told Russian media this morning.

He added that he wouldn't ""comment on such details before they are made public”.

The Kremlin said earlier that the contents of the US-Russia talks held in Saudi Arabia yesterday would not be published, with the results still “being analysed”by both sides. 

The two countries were expected to release a joint statement at 08:00 GMT today. It's not clear whether one might still be released later today.

Moscow has accused
Ukraine of continuing to target Russia's civilian energy infrastructure amid
continuing peace talks.

In a statement, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian
drones attacked a power grid in the Krasnodar territory yesterday, as well as a gas
distribution station in the occupied Luhansk region. It also said a Ukrainian drone
targeted an underground gas storage facility in occupied Crimea yesterday,
which was intercepted.

""By continuing daily attacks on Russia's
energy infrastructure, Zelensky confirms that he is incapable of sticking to
agreements or of being managed by foreign guarantors of any possible
agreements,"" the ministry said.

Away from the talks, both Russia and Ukraine have continued to carry out attacks overnight. 

Images have been released by Ukraine's state emergency service, which says show the aftermath of Russian drone strikes in the cities of Fastiv and Boryspil, in the Kyiv region, and the city of Izyum, in the north-eastern Kharkiv region.

James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent in Kyiv

There were 12 hours of talks between the Russians and Americans on Monday in Riyadh. The text we're expecting will probably give some readout of what was discussed. 

What's interesting is the fact Washington and Moscow are even contemplating issuing a joint statement that does not involve the Ukrainians, despite those talks with the Kyiv continuing.

Ahead of these talks, people were describing them as shuttle diplomacy - with three delegations in the same hotel complex in Riyadh. 

But there doesn't seem to be that much shuttling - it seems to be just long talks with one side and the Americans to find where there is common ground.

The focus is on restoring the 2022 Black Sea grain initiative - a very specific deal done to open up one seaway to get grain and fertiliser out of Ukraine, while in return relaxing economic sanctions to let Russia export some more of its grain and fertiliser. 

That is not the same thing as a comprehensive ceasefire across the Black Sea, so we wait to see precisely what they've agreed, if anything. 

But at the moment, it seems to be as ever slow incremental steps rather than anything resembling a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire across the whole of the Ukraine which was demanded by the US and agreed to by Kyiv.

Issues surrounding the safety of shipping in the Black Sea were discussed with the US in Saudi Arabia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says, according to the state-owned Tass news agency.

Lavrov adds that Russia is in favour of resuming the Black Sea grain initiative - a deal allowing Ukraine to safely export grain, after pulling out in 2023. 

The Kremlin said a short while ago that the contents of the talks held in Riyadh yesterday would not be published, with the results still “being analysed” by both sides.

It had been reported earlier, however, that negotiators were examining a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea. 



We're continuing to monitor for updates, and will bring you all the latest right here on this page. Stay with us.

Earlier, we brought you reports that the US and Ukrainian teams in Saudi Arabia were holding a further meeting today. 

That meeting has now ended, the AFP news agency reports, citing a source from the Kyiv delegation. 

""The talks are over. All details will be announced later,"" the source tells a small group of media, according to AFP.

Ukraine's national broadcaster, Suspilne, also reports that the talks - the second round in the past three days - have finished.

Ben TavenerMoscow producer

More now on what we've heard from Moscow about the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia. 

As we reported in our last post, the Kremlin says the results of the meeting have been conveyed to their respective capitals and are currently “being analysed”. 

“We're talking about technical talks, where they go into detail, so of course the contents of those talks definitely won't be made public,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says on a daily conference call with Russian and international journalists.

“The briefings made to the capitals are being analysed [and] we can talk about the understandings [reached] later,” he adds.

On the potential for another call between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, he says there are no plans right now, but that it could be quickly arranged if needed. 

Asked whether there were now grounds for three-way talks including Ukraine, Peskov says that had not been discussed.

A Kremlin spokesperson says both Russia and the US are currently analysing the outcome of talks in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

Dmitry Peskov adds that the content of what was discussed will not be published. 

We'll bring you more on this shortly.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron will hold another meeting on the ""coalition of the willing"" on Thursday.

In the aftermath of the Saudi Arabia talks, the European leaders, along with their allies, aim to provide possible solutions to ensure any potential ceasefire agreement can be maintained and give Ukraine confidence about its future security.

In a statement shared yesterday, a Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer was continually updating the White House on meetings with his allies, following conversations on military planning.

The US and Ukrainian delegations are currently holding a further round of talks in Riyadh, according to reports.

""We are still working with the Americans,"" a member of the Ukrainian delegation tells a small group of media, according to the AFP news agency.

Bloomberg is reporting the same, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has addressed a recent leak of high-level discussions about US airstrikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels, calling the journalist involved “deceitful” and downplaying the significance of the disclosure.

The incident came to light after The Atlantic reported on Monday that its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had been accidentally added to a Signal group chat that included top Trump administration officials such as Vice President J.D. Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Hegseth.

The group had been actively discussing potential US military operations against the Houthis for days prior to President Donald Trump ordering strikes on Yemen on March 15.

Goldberg claimed that one of Hegseth's final messages before the attack “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing.”

When asked about the leak on Monday, Hegseth dismissed Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes.”

“Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said when pressed on the content of the messages.

National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told Reuters that the message thread “appears to be authentic” and confirmed that an internal review had been launched into “how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

“The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials,” Hughes added, without clarifying whether national security protocols had been breached or if any disciplinary action would follow.

Trump ordered a “powerful military action” against the Yemen-based Houthi militants last Saturday, accusing them of conducting an “unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.” The group, officially known as the Ansar Allah movement, has controlled large portions of Yemen – including the capital, Sanaa – since the mid-2010s.

In what The Atlantic described as a “fascinating policy discussion,” senior US officials reportedly acknowledged the difficulty of building public support for a new military campaign.

“There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” the account labeled ‘JD Vance' said, arguing that “the strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.” In response, Hegseth agreed, stating: “I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”

Trump has claimed that the Houthi attacks “emanate from, and are created by, Iran,” warning that from now on, Washington would view every shot fired by the Yemeni group as if it were fired by Tehran. “Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform last Monday.

TOKYO (AP) — The Unification Church in Japan was ordered dissolved by a court Tuesday after a government request spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The South Korea-based church said it was considering an immediate appeal of the Tokyo District Court's revocation of its legal status, which would take away its tax-exempt privilege and require liquidation of its assets. 

The order followed a request by Japan's Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.

In the ruling, the court said the church's problems were extensive and continuous, and a dissolution order is necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television. 

“We believe our claims were accepted,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government will continue efforts to support victims of the church. 

The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers. 

The church called the court order regrettable and unjust and said in a statement the court's decision was based on “a wrong legal interpretation and absolutely unacceptable.”

Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the church's Japanese branch, accused the government of “fabricating damages.” The church is “not a malicious group that should be dissoloved,” he told a news conference on Tuesday. 




The investigation into Abe's assassination revealed links over decades between the church and Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in the 1960s during an anti-communist movement supported by Abe's grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.

The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family's financial troubles. 

The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group subject to a revocation order based on violations of Japan's civil code. Two earlier case involved criminal charges — the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.

To seek the church's dissolution, the Education Ministry had submitted 5,000 documents and pieces of evidence to the court, based on interviews with more than 170 people.

The church tried to steer its followers' decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability and causing fear and harm to them and their families, seriously deviating from the law on religious groups, officials and experts say.

The Agency for Cultural Affairs said the settlements reached in or outside court exceeded 20 billion yen ($132 million) and involved more than 1,500 people.

Lawyers representing those seeking damages from the church welcomed the court decision as a major first step toward redress.

“We must pursue our effort to achieve redress and to prevent future problems,” head lawyer Susumu Murakoshi told reporters, demanding the church accept the dissolution order and offer an apology and compensation to all victims.

The church was founded in Seoul in 1954 by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative, family-oriented value systems. 

Nicknamed the “Moonies,” after its founder, the church developed relations with conservative world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as his predecessors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

The church faced accusations in the 1970s and 1980s of using devious recruitment tactics and brainwashing adherents into turning over huge portions of their salaries to Moon. In Japan, the group has faced lawsuits for offering “spiritual merchandise” that allegedly caused members to buy expensive art and jewelry or sell their real estate to raise donations for the church.

The church has acknowledged excessive donations but says the problem has lessened since the group stepped up compliance in 2009.

Experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and that the majority of the church's worldwide funding comes from Japan.

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, Palestinian medics said, as hospitals are flooded with dead and wounded since Israel resumed heavy bombardment last week, shattering the ceasefire that had halted the 17-month war. The dead include three children and their parents who were killed in a strike on their tent.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, an Oscar-winning Palestinian director is set to be released a day after he was badly beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces, according to the director's lawyer. The lawyer said Hamdan Ballal had been wounded in the attack and was accused of throwing stones at a young settler, allegations he denies.

Israel's parliament passed a crucial state budget on Tuesday, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to the Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251. Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because it operates in densely populated areas. 




Here's the latest:

An Oscar-winning Palestinian director and two others have been released by Israeli authorities, a day after he says he was badly beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

Associated Press journalists on Tuesday spoke with Hamdan Ballal after he left the police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.

Ballal and other witnesses say he was attacked by Jewish settlers before being detained by the Israeli army Monday evening. The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation.

Ballal is one of the other directors of “No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary. The film chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.

An Israeli strike Tuesday in southwestern Syria killed at least four people as Israeli troops occupying the area clashed with local residents, Syrian state media and a war monitor reported. 

Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said troops fired back at gunmen who attacked them, before launching a drone attack. 

Syrian state-run news agency SANA said several people were wounded, including a woman. The report said Israeli tanks in the southwestern village of Koayiah also fired several rounds. 

Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at seven. The observatory and a town resident told The Associated Press that clashes had erupted between Israeli troops and residents when the Israeli troops fired. 

Israel seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone inside Syria after Islamist insurgents toppled President Bashar Assad and seized power in December, with Israeli officials saying they will thwart any threats.

The lawyer for an Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces says he will be released. 

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Hamdan Ballal, said Tuesday that he and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could feel free to move toward a lasting ceasefire with Hamas since his political allies, who oppose ending the war, have little incentive to trigger new elections while their polling numbers are down, said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

But the vote doesn't mean Netanyahu will move in the direction to end the war, she said. She expected him to further his ultranationalist partners' agenda to keep them as loyal allies and galvanize the nationalist right ahead of any future vote.

“Netanyahu is always thinking about the next elections,” Talshir said. “His goal is to make sure the extreme right will be in his government now and in the future.”

Israel's parliament on Tuesday passed a state budget, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

The budget vote was seen as a key test for Netanyahu's coalition, which is made up of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties who had demanded and largely received hefty sums for their constituents in exchange for support for the funding package. By law, the government would fall and elections triggered if a budget weren't passed by March 31. 

With its passing, Netanyahu buys himself what's likely to be more than a year of political quiet that could see his government coast through to the end of its term in late 2026, a rare occurrence in Israel's fractious politics. It's a political win for Netanyahu, who faces mass protests over his decision to resume the war in Gaza while hostages still remain in Hamas' hands, and over his government's recent moves to fire top legal and security chiefs. 

Palestinian first responders say a nine-member ambulance crew is still missing days after being surrounded and targeted by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said the team was responding to airstrikes in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of the southern city of Rafah when Israeli forces encircled the area early Sunday. It said Israel has refused access to the area since then. 

The military said troops had fired on ambulances and fire trucks that it said had raised suspicion by moving without prior coordination and without headlights or emergency signals. It said those inside were militants, without providing evidence.

The Israeli military says a well-known Palestinian journalist killed in a strike on the Gaza Strip was also a Hamas sniper. 

It shared what it said were internal Hamas documents purportedly showing that Hossam Shabat was a sniper in a Hamas battalion in northern Gaza and had received military training in 2019. The military said he had carried out attacks during the war, without providing evidence. 

Qatar-based Al Jazeera said Shabat, a freelance reporter, was covering the war for the satellite news network when he was killed in an Israeli strike on Monday. It said he had been wounded in an Israeli strike in November. 

Shabat, in his early 20s, was prolific on social media, sharing videos and other reports with more than 170,000 followers on the X platform.

Israel has banned Al Jazeera and accused several of its journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. A number of them have been killed or wounded in Israeli strikes. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war.

One of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary “ No Other Land ” was still missing on Tuesday after being beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by the Israeli military.

Attorney Lea Tsemel told The Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained in the occupied West Bank.

Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya late Monday, according to Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they're being held at a military base for medical treatment, and she said she hasn't been able to speak with them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.

Palestinian medics say Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday.

Nasser Hospital said it received four additional bodies from two other strikes in addition to the family of five.

In central Gaza, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said it received the bodies of six people who were killed in three separate strikes. Three others were killed in a strike on a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital.

In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed 5 people, according to the Health Ministry's emergency service. Another 12 people were wounded, it said.

TOKYO (AP) — A controversial South Korean church with powerful political connections faces dissolution in Japan after a Tokyo court ordered a revokation of its legal status after the government accused it of manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.

The Tokyo District court's ruling would end the Unification Church's tax-exempt status in Japan and force it to liquidate its assets. The church said it is considering an immediate appeal to the country's highest court.

The Unification Church has faced hundreds of lawsuits in Japan from families who say that it manipulated members into draining their savings to make donations, but for decades it largely escaped official scrutiny and maintained close links with the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

That changed in 2022, when former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated. The man accused of shooting Abe allegedly was motivated by the former prime minister's links to the church and blamed it for bankrupting his family. The killing drew public attention and prompted investigations into the church's practices and its links to powerful politicians.




The church was founded in Seoul in 1954, a year after the end of the Korean War, by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative, family-oriented value systems. 

The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, champions anti-communism and the unification of the Korean Peninsula, which has been split between the totalitarian North and democratic South. 

The church is perhaps best known for mass weddings where it paired off couples, often from different countries, and renewed the vows of those already married, at places like stadiums and gymnasiums. The group is said to have a global membership of millions, including hundreds of thousands in Japan.

The church faced accusations in the 1970s and ‘80s of using devious recruitment tactics and brainwashing adherents into turning over huge portions of their salaries to Moon. The church has denied the allegations, saying many new religious movements face similar accusations in their early years. 

Experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and that the majority of the church's worldwide funding comes from Japan.

The Education Ministry asked a Tokyo court to dissolve the church in October 2023, accusing it of trying to steer its followers' decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability, and causing fear and harm to them and their families. 

On Tuesday, the Tokyo District court granted the request, writing that the church's problems were extensive and continuous, and a dissolution order is necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television. 

The Unification Church is the first religious group to face a revocation order under Japan's civil code. Two earlier case involved criminal charges — the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.

The Japanese branch of the church has criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers. In a statement Tuesday, it called the court order “truely regrettable” and “unjust,” adding that the decision is based on “a wrong legal interpretation and absolutely unacceptable.”

The 2022 assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and subsequent investigations unearthed decades of cozy ties between the Unification Church and Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party and triggered public outrage. 

The man accused of shooting Abe at a campaign event allegedly told police he was motivated by the former prime minister's links to the church, which he said bankrupted his family due to his mother's excessive donations.

Abe was known for his arch-conservative views on security and history issues and appeared at events organized by church affiliates. 

Throughout his life, Moon worked to make his church into a worldwide religious movement and expand its business and charitable activities. Moon was convicted of tax evasion in 1982 and served a prison term in New York. He died in 2012.

The church has developed relations with conservative world leaders including U.S. presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and more recently Donald Trump.

Moon also had ties with North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un.

Moon said in his autobiography that he asked Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions, and that Kim responded that his atomic program was for peaceful purposes and he had no intention to use it to “kill (Korean) compatriots.”

President Donald Trump insisted Monday the upcoming visit to Greenland by second lady Usha Vance and other U.S. officials is about “friendliness, not provocation.” Still, the president repeated his assertion that the U.S. could come to control Greenland.



































































































NUUK, Greenland (AP) — Lisa Sólrun Christiansen gets up at 4 a.m. most days and gets to work knitting thick wool sweaters coveted by buyers around the world for their warmth and colorful patterns celebrating Greenland's traditional Inuit culture.

Her morning routine includes a quick check of the news, but these days the ritual shatters her peace because of all the stories about U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on her homeland.

“I get overwhelmed,'' Christiansen said earlier this month as she looked out to sea, where impossibly blue icebergs floated just offshore.

The daughter of Inuit and Danish parents, Christiansen, 57, cherishes Greenland. It is a source of immense family pride that her father, an artist and teacher, designed the red-and-white Greenlandic flag.

“On his deathbed he talked a lot about the flag, and he said that the flag is not his, it's the people's,” she said. “And there's one sentence I keep thinking about. He said, ‘I hope the flag will unite the Greenlandic people.'''

Greenlanders are increasingly worried that their homeland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has become a pawn in the competition between the U.S., Russia and China as global warming opens up access to the Arctic. They fear Trump's aim to take control of Greenland, which holds rich mineral deposits and straddles strategic air and sea routes, may block their path toward independence.

Those fears were heightened Sunday when Usha Vance, the wife of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, announced she would visit Greenland later this week to attend the national dogsled race. Separately, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will visit a U.S. military base in northern Greenland. 




The announcement inflamed tensions sparked earlier this month when Trump reiterated his desire to annex Greenland just two days after Greenlanders elected a new parliament opposed to becoming part of the U.S. Trump even made a veiled reference to the possibility of military pressure, noting the U.S. bases in Greenland and musing that “maybe you'll see more and more soldiers go there.”

News of the visit drew an immediate backlash from local politicians, who described it as a display of U.S. power at a time they are trying to form a government.

“It must also be stated in bold that our integrity and democracy must be respected without any external interference,'' outgoing Prime Minister Múte Boroup Egede said.

Greenland, part of Denmark since 1721, has been moving toward independence for decades. It's a goal most Greenlanders support, though they differ on when and how that should happen. They don't want to trade Denmark for an American overlord.

The question is whether Greenland will be allowed to control its own destiny at a time of rising international tensions when Trump sees the island as key to U.S. national security.

While Greenland has limited leverage against the world's greatest superpower, Trump made a strategic mistake by triggering a dispute with Greenland and Denmark rather than working with its NATO allies in Nuuk and Copenhagen, said Otto Svendsen, an Arctic expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Trump's actions, he says, have united Greenlanders and fostered a greater sense of national identity.

“You have this feeling of pride and of self-determination in Greenland that the Greenlanders are not, you know, cowed by this pressure coming from Washington,” Svendsen said. “And they're doing everything in their power to make their voices heard.”

Denmark recognized Greenland's right to independence at a time of its choosing under the 2009 Greenland Self-Government Act, which was approved by local voters and ratified by the Danish parliament. The right to self-determination is also enshrined in the United Nations charter, approved by the U.S. in 1945.

But Trump is more focused on the economic and security needs of the U.S. than the rights of smaller nations. Since returning to office in January, he has pressured Ukraine into giving the U.S. access to valuable mineral resources, threatened to reclaim the Panama Canal and suggested that Canada should become the 51st state.

Now he has turned his attention to Greenland, a territory of 56,000 people, most from indigenous Inuit backgrounds.

Greenland guards access to the Arctic at a time when melting sea ice has reignited competition for energy and mineral resources and attracted an increased Russian military presence. The Pituffik Space Base on the island's northwest coast supports missile warning and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.

Before Trump's re-election, Greenlanders hoped to leverage this unique position to help the country achieve independence. Now they fear it has made them vulnerable.

Cebastian Rosing, who works for a water taxi firm that offers tours around the Nuuk fjord, said he's frustrated that Trump is trying to take over just as Greenland has begun to assert its autonomy and celebrate its Inuit origins.

“It's so weird to defend (the idea) that our country is our country because it's always been our country,” he said. “We're just getting our culture back because of colonialism.”

It's not that Greenlanders don't like the U.S. They have welcomed Americans for decades.

The U.S. effectively occupied Greenland during World War II, building a string of air and naval bases.

After the war, President Harry Truman's government offered to buy the island because of “the extreme importance of Greenland to the defense of the United States.” Denmark rejected the proposal but signed a long-term base agreement.

When Trump resurrected the proposal during his first term, it was quickly rejected by Denmark and dismissed as a headline-grabbing stunt. But now Trump is pursuing the idea with renewed energy.

During a speech earlier this month he told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed to take control of Greenland to protect its national security. “I think we're going to get it,” Trump said. “One way or the other.”

Even so, Trump has his admirers in Greenland.

And there is no greater fan than Jørgen Boassen. When he spoke to The Associated Press, Boassen wore a T-shirt featuring a photo of Trump with his fist in the air and blood streaming down his face after an assassination attempt last year. Included was the slogan, “American Badass.”

Boassen works for an organization called American Daybreak, which was founded by former Trump official Thomas Dans and promotes closer ties between the U.S. and Greenland.

The former bricklayer, who describes himself as “110%″ Inuit, has a litany of complaints about Denmark, most stemming from what he sees as mistreatment of local people during colonial rule. In particular, he cites Inuit women who say they were fitted with birth control devices without their permission during the 1970s.

Trump must act to secure America's back door, Boassen says, because Denmark has failed to guarantee Greenland's security.

But even he wants Greenland to be independent, a U.S. ally but not the 51st state.

What he has in mind is something more like the free-association agreement the Marshall Islands negotiated with the U.S. when it became independent in 1986. That agreement recognizes the Pacific archipelago as a sovereign nation that conducts its own foreign policy but gives the U.S. control over defense and security. 

“We're in 2025,'' Boassen said. “So I don't believe they can come here and take over.”

Whatever happens, most Greenlanders agree that the island's fate should be up to them, not Trump.

“We have to stand together,'' Christiansen said, her knitting needles clicking and clacking.

LONDON (AP) — The urgent care doctor cocked an eyebrow at Mari Santos and her American accent.

It was four days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, and Santos was a student with a stomach bug in the first weeks of an overseas semester in Glasgow, Scotland. A doctor arrived to see her after a six-hour wait. But before asking what ailed her, he said this: “Interesting time to be an American, I suppose.”

Until then, Santos, 20, had not been thinking about Trump — just her 104-degree fever and concern about being sick while abroad. But the president and his triumphant return to the White House, she says, were on her physician's mind, giving the American University student an instant education in geopolitics. The lesson, as she sees it: “There's a kind of chilling in the air.” 

“I knew that maybe that Europe is not in general big fan of American politics,” Santos said, “but I didn't expect it to be such like a personal thing.”

The United States and its center of gravity occupy a unique space in the international conversation. People the world over talk about America — its policies, its proclivities, its place in the world. They have for generations. They did it during the Iraq War. They did it during the first Trump administration. 

And two months into Trump 2.0, at least in many European and English-speaking countries, it's happening again — sometimes even more intensely. 

Answering for America under the new Trump administration is becoming a delicate experience for some of the estimated 5 million U.S. citizens living in other countries.

From Santos in Scotland to others in New Zealand, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, Republican and Democratic expats alike told The Associated Press in recent weeks that the moment they are revealed to be American changes virtually every conversation to, in essence, “What about Trump?” 

At its root, this change is about whom to trust among those thought until now to be allies, in world politics and in life. Trump, known for insisting the truth is what he says it is, is now the voice of America — not VOA, the independent news service that told the nation's story for eight decades until he silenced it March 16. The president himself has set an example in which trust is almost beside the point. 

“Who do I trust? I mean, who do you trust? Do you trust anybody?” he said during an interview last month with The Spectator, when asked how much he trusts people like Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post.

What comes after the revelation that someone is American, U.S. citizens overseas say, are awkward questions, pauses and euphemisms — but almost always a reference to America under Trump in 2025.

“Before this year, the typical follow-up would be asking where exactly I'm from and what brought me to France,” said Anthony Mucia, 31, a Nebraska native who lives in Toulouse, France and has been overseas for six years. “Twice now, the first thing someone asked me was, ‘Are you glad to be in France now?'” He also gets looks that he interprets as “a bit of ‘shock' or ‘uneasiness.' Almost like it automatically turned into an embarrassing topic.”

What's bending these interactions, expats say, is Trump's flurry of orders and statements that have upended 80 years of international order and spooked markets.

He's talked about how the U.S. will “one way or the other” capture Greenland from Denmark, “take back” Panama and make Canada the 51st U.S. state. He wants to empty and develop war-battered Gaza, and has cut off U.S. aid to the world's neediest people. He's falsely blamed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting the Russian invasion and ended a White House meeting with Zelenskyy after berating the Ukrainian leader. Trump has let Europe's leaders know that the U.S. is not a staunch ally in facing the Russian threat. And he's set off tariff wars with China, Canada and Mexico. 

Not smoothing the American experience overseas is the backlash developing against Trump's association with Elon Musk and Tesla, which has fueled growing boycott movements. People are joining Facebook groups to exchange ideas about how to avoid U.S. products. Feelings are especially strong across the Nordic region — particularly Denmark, where Trump's moves have set “the Danish Viking blood boiling,” one man told The Associated Press.

So far, the interactions are less hostile than wary, Americans overseas say. But anti-U.S. sentiment is emerging as a concern on the cusp of what's expected to be a record-setting international travel season for Americans. 

Jake Lamb, 32, moved from Colorado to Auckland, New Zealand in 2023. He said says he's “noticed a significant shift in the types and frequency of questions I'm asked” over the past year. Kiwis remain friendly about it, but they've been saying they might have to “hide” Lamb or vouch that he's “one of the good ones” if Trump escalates conflicts with former allies. He thinks that the good humor belies wariness.

“I am concerned that it may become difficult for some not to hold individual Americans responsible,” Lamb, a volunteer coordinator for a charity and who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris, said in an email.

Elizabeth Van Horne, 33, has lived in France since 2013. For years, she said, people would ask “why on Earth I'd come to live in France if I could live in the U.S: ‘It's so beautiful, there's so much potential, so much opportunity, like living in a TV show.'”

“Now, that romanticized image has completely changed,” Van Horne, a Democrat, said in an email. Early in March, a postal worker told her it's sad to watch.

“For me,” she said, “that conversation summed it up: ‘Je suis desole pour vous' — ‘I'm sorry for you.'”

Georganne Burke, a Syracuse, N.Y., native living in Ottawa, supported Trump in all three elections and is the chairwoman of Republicans Overseas in Canada. She's a dual citizen, which makes her something like the Peace Bridge that links the two nations in Buffalo, N.Y.

Trump's tariff war, his manner and his provocative talk about how Canada “only works” as the 51st U.S. state “has everybody's hair on fire,” she said in an interview. Burke, 77, says she's received threats and had a tense talk with an anti-Trump co-worker. People ask her, “How could anyone vote for him?”

An invitation to speak about trade near the end of March, she says, came with the organizer saying that he was “pretty sure that most of the people will be polite.” Burke accepted the invitation.

She says anti-American sentiment was bad during the Iraq war under President George W. Bush in 2003. But now it's different. 

“Then, it was kind of more on the politicians,” as the targets of public ire, Burke said in a recent interview. “Now, it's much more personal.” 

Burke's counterpart in London, Greg Swenson of Republicans Overseas UK, says walking around as an American in another country remains more positive than negative. In interviews with media outlets, he readily acknowledges Trump can be “obnoxious.” But Swenson, 62, is an investment banker, and he says the president and America remain good for business.

“In the private capital world, which is not affected by day-to-day (market) volatility, there is just a huge amount of optimism,” Swenson said. That means, he says, that investors want to work with U.S. vendors and customers, seeking American “credibility” through “an affiliation with the president.”

As for what people overseas think of Americans right now: A survey of social media, neighbors and others shows plenty are curious and concerned. When an American dad posted on Reddit his worry that his family won't be welcomed in Ireland, an Irish dad who asked the AP to identify him by his Reddit handle responded this way:

“A lot of people like me are really, really alienated and angry at the US and Americans,” wrote MDMB13. “But the good news is we're Irish so you'll never know because (we) bury our feelings in a far-off place and let them fester over decades.” He ended his comment with a smile emoji.

UPDATE: Lawyer for Oscar-winning Palestinian director detained by Israeli forces says he will be released

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary film “ No Other Land ” on Monday in the occupied West Bank before he was detained by the Israeli military, according to two of his fellow directors and other witnesses.

The filmmaker Hamdan Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya, according to attorney Lea Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they were being held at a military base for medical treatment, but she said Tuesday morning that she had not been able to reach them and had no further information on their whereabouts.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

“We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us,” Adra told The Associated Press. “This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment.”

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed. The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.




“No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.

The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened the documentary.

Adra said that settlers entered the village Monday evening shortly after residents broke the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A settler — who according to Adra frequently attacks the village — walked over to Ballal's home with the military, and soldiers shot in the air. Ballal's wife heard her husband being beaten outside and scream “I'm dying,” according to Adra.

Adra then saw the soldiers lead Ballal, handcuffed and blindfolded, from his home into a military vehicle. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said Ballal's blood was still splattered on the ground outside his own front door.

Some of the details of Adra's account were backed up by another eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.

A group of 10-20 masked settlers with stones and sticks also assaulted activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, smashing their car windows and slashing tires to make them flee the area, one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the AP.

Video provided by the Center for Jewish Nonviolence showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.

The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards — and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.

During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has gifted to Donald Trump a portrait he commissioned of the U.S. president.

Putin gave the painting to Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow earlier this month, the Russian president's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a response to a journalist's question, declining further comment.

The gift was first mentioned last week by Witkoff in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Witkoff told Carlson that Trump “was clearly touched” by the portrait, which he described as “beautiful.”

Witkoff met Putin after talks with Russian officials about trying to end the war in Ukraine. Ceasefire talks continued Monday in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. officials met their Russian counterparts, a day after meeting with Ukrainian negotiators.

During his interview with Carlson, Witkoff described Putin's gift as “gracious” and recalled how Putin told him he had prayed for Trump last year when he heard the then-candidate for the U.S. presidency had been shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. “He was praying for his friend,” Witkoff said, recounting Putin's comments. 

In 2018, Putin gave then-President Trump a soccer ball that the Secret Service had checked for listening devices before Trump gave it to his son — a precaution that hearkened back to a Soviet-era gift to a U.S. diplomat that turned out to be bugged.

In 1945, a carving of the Great Seal of the United States was given as a gift from Soviet school children to then-U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in his office for six years allowing the Soviet Union to eavesdrop on his conversations until the State Department discovered that it contained a covert listening device.




It was not immediately known if the portrait Putin gave to Trump had been examined for bugs. The White House hasn't commented on the portrait.

Trump isn't the first sitting president to receive a gift from Putin. In 2021, Putin gave then-President Joe Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2013, he reportedly sent then-President Barack Obama porcelain plates and espresso cups.

This apparently isn't the first portrait of a U.S. leader Putin has sent, either. In 2014, the Russia president reportedly sent to George H.W. Bush a portrait of the former president on his 90th birthday.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday the claim that white people are being persecuted in his country is a “completely false narrative.” It was his latest attempt to push back against allegations made by U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and some white minority groups in South Africa.

South African-born Musk, who has regularly accused South Africa's Black-led government of being anti-white, repeated a claim this weekend in a social media post that some of the country's political figures are “actively promoting white genocide.”

Ramaphosa said in his weekly message to the nation that South Africans “should not allow events beyond our shores to divide us or turn us against each other.”

“In particular, we should challenge the completely false narrative that our country is a place in which people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution.”

Ramaphosa did not mention names, but his denial was a reference to the allegations by Trump and others that South Africa is deliberately mistreating a white minority group known as Afrikaners by encouraging violent attacks on their farms and introducing a law designed to seize their land. 

The allegations were central to an executive order issued by Trump last month cutting funding to South Africa to punish the government, while offering Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S.




Afrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa more than 300 years ago. They were at the heart of the apartheid government that systematically oppressed non-whites, although South Africa has been largely successful at reconciling its many racial groups after apartheid ended in 1994.

In his post on X, influential Trump adviser Musk cited a political rally last Friday in South Africa where Black leaders of a far-left opposition party sang a song that has the lyrics “Kill the Boer, the farmer.” Boer is a word that refers to an Afrikaner.

“Very few people know that there is a major political party in South Africa that is actively promoting white genocide,” Musk wrote. He linked to a video of the rally.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X late Monday that the song “is a chant that incites violence. South Africa's leaders and politicians must take action to protect Afrikaner and other disfavored minorities. The United States is proud to offer those individuals who qualify for admission to our nation amid this continued horrible threat of violence.”

The party in question, the Economic Freedom Fighters, is the fourth biggest in Parliament and a political opponent of Ramaphosa's African National Congress. It won 9.5% of the vote in last year's national election. It has come under scrutiny for stirring racial tensions before and for singing the song, which was used during apartheid as a call to fight against government oppression.

The song's modern-day use has been criticized by some in South Africa, including by other political parties, and a group representing Afrikaners challenged its use in court. It was ruled hate speech and effectively banned by a court more than a decade ago.

But it was the subject of several other legal cases before a 2022 ruling found that it was not hate speech and protected under freedom of speech because there was no proof it incited violence. The EFF says it is a historic chant that shouldn't be taken literally and has sometimes changed the lyrics to “kiss the Boer.”

Since Trump's executive order, the South African government has sought to dispel what it says is misinformation over white farmers, who are sometimes victims of violent attacks in their homes. The government has condemned the attacks, but experts say there is no evidence of any widespread targeting of whites and they are in fact part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates, which affect all races.

The group representing Afrikaners says the police have sometimes undercounted farm homicides in official statistics. It recently said it had figures showing there were eight farm homicides in the three-month period between October and December last year when police only recorded one. 

There were a total of 6,953 homicides across South Africa during that same time period, according to the police statistics.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Five-year-old Sila Abu Aqlan curled her lip in concentration as she practiced walking for the first time on a prosthetic leg at a clinic in Gaza City. The foot of the new leg had a little pink sneaker with a lacy frill, matching her pink hoodie.

It has been nearly 15 months since the little girl's leg was amputated after it was left severely burned from an Israeli airstrike. Finally, she is being fit for a prosthetic.

One of the most shocking sights in Gaza's war has been the thousands of children with amputated limbs from Israel's bombardment. The U.N.'s humanitarian aid organization OCHA called it the “largest cohort of child amputees in modern history.”

Throughout the 17-month war, supplies and services for children and adults with amputations have fallen far short of demand. Gaza's ceasefire that began in mid-January offered a window for aid agencies to bring in an increased number of prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, crutches and other devices.

Still, it only covered about 20% of the total need, said Loay Abu Saif, head of a disability program run by the aid group Medical Aid for Palestine, or MAP.

The window slammed shut when Israel barred entry of all medical supplies as well as food, fuel and other aid on March 2. Israel's resumpton of its military campaign last week, killing hundreds of Palestinians, has only added to the ranks of amputees.

With help limited, children wrestle with the psychological pain of losing a limb along with other traumas.

Sila's mother, father and sisters were all killed in an airstrike on her home in December 2023. Sila suffered severe burns to her right leg. A month of treatment had little effect, and Sila would scream in excruciating pain, her aunt Yasmine al-Ghofary said. Doctors amputated her leg above the knee.

“I try as much as I can to make her happy. But the truth is, there's only so much she can be happy. Pain is pain, and amputation is amputation,” al-Ghofary said. 

Sila sees other girls playing and tries to keep up with them using her walker but falls down. “She says, 'Why am I like this? Why am I not like them?” said al-Ghofary.

In October 2023, 11-year-old Reem lost her hand when an airstrike hit nearby as her family fled their home in Gaza City.

Reem can no longer dress on her own, brush her hair or tie her shoes. She gets angry and hits her siblings if she can't find someone to help her, her mother said. Other times, she isolates herself and just watches other children playing.

“Once Reem told her dad that she wished to die,” said her mother, who goes by the traditional name, Umm Reem. “In another instance, we were talking about meat, and she said, ‘Slaughter me like a sheep,' and she was laughing.”

Some 3,000 to 4,000 children in Gaza had suffered amputations as of November 2024, according to Jamal al-Rozzi and Hussein ِAbu Mansour, two prominent experts with rehabilitation programs in the territory who spoke with The Associated Press.

Up to 17,500 adults and children suffered severe limb injuries, leaving them in need of rehabilitation and assistance, the World Health Organization estimated in September.

Throughout the war, hospitals lacked medicines that could have averted amputations. Doctors describes cutting off limbs because of infections that should have been easily treated.

In its campaign in Gaza, Israel has struck homes and shelters with families inside almost daily.

Gaza's Health Ministry on Monday put out a list of the names of more than 15,000 children, 17 and younger, killed by Israel's offensive. The list included nearly 5,000 children younger than 6, including 876 infants who had not reached a year in age.

Israel's offensive has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians of all ages and wounded more than 113,000, according to the ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Nearly 90% of the population of some 2.3 million have been displaced, and vast areas of Gaza have been destroyed.

Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others. Israel says it is targeting Hamas and blames the group for civilian deaths because it operates in residential areas.

Last May, 13-year-old Moath Abdelaal's leg was amputated above the knee after an Israeli airstrike in the southern city of Rafah.

The family had to flee to a tent camp outside the neighboring city of Khan Younis. During the ceasefire, they moved back to their hometown Jabaliya in northern Gaza, but their home had been destroyed, so they live in a tent by the ruins, said his father, Hussein Abdelaal.

Moath's psychological state is worsening, his father said. Moving with crutches around the rubble is difficult. Doctors had to amputate more from his leg, almost up to his hip, because of complications. The boy learned that a number of his friends in the neighborhood had been killed, Abdelaal said.

“He has been having a hard time coping with his new situation. He's not sleeping well next to his siblings. It's difficult to see our son like that,” said Abdelaal.

Sila is being treated at the Artificial Limbs and Polio Center in Gaza City, a program launched by the International Committee of the Red Cross that has provided physical therapy, wheelchairs and prosthetics to hundreds of Palestinians suffering from amputations or paralysis. 

But supplies are limited. Wheelchairs are urgently needed, with 50 to 60 people a day asking for them in northern Gaza alone, said Mahmoud Shalabi with MAP. 

Al-Rozzi, executive director of the National Rehabilitation Society in the Gaza Strip, said Israel blocks materials to manufacture prosthetics from entering Gaza on grounds they could have dual or military uses. 

COGAT, the Israeli military body overseeing aid, said there have never been limitations on medical supplies to Gaza, including wheelchairs, prosthetics and crutches.

Some child amputees have been evacuated out of Gaza for treatment. But the pace of medical evacuations has remained slow, at a few dozen a day, and was reduced after Israel's strikes last week. As many as 13,000 patients of all kinds are waiting their chance to get out. 

Asmaa al-Nashash wants nothing more than for her 11-year-old son Abdulrahman to go abroad for a prosthetic leg.

The boy was selling items from a stand at a U.N. school-turned-shelter in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp when an airstrike hit, she said. Shrapnel tore through his leg, and doctors couldn't save it.

Since then, he often sits alone playing games on her phone because he can't play football with other children, she said. Other kids bully him, calling him the “one-legged boy.”

“My heart gets torn into pieces when I see him like this and I can do nothing for him,” she said.

Anti-government protesters in Turkey clashed with police on Monday amid growing demonstrations over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators and several protesters were arrested.

A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

In a televised address on Monday following a Cabinet meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused CHP chairman Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order.

The Turkish opposition staged a rally outside Istanbul City Hall on Monday evening in support of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Thousands of protesters held flags and placards and chanted slogans.

ISTANBUL (AP) — A media union said Turkish authorities arrested several journalists at their homes in a crackdown Monday, amid growing protests over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

The Disk-Basin-Is media workers' union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people's right to learn the truth.” It called for their immediate release.

The social media platform X said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organizations, journalists and political figures in Turkey.




A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized.

“Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Yerlikaya said on social media.

The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organizations and others had criminal records.

Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor. There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday. He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness.

“I'm working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said.

The mayor's jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.

The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.” The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.

In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan accused the opposition party's chairman Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order instead of addressing the alleged corruption. He also said he would be held to account for the protests.

“I have made this call several times before, and today I am repeating it: Stop disturbing our citizens' peace with provocations. If you have the courage, account for the corruption, theft, bribes taken, and irregularities committed,” Erdogan said.

Erdogan said: “of course, there will be political accountability for these actions in parliament and legal accountability in court.”

Addressing demonstrators outside city hall for a sixth consecutive night, Ozel urged supporters to boycott a number of pro-government companies and television stations. He also challenged Erdogan and the Istanbul chief public prosecutor to broadcast Imamoglu's trial live on state television, to allow the jailed mayor to respond to the allegations and “expose their lies.”

About 15 minutes after Ozel addressed the crowd, police intervened with tear gas and plastic pellets to disperse the demonstrators.

Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said.

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.

Thousands of protesters rallied outside Istanbul's city hall to voice anger over what they see as a crackdown on democratic freedoms. Tensions remained high as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas minutes after opposition leader Ozel's daily address concluded.

Protesters, many young and masked to avoid identification, hurled harsh words to the police and Erdogan and booed those in their ranks who threw bottles and flares at security forces to avoid elevated violence akin to Sunday's police interventions.

“I think it can't get any worse than this,” said one female demonstrator who did not want to be named due to fear of detention. “We will never accept this. If necessary, I will come every day.”

Others echoed her sentiment. “There is a coup against our democracy right now,” said an older male protester who also wished to remain anonymous. “We are here for our children, for the youth. We want them to be free so this country can be more beautiful.”

Several protesters said their aim was not to support specific politicians but to stand up for the Turkish Republic. 

“I would like to say my name, but I cannot,” one man said. “The reason I came here is not Ozel or Imamoglu. I came here to defend my own rights as the youth of Ataturk (founder of the Turkish Republic).

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 43 protesters were detained Monday, and condemned what he called “vile insults” toward Erdogan and his late mother, vowing not to tolerate “such indecency.”

Ali Mahir Basarir, a legislator from the main opposition Republican People's Party, told the AP that the authorities used “pre-determined provocateurs” to justify crackdowns. 

“They start attacking the protesters before the rally is over,” he said. “All they want is a good future. They are exercising their constitutional rights.” and urged the police to not mistreat protesters.

Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara's mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said Monday. 

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

Sixty-five people, including 14 children, were injured in a Russian strike on Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy, according to the regional prosecutor's office. The strike damaged several residential buildings and a school on Monday afternoon.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday commented on the talks between the US and Russia, who he referred to as “the war team”, in Saudi Arabia.

Russian troops launched a missile strike Monday afternoon in Sumy city center, hitting residential buildings and a school. Children at the school were being evacuated, and all were safe, said regional head Volodymyr Artiukh.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. negotiators worked on a proposed partial ceasefire in the 3-year-old war in Ukraine on Monday, meeting representatives from Russia one day after holding separate talks with a team from Kyiv.



It has been a struggle to reach even a limited, 30-day ceasefire — which Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week -- with both sides continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.



One major sticking point is what targets would be off-limits to strike, even after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, because the parties disagree.



While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would also like to see infrastructure like railways and ports protected.

Talks Monday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh were expected to address some of those differences, as well as a potential pause in attacks in the Black Sea to ensure the safety of commercial shipping. Russian state media reported late Monday local time that the talks had ended.





AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on US-Russia officials holding talks right now in Saudi Arabia on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine.







In an exchange with reporters at the White House, Trump said territorial lines and the potential for U.S. ownership of a key nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine have been part of the talks.



Last week, Trump floated the idea of the U.S. taking control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The six-reactor facility — one of the world's largest — was seized by Russia early in the war.

(Iryna Rybakova/Ukraine's 93rd Mechanized Brigade via AP)





“Some people are saying the United States should own the power plant — work it that way because we have the expertise” to get the plant operating, Trump said. “Something like that would be fine with me.”



Since falling under Russian control, the plant's conditions have deteriorated. While its reactors have been shut down for years, they still require power and staff to maintain cooling systems and safety features. The facility is connected to Ukraine's energy grid without producing electricity.



U.S. and Russian representatives met in the morning in Riyadh, Russia's state Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The U.S. and Ukrainian teams met Sunday. 



Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, said the delegation remained in Riyadh on Monday and expected to meet again with the Americans. In his nightly address Monday, Zelenskyy said representatives from Ukraine and the U.S. will meet again, although he did not specify when.



Grigory Karasin, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house and a participant in Monday's talks, told the Interfax news agency the negotiations were going on in a “creative way” and that the U.S. and Russian delegations “understand each other's views.”



Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine continued to launch attacks across their borders.



The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday a Ukrainian drone attacked an oil pumping station in southern Russia that serves a pipeline carrying Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea oil to the Russian port of Novorossiisk for export. It said the drone was downed before it could reach the pumping station.



Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday the Russian military has been fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days. He has accused Ukraine of derailing the partial ceasefire with attacks on Russia's energy facilities, including a gas metering station in Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region.



Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station, a claim Peskov called “absurd.”



Zelenskyy said Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this.”



He added that Ukraine's partners — “the U.S., Europe, and others around the world” — should increase pressure on Russia “to stop this terror.”

Zelenskyy has emphasized that Ukraine is open to Trump's proposal of a full, 30-day ceasefire. Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.



Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at talks and that a pause in hostilities by both countries in the Black Sea would “naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”



Asked about reports speculating that China might send peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any peace deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded Monday with an unequivocal no. 



“Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent,” Guo said at a briefing. 



China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but has not given any weapons or sent any personnel. China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.



A “massive targeted cyberattack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company wrote on Telegram, adding that it was working to restore its systems on Monday. The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules but disrupted its online booking system.



“The railway continues to operate despite physical attacks on the infrastructure, and even the most vile cyberattacks cannot stop it,” the company wrote.



Meanwhile, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces claimed Monday it destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with the use of U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems. It published drone footage on its Telegram page of what it said was the attack.



The strikes occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces, the group said.



A Russian missile struck the northern city of Sumy, across the border from Russia's Kursk region, hitting residential buildings and a school, said regional head Volodymyr Artiukh. Children at the school were being evacuated at the time, and all were safe, he added.



But the regional prosecutor's office said 65 people were injured, including 14 children.



Earlier, Russia fired 99 attack and decoy drones into Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's air force, of which 57 were shot down.





Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.

PARIS (AP) — French actor Gérard Depardieu went on trial Monday in Paris on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a movie set, in a case seen as a potential watershed for the #MeToo movement in France.

Depardieu, 76, is accused of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during filming in 2021 of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”). 

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.

Depardieu denies any wrongdoing.

To reporters massed outside the courtroom, he briefly said “I'm ok.” Inside, he told the judges that he was prepared to answer the court's questions.

“We will be able to show in an impartial, objective and incontestable manner that all of the accusations are lies,” his attorney, Jérémie Assous, told journalists.

“The truth will be obvious and the truth is on our side,” he said.

Depardieu's long and storied career has turned the trial into a post- #MeToo test of the willingness of France and its movie industry to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.

Depardieu has been a darling of French cinemagoers for decades and was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.

But his alleged boorish behavior off-screen has also long made headlines. He has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some others were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.




Feminist and historian Florence Montreynaud described Depardieu's court appearance as “a historic moment” for women's rights, as she joined other campaigners who demonstrated outside the court. A dozen chanted “Sexist violence, complicit judicial system” as they danced to techno music.

“Times are changing. #MeToo has swept through. At last, mentalities are changing,” Montreynaud said to French broadcaster BFMTV.

The trial also follows in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gisèle Pelicot, whose bravery put the spotlight on sexual violence in France. She demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for a horrific catalogue of abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would help make shame change sides.

France has often been ambivalent — even resistant — toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.

At the time of the alleged assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024, prosecutors requested that it go to trial.

Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped the set dresser with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. She says the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.

The assistant director alleged that Depardieu groped her both on set and in the street.

The women sat side by side in court. The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified. Neither has done so in this case.

The trial is expected to last at least two days, but could be extended beyond Tuesday, if the chief judge wants more time. The trial was initially scheduled for October, but then postponed because of Depardieu's health. A verdict is expected at a later date. 

Depardieu grasped his lawyer's shoulder as he strode calmly into the courtroom. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he's fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don't exceed six hours, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours.

Beyond giving his name, Depardieu didn't testify Monday. Instead, his lawyer took up much of the time, raising what he described as legal issues and seeking to cast doubt on witness testimony and the police investigation. The attorney alleged, without providing evidence, that police acted under instructions from magistrates who led the investigation to “make Depardieu fall.”

Depardieu listened intently, sometimes nodding.

One of the plaintiffs burst into tears when her lawyer read a message she wrote about the alleged sexual assault. Sitting by her side, the other accuser put a hand on her shoulder in a gesture of empathy.

The plaintiffs' lawyers said they would lay out their evidence later.

One of the lawyers, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said Depardieu had apologized to her client at the time. “So why apologize if you haven't done anything?” 

It was unclear what the apology message was about.

Durrieu Diebolt had previously said that four additional women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Depardieu would testify.

In an open letter published in October 2023, Depardieu wrote: “Never, but never, have I abused a woman.”

The actor had dropped out of sight in recent months, his film career seemingly on hold. But he still has friends in the industry. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's government on Monday apologized to families of victims of the country's military dictatorship whose remains could be among those found in a clandestine mass grave 35 years ago. 

Dozens of families are still waiting to know whether their parents, children, siblings and friends are in one of more than 1,000 blue bags discovered in 1990 in a ditch in a São Paulo cemetery in the isolated district of Perus. That was the first of many mass graves uncovered by Brazil's authorities after the end of the 21-year military rule in 1985.

The clandestine grave at the Dom Bosco cemetery also contained remains of several unidentified people who were not linked to the fight against Brazil's dictatorship. 

The official apology is part of a deal between prosecutors, family members and the State. It took place during Right to Truth Day, which is also celebrated in other countries.

Human Rights Minister Macaé Evaristo said the Brazilian State was neglectful in the identification process of the bags and bones found in Perus. For almost 25 years, the remains were held by three state universities and laboratories outside Brazil, but only a handful of families finally had their loved ones identified.

Evaristo said Brazil's government has invested about 200,000 Brazilian reais ($35,000) each year for the identification of bags from Perus, but agreed that is not enough to give peace to families of victims.




“What the Brazilian government has been doing is continuing the process of seeking investigation and accountability. We need to remember that our ministry was dismantled,” Evaristo said, in a reference to the 2019-22 presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, an advocate of the country's military dictatorship. “Families have the right to the truth. Brazilian society has the right to the truth.”

Families uncertain if their loved ones' remains were in the Perus mass grave attended the ceremony.

Gilberto Molina, who represented them, had his brother Flávio's remains finally identified in one of the bags in 2005. The Brazilian State only recognized it was responsible for the crime in his brother's third death certificate, early in 2019.

“It was a funeral of almost 50 years. For some other families it still is an even longer one,” Molina said. “I hope that every family here still has perseverance in their quest for justice.”

Brazil's truth commission in 2014 reported that at least 434 people were killed and more than 100 disappeared completely during the country's military dictatorship. The disappearance of former lawmaker Rubens Paiva, as portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film “I'm Still Here” renewed public interest in the dictatorship's abuses, attracting an audience of more than 6 million in Brazil.

Nilmário Miranda, a former government minister and long-time human rights activist, said uncovering a mass grave with victims of the dictatorship in 1990 — only a few years after redemocratization — was a major affair led by then Sao Paulo Mayor Luiza Erundina. Faced with anonymous death threats, she put City Hall officers to oversee the searches.

“It was all under the rug of society, it was all hidden and you couldn't speak about it. That put the deal that ended the dictatorship in check, the one that spared torturers and executioners,” Miranda said, in a reference to Brazil's 1979 amnesty law that didn't punish crimes of the military during the regime.

That law could soon be partially reversed by Brazil's Supreme Court in cases of people who were killed then by state agents and had their remains vanished.

Antonio Pires Eustáquio, who became a manager at the Dom Bosco cemetery in 1976 and helped families in their quest for justice for decades, celebrated the apology.

“This can only happen in a democracy. Dictators don't apologize for their mistakes,” Eustáquio said. “I remember that at that time people always wondered whether I was going to be killed for I knew where the illegal ditch was. My being here means democracy won.”

But Crimeia Almeida, whose husband, her father-in-law and a brother-in-law went missing as guerrilla men about 50 years ago, said the state's apology is not enough.

“The apology is not enough. It is nice, we get emotional, but it doesn't solve the criminal act,” she said.

CAIRO (AP) — When the first explosions in Gaza this week started around 1:30 a.m., a visiting British doctor went to the balcony of a hospital in Khan Younis and watched the streaks of missiles light up the night before pounding the city. A Palestinian surgeon next to him gasped, “Oh no. Oh no.”

After two months of ceasefire, the horror of Israeli bombardment was back. The veteran surgeon told the visiting doctor, Sakib Rokadiya, they'd better head to the emergency ward.

Torn bodies soon streamed in, carried by ambulances, donkey carts or in the arms of terrified relatives. What stunned doctors was the number of children.

“Just child after child, young patient after young patient,” Rokadiya said. “The vast, vast majority were women, children, the elderly.”

This was the start of a chaotic 24 hours at Nasser Hospital, the largest hospital in southern Gaza. Israel shattered the ceasefire in place since mid-January with a surprise barrage that began early Tuesday and was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and accepting changes in the truce's terms. It turned into one of the deadliest days in the 17-month war.

The aerial attacks killed 409 people across Gaza, including 173 children and 88 women, and hundreds more were wounded, according to the territory's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between militants and civilians.

More than 300 casualties flooded into Nasser Hospital. Like other medical facilities around Gaza, it had been damaged by Israeli raids and strikes throughout the war, leaving it without key equipment. It was also running short on antibiotics and other essentials. On March 2, when the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire technically expired, Israel blocked entry of medicine, food and other supplies to Gaza.

Nasser Hospital's emergency ward filled with wounded, in a scene described to The Associated Press by Rokadiya and Tanya Haj-Hassan, an American pediatrician — both volunteers with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. Wounded came from a tent camp sheltering displaced that missiles set ablaze and from homes struck in Khan Younis and Rafah, further south. 

One nurse was trying to resuscitate a boy sprawled on the floor with shrapnel in his heart. A young man with most of his arm gone sat nearby, shivering. A barefoot boy carried in his younger brother, around 4 years old, whose foot had been blown off. Blood was everywhere on the floor, with bits of bone and tissue.

“I was overwhelmed, running from corner to corner, trying to find out who to prioritize, who to send to the operating room, who to declare a case that's not salvageable,” said Haj-Hassan.

“It's a very difficult decision, and we had to make it multiple times,” she said in a voice message.

Wounds could be easy to miss. One little girl seemed OK – it just hurt a bit when she breathed, she told Haj-Hassan -- but when they undressed her they determined she was bleeding into her lungs. Looking through the curly hair of another girl, Haj-Hassan discovered she had shrapnel in her brain.

Two or three wounded at a time were squeezed onto gurneys and sped off to surgery, Rokadiya said.

He scrawled notes on slips of paper or directly on the patient's skin – this one to surgery, this one for a scan. He wrote names when he could, but many kids were brought in by strangers, their parents dead, wounded or lost in the mayhem. So he often wrote, “UNKNOWN.”

Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, an American trauma surgeon from California with the medical charity MedGlobal, rushed immediately to the area where the hospital put the worst-off patients still deemed possible to save.

But the very first little girl he saw -- 3 or 4 years old -- was too far gone. Her face was mangled by shrapnel. “She was technically still alive,” Sidhwa said, but with so many other casualties “there was nothing we could do.”

He told the girl's father she was going to die. Sidhwa went on to do some 15 operations, one after another.

Khaled Alserr, a Palestinian surgeon, and an Irish volunteer surgeon were doing the same. There was a 29-year-old woman whose pelvis was smashed, the webbing of veins around the bones was bleeding heavily. They did what they could in surgery, but she died 10 hours later in the intensive care unit.

There was a 6-year-old boy with two holes in his heart, two in his colon and three more in his stomach, Sidhwa said. They repaired the holes and restarted his heart after he went into cardiac arrest.

He, too, died hours later.

“They died because the ICU simply does not have the capacity to care for them,” Sidhwa said.

Ahmed al-Farra, head of the pediatric and obstetrics department, said that was in part because the ICU lacks strong antibiotics. 

Sidhwa recalled how he was at Boston Medical Center when the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing happened, killing three people and sending some 260 wounded to area hospitals.

Boston Medical “couldn't handle this influx of cases” seen at Nasser Hospital, he said. 

Rokadiya marveled at how the hospital staff took care of each other under duress. Workers circulated with water to give sips to doctors and nurses. Cleaners whisked away the bloody clothes, blankets, tissues and medical debris accumulating on the floors.

At the same time, some staff had their own family members killed in the strikes. 

Alserr, the Palestinian surgeon, had to go to the morgue to identify the bodies of his wife's father and brother.

“The only thing I saw was like a packet of meat and bones, melted and fractured,” he said in a voice message, without giving details on the circumstances their deaths. 

Another staffer lost his wife and kids. An anesthesiologist -- whose mother and 21 other relatives were killed earlier in the war -- later learned his father, his brother and a cousin were killed, Haj-Hassan said.

Around 85 people died at Nasser Hospital on Tuesday, including around 40 children from ages 1 to 17, al-Farra said.

Strikes continued throughout the week, killing several dozen more people. At least six prominent Hamas figures were among those killed Tuesday. 

Israel says it will keep targeting Hamas, demanding it release more hostages, even though Israel has ignored ceasefire requirements for it to first negotiate a long-term end to the war. Israel says it does not target civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because it operates among the population.

With Tuesday's bombardment, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also secured the return to his government of a right-wing party that had demanded a resumption of the war, solidifying his coalition ahead of a crucial budget vote that could have brought him down.

Haj-Hassan keeps checking in on children in Nasser's ICU. The girl with shrapnel in her brain still can't move her right side. Her mother came to see her, limping from her own wounds, and told Haj-Hassan that the little girl's sisters had been killed.

“I cannot process or comprehend the scale of mass killing and massacre of families in their sleep that we are seeing here,” Haj-Hassan said. “This can't be the world we're living in.”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top U.N. official in the world's youngest nation warned on Monday, lamenting the government's sudden postponement of the latest peace effort.

Calling the situation unfolding in the country “dire,” Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage “and put the interests of their people ahead of their own.”

There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.

More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 — and again until 2026.

The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.

Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar's home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.




Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating “particularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.”

He said Kiir and Machar don't trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.

“Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,” Haysom said.

“Given this grim situation,” he said, “we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.”

Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.

He said the U.N. takes the threat of the “ethnic transformation” of the conflict very seriously.

To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.

Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions “through dialogue rather than military confrontation.”

This story has corrected the war toll to 400,000, not 40,000.

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The leader of the rebels who captured two key cities in eastern Congo tells The Associated Press that international sanctions and Congo's proposed minerals deal with the United States in search of peace will not stop the fighting. 

Meanwhile, neighboring countries announced a broader peace facilitation team to seek a resolution to the conflict.

With a $5 million bounty placed on the rebel leaders by Congo's government, “we will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,” said Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group.

Nangaa dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's comments last week that his country — whose mineral resources are estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world's technology — is looking for a minerals partnership with the U.S.

The U.S. government has not publicly spoken about any such deal, which local observers say could be similar to the Trump administration's recent offer to Ukraine to help end the war with Russia.

“This problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,” Nangaa told the AP over the weekend. “Trying to bribe U.S. with mines can undermine U.S. credibility.”

The rebel leader also rejected the outcome of last week's meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without his group's involvement would fail. He said the rebels can only have a dialogue with Congo's government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict.




“Anything regarding us which are done without us, it's against us,” Nangaa said.

Since launching a major escalation of their decadelong fighting with Congolese forces in January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, prompting fears of regional war involving neighbors whose militaries are also on the ground.

Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out of talks facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders. After Angola's president and chairperson of the African Union, Joao Lourenco, withdrew as the key mediator on Monday, southern and eastern African leaders announced at a joint summit that a panel of five former African presidents to help seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

The panel will appoint a mediator to replace the Angolan leader, the president's office in Congo said Tuesday in a statement posted on X.

Also Monday, the M23 rebels said their planned withdrawal from the strategic town of Walikale, which they captured last week, is delayed because Congolese forces are allegedly still positioned in the area with attack drones. M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said their presence “compromises” peace initiatives. The AP has reached out to Congo's military.

Holding Walikale gives the rebels control of a road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions.

The M23 is the most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in eastern Congo. It is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.

Although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 forces from neighboring Rwanda supporting the rebels in Congo, Nangaa asserted that the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address “the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country.”

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In the latest twist in South Korea's ongoing political crisis, the country's Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago.

The court's ruling on Monday marks just one front in the deepening turmoil as it simultaneously weighs the far more consequential case of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose December impeachment over his brief but stunning martial law decree has left the country's leadership in limbo for months.

Here's a look at the court's decision and what's ahead: 

The prime minister typically holds limited authority as the country's second-highest official. But Han, a career bureaucrat who has held various government roles since the 1970s, was elevated as the government's caretaker after South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14.

Yoon's impeachment, triggered by his short-lived imposition of martial law that month, immediately suspended his presidential powers and put his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.

As acting president, Han quickly clashed with the liberal opposition Democratic Party, mainly over his refusal to comply with their demand to immediately fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench.




The composition of the court is a sensitive issue since removing Yoon from office requires the support of at least six justices, and a full bench would likely increase the chances of his ouster. Han said he wouldn't appoint the justices without bipartisan consent, but the Democrats accused him of siding with the conservatives in the governing People Power Party, which has been campaigning for Yoon's return to power.

Days after lawmakers impeached Han on Dec. 27, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who stepped in as acting president, filled two of the court's vacancies but refused to appoint a progressive justice nominated by the opposition.

Seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment, ruling that the accusations against him were either not illegal, not serious enough to warrant his removal or that the impeachment motion had failed to meet the required quorum when it passed through the National Assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.

After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies.

Han's case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. Han played no meaningful role in planning or enforcing Yoon's martial law, which was lifted by a legislative vote just hours after Yoon declared it on the night of Dec. 3.

But Han's reinstatement still struck a nerve with the Democrats, who have recently criticized the court for its prolonged deliberation on Yoon's case, which has fueled concerns about a divide among justices, potentially paving the way for Yoon's return.

Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, questioned why the court didn't consider Han's refusal to appoint the justices an impeachable offense. He said Han's actions amounted to a “clear and deliberate violation of his constitutional duty to form a government body.”

Lee also called for the court to make a swift decision on Yoon.

Yoon's office issued a statement welcoming Han's reinstatement, asserting that the court's decision proved the opposition's “excessive impeachment attempts were reckless, malicious, and politically motivated.”

Yoon, who is also facing a separate criminal trial on rebellion charges, stands accused of abusing military power, bypassing constitutional and legal protocols to impose martial law, and orchestrating a failed attempt to dissolve the legislature. But the Constitutional Court likely won't take a deep dive into Yoon's criminal allegations, as it's only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office.

Some experts say Han's testimony before lawmakers, investigators and the court regarding the short-lived martial law decree could possibly influence how justices rule on Yoon's case.

Among the various accusations against Yoon, the National Assembly has alleged that he bypassed a constitutional requirement to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Han's testimony has seemingly supported these claims.

While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation.

Han and other top officials, including Choi and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, have said they attempted to talk Yoon out of martial law, citing potential damage to the country's international reputation and economy. Under South Korea's constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.

U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country into Monday, with the group saying the one attack in the capital killed at least one person and wounded more than a dozen others.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country into early Tuesday, with the group saying one attack in the capital killed at least two people and wounded more than a dozen others.

The American strikes on the rebels, who threaten maritime trade and Israel, entered their 10th day without any sign of stopping. They are part of a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump targeting the rebel group while also trying to pressure Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor. 

So far, the U.S. has not offered any specifics on the sites it is striking, though Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the attacks have “taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer.” That's something so far that's not been acknowledged by the Houthis, though the rebels have downplayed their losses in the past and exaggerated their attacks attempting to target American warships.

“We've hit their headquarters,” Waltz told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “We've hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.” 

An apparent U.S. strike Sunday hit a building in a western neighborhood of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least two people and wounding 13 others, the rebel-controlled SABA news agency said, citing health officials. Footage released by the rebels showed the rubble of a collapsed building and pools of blood staining the gray dust covering the ground. 

AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on the U.S. firing on Yemen's capital as its campaign against the Houthi rebels continues.




A building next to the collapsed structure still stood, suggesting American forces likely used a lower-yield warhead in the strike. 

The Houthis also described American airstrikes targeting sites around the city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and Marib province, home to oil and gas fields still under the control of allies to Yemen's exiled central government. Those strikes continued into early Tuesday as the Houthis separately launched a missile attack on Israel.

The campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people immediately after they began March 15, started after the Houthis threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.

The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.

The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

South Korean firefighters on Tuesday appeared closer to containing the largest wildfires in the country's southeastern regions, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land across the country in the past five days.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.

Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days. 

Officials in Andong, a city in the country's southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters — including schools and indoor gyms — as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries. 

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple's national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.

The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.




More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.

The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest “serious” level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country's southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.

Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts. 

Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country's acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.

Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.

        Senior figures have expressed disbelief and outrage after a journalist revealed that he was sent sensitive information about military strikes in Yemen.
    

Senior figures in the Democratic party have called for the resignation of US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after he sent war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a Signal group chat that included a journalist.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that the material shared ""contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing"". 

The US National Security Council stated that the text chain ""appears to be authentic"". 

Two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on 15 March, the US launched a wave of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. 

The revelation, with its clear implications for national security, has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and political circles, and many have called for investigations into how the blunder came about, while others have called for disciplinary action.

The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, led calls for Hegseth's resignation, calling for him to ""be fired"" if he did not quit. In his statement, Martin blasted Hegseth as ""unfit to lead the Defence Department even before he risked our national security"". 

""Hegseth should resign, and if he doesn't resign, he should be fired. It's crystal clear that our men and women in uniform deserve better – and that our national security cannot be left in Hegseth's incompetent and unqualified hands,"" Martin added.

Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the leak on a non-classified system as ""completely outrageous and shocks the conscience"", adding that it shows that Americans are increasingly angry ""due to the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defence.""

In his statement, Jeffries called for House Republicans to join Democrats ""in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach.” Separately, Jeffries told reporters that Hegseth ""has got to be the most unqualified person ever to lead the Pentagon in American history"".

Stressing the gravity of the situation in a floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: “This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time."" 

He underlined that using encrypted instant messaging service Signal, rather than government communications channels, was even more concerning than the leak to The Atlantic.

""It's bad enough that a private citizen was added to this chain, but it's far worse that sensitive military information was exchanged on an unauthorised application,"" Schumer explained.

It has also drawn reaction from former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose use of a private server for classified emails while Secretary of State became a major scandal during her 2016 campaign, with President Donald Trump repeatedly returning to the issue. 

“You have got to be kidding me,” Clinton responded in a post on X while sharing the eyes emoji and The Atlantic article.

Reaction from Republicans appeared more mixed, with many seeking to downplay the incident. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana was among those offering a lukewarm response. 

“A mistake was made. It happens,” Kennedy told media. Other figures in the party recognised the blunder, but refused to call for repercussions for those involved.

But Senate Armed Services Committee Chair, Roger Wicker, was among those telling reporters that ""mistakes were made"". 

“We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis,” the Mississippi Republican senator said, adding that the panel “definitely” plans to investigate the situation. 

Meanwhile, The Hill reported that Republican Senator John Cornyn, of Texas, a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters at the Capitol on Monday the inclusion of a journalist in the chat was “a huge screwup"".

“I mean, is there any other way to describe it,"" he added.

        Ekrem Imamoglu, who was set to be Erdogan's main rival in the 2028 election, was formally arrested and charged with corruption.
    

Tens of thousands of Turkish opposition protesters staged a rally outside Istanbul City Hall on Monday evening in support of the jailed Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The demonstrators waved flags and placards and chanted slogans while clashes between protesters and the police occurred. Several protestors were detained, and police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. 

Imamoglu was formally arrested by a court on Sunday and jailed pending trial on corruption charges, which further triggered the enormous protests on Monday night.

It followed an earlier detention last week, which sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations across Turkey, not seen in more than a decade.

According to the prosecutor's office, the Istanbul mayor was jailed for operating a criminal organisation, collecting bribes, indulging in extortion, unlawfully recording personal information, and bid-rigging.  

He is still being prosecuted, but a request to put him in jail on terror-related charges was denied.

The opposition and some government officials reject the accusations against him and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently. 

Meanwhile, in a televised address on Monday and following a Cabinet meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the opposition party CHP chairman, Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order.

“I have made this call several times before, and today I am repeating it: Stop disturbing our citizens' peace with provocations,” Erdogan said. He also suggested Ozel would be held to account for the protests.

""Of course, there will be political accountability for these actions in parliament and legal accountability in court.""

Ozel is the head of the Republican People's Party, or CHP, to which Imamoglu belongs.

Imamoglu's imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major contender who could most likely defeat Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. 

“If you weren't here today if you hadn't rushed here since the first day, if you had yielded to tear gas and barricades, if you had gotten scared and remained at home, then today a caretaker appointed by Tayyip Erdogan would be residing here in this building,” said Ozgur Ozel Sunday night, pointing at city hall as he spoke to the massive crowd chanting anti-government slogans. 

Imamoglu is arguably the second most prominent politician in Turkey behind Erdogan, serving as mayor of the 16 million economic and cultural capital of the country.

        The foiled attack came as the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas paid a visit to Israel and the occupied Bank on Monday, where she met with both Israeli and Palestinian officials.
    

The Israeli military on Monday said it intercepted a long-range missile launched from Yemen over Jerusalem, triggering air raid sirens and explosions over the city. 

Local officials said they believed the missile to be from Houthi rebels in Yemen, where a handful of long-range missiles have been fired from in recent days following the resumption of war in Gaza by Israeli forces. 

There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis. 

The foiled attack came as the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas paid a visit to Israel and met with the Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa in the West Bank on Monday.

Kallas, who met with both Israeli and Palestinian officials, conveyed the EU message, saying the bloc ""strongly opposes the resumption of war,"" which is ""causing an appalling and unacceptable loss of life in Gaza.""

""My message(s) during my visit here are very clear. Hamas must release all hostages. Israel must fully reinstate humanitarian aid to Gaza, and negotiations must resume,"" Kallas said at a press conference with the Palestinian Prime Minister in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

""We cannot remain silent about the grave violations of international law and rights of the Palestinian people,"" Mohammad Mustafa, the Palestinian Prime Minister, said.

According to Gaza's health ministry, more than 50,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the Israel-Hamas war after hundreds more deaths were added to the casualty toll following Israel's resumption of hostilities last week in its surprise wave of airstrikes. 

Israel blames Hamas for refusing to release the remaining hostages following the completion of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.

The January ceasefire put an end to over a year of fighting that had been sparked by Hamas' 7 October, 2023, onslaught on Israel, in which militants murdered about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured 251 others.

The majority of hostages were released in the first months following the Gaza war, while approximately 2,000 Palestinian detainees were exchanged for 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in January's truce deal. 

Hundreds of thousands of Gaza residents were permitted to return home by Israeli forces. 

The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the ceasefire's next phase. However, those talks, which called for Hamas to free the remaining 59 hostages in exchange for more Palestinian captives, a permanent ceasefire, and an Israeli departure, never began. 

35 of those hostages are believed to be dead.

        The head of the peacekeeping mission in the country said President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar must put the interests of the South Sudanese people first.
    

The top UN official in South Sudan has warned the country is on the brink of a renewed civil war after the government abruptly postponed the latest round of peace efforts.

Describing the situation as “dire”, Nicholas Haysom, the UN Special Representative and head of the peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, said on Monday that international efforts to support peace will only succeed if President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar are prepared to engage constructively and “put the interests of their people ahead of their own”.

South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, gained independence from Sudan in 2011, following decades of conflict. But by 2013, it descended into a civil war rooted in ethnic divisions, as forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, clashed with supporters of Machar, a Nuer.

The conflict claimed the lives of more than 400,000 people before a peace agreement establishing a unity government was signed in 2018. While elections were initially set for 2023, they have been postponed twice, and are now expected in 2026.

Recent tensions have flared in the north of the country, where government troops have been fighting a militia known as the White Army — widely believed to be aligned with Machar.

On 4 March, the White Army reportedly overran a military garrison in Nasir, prompting a forceful government response, including the surrounding of Machar's residence in the capital, Juba and the arrest of several of his allies. 

Days later, a UN helicopter evacuating government soldiers from Nasir came under fire, resulting in multiple fatalities, among them a South Sudanese general.

Haysom warned that tensions and violence are escalating as the elections approach, and that political competition between longtime rivals Kiir and Machar is intensifying.

He also noted that Kiir and Machar do not have sufficient trust in one another to demonstrate the leadership necessary to enforce the 2018 peace accord and steer South Sudan towards a secure and democratic path forward. 

“Given this grim situation, we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war,” Haysom added.

A return to conflict, he said, would risk repeating the horrors of 2013 and 2016, when violence devastated communities and displaced millions.

To help de-escalate the crisis, the UN peacekeeping mission, which has nearly 18,000 personnel, is engaged in intensive shuttle diplomacy with international and regional stakeholders, including the African Union.

The unified message, Haysom said, is for Kiir and Machar to meet, recommit to the 2018 peace deal, uphold the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve disputes “through dialogue rather than military confrontation.”

Ukraine is looking for thousands of new soldiers, including 18-year-olds, for its fourth year of resisting Russia's invasion. 

A network of enlistment centres has been set up, offering on-demand sign-ups and a new one-year contract for young recruits.

In Donbas, volunteers undergo intensive training. Many are over 40 and have held a gun for just two weeks. ""Protecting our country is the only thing we can do,"" says Natalia, 50, a mother of three from Sumy.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        Rwanda has rejected Ndayishimiye's words as ""surprising"" and said there was no plan to spark conflict in Burundi.
    

The president of Burundi has claimed that neighbouring Rwanda is planning to foment a conflict in his country, warning that it is backing a rebel group in an effort to destabilise its neighbour, citing ""credible intelligence"".

In an interview with the BBC, President Évariste Ndayishimiye claimed that Rwanda's plan resembled what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where a long-established paramilitary rebel group, M23, has swept through key parts of the country in an effort to seize control.

The group is widely thought to be supported by Rwanda, which denies taking any direct role in the conflict.

In his interview, Ndayishimiye claimed that the Rwandan government intended to first trigger instability and then claim it had started without external involvement.

""They would say it's an internal problem when it's Rwanda (who is) the problem,"" he said of the government led by his counterpart, President Paul Kagame. ""We know that he has a plan to attack Burundi. Burundians will not accept to be killed as Congolese are being killed. Burundian people are fighters.""

Ndayishimiye also accused Rwanda of fomenting a failed coup in Burundi in 2015, but said he had no intention of going to war.

""We don't have any plans to attack Rwanda,"" he said. ""We want to resolve that problem by dialogue.

""We are calling on our neighbours to respect the peace agreements we have made. There is no need for us to go to war. We want dialogue, but we will not sit idle if we are attacked. We don't have anything to ask (of) Rwanda, but they refuse because they have a bad plan — they wanted to do what they're doing in the DRC.""

Ndayishimiye has not provided any evidence for his claims. Rwanda has rejected Ndayishimiye's words as ""surprising"" and said there was no plan to spark conflict in Burundi.

The government in Kigali has also denied links to rebel groups in Burundi and insists the two countries are cooperating to secure their border.

Meanwhile, Burundi is seeing its largest influx of refugees in decades as tens of thousands of people flee the fighting in the eastern area of DRC.

According to the UN World Food Program (WFP), as Congolese government troops fight Rwanda-backed rebels who now hold two major cities, the number of registered refugees who need food assistance has doubled since January and now stands at 120,000. 

The decades-long conflict in eastern DRC escalated in January when the M23 rebel group seized the strategic city of Goma. The following month the group took the city of Bukavu, which lies less than 30 miles from the Burundi border.

The presidents of DRC and Rwanda met last week in Qatar for their first direct talks since the cities were seized.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region. The conflict has created one of the world's largest and longest-running humanitarian crises, displacing more than 7 million people displaced over the years.

Many of those displaced to neighbouring countries including Burundi have escaped lethal violence only to face serious food insecurity. WFP warned yesterday that its funds for operations in Burundi are “stretched to the limit” and likely will be exhausted in June. It said it might have to ""suspend food assistance entirely” from July or earlier.

        Moscow and Kyiv have struggled to reach even a limited 30-day ceasefire with both sides continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.
    

US negotiators on Monday held talks with representatives from Russia to push forward a proposed partial ceasefire in the three-year war in Ukraine. 

Moscow and Kyiv have struggled to reach the limited, 30-day ceasefire, which was agreed to in principle last week. 

Both sides have continued to attack each other with drones and missiles despite the agreement. 

On Monday evening, Ukrainian officials said children were among the casualties after a Russian missile attack injured 88 people in the Ukraine city of Sumy. 

“Every day like this, all the nights with Russian missiles and drones against our country, every day of the war means losses, pain and destruction that Ukraine never wanted,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his evening address. 

One major sticking point in negotiations is what targets are off-limits to strike.

US negotiators originally proposed a ceasefire on both ""energy and infrastructure"" however the Kremlin has declared the agreement should more narrowly cover simply ""energy infrastructure.""

Zelenskyy has declared he would also like to see infrastructure such as railways and ports protected. 

After the talks on Monday, US President Donald Trump said that territorial lines and potential US ownership of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine were part of discussions. 

“Some people are saying the United States should own the power plant — work it that way because we have the expertise” to get the plant operating, Trump said. “Something like that would be fine with me.”

The nuclear power plant — Europe's largest — has been under Russian control since the early days of the invasion. Zelenskyy has publicly rejected the concept of US firms owning Ukrainian power plants. 

The US is expected to move between Russia and Ukraine to finalise details of the ceasefire and also negotiate measures to ensure a separate ceasefire in the Black Sea. 

“We're not far away from that,” US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said of a permanent ceasefire during a podcast episode with Tucker Carlson over the weekend. 

He also claimed that within the four regions Moscow has claimed as under its control — Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia — the ""overwhelming majority of people have indicated they want to be under Russian rule"", despite referendums held in these provinces being slammed as illegitimate by the west. 

Grigory Karasin, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house and a participant in Monday's talks, told the Interfax news agency the negotiations were going on in a “creative way"" and that the US and Russian delegations “understand each other's views.”

Zelenskyy on Sunday evening said that ""since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this.”

On Monday, the Ukrainian leader said US and Ukraine representatives were set to meet again, although did not specify when.

        Criticism by Denmark's leader Mette Frederiksen comes after the White House announced a US delegation would be visiting the Arctic island.
    

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen criticised the US on Tuesday for putting ""unacceptable pressure"" on Greenland, ahead of an unsolicited visit to the Arctic island by members of the Trump administration. 

A delegation from Washington including Second Lady Usha Vance, wife of US Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright is set to visit semi-autonomous Danish territory from Thursday until Sunday.

""I have to say that it is unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark in this situation. And it is pressure that we will resist,"" Frederiksen told Danish media.

""You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.""

US President Donald Trump on Monday repeated his desire to take over Greenland, using national security as a justification. He said that the upcoming visit was about ""friendliness, not provocation"".

However, Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede on Monday called the visit ""highly aggressive"". He said that there would be no official meetings with the US representatives as the island has just held elections, with a new government yet to be formed. 

Egede, who will remain in his post until a new government convenes, wrote on Facebook that there was worry on the island over the visits. 

The ""only purpose"" of a trip by Waltz is ""a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood,"" Egede said. 

Frederiksen referred to Egede's comments in her interview on Tuesday, saying that it was ""clear that when you make a visit in this way, and the Greenlandic politicians clearly say that they do not want the visit, you cannot interpret it as respectful.""

“It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs, or what Greenland wants,” the Danish leader concluded. 

Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time US ally that has rejected Trump's overtures. Copenhagen has recognised the island's right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Last month, JD Vance blasted Denmark for ""not doing its job"" and ""not being a good ally"" by not countering the Chinese use of sea lanes in the region. 

""So you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?"" JD Vance told Fox News. ""If that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do.""

During the US delegation's visit to Greenland, Usha Vance and one of her three children will ""visit historic sites"" and ""learn about Greenlandic heritage"", according to her office. 

A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that it ""should not be a surprise"" that Waltz and Wright would visit ""a US Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground,"" referring to the US Pituffik military space base in northern Greenland.

        Second lady Usha Vance is set to travel to Greenland this week as Trump continues to suggest the US could take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.
    

US President Donald Trump on Monday insisted that second lady Usha Vance's planned visit to Greenland is about ""friendliness, not provocation.""

""This is friendliness and provocation. We're dealing with a lot of people from Greenland that would like to see something happen with respect to their being properly protected and properly taken care of,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting.

The wife of US Vice President JD Vance, Usha Vance, is set to travel to Greenland this week as Trump continues to suggest the US could take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.

Her office said Vance will leave on Thursday and return on Saturday.

Usha will be part of a US delegation set to “visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.”

Trump's conciliatory tone on Monday comes as Greenland's prime minister Múte Bourup Egede warned of “American aggression” and lamented a “mess” caused by the upcoming visit from Vance, who will be joined by Trump's national security adviser and energy secretary.

Trump claimed to have been receiving positive overtures from the island nation, although authorities there have clearly expressed concerns ahead of the visit.

Egede, who remains in the post as Greenland's prime minister until a new government is formed, acknowledged Sunday on Facebook that there is worry on the island.

The visit of “the wife of the United States vice president and the United States president's highest security adviser cannot be seen only as a private visit, ""he said. “We can already see now how big a mess it's caused.”

Egede said there would be no official meetings with the US visitors because a new government has yet to be formed.

He called on Greenland's allies to show support, adding that “the only purpose” of a trip by Waltz is “a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood.”

“We have been treated unacceptably,” he wrote on his Facebook account.

However, Demokraatit's Jens-Frederik Nielsen, the likely next Greenlandic leader, attempted to allay fears by announcing that he was forming a new coalition government ""with the clear goal of creating security for our country and our people.""

“When foreign dignitaries travel to our country on what are called private visits, it rightly causes concern,” he wrote on Facebook. “There is no reason to panic. But there is good reason to stand together and to demand respect. I do. And I will continue to do so.”

Greenland is a self-governing region of Denmark, and northwestern Greenland houses the US Pituffik military base that falls under the Pentagon's Space Force.

But Trump has repeatedly said that he thinks the US should take control of Greenland for strategic and national security purposes, something that has rattled NATO ally Denmark and the European Union.

California Attorney-General Rob Bonta has urged users of genetic testing company 23andMe to delete their personal data, warning them of potential risks if the company goes bankrupt, the New York Post reported on Sunday.“Given 23andMe's reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,” Bonta said in a statement on Friday.  According to the California Department of Justice, the state's Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA) allows users to delete their accounts and genetic data and request that any biological samples be destroyed.“In addition, GIPA permits California consumers to revoke consent that they provided a genetic testing company to collect, use, and disclose genetic data and to store biological samples after the initial testing has been completed,” the department noted on its website.

The breach, which occurred in October 2023, exposed the personal data of more than 6.9 million customers, including names, locations, birthdates, and family tree information. The data was then shared on an online forum used by cyber criminals, the Post reported.Once valued at over $320 per share in February 2021, the company's stock is now trading at under $2, the NYP reported.

Some great Israeli movies have been released during the past year and now these movies, along with some other wonderful films that will be released soon, will be playing on March 26 in theaters all over Israel for NIS 10. Among the most popular recent Israeli movies that will be shown will be Adir Miller's The Ring, the directorial debut of this beloved stand-up comedian, who also stars in this semi-autobiographical film about a man who goes to Budapest with his estranged daughter to try to reclaim his family's Holocaust legacy.Erez Tadmor's two latest movies are part of the program: Matchmaking 2, a funny but romantic look at dating in the ultra-Orthodox world, and Soda, a period drama starring Lior Raz of Fauda and Rotem Sela from A Body That Works, which tells the story of a former partisan living in Tel Aviv in the 1950s who meets a mysterious woman who may have been a Kapo in Auschwitz.  This has been a great year for women directors in Israel, and you can see Maya Kenig's The Milky Way, a dystopian comedy about a single mother who sells her breast milk to rich families; it's a highly original film that succeeds on every level. Maya Dreifuss's Highway 65 is a suspenseful, neo-noir police thriller starring Tali Sharon and Idan Amedi.Sophie Artus's Halisa tells the story of a nurse who works in a pediatric clinic in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood in Haifa. Veronica Kedar's Day Trippers is about an Israeli woman dealing with a crisis by getting high in Amsterdam with a young woman from England. Advertisement NELL BARLOW (left) and Naama Amit in ‘Day Trippers.' (credit: IDDO SOSKLONE)Unreleased filmsThis Israeli Cinema Day is also an opportunity to see movies that haven't been released yet. Nir Bergman's Pink Lady, which won an award for its director at the Black Nights Film Festival in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, tells the story of a haredi (ultra-Orthodox) couple struggling to deal with the husband's attraction to men, and will be included in the program.Anat Maltz's Real Estate: A Love Story, which won the Israeli Feature Film Competition this year at the Haifa International Film Festival, is about a young couple looking to leave trendy Tel Aviv and settle down in Haifa, who find their day of apartment hunting turns into a turbulent, stressful experience. As Iran is in the headlines daily, you might be interested in seeing Eran Riklis's latest film, Reading Lolita in Tehran. It is an adaptation of an Iranian literature professor's memoir, starring Golshifteh Farahani, who was in Riklis's Shelter, and Zar Amir Ebrahimi, who co-directed and acted in Tatami, the story of an Iranian judoka.This Israeli Cinema Day is in honor of the late actor/director Ze'ev Revach, who died in January at age 85. Considered to be one of the most influential and important figures in Israeli cinema, he won three Ophir Awards – the “Israeli Oscar” – two for Best Actor and one for Lifetime Achievement. Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar called him, “One of the greatest actors who grew up in Israel,” saying that “Revach gave us unforgettable moments, laughter and tears, and his legacy will continue to live on in the heart of Israeli culture.”

The IDF denied claims made on Monday by No Other Land Israeli co-director Yuval Abraham on X/Twitter that Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of the Academy Award-winning documentary, was taken from an ambulance by IDF soldiers.Abraham said that Ballal was beaten, bleeding, and wounded in his head and stomach. Abraham also added that Ballal had since disappeared and that it's ""unclear whether he is receiving medical treatment or what is happening to him.""The military reported that several terrorists had thrown rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles near Susya in the West Bank.  Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving ""mutual rock-throwing"" between Palestinians and Israelis at the scene.The IDF and Israel Police arrived to disperse the confrontation as several terrorists began throwing rocks at the security forces.

The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police. An Israeli citizen was injured in the incident and was evacuated to receive medical treatment. Contrary to claims, no Palestinian was apprehended from inside an ambulance, the military added.Abraham wrote on the social media platform in Hebrew and English.

In February 2025, Harvard's Center for American Political Studies published a poll showing that 46% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 in the United States supported Hamas – not the Palestinians, but Hamas. The same poll showed that 39% of this same demographic opposed the unconditional release of the Israeli hostages. How did we ever get to this situation?In an October 2024 poll of Americans, Pew Research found that “adults under the age or 30 are as likely to trust information from social media as they are to trust national media outlets.” A poll two months before found that 52% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 got their political news from TikTok and 50% of users of X said that they regularly get their “news” from that platform.   What is the “news” about Jews and Israel that the “under 30s” are seeing on social media?Nonprofit antisemitism monitoring platform Cyberwell reported in late 2024 that 11 months after the October 7 attacks there had been a “36% increase in online Jew-hatred” and a “doubling in outright calls to violence against Jews.” None of this is happening by chance. The speed of which antisemitic content is created, the consistency of the messaging and the specific targeting of younger people unambiguously reflects a well thought out and well managed social media strategy. One Palestinian advocate has called this coordinated effort the “Instafada: social media as resistance.” Another noted that its strategic use of “social media….. has empowered laypeople to coordinate, take to the streets in protest, build encampment protests on universities, initiate petitions and fundraisers, disrupt politicians, stop arms factories, and revive the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign (which has ultimately affected the profits of corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's).”  Hand using mobile smartphone with icon social media and social network. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)A perfect example of this strategy in action was the campaign launched by Hamas supporters denying that Israelis were sexually assaulted during the October 7 terrorist attacks. Despite the fact that Hamas live-streamed and shared videos of women being raped, there was a massive online campaign conducted last February and March by pro-Hamas influencers and activists calling the reported sexual assaults “atrocity propaganda,” intended to distract the public from the war and to “unfairly demonize Hamas.”It is therefore no surprise that under 30s are disproportionately supporting Hamas and against something as fundamentally humanitarian as releasing the hostages. How has the organized Jewish community responded to this onslaught of online hate? It hasn't. In the last year, I have had several tens of conversations with leading Jewish organizations and philanthropists and have been shocked how little has been done to reclaim the social media narrative.There is no successful company in the world, especially one focused on consumers, that does not have a social media strategy.

Nonprofit antisemitism monitoring platform Cyberwell reported in late 2024 that 11 months after the October 7 attacks there had been a “36% increase in online Jew-hatred” and a “doubling in outright calls to violence against Jews.” None of this is happening by chance. The speed of which antisemitic content is created, the consistency of the messaging and the specific targeting of younger people unambiguously reflects a well thought out and well managed social media strategy. One Palestinian advocate has called this coordinated effort the “Instafada: social media as resistance.” Another noted that its strategic use of “social media….. has empowered laypeople to coordinate, take to the streets in protest, build encampment protests on universities, initiate petitions and fundraisers, disrupt politicians, stop arms factories, and revive the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign (which has ultimately affected the profits of corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's).”  Hand using mobile smartphone with icon social media and social network.

Despite the fact that Hamas live-streamed and shared videos of women being raped, there was a massive online campaign conducted last February and March by pro-Hamas influencers and activists calling the reported sexual assaults “atrocity propaganda,” intended to distract the public from the war and to “unfairly demonize Hamas.”It is therefore no surprise that under 30s are disproportionately supporting Hamas and against something as fundamentally humanitarian as releasing the hostages.

Donald Trump has reacted to the report claiming that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mistakenly included The Atlantic magazine editor to a group chat discussing fundamental US military Houthi war plans.

When pressed about The Atlantic's revelation on Monday that senior cabinet members and advisers texted war preparations to a journalist using Signal, Trump gave a surprising response, saying that “I don't know anything about it.”

The US President launched a scathing attack against the magazine. “I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it. You're saying that they had what?”

In his remarks, Trump also mentioned that this was the first time he heard about the purported intelligence exchange.

Trump then requested information about the security breach from reporters.

“What were they talking about?” Trump enquired. He then seemed to mistake the breach for a deliberate effort to undermine the US military's presence in Yemen.

“It couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective. I can tell you that,” the President remarked.

Later, Trump reshared billionaire Elon Musk's X remarks on Truth Social. “Best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of The Atlantic magazine, because no one ever goes there,” the Tesla CEO wrote.

What has The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg saidJeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic said that officials shared extremely private and classified information in the group chat regarding the Pentagon's strategy to launch military airstrikes against the Houthis, leading to condemnation of the government's handling of this crucial information. Goldberg claimed to have been added to the “Houthi PC small group” on Signal, an open-source encrypted messaging platform. According to The Atlantic report, an account named “Pete Hegseth” posted information on impending raids on Yemen in the chat group on March 15. Trump said that same day he issued an order for a series of strikes on Hothi-dominated areas in Yemen. Following the report about the leak, former national security staffers and members of Congress blasted the  Trump administration on social media. “If House Republicans won't hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I'll do it my damn self,” Representative Pat Ryan, a Democrat from New York wrote on X.

On Monday night, Bollywood actor Sonu Sood's wife, Sonali Sood, suffered injuries in a major car accident on the Mumbai-Nagpur highway. The actor has now shared an update about his wife's health.

In an interview with India Today, Sonu talked about his wife getting injured and said, ""She's doing fine now. Had a miraculous escape. Om Sai Ram.”

An insider told Hindustan Times that Sonali was travelling with her sister and nephew, who was behind the wheel and also sustained injuries in the crash. The incident occurred late Monday night (March 24), and both Sonali and her nephew are currently receiving treatment at Max Hospital in Nagpur. Sonu rushed to be with his wife and has been in Nagpur since the last night.

Meanwhile, Sonali and her nephew are under observation at the MAX Hospital in Nagpur; Sonali's sister escaped unhurt, sustaining only minor injuries.

Sonu Sood recently starred in Fateh, his directorial debut. The action thriller, produced by Shakti Sagar Productions and Zee Studios and co-produced by Ajay Dhama, stars Sonu in the lead role alongside Naseeruddin Shah, Jacqueline Fernandez, Vijay Raaz, and Dibyendu Bhattacharya.

The film follows the story of an ex-agent who emerges from his tranquil life to bring down the entire cyber mafia syndicate when a local girl falls victim to it and goes missing. It opened to a mixed-to-positive response from the audience, earning only ₹ 19.05 crore worldwide at the box office.

Speaking about the challenges he faced while making Fateh, Sonu told ANI, ""I wanted to work with the best of the best in the world. A lot of people, including the action director who shot Fast and Furious, Jurassic Park and the song which was written by Hans Zimmer, To the Moon... so getting all these people from Hollywood was a big challenge but I, like I said when you are doing your first you have to make sure you get the best.""

Samsung Electronics co-chief executive officer Han Jong-hee died of cardiac arrest on Tuesday, the South Korean tech giant said. Han Jong-hee was 63.

Han died at a hospital while being treated for cardiac arrest, a company spokesperson said. The company is yet to name his successor.

News agency Reuters reported that Han was in charge of Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile devices division, while co-CEO Jun Young-hyun oversees the chip business of South Korea's biggest company.

Samsung Electronics shares were flat in morning trade.

Han's death comes at a crucial juncture for the company as it seeks to catch up with SK Hynix Inc. in AI memory, and navigates sluggish demand for consumer electronics.

Last week, Han told attendees at Samsung's annual shareholders' meeting of the company's challenges. He told investors that 2025 would be a difficult year, but the company would pursue mergers and acquisitions to address growth concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Han shared leadership duties with Jun Young-hyun, who's taken the helm of the company's pivotal semiconductor business. Han was in charge of everything else at the massive electronics manufacturer.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, a day after it was revealed that he added the editor-in-chief of Atlantic magazine to a chat group where top US national security officials discussed plans about attacking the Houthis in Yemen earlier this month.

In an interview with NBC News on Tuesday, Trump called Waltz “a good man,” adding that he “has learned a lesson.”

The President further stated that the outcome of the March 15 airstrikes, which he called “perfectly successful,” was not affected at all following the inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg in a Signal group. The group also included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

He pointed out that it was the “only glitch in two months” following his presidency, “and it turned out not to be a serious one.”

Trump's remarks come after White House issued a new statement on Tuesday over the alleged blunder. Earlier, the National Security Council stated that The Atlantic's story seemed to be a “authentic message chain.”

Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary for the White House, said: “Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

Taking to X, she even shared three “facts about his latest story”.

According to Leavitt, the White House Counsel's Office has given advice on different channels for Trump's top officials to interact “as safely and efficiently as possible.” She also noted that no “war plans” were discussed or secret data was sent to the thread.

Citing the National Security Council, she said that the White House is conducting an investigation into how Goldberg's number was accidentally added to the thread.

“Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,” she added.

Meanwhile, Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are demanding Waltz's resignation following alleged “outrageous national security breach.”

“We need a full investigation and hearing into this on the House Armed Services Committee, ASAP,” the Democrat added.

Following The Atlantic's story, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, blasted the magazine and told reporters that “nobody was texting war plans.”

He called Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.”

Outrage erupted after The Atlantic revealed a major security breach by the Trump administration. Top administration officials mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal group chat and shared extremely classified military plans about attack on Houthi dominated areas in Yemen with him.

The action has sparked intense debate about the future of national security adviser Mike Waltz. many are contemplating whether he should be fired for the major blunder.

The discussion about Waltz's future comes after Chuck Schumer, the Senate's minority leader, called the tragic incident “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time” on the Senate floor on Monday. He called on Republicans to look into the details of the breach, the harm it caused, and how the US can prevent it from happening again.

Taking to X, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware wrote, “Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime – even if accidentally.” Calling the Trump administration “dangerous”, he stated that this government cannot be trusted to protect Americans.

Representative Pat Ryan of New York even declared that if House Republicans do nothing, he will “IMMEDIATELY” begin his own congressional investigation.

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief, was mistakenly invited into a Signal chat group that included over a dozen high-ranking Trump administration officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and others, according to the Atlantic.

Speaking to MSNBC, Goldberg poked fun at Walz, saying: “I'm thinking to myself, I'm glad Mike Waltz didn't invite a Houthi into the group or a Russian spy, or an adversary of the United States.”

While nothing has been decided as of yet, according to Politico, White House insiders warned that President Donald Trump will make the final choice over the course of the next day or two as he observes coverage of the regrettable incident.

The official, who was given confidentiality to speak about internal deliberations, stated, “Half of them saying he's never going to survive or shouldn't survive.”

Waltz should step down to avoid placing the president in a “bad position”, stated two senior White House sources to Politico.

According to a third source with knowledge of the aftermath, Trump has discussed the issue with Waltz, and the White House is currently supporting him.

During a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Trump still has complete faith in his national security staff, which includes national security adviser Mike Waltz. The press office refused to provide any additional comments, quoting Trump as saying that “the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective.”

A viral video on social media is being circulated with the claim that it shows the moment University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki drowned. The clip shows a woman being pulled into the ocean by surging waves. In the video, a man and a woman can be seen in knee-deep water before crashing waves knock them over, and then carry the woman out of sight as the man tries to rescue her.

Konanki, 20, an Indian-origin woman, vanished while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She was last seen at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

The clip appears to depict the kind of scenario Joshua Riibe, the person last seen with Konanki, described when he was previously interrogated by authorities. However, he had claimed he saved Konanki from drowning and soon passed out after ingesting salt water.

The video is being circulated with a false narrative. AFP found after reverse image searches that the video is months-old, and shows a different man and woman in Sochi, Russia. The outlet reported that according to Russian media outlets, the woman was swept away on June 16, 2024, at Riviera Beach in the resort city along the Black Sea. Her body was found days later.

The outlet further noted how photos on Google Maps and Russia's Yandex Maps show a matching coastline at Riviera Beach. The Dominican Republic beach where Konanki disappeared looks very different in photos.

A June 2024 article by the US Sun identified the woman in the video as aspiring model Diana Belyaeva, 20. The man seen in the video was identified as her boyfriend.

Meanwhile, Dominican Republic authorities recently allowed Riibe to leave, following which he returned to his home in Iowa. He was released after Konanki's parents asked Dominican authorities to let him go, and urged them to declare their daughter legally dead. The grieving parents said they were convinced that their daughter had drowned, even though her body has not been found yet.

“Both sides of the authorities have shown us how high the ocean waves were at the time of the incident, and both sides of the authorities have clarified the person of interest was not a suspect from the beginning,” Subbarayudu Konanki, the missing woman's father, reportedly said.

“It is with deep sadness and a heavy heart that we are coming to terms with the fact our daughter has drowned,” he added. “This is incredibly difficult for us to process.”

Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary film No Other Land on Monday in the occupied West Bank before he was detained by the Israeli military, according to two of his fellow directors and other witnesses. (Also read: Oscars 2025: Directors of 'No Other Land' urge world to address Palestine issue)

The filmmaker -- Hamdan Ballal -- was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya, according to attorney Leah Tsemmel. Police told her they're being held at a military base for medical treatment and she said she hasn't been able to speak with them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers -- some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform -- attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while the settlers continued throwing stones.

“We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us. This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment,"" Adra told The Associated Press.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians -- a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.

“No Other Land"", which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.

Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.

The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theatre that screened the documentary.

Adra said the settlers entered the village on Monday evening, shortly after residents broke the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramzan.

A settler -- who according to Adra frequently attacks the village -- walked over to Ballal's home with the military, and soldiers shot in the air. Ballal's wife heard her husband being beaten outside and scream “I'm dying"", according to Adra.

Adra then saw the soldiers lead Ballal, handcuffed and blindfolded, from his home into a military vehicle. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said Ballal's blood was still splattered on the ground outside his own front door.

Some of the details of Adra's account were backed up by another eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.

A group of 10-20 masked settlers with stones and sticks also assaulted activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, smashing their car windows and slashing tires to make them flee the area, one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the AP.

Video provided by the Center for Jewish Nonviolence showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The three million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.

The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled.

Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards -- and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.

During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank in wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has also been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

A routine message on Signal changed everything for Jeffrey Goldberg, an Israel-American journalist, when a connection request from Michael Waltz, national security adviser to President Donald Trump, on March 11 led him into an unexpected journey into military secrets and high-stakes strategy.

Given the “contentious” relationship between the Trump administration and journalists, Goldberg briefly wondered whether someone was impersonating Waltz in an attempt to entrap him. 

However, he decided to accept the request, hoping it was the real Waltz and that the conversation would focus on issues like Ukraine or Iran, matters of pressing international importance, as mentioned in his account for The Atlantic magazine, where he serves as editor-in-chief.

Two days later, the journalist received a notification that he was to be added to a Signal group chat titled “Houthi PC small group.” He wrote in the magazine that the name alone suggested the conversation would focus on sensitive matters related to the Houthi movement in Yemen.

He mentioned that at 4:28 pm (local time), the first message appeared. It was from “Michael Waltz,” and the content revealed the serious nature of the discussion. The message read, “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”

Goldberg, who had spent years reporting on national security matters, was shocked by the message. In his account, he explained that the term “principals committee” typically refers to the highest-ranking officials within the national security apparatus, such as the secretaries of defence, state, and treasury, along with the CIA director. 

Journalists were rarely, if ever, invited to be part of such discussions. Yet, Goldberg found himself included in what appeared to be a highly secretive conversation, something he had never experienced in his career.

The message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.” 

Goldberg had never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting before, nor had he ever heard of one being coordinated through a commercial messaging app, he wrote.

A massive earthquake of magnitude 6.8 sent tremors off the coast of Riverton in New Zealand on Tuesday, said the United States Geological Survey.

The quake, which initially was recorded at 7 magnitude, struck at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) off the southwest tip of the South Island, the USGS said. So far, no tsunami warning has been issued for the region.

As per the USGS website, there have been green alerts for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses, as per which it has concluded that there are low chances of casualties and damage.

Further, it said that the population residing in the quake-hit region live in structures that are highly resistant to earthquakes, with an exception of some vulnerable structures.

Meanwhile, New Zealand's emergency management agency said that it was ""assessing whether the earthquake has created a tsunami that could affect"" the country.

In a national advisory, the agency said, ""If a tsunami has been generated in this location it is not likely to arrive in New Zealand for at least one hour.""

Previously, a 6.3 magnitude that struck Christchurch in 2011 had killed 185 people.

According to USGS the eastern margin of the Australia plate is one of the most seismically active areas of the world due to the high rates of convergence between the Australia and Pacific plates.

In New Zealand, it said, the 3000 km-long Australia-Pacific plate boundary extends from south of Macquarie Island to the southern Kermadec Island chain.

Since 1900, around 15 instances of magnitude 7.5 plus earthquakes have been recorded near New Zealand. Nine of these, and the four largest ones, occurred near the Macquarie Ridge, including the 1989's destructive 8.2 magnitude on the ridge itself.

The largest earthquake recorded in New Zealand itself was in 1931, the 7.8 magnitude Hawke's Bay earthquake, which claimed the lives of 256 people.

The Bengaluru-based founder of asset management firm 16VC has come under fire for advertising unpaid jobs on LinkedIn. Sridhar Arunagiri took to LinkedIn last week to share vacancies for four roles within his company. Sridhar made it clear that 16VC would only hire a “top performer” who would be expected to work out of their Bengaluru office, with no remote or hybrid flexibility.

And then came the stinger - “this is an unpaid role until you match all the checklist,” wrote Sridhar.

Sridhar told HT.com in an emailed statement that the position is a paid one, with an “unpaid” period during which skills of the candidate will be assessed. 

His post made it clear that candidates selected for the roles of product manager, software engineer, UX developer, and growth marketer would have to fulfil an extensive list of requirements before they could get paid. Then, too, the first month on the job would be unpaid.

“We're not hiring anyone just because they have the right skills on paper or some outdated projects. come join us, prove what you can do in a real environment, and from the next month, we'll make it paid,” wrote Sridhar. His post has triggered backlash at a time when conversations around work-life balance are happening across the country.

You can take a look at the post here.

In his post, the Bengaluru-based founder wrote “This is not a 9-to-5” - indicating that employees would be expected to work long hours. “This is a high-speed, high-impact opportunity for those who want to build something massive,” he added.

“The job posting was structured to filter applications effectively. Today, any job post attracts thousands of applications, making it difficult to identify the right candidates efficiently. My approach was intended to streamline the process and ensure that only genuinely interested and highly motivated candidates applied,” Sridhar A told HT.com over an email.

""I also want to emphasize that this is a paid role. The mention of an unpaid period was meant to assess skills before onboarding a candidate into a full-time, compensated position. My plan was always to follow up with a post after hiring someone to confirm that it is a paid role. 

“The interview process is still ongoing, and I will be updating the post accordingly once the selection is completed,” he added.

Sridhar's post was widely criticised not just on LinkedIn but also X and Reddit.

“Post keeps getting worse with every line,” wrote one X user. Another called it “Labour exploitation wrapped into motivational trash.”

 

Several people pointed out the contradiction in his LinkedIn post, where on the one hand he said that his company would rather pay above market rate for a top performer, and on the other hand called it an unpaid role.

Some even doubted the authenticity of not just his post but the company as a whole. In fact, a quick Google search for “16VC” reveals that dozens of people have accused the firm of defrauding them with fake job offers.

The LinkedIn post also reached the popular ‘LinkedIn Lunatics' forum on Reddit, where reactions were similarly negative.

A man's post slamming the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has surfaced online. In his share, the Indian-origin content creator claimed that after getting a cut in his hand, which left him with a deep wound, he only faced delays from the NHS. He further stirred a debate on social media after saying he travelled to India for proper medical attention.

“While I was in the UK, a glass shattered on my hand, severely damaging a nerve and leaving my tendon 90% torn, making it impossible to raise my finger. I rushed to a pharmacy where they told me it was a deep cut that required hospital treatment. They helped me wrap the wound and gave me energy tablets to prevent me from fainting,” Aryan Mangal wrote.

He continued that he waited three hours before meeting a doctor at the hospital and was asked to meet a hand plastic surgeon the next day. According to Mangal, the surgeon numbed his hand with injections and asked him to come back for surgery after three days.

“As I got up to leave, my wound started (bleeding) again, so the doctor tightened the bandage and gave me extra dressings in case it bled at home. Later, I developed a fever because the wound was open and infected, and I had to take medication until Tuesday. That evening, I woke up to 7–8 missed calls from the NHS and a voice note informing me that my surgery had been postponed by 4–5 days,” he continued.

He went on to say that, frustrated by the delay, he travelled to India to get his surgery done. “Unfortunately, my experience with the NHS wasn't great. While the doctors were kind and professional, the delays were excruciatingly painful,” he added. He concluded his post with a video.

A 76-year-old woman was attacked and killed by over 50 dogs of her daughter in Colorado City town of US' Arizona, an incident which took place in February this year but seeing an arrest only recently.

Jessica Hoff, 47, was arrested on Friday in connection with the February incident, according to news agency Associated Press.

Jessica Hoff left her 76-year-old mother LaVonne Hoff, who had dementia, home alone in Colaroda City with the dogs on February 3 while she did errands, the report said.

LaVonne Hoff required 24-hour care, according to the Pueblo County sheriff's office, quoted in the report.

Later that day, deputies found LaVonne Hoff unconscious and several dogs running loose along with about two dozen other dogs and seven birds that were in cages, the sheriff's office said.

A search of Jessica Hoff's house and another nearby property led to discovery of 54 dogs, some in poor health. The animals, along with several birds, were found in unsanitary conditions and were taken by animal control, according to the sheriff's office.

Hoff, who was in jail on Monday, is set to appear in court on Thursday. As of now, prosecutors have not filed formal charges against her, according to court records.

She is being represented by a public defender, whose office does not comment on cases to the media.

Under Colorado law, criminal negligence resulting in an at-risk person's death can lead to prison time between two and six years while aggravated cruelty to animals can carry between a year and 18 months in prison.

The White House on Tuesday insisted that no classified material was sent on a chat between senior officials about strikes on Yemen that was accidentally shared with a journalist.

“No war plans were discussed,” President Donald Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. “No classified material was sent to the thread.”

The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in an article, claimed that he was inadvertently invited into a group chat where top US officials planned for strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels.

While Trump informed the public about the strikes on March 15, Goldberg claimed that he knew about them hours earlier as he was part of the chat, which included US defense secretary Pete Hegseth and vice president JD Vance.

Top Democrats were quick to condemn the incident, describing it as a major security breach and calling for an investigation to determine how it happened.

On Tuesday, Leavitt said that the White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on several different platforms for Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.

She also criticised Jeffrey Goldberg, saying that the magazine editor is “well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

“Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed, and that's what matters most to President Trump,” Karoline Leavitt added.

Earlier today, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he was unaware of the incident. ""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,"" Trump said.

 

Jeffrey Goldberg said he was unexpectedly invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the “Houthi PC small group”.

The editor claims that hours before those military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15, defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan in the messaging group, “including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing”.

He added that US officials in the group also debated whether the US should carry out the strikes, and at one point Vance appeared to question whether US allies in Europe, more exposed to shipping disruption in the region, deserved US help.

A Texas man has been sentenced to six years in prison for urinating in women's water bottles, an act that led to one victim contracting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). 

Quoting court documents, The Independent reported that Lucio Catarino Diaz, a former janitor at a Houston medical facility, was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, his urine. 

Diaz, who had already served two years of sentence, committed the crimes in the summer of 2022 at a doctor's office located along the East Freeway. 

The practice had a shared five-gallon water dispenser used by staff and others in a common area.

An employee, identified as MA, noticed on August 30, 2022, that “the water she got from the water dispenser had a funny taste and smell to it,” according to the complaint. She later told police that she began bringing her own water bottle instead of drinking the “sour” water. 

The employee eventually “noticed her water from her personal water bottle that she brought from the store smelled nasty,” the documents said, adding that she decided to dispose of the bottle rather than investigate further.

As the office lacked security cameras, the woman purchased a small camera online and attached it to her computer. She also placed a large water bottle in the camera's view.

Later that evening, the woman was notified of movement on the camera. “What she witnessed moments later was far worse than anyone could imagine,” court documents revealed.

“The video clearly showed the nighttime janitor, Lucio Diaz, approach M.A.'s desk as if to clean, set the cleaning rag and cleaning bottle on the desk, unzip his pants, pull out his penis, grab the water bottle sitting on the desk, unscrew the cap, and begin to insert his penis into the water bottle (turning it upwards to ensure the water in the bottle touched his penis), and rub his penis on the mouth of the bottle,” report quoted court documents. 

“He then put the cap back on the bottle, set it back where he found it, zipped up his pants, grabbed the cleaning bottle and rag, and continued to ‘clean' the desk. Lucio Diaz was not phased, he was not nervous—he had done this before—and it had now become just a part of his daily ‘cleaning' ritual,” the report added. 

According to the complaint, Diaz admitted to the crimes during police questioning, saying he “did it because he knew [the employee] would drink it the next day” and mentioned having a “sickness.”

The woman later underwent several STD tests, all of which came back positive for Herpes simplex virus type 1, a condition she had never tested positive for before, the complaint revealed.

Tests on Diaz also showed he was positive for the same virus, along with chlamydia. 

Following this, several other women working at the medical practice found they had contracted STDs. The Independent reported it has reviewed multiple civil suits filed against Diaz.

On October 10, 2022, another woman who was targeted by Diaz informed police that she tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 and chlamydia after consuming water from her bottle that had been contaminated with his urine, as stated in the court documents, reported USA Today.

Biotech giant 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday sparking DNA data breach concerns. The company's shares fell to as much as 50% on Monday after founder Anne Wojcicki resigned as CEO. As of now, 23andMe has not confirmed if it is looking to sell to interested bidders.

Jason Koebler-led 404 Media viewed 23andMe's court documents and reported that the biotechnology company is looking to protect itself from the potential damage of dozens of legal cases about past data leaks. Hackers had obtained personal data of about seven million customers in October 2023. According to the 404 Media report, it included ‘health-related information based upon the user's genetics'.

The company, in the documents, also stated that it has faced ‘over 50 class action and state court lawsuits' and 'approximately 35,000 claimants have initiated, filed, or threatened to commence arbitration claims'.

23andMe has collected DNA from saliva samples from more than 15 million customers, Bloomberg reported. As per the report, the ‘personal information can now be sold as part of a court-supervised auction'.

The Wojcicki-led organization filed for Chapter 11, which refers to bankruptcy. 404 Media adds that it owes money to pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, artificial intelligence companies, health insurance companies, and marketing companies.

As concerns about the data auction surfaced, 23andMe issued an open letter to customers. “Your data remains protected. The Chapter 11 filing does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data. Our users' privacy and data are important considerations in any transaction, and we remain committed to our users' privacy and to being transparent with our customers about how their data is managed.”

However, it stated that buyers will have to ‘comply with applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data'.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the US bars employers and health insurance companies from discriminating against people due to genetic information.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta last week advised customers to delete their genetic data due to 23andMe's financial troubles.

""Once that data is out there, then, even if you requested your account to be deleted, they can't find your information because it no longer has your name attached. So for most people that might be fine as long as their names (are) not attached.""

The Social Security Administration (SSA) on Monday announced several ‘transparency initiatives' under President Donald Trump - including a detailed explanation of its newly introduced identity verification change. The agency further hinted at layoffs, offering workers ‘voluntary opportunities to depart the agency or move to a frontline customer service position'. 

In a press release, SSA stated that President Trump ‘has been clear that good government must serve the People'. ""This begins with being transparent in how its government makes decisions and operates as good stewards of the resources entrusted to it,” Lee Dudek, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, said.

“With this guiding principle in mind, Social Security is taking several important steps to increase transparency and accountability in order to help others understand our agency's work and the complexities we navigate.”

Here are 5 key points on the Social Security Administration's transparency initiative:

Earlier this month, the SSA had announced that it will impose tighter identity verification measures starting March 31. This rule change will affect millions of Americans to verify their identity in person rather than over the phone. 

On Monday, the agency stated that those ‘who cannot successfully use the agency's online my Social Security service will need to visit a field office in person to complete the verification process'. 

More details are published on the SSA's ‘What to Know about Proving Your Identity' page. 

Acting Commissioner Dudek has started meeting with his senior leadership team throughout the week ‘to tackle a range of challenges facing the agency', the SSA said.

“During the Weekly Operational Report (WOR) meeting, leaders focus on specific topics, the options presented to the acting commissioner, and the resulting decisions made during these meetings.”

Dudek published a summary of select agency challenges under the titles: Treasury Offset Program (TOP) Resumption, Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification (eCBSV) Cost Reduction and Enhancements Plan, Payroll Information Exchange (PIE) Phased Implementation Plan and Strengthening Identity Assurance Across Customer Service Channels.

The SSA acknowledged that people do not get prompt customer service after calling the agency's 800 number. 

“People deserve to know the wait time challenges they will face if unable to use the agency's secure and convenient online services,” the press release says. 

Dudek is planning to increase the level of detail shared with beneficiaries. 

Like other federal agencies, the SSA will also be cutting costs in what is described as an ‘efficiency' move. The agency is identifying ‘unused and underutilized office space'. 

“SSA published its Efficiencies and Cost Avoidance webpage that lists soft-term lease terminations, including an explanation for each location and whether any change affects the public or not. For nearly all locations, the space being terminated is only a small room within the larger Social Security office location.”

The Social Security Administration hinted at layoffs. In its transparency release, the agency stated that it has ‘identified opportunities to optimize its workforce by offering voluntary opportunities to depart the agency or move to a frontline customer service position'.

US President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25 per cent tariff on countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela, a punitive measure that could hit Asian markets including China and India, among others, and sow fresh global trade uncertainty.

""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse,"" he wrote on his Truth Social network. 

""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country.""

The latest across-the-board 25 per cent levies targeting direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan oil can take effect as soon as April 2, according to an order signed Monday by Trump.

According to Trump's order, the 25 per cent tariff expires a year after the last date that a country has imported Venezuelan oil -- or sooner if Washington decides so.

Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants. Venezuela subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.

But Caracas said Saturday it had reached an agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras.

The US President's action could hit China and India, with experts noting that Venezuela exports oil to both those countries and to the United States and Spain.

In December 2023 and January 2024, India was the top buyer of Venezuelan crude oil. In the first month, New Delhi imported approximately 191,600 barrels per day, which rose to over 254,000 in the following month. In January 2024, India was importing nearly half of Venezuela's total oil exports (almost 557,000 bpd for the month).

In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5 per cent of the country's total crude oil purchases.

In February, Venezuela also exported some 500,000 barrels of oil per day to China and this figure was 240,000 barrels for the United States, according to a report by AFP.

Following Trump's announcement, oil prices gained 1 per cent on Monday. Brent crude futures rose 84 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $73 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was up 83 cents, or 1.2 per cent, at $69.11.

Price gains were capped, however, as the US gave oil producer Chevron until May 27 to wind down its oil operations and exports from Venezuela. Trump had initially given Chevron 30 days from March 4 to wind down that license.

The two moves taken together alleviate some pressure on Chevron while putting more pressure on other consumers of Venezuelan oil, though it is uncertain how the Trump administration will enforce the tariff.

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed tariffs on US allies and foes alike, attempting to strong-arm both economic and diplomatic policy. The secretary of state, in consultation with other US agencies, is authorized to determine if the levy will be imposed.

Trump told reporters Monday that the 25 per cent tariff would be on top of existing rates. He has dubbed April 2 ""Liberation Day"" for the world's biggest economy, already promising reciprocal tariffs tailored to each trading partner in an effort to remedy practices that Washington deems unfair.

He earlier signalled sector-specific duties coming around the same day -- but the White House said Monday it might take a narrower approach.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Green card holders living in America may soon be required to surrender their social media accounts to the government under a new proposal by President Donald Trump administration's as part of their crackdown on immigration. Visa applicants living abroad are already required to share their social media handles with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Now, under the new proposal, the policy will expand to those already living legally in America and are applying for permanent residency or seeking asylum.

The move could potentially allow the White House to bar critics from making the United States their home. It will affect many Indians living legally in America and are active contributors to Indian and US politics. The increased scrutiny from the government could discourage these people from speaking on political matters online due to the risk of negative consequences.



In a notice released on March 5, the Trump administration announced that it's seeking public comment on its plan, saying USCIS has ""identified the need to collect social media identifiers ('handles') and associated social media platform names from applicants to enable and help inform identity verification, national security and public safety screening, and vetting, and related inspections.""

The document said that the vetting of social media accounts was necessary for ""enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.""

The plan is an extension of a current policy that mandates visa applicants abroad to provide their social media handles. The proposal is to extend the scrutiny to already existing residents who are lawfully present in the country, including those with green cards and asylum seekers who are applying for permanent residence. 

The increased social media vetting comes amid the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement, including closer scrutiny of green card and visa holders.

Since coming to power for the second time, Trump's hardline approach to deporting immigrants has intensified America's already stark partisan divide. 

On January 20, his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to team up to fight ""an invasion"" of illegal immigrants. He cast the nation's estimated 11 million immigrants in the US illegally as the driving factor behind crime, gang violence and drug trafficking - assertions not supported by government statistics, and accused immigrants of draining US government resources and depriving citizens of jobs.

Almost immediately, federal law enforcement started posting photos of the crackdown to social media: agents wore body armor and jackets emblazoned with names of multiple agencies - including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, known as ATF - during raids on immigrants without proper legal status.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was spotted jogging at London's Hyde Park in a white saree and slippers. Trinamool Congress' Kunal Ghosh shared a series of pictures and videos from Ms Banerjee's London visit in which the Chief Minister can be seen walking around London from Buckingham Palace to Hyde Park, basking in the beauty of the city, along with other officials.

Ms Banerjee chose a white saree with a green border and her signature white slippers for what is described as a ""warm-up"". She wore a black cardigan and a shawl to beat London's cold weather. Take a look:

In one of the posts on X (formerly Twitter), TMC's Kunal Ghosh wrote: ""According to the Chief Minister, today it is not a walk, but a warm-up"".

Ms Banerjee was also seen ""back-walking"" and clapping.

This is not the first time Ms Banerjee has been seen jogging in a foreign land. During her official visit to Spain in 2023, the Chief Minister had a ""refreshing morning"" in Madrid as she jogged in a saree and slippers. The message was clear: ""Stay fit, stay healthy!""

Ms Banerjee arrived in London on Sunday as part of an official visit aimed at strengthening Bengal's ties with Britain. Reflecting on the relationship between Bengal and Britain, Ms Banerjee stated, it ""spans centuries, rooted in history, culture, and commerce"".

""As we landed in London yesterday, we stepped into a city that, much like Kolkata, carries the weight of its past while embracing the dynamism of the present. Before the day's engagements commenced, I took a moment to immerse myself in the essence of London's timeless grandeur. From its iconic landmarks to its storied streets, the city exudes an old-world charm that speaks of history and evolution - values that Bengal, too, holds close to its heart,"" she wrote in a post on X.

US President Donald Trump was shocked to learn that his administration's top officials and aides mistakingly leaked war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic after the journalist was mistakenly included in a private Signal group chat. When asked about the security breach during a press conference at the White House's Roosevelt Room on Monday, the stunned commander-in-chief told reporters, ""You're telling me about it for the first time.""

""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine but I know nothing about it...You're saying that they had what,"" Trump said.

He, however, added that ""the attack was very effective"" in any case. 

Trump Says He Knows ‘Nothing' About His Defense Officials Texting War Plans To The Atlantic Editor pic.twitter.com/ni8W1sQTNi



The material in the text chain ""contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing,"" The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, did not dispute the authenticity of the messages. The National Security Council said reported the text chain ""appears to be authentic.""

The report said Goldberg received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. He was then added to a group, which also included Waltz, in addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, two that before the strike. 

Goldberg then received texts from other top government officials designating representatives who would work on the matter. He also shared that Hegseth sent information on the strikes, including ""targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing"" to the group chat.

The messages revealed by the Atlantic also highlighted Vice President JD Vance's disagreement with Trump's Yemen strategy. Goldberg, in his report, said that a person identified as Vance expressed doubts about carrying out the strikes on March 14, saying he hated ""bailing Europe out again"". He also argued that the Trump administration didn't need to rush to attack Yemen saying Europeans were more affected by Houthi attacks on shipping than the United States.

He made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the US by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.

""Three per cent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 per cent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message,"" Vance reportedly wrote in a message.

""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,"" Vance says in a later message. 

Vance in the chain of the messages questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of ""a moderate to severe spike in oil prices"" and if the timing of the operation might be a ""mistake.""

""I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,"" Vance argued. ""But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""

After pushback from other members of the Trump administration, Vance appears to address Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying ""If you think we should do it let's go"".

""I just hate bailing Europe out again,"" Vance said.

""I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,"" Hegseth replied. He added, ""I think we should go.""

The vice president's communication director, William Martin, in a statement, downplayed the debate.

He said Vance ""unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy.""

A US journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other top American officials discussed upcoming strikes against Yemen's Huthi rebels, the White House confirmed Monday.

President Donald Trump announced the strikes on March 15, but in a shocking security breach, The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that he had hours of advance notice via the group chat on Signal.

""The message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,"" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said.

The White House said Trump ""continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team,"" after the US president earlier said he did not ""know anything about"" the issue.

The leak could have been highly damaging if Goldberg had publicized details of the plan in advance, but he did not do so even after the fact.

He did, however, write that Hegseth sent information on the strikes, including on ""targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing,"" to the group chat.

""According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 pm eastern time,"" Goldberg wrote -- a timeline that was borne out on the ground in Yemen.

Goldberg said he was added to the group chat two days earlier, and received messages from other top government officials designating representatives who would work on the issue.

On March 14, a person identified as Vance expressed doubts about carrying out the strikes, saying he hated ""bailing Europe out again,"" as countries there were more affected by Huthi attacks on shipping than the United States.

- 'Stunning and dangerous' -

Group chat contributors identified as National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Hegseth both sent messages arguing only Washington had the capability to carry out the strikes, with the latter official saying he shared Vance's ""loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.""

And a person identified as ""S M"" -- possibly Trump advisor Stephen Miller -- argued that ""if the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.""

The security breach provoked outrage among Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing it as ""one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time"" and calling for a full investigation.

Senator Jack Reed also slammed the leak, saying: ""The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous.""

And Hillary Clinton -- who was repeatedly attacked by Trump for using a private email server while she was secretary of state -- posted the Atlantic article on X along with the message: ""You have got to be kidding me.""

- Huthi attacks -

The Huthi rebels, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the ""axis of resistance"" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the United States.

They have launched scores of drone and missile attacks at ships passing Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza war, saying they were carried out in solidarity with Palestinians.

The Huthis' campaign crippled the vital route, which normally carries about 12 percent of world shipping traffic, forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.

The US began targeting the Huthis in response under the previous administration of president Joe Biden, and has launched repeated rounds of strikes on Huthi targets, some with British support.

Trump has vowed to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,"" citing the Huthis' threats against Red Sea shipping, and US strikes have continued over the past 10 days.

US President Donald Trump has simple advice for Kamala Harris if she decides to run for governor of California in 2026: start talking.

""Let her run,"" Trump said in an interview with OutKick on Saturday when asked about Harris' potential political future. ""I don't want to be [giving] people advice politically, but one thing she's gotta start doing is she's gotta start giving interviews.""

Trump pointed out that former President Joe Biden avoided interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic but still won the election. ""Biden - during the COVID thing, he did no interviews, and he got away with it because of COVID,"" Trump said.

Since her defeat in the 2024 presidential election, there's been a lot of speculation on Kamala Harris' future in American politics. Reports suggest she is weighing three options: running for California governor in 2026, making another presidential bid in 2028, or remaining a Democratic powerbroker without seeking office.

With sitting Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom term-limited, the 2026 race presents a significant opportunity for Harris. She is expected to decide by summer end.

At a pre-Oscars party last weekend, she spoke about ""staying in this fight"" while meeting key Democratic figures. Harris previously served as California's attorney general after winning elections in 2010 and 2014, before becoming a US senator in 2016. 

If she runs, she will join a crowded Democratic field that includes Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins, ex-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state schools chief Tony Thurmond, and former comptroller Betty Yee.

The election is set for November 3, 2026, with primaries in June.

During the 2024 campaign, Harris was cautious with media interactions and avoided popular platforms such as Joe Rogan's podcast - unlike Trump, who took an aggressive media approach. With help from his son Barron, Trump engaged across traditional and independent outlets, appearing on shows hosted by Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schultz. 

His running mate, JD Vance, also pushed back against media narratives on mainstream networks, while Harris' VP pick, Tim Walz, admitted he was restricted from doing more interviews.

During his interview with OutKick, Trump also reflected on his political comeback, saying that his re-election in 2024 ""showed how bad [Democrats] were.""

Officers have confiscated nearly 6.5 tonnes of cocaine from a semi-submersible submarine intercepted off the Azores while bound for the Iberian peninsula, Portugal's judicial police said on Tuesday.

The bust amounts to nearly a quarter of the record 23 tonnes seized across the whole of 2024 in Portugal, often considered one of the first points of entry for the drug into Europe.

Drug traffickers have been caught using semi-submersible vessels, sometimes dubbed ""narco-submarines"", to smuggle cocaine while attempting to evade detection.

The vessel was intercepted ""in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, around 500 nautical miles (more than 900 kilometres)"" south of Portugal's Azores archipelago, the judicial police statement said.

Five crew members were onboard the vessel, which was used by an international crime ring, the statement added.

Besides the Portuguese navy and airforce, international partners including the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the British National Crime Agency and the Spanish Guardia Civil contributed to the bust, according the police.

Many so-called ""narco-submarines"" cannot fully dive like a true submarine, but some are able to dip completely underwater.

Most of the cocaine smuggled into Portugal comes across the sea from Latin America.

Nancy Wilson, the famous American musician from the rock band Heart, expressed her discomfort with being an American in the current political climate, calling it ""embarrassing"".  In a recent interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wilson opened up about the state of the world and her feelings as an American today. 

The conversation touched on Heart's iconic 1975 single, ""Crazy on You"", which she explained was originally written as a critique of the Vietnam War. Interestingly, she noted that the song's message continues to feel relevant even in today's world.

""We were kind of embarrassed at that time to call ourselves American because of the dirty politics of the Vietnam War,"" Wilson explained. ""To be as subtle as possible, it's more embarrassing now.""

According to the New York Post, Wilson's remarks were not taken lightly, and both fans and critics slammed the wealthy singer for her contentious comments about the country.

""Says the millionaire who made tonnes of dough playing music,"" one X user scoffed. ""I just can't with these people right now.""

Stop playing 80's Heart music and it's not as embarrassing

""Stop playing 80s Heart music, and it's not as embarrassing,"" a third X user quipped.

""It's embarrassing to be a Heart fan now,"" added another former backer of the band.

Others instructed Wilson to ditch the US if she's that embarrassed.

""Then leave; you won't be missed,"" one person remarked. ""Move, I guess,"" commented a second.

A Chinese woman jumped off a hospital roof and died after a doctor messed up a routine tooth extraction process, a report in South China Morning Post has claimed. The woman surnamed Wu, 34, hailed from Anhui province in eastern China and had undergone a wisdom tooth extraction at the Anqing Municipal Hospital, known for its dental department, earlier this month.

During the procedure, the doctor mistakenly removed a healthy tooth and then forcibly stuffed the incorrectly extracted tooth back in place.

""For an hour and a half of the surgery, they did not use anaesthesia, and my sister endured it,"" Ms Wu's brother said, adding that the doctor used wire to tie the wrong tooth along with several others.

The botched operation damaged Ms Wu's teeth and she was left with severe pain and a swollen face. She was unable to eat and survived by only drinking water for the next few days as the pain kept her up at night.

Chronicling her experience on social media, Ms Wu shared a video, where she recounted the horrifying experience. ""No one really addressed this incident. The hospital lied to me from start to finish, causing me immense suffering. Who will save me? Because of the harm this hospital caused, I will die here,"" she said.

One of Ms Wu's relatives said she had warned that she would be using her 'death' to prove her innocence after no action was taken against the hospital staffers.

""Wu had repeatedly reported the issue to the hospital and authorities, but nothing was done. This broke her psychological defences, and she said she would use death to prove her innocence,"" the relative said.

After her death, the hospital announced that the doctor involved had been suspended and that both the health commission and police were investigating the matter. Meanwhile, Ms Wu's family has rejected the hospital's offer of Rs 11.7 lakh (100,000 yuan) in compensation and demanded to see surveillance footage of the rooftop plunge.Also Read | Meta's AI Comment Experiment Sparks Outrage: ""Feels Like Dark Mirror Episode""

""Dozens of settlers attacked the gathering at Iftar,"" Nawajaa told Reuters by phone. ""The young men came out to prevent them, and there were about eight injuries on our side.""

Israeli police arrested three men, including Ballal, who was injured during the standoff, he said. It was unclear how badly he had been injured.

India's Permanent Representative to the UN advised Pakistan not to try to ""divert"" the attention

India on Tuesday slammed Pakistan for its ""repeated references"" to Jammu and Kashmir at a United Nations debate on peacekeeping reforms. Speaking at the Security Council, India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said the remarks were ""unwarranted"" and reiterated that the region ""was, is, and will always be an integral part of India.""

""India is compelled to note that the delegate of Pakistan has yet again resorted to unwarranted remarks on the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Such repeated references neither validate their illegal claims nor justify their state-sponsored cross-border terrorism,"" Mr Harish said.

He advised Pakistan not to try to ""divert"" the attention of the forum to drive its ""parochial and divisive agenda"".

Mr Harish also said that Pakistan continues to ""illegally occupy"" part of Jammu and Kashmir, and ""must vacate"" the territory.

Mr Harish's retort came after Syed Tariq Fatemi, the Special Assistant to the Pakistani Prime Minister, spoke on Jammu and Kashmir during a discussion on the future of UN Peacekeeping at the Security Council.

India has maintained that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan but insists that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility for such engagement.

In a recent podcast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that every attempt to foster peace with Pakistan was met with hostility and betrayal.

In an interaction with US-based podcaster Lex Fridman, he recalled that he had specially invited his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014.

""It [invitation] was a gesture of goodwill. It was a diplomatic gesture unlike any in decades,"" he said.

""Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal. We sincerely hope that wisdom prevails upon them and they choose the path of peace,"" PM Modi said.

A mysterious spinning orb illuminated the UK night sky on Monday sparking widespread confusion and speculation about a potential UFO sighting. The glowing anomaly was spotted spiralling across the sky in various northern regions, including Greater Manchester, Derbyshire, and Yorkshire. Eyewitnesses described the phenomenon as a strange, swirling light surrounded by misty rings, moving slowly across the sky before disappearing into the night.

The sightings weren't limited to the UK, with reports also emerging from Slovenia and Sweden, where Facebook users shared images and wondered about the origin of the mysterious spinning lights. ""Anyone else just sees this in the sky? It just kept spinning,"" one person wrote on Facebook.

Another commented, ""Has anyone else just seen this over Radcliffe in the sky because me and the kids are freaked out."" A third added, ""What have we just seen??? It was moving and then faded away after about 2 mins and there were other small what looked like stars moving around it too.""

A fourth added, ""It was like a whirlpool of lights floating across the sky, I've never seen anything like that before.""

The real reason:

The mysterious spinning lights were officially attributed to a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a mission for the US National Reconnaissance Office (NROL-69). After liftoff, excess fuel was released into space, freezing and catching sunlight to create a breathtaking spiral display visible from the UK. This phenomenon, known as ""rocket ice clouds,"" was previously observed in 2023 over parts of the US following another SpaceX launch.

""The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky,"" the Met Office said.

A motorcyclist who fell into a massive sinkhole that opened on a Seoul street was discovered dead following an extensive overnight search, Seoul officials announced on Tuesday. According to the BBC, the unidentified man, in his 30s, was found in cardiac arrest around noon on Tuesday, after the sinkhole swallowed him as he drove by. The sinkhole measured approximately 65 feet in both width and depth, according to the Gangdong Fire Station.

Notably, the sinkhole suddenly appeared near an intersection in Seoul's Gangdong district around 6:30 p.m. local time on Monday. Emergency responders launched a search and rescue operation, eventually locating the motorcyclist around 11 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The victim, who was wearing a helmet and motorcycle boots, was found unconscious and without a pulse. Rescuers also recovered his Japanese-made motorcycle and mobile phone from the sinkhole.

Dashcam footage captured the moment when a car narrowly escaped the sinkhole, with its rear wheels barely clearing the edge. Immediately after, a motorcycle and its rider fell into the deep pit.  Authorities suspect that a ruptured water main pipe may have caused the road to collapse, leading to the massive sinkhole.

The 17-hour search operation was extremely challenging due to the presence of water and soil at the scene, which made it difficult for rescuers to navigate. Additionally, heavy machinery from a nearby construction site had become entangled, further complicating the rescue efforts, according to a fire station official.

""It was only after draining the area and deploying heavy equipment to remove the soil that we were able to locate the man,"" he added.

A woman in her 40s, who happened to be passing by the area just before the sinkhole appeared, sustained a minor injury and is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.

Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon visited the site of the massive sinkhole on Monday night, calling for an investigation into the cause of the incident and measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.  The cause of the sinkhole remains unknown. Seoul officials said they planned to conduct a ""detailed and comprehensive investigation.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

It started as a joke. In December 2024, Donald Trump glibly told Justin Trudeau that Canada should become the 51st state. Three months later, the “joke” seems to have become an American foreign policy goal for the second Trump administration.

Canadian Parliament has been unanimous in its response: “Canada is not for sale.” But Canada's head of state, King Charles, has remained largely silent on the matter — until recently.

Over the last several weeks, observers have started to pick up on subtle signs of support for Canadians from the King. But many people have no doubt been wondering why there's not been a direct statement of support from King Charles.

The answer to that question isn't as simple as many people might think.

Since 1689, Britain has been a constitutional monarchy. The sovereign is the head of state, but the prime minister leads the government. As such, the King can't interfere with politics. He is supposed to remain neutral and be the embodiment of the nation.

This crucial separation between palace and Parliament was solidified in Canada and throughout the Commonwealth in 1931 with the Statute of Westminster. In 1954, the Royal Styles and Titles Act separated the British Crown from the other Commonwealth realms. Queen Elizabeth became the first sovereign to ever be called Queen of Canada.

As a constitutional monarch, King Charles is bound by parliamentary limitations on his authority. He cannot act without taking advice from the prime ministers in his various realms.

This means King Charles can't make a political statement about the ongoing tensions between Canada and the U.S. without the green light from Ottawa. When asked about the situation in January, a palace official said simply that this is “not something we would comment on.”

As former Alberta premier Jason Kenney later explained on social media:

“For Canadians disappointed that King Charles has not commented on President Trump's threats to annex Canada: in his capacity as King of Canada, he can only act on the advice of his Canadian first minister, i.e. Justin Trudeau.”

Or, at this moment, Mark Carney.

The King met with Trudeau at Sandringham, the royal family's private estate in Norfolk, England, on March 3. This meeting seems to have prompted a series of symbolic gestures demonstrating the monarchy's solidarity with Canadians.

The next day, the King conducted an inspection of the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales in his capacity as head of the Armed Forces. Canadian medals and honours adorned his naval dress uniform during the inspection.

A week later, the King planted a red maple tree at Buckingham Palace to honour Queen Elizabeth's commitment to the preservation of forests and the bonds among Commonwealth nations.

On March 12, the King met with representatives from the Canadian Senate.

He presented a ceremonial sword to Gregory Peters, the Usher of the Black Rod (one of the Senate's chief protocol officers). Raymonde Gagné, the speaker of the Senate, was also present for that meeting.

Delighted to see that Buckingham Palace has just shared this lovely photo of Senate Speaker @sengagne.sencanada.ca and our gentlemanly Usher of the Black Rod, Greg Peters, with King Charles III. The King presented the Black Rod with a new ceremonial sword. #SenateofCanada #Canada #KingCharlesIII[image or embed]

And on March 17, the King met with Carney as part of the new prime minister's whirlwind diplomatic tour of western Europe.

Some observers even pointed to the Princess of Wales's red dress at the Commonwealth Day Service of Celebration on March 10 as yet another nod of recognition for Canada.

These sorts of gestures are examples of what is known as “soft power.” Unlike the hard power of military and economic force used by governments, soft power describes any number of ways that people or groups can influence others through culture, personal diplomacy and even fashion.

As one Buckingham Palace source remarked: “The King knows that seemingly small gestures can send a reassuring sign of recognition about what is going on around the world.”

One of the best known forms of the monarchy wielding soft power is through the use of state visits. At the British prime minister's request, world leaders are invited to London by the sovereign. The red carpet is rolled out for them, they're wined and dined in lavish dinners at Buckingham Palace and they often make a speech to Parliament.

These state visits are a way for the Royal Family to use its soft power to positively influence diplomatic relations.

In February, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented Trump with an invitation from the King for a second state visit to the U.K.. So far, no date for the trip has been announced, but the King's meetings with Trudeau and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly irritated Trump.

It remains to be seen how King Charles navigates his constitutional role as both king of the United Kingdom and of Canada. Will Trump's state visit only be about British interests? Or will Charles use it as a chance to address the concerns of his Canadian subjects?

Authorities have charged a 47-year-old Colorado woman after her mother with dementia was allegedly mauled by dogs residing in what they deemed 'unsanitary conditions.'

Jessica Hoff has been charged with criminal negligence resulting in death and 54 counts of aggravated animal cruelty, according to the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office. Her arrest on Friday followed a February 3 call reporting an unconscious woman.

Deputies arrived to find 76-year-old LaVonne Hoff unresponsive, with multiple dogs roaming freely inside the home and two dozen more on the property. She was pronounced dead at the scene, NBC News reported. 

Investigators determined that Jessica Hoff had left her mother- who required 24-hour care for dementia-alone while running errands. During that time, the dogs attacked LaVonne inside the home. An autopsy confirmed the cause of death as a dog attack.

Authorities later searched Jessica Hoff's home and a second property in Colorado City, discovering a total of 54 dogs and seven birds. Many of the animals were found in unsanitary conditions, with several dogs in poor health.

A disturbing video has surfaced of a woman being brutally attacked on a crowded train platform in Calgary, Canada, with bystanders failing to intervene. The footage has gone viral, sparking widespread outrage and allegations of racism, as the victim appears to be of Indian descent. 

The footage shows the man, identified as Braydon Joseph James French, grabbing the woman's jacket, repeatedly shaking her. He then grabbed her water bottle, splashed water on her face, slammed her into transit shelter walls, and demanded her phone while violently shaking her. The assailant fled the scene without taking her phone, allowing the woman to contact the authorities. Bystanders witnessed the attack but failed to intervene.

Here's the video:

Russia said on Tuesday it was willing to strike a new agreement on the safety of shipping in the Black Sea - a possible stepping stone towards a ceasefire with Ukraine - but only if the United States ordered President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to respect it.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said only such an order would provide the assurances that Russia needed.

Each side criticised the other over the collapse in 2023 of an earlier agreement intended to ensure the safety of merchant shipping in the Black Sea after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

""We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskiy and his team to do one thing and not the other,"" Lavrov said in televised comments.

""And it seems to me that our American partners have received this signal. They understand that only Washington can achieve positive results in stopping terrorist attacks, stopping shelling of civilian infrastructure, energy infrastructure not related to the military-industrial complex.""

Russia frequently accuses Ukraine of ""terrorist"" actions and Kyiv has often used similar language in response to Russian attacks that have killed thousands of civilians in Ukraine during three years of war.

Lavrov's comments indicated that Russia will demand a further tightening of U.S. pressure on Zelenskiy before it will agree to a maritime ceasefire, which Washington says would be an important step towards a more comprehensive truce.

Zelenskiy and Trump had a disastrous meeting in the White House last month, and Kyiv and its European allies fear Trump could seal a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that gives in to Russian demands and undermines their security.

The maritime ceasefire under discussion would be a successor to the earlier Black Sea deal that had allowed Ukraine to safely export nearly 33 million metric tons of grain despite the war.

Moscow withdrew in 2023, saying its own food and fertiliser exports faced serious issues because of Western sanctions affecting payments, logistics and insurance. Kyiv had earlier accused Russia of obstructing the initiative.

Lavrov said the market for grain and fertiliser needed to be ""predictable"". He said Russia could not take Zelenskiy at his word, a charge Zelenskiy often levels at Putin.

The Black Sea initiative was the priority of discussions at a meeting between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Lavrov added.

The Kremlin said earlier on Tuesday that both Russia and the U.S. were analysing the outcome of the talks, but the details would not be made public.

Ukraine's national broadcaster Suspilne cited a source as saying Ukrainian and U.S. officials would meet in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday.

When Trump and Putin spoke last week, the Russian leader declined a proposal by the U.S. president for a full 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but agreed to a moratorium on attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Ukraine says it is ready to join a limited energy ceasefire if it is properly documented.

A North Carolina man, who says he is ""blind,"" has been charged with murder after he called 911 to report three deaths, the People reported.

The Bladen County Sheriff's Office (BCSO) reported in a Facebook post on Tuesday, March 18, that a shooting was reported at a home in Clarkton the previous day. Upon arrival, deputies found Kevin Musser at the front door, wearing blood-stained clothing and holding a handgun.

According to a report by WECT, Musser, 35, was the one who made the initial 22-minute 911 call. During the call, he falsely identified himself as ""Randy"" and claimed that three men had been shot and killed inside the residence. He also alleged that he had been shot in the hand.

Musser further claimed to be ""blind"" and told authorities the victims were already ""beyond help,"" WECT reported.

When deputies arrived, Musser briefly shut the door and attempted to escape through the back but was quickly arrested. He was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, while authorities discovered the bodies of three men inside the home.



The victims, identified as Daniel Dennis, 62, Randy Benton, 54, and Phillip Palmer, 32, all suffered multiple stab wounds, according to the BCSO.

Following an interview with the sheriff's Criminal Investigation Division, Musser was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and possession of methamphetamine, as per a March 19 update from the BCSO.

Law & Crime also reported that Musser is accused of stealing a victim's wallet.

As of March 19, Musser remains in custody at the Bladen County Detention Center without bond. It is unclear if he has legal representation.

Amid a heated legal dispute, a 2021 photo featuring Rippling's Prasanna Sankar, his estranged wife Dhivya Sashidhar, and Sam Altman has resurfaced on X. The image, originally from November 2021, is now circulating as Sankar publicly accuses Sashidhar of infidelity and filing false police complaints.

The resurfaced post was captioned: ""Super inspiring to meet @sama for dinner tonight at our place. @dhivsash and I loved the conversation.""

In a series of posts on X, Prasanna Sankar accused his wife, Dhivya, of having an affair with a married man named Anoop for over six months. He claimed he discovered the relationship after receiving screenshots of their conversations from Anoop's wife.

Beyond the infidelity allegations, Sankar stated that after they began negotiating their divorce, Dhivya filed multiple false complaints against him, including accusations of domestic violence and rape. He asserted that Singaporean authorities investigated the claims and cleared him of all charges.

Sankar further accused Dhivya of abducting their 9-year-old son despite a court ruling in his favor. He alleged that she took the child to the U.S., prompting him to file an international child abduction case. ""The judge ruled in my favor, ordering the return of the child,"" he wrote.

Prasanna Sankar is the co-founder of Rippling, a San Francisco-based HR tech company valued at $10 billion. Originally from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, he is an Indian-origin entrepreneur now based in Singapore. However, according to his LinkedIn profile, he left Rippling in 2020. 

Sankar pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT Trichy), where he met his wife.

Before founding Rippling, he worked at leading tech firms, including an internship at Google in 2006 and a role at Microsoft Canada.

Since January 2023, he has been leading 0xPPL, a decentralized social network focused on crypto communities, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Highlighting his passion for programming, Sankar shares on LinkedIn: ""I used to do a lot of programming contests: I was ranked #1 in India at TopCoder while in college, was a two-time Google Code Jam world finalist, and a two-time ACM ICPC world finalist.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Conspiracy Probe After Kunal Kamra Mocks Eknath Shinde","https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/eknath-shinde-kunal-kamra-supari-for-comedy-conspiracy-probe-after-kunal-kamra-mocks-eknath-shinde-8004769","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:47:42 GMT","

Mumbai Police are investigating if Kunal Kamra's jokes targeting Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde were part of a conspiracy and whether the comic received money or any other form of help to mock the Maharashtra Chief Minister, sources have said.

A team from Khar police station visited Kunal Kamra's Mumbai home, where his parents stay, with a summons, asking the comic to appear for questioning in connection with the cases against him. Since the comic is believed to have left the state, the summons has been sent to his WhatsApp number too. Kamra faces multiple charges, including defamation and statements conducing to public mischief.

According to Mumbai police sources, they are trying to find out if Kunal received money or any other help to target Eknath Shinde. They are also probing if someone helped the comic write the lines he used against the Sena chief. Police have said Kunal Kamra's phone and other devices may be examined during the probe.

In a show shot at Mumbai's Habitat studio, Kunal Kamra targeted Mr Shinde with a parody of 'Bholi Si Surat', a popular song from the 1997 blockbuster Dil To Pagal Hai. He used the 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe against the Shiv Sena leader, who led a rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray in 2022, bringing down his government and splitting the party.

Upset with the remarks, Shiv Sena workers vandalised the studio, a preferred venue for stand-up comedy shows. Mr Shinde has said he did not support the vandalism, but cited party workers' sentiments and said, ""every action has a reaction"". He has also asked who gave Kunal Kamra ""supari"" to target him. 

Besides the vandalism, the studio also faced a demolition exercise with civic officials alleging building law violations. The studio announced it has decided to shut down for now and said it was not responsible for the content in performers' shows. ""We have never been involved in the content performed by any Artist, but the recent events have made us rethink about how we get blamed and targeted every time almost like we are a proxy for the performer,"" it said.

In a statement issued late last night, Kunal Kamra said the studio or any political party was not responsible for his remarks. ""An entertainment venue is merely a platform. A space for all sorts of shows. Habitat (or any other venue) is not responsible for my comedy, nor does it have any power or control over what I say or do. Neither does any political party. Attacking a venue for a comedian's words is as senseless as overturning a lorry carrying tomatoes, because you didn't like the butter chicken you were served,"" he said in a post on X.

He said he does not fear the mob and won't be hiding. The comic said he was willing to cooperate with police and courts. ""But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke? And against the unelected members of the BMC, who have arrived today at Habitat, without prior notice, and tore the place down with hammers?"" he asked.

The Opposition, meanwhile, has backed the comic and slammed the Maharashtra government for going after him. Uddhav Thackeray, Mr Shinde's former boss, said Kunal Kamra has told the truth. ""It was not satire. Those who steal are 'gaddar'. There is no 'freedom of expression' when it comes to traitors,"" the Sena (UBT) chief has said.

Former US secretary of state makes remark on X amid scandal over use of private server for classified information

Hillary Clinton – the former US secretary of state who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump amid a scandal over her use of a private server for classified emails – reacted to Monday's news of a leak of highly sensitive military plans at the White House by saying: “You have got to be kidding me.”

Clinton punctuated her reaction on the X platform with an eyes emoji and a link to an Atlantic article that revealed how Trump officials inadvertently broadcast plans of US airstrikes on Houthi rebels through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.

Trump and his supporters criticized her ruthlessly for her classified emails and private server use before and after he defeated her in the presidential election nine years earlier, even calling for her to be imprisoned.

Among them were some of the participants in the group chat reported on by the Atlantic: the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the Central Intelligence Agency director, John Ratcliffe; and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz.

“If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now,” ex-Fox News host Hegseth said on his former network in 2016, as CNN showed in a montage which went viral Monday night.

That same year, Rubio remarked on Fox: “Nobody is above the law – not even Hillary Clinton, even though she thinks she is.”

In 2019, Ratcliffe told Fox: “Mishandling classified information is still a violation of the Espionage Act.”

And in a 2023 CNN appearance, Waltz complained about the lack of prosecution over “the Clinton emails”.

All were appointed to Trump's cabinet after he won his second presidency in November.

On Monday, the White House confirmed the leak reported by the Atlantic but essentially insisted it had been harmless, demonstrating “deep and thoughtful coordination between senior officials”.

“The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security,” White House spokesperson Brian Hughes told the Guardian.

Hegseth, meanwhile, insulted the Atlantic journalist who was inadvertently brought into his Signal chat, Jeffrey Goldberg, as “a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes”. Hegseth asserted: “Nobody was texting war plans,” prompting Goldberg to respond on MSNBC by saying he had seen a “minute-by-minute accounting” of plans to bomb targets in Yemen associated with Houthis.

Asked Monday for his take on Goldberg's report, Trump claimed: “I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of the Atlantic … but I know nothing about it.”

By Tuesday, he reportedly told NBC News that Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man”. He also echoed Hughes in claiming Goldberg's presence in the Signal chat “had no impact at all” on the ensuing military operation.

Clinton served as secretary of state under former president Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013.

As she ran for the presidency, the FBI's then-director James Comey said there was evidence Clinton had either sent or received 113 emails on a private server with information that was classified at the time of the correspondence. Information in another 2,000 emails or so was later classified.

Comey said Clinton had been “extremely careless” but had not acted in a way rising to the level of criminal charges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Defence secretary, US vice-president and senior Trump advisers wrote openly about the strikes on Yemen

US defence secretary

The appointment of the Fox News host to head the Pentagon was highly controversial. A former Army National Guard officer, Pete Hegseth, 44, has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement and alcohol abuse.

His contributions to the group chat include suggesting that because Americans were unfamiliar with the Houthi armed group in Yemen that messaging could instead focus on the alleged failures of the former US president Joe Biden.

He also appeared to be one of the most gung-ho participants, warning: “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza ceasefire falls apart – and we don't get to start this on our own terms.” Hegseth also makes references to enforcing “100%” operational security in the event the action was paused, despite the fact it was already compromised by a journalist's presence in the group.

Most alarming, however, was Hegseth's sharing of a “TEAM UPDATE” the Atlantic decided not to publish because of the risk it said that it posed to US servicemen and operations in the Middle East.

US vice-president

The 40-year-old served as a press officer in Iraq for six months in a non-combat role before studying law at Yale and beginning his political career after the success of his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

In the chat, Vance, who has often appeared as Trump's tag team partner, not least in the Oval Office pile-on of Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, displays more independence of thought in the conversation.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate-to-severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

Later in the chat he reinforces his animus towards Europe, previously seen at the Munich Security Conference, in a message responding to Hegseth: “If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”

Senior Trump adviser

Miller, 39, a longtime bete noire for liberals due to his incendiary views on immigration and other issues, was also seen as an intellectual architect of efforts to block the election of Joe Biden in 2020, suggesting publicly that slates of “alternate” electors be sent to Congress.

Identified by the Atlantic as SM in the conversation, he intervenes to insist that the president has already been clear about the decision to attack Yemen, suggesting that he speaks for Trump and with his authority.

“As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. Eg, if Europe doesn't remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”

National security adviser

A former Republican member of Congress and special forces soldier who served overseas, Waltz, like other former military personnel in the chat, including Vance, Hegseth, and the director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, should have been aware of the breach of operational security involved in the chat.

It was Waltz, the Atlantic suggests, who erroneously invited Jeffrey Goldberg on Signal to take part in the war planning group.

Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, is also involved in negotiations with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, over a Ukraine ceasefire plan. Witkoff contributes congratulatory emojis after the Yemen attack. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, reported contribution amounts largely to offering congratulations on the operation, and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, offers “kudos”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Luigi Mangione's lawyers want computer for him to review case materials in deadly shooting of Brian Thompson

The accused killer of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes – not for communicating with anyone – as he awaits trial.

In a court filing made public late on Monday, Luigi Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding Thompson's deadly shooting on 4 December. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.

Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's “no connection to Mr Mangione for any of said alleged threats”.

Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.

An Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He has not entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.

Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.

But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans' frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.

Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.

Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.

If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.

Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there are not enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

In an interview on his cross-country tour, the senator said Americans are ‘very disturbed' by the chaos in Washington

Bernie Sanders said Donald Trump has “absolutely” created a constitutional crisis in the United States and is pushing the country “very rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society”.

The independent senator from Vermont has been rallying the anti-Trump resistance on a cross-country “Fight Oligarchy” tour, drawing some of the largest crowds of his decades-long political career as he taps into rising anger over the president's stunning power grabs.

In an interview after an event in Tempe, Arizona, on Thursday night, Sanders accused Trump of “illegally” attempting to dissolve government agencies, including via an executive order, signed hours before the senator took the stage, to dismantle the US Department of Education, which cannot be done without the approval of Congress. He also pointed to the Trump administration's defiance of a federal judge's order not to deport a group of Venezuelan immigrants.

“So yes, I think we are in the midst of the constitutional crisis,” Sanders said.

In the dizzying two months since Trump returned to power, Sanders is packing venues across the country – in Republican-held districts and swing states Democrats lost in 2024. The senator said Americans were clearly “very disturbed” by the daily turmoil in Washington, and that they felt squeezed, stressed and desperate for leaders who are willing to fight for them.

“For years, I've talked about the concept of oligarchy as an abstraction,” Sanders said. But he believes the message hits harder now that Elon Musk, the world's richest person who donated nearly $300m to elect Trump and other Republicans in 2024, is leading the administration's government-slashing effort that includes overhauls of veterans' services and social security. “You've gotta be kind of blind not to understand that you have a government of the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, by the billionaire class.”

Locked out of power in Washington, the opposition party must learn to fight harder, Sanders said, echoing the calls of angry constituents across the country.

“There's got to be more militancy in the Congress in making Republicans pay a price in one way or another for what they're doing,” Sanders said, calling the Democrats' support for the GOP-written spending bill a “disaster”.

Despite his criticism, Sanders has refused to engage with questions about the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is facing calls for his resignation after he paved the way for the bill without extracting any concessions. During an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Sanders dismissed as “nonsense” a question about whether the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should run for the Senate, which some have suggested is a way to primary Schumer. Schumer has remained defiant, and cited his early encouragement of Sanders' cross-country tour as an example of his strong leadership instincts.

In the interview, Sanders, a progressive who caucuses with the Democrats and has twice sought the party's nomination, argued that Democrats' troubles run much deeper than one person or one decision.

“The problem is the Democratic party has no grassroots,” he said in the interview on Thursday. Gesturing to the overflow crowd that turned out to his rally with Ocasio-Cortez in Arizona, he said of his colleagues: “You tell me how many people are going out?”

Sanders' popularity comes at a moment when approval of the Democratic party is at record lows.

In his view, the party's descent traces the rise of money in politics, which over time made Democrats reliant on wealthy donors and inside-the-Beltway consultants. While he credited the party with ushering in progress on social issues such as civil rights, women's rights and LGBTQ+ rights, the senator said Democrats have for too long failed to champion an economic agenda that would meaningfully address the concerns of working-class people – an assessment many leaders roundly rejected.

Yet after decades of warning against the ills of corporate concentration and rising wealth inequality, Sanders, a big smile spreading across his face, said he was “noticing” that more of his colleagues were starting to adopt his populist pitch.

“My colleagues are not dumb people. They are by and large very, very smart people. And you've got to be deaf, dumb and blind, not to analyze the solution,” he said, noting that Democrats not only lost support among working-class voters, but saw their support decline with young people and Latinos – key parts of the party's electoral coalition. “They see those things, they read the polls. And I think some of them at least understand that there has to be a turn around, and they've got to start addressing the needs of working-class people.”

At 83, Sanders has all but ruled out a third presidential run. His joint appearances with Ocasio-Cortez last weekend generated speculation about her political future and whether she was prepared to assume the mantle of his progressive movement.

In the interview, Sanders reflected on how much the movement had grown since he was first elected to Congress in 1990 and co-founded the Progressive caucus: “There are dozens and dozens of really strong progressives out there who are, I think, going to be the future political leaders.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

A former New York Yankees player and his wife say they have “many questions” and “few answers” after their youngest son fell ill and died during a family vacation.

Miller Gardner – the son of Brett and Jessica Gardner – was 14.

Miler Gardner died in his sleep on Friday morning, according to a statement from the couple that was released by the Yankees on Sunday. Costa Rica's judicial investigation agency reportedly told NBC News that the boy seemingly died by asphyxia “after a possible intoxication after apparently ingesting some food”.

The cause of death was preliminary, and officials are awaiting an autopsy and an analysis of toxicology testing results, NBC reported.

Miller Gardner's body was found in a hotel room in the popular Costa Rican resort area of Manuel Antonio, on the country's Pacific coast.

The Gardners' statement said their family had “so many questions and so few answers at this point”.

“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” Jessica and Brett Gardner said in the release. “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

The Yankees said their organization was “filled with grief”.

“Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss,” a statement from the team said. “It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years – so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”

Brett Gardner, 41, was drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and spent his entire Major League Baseball career – from 2008 to 2021 – with the organization. The outfielder helped the Yankees win a World Series championship in 2009, and was a popular figure in the clubhouse and with the team's fans.

President says national adviser Mike Waltz had ‘learned a lesson'; senate intelligence committee chair criticizes handling of classified information

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dodged questions about her involvement in the Signal group chat to which an Atlantic journalist was added.

“Senator, I don't want to get into this,” Gabbard said when Senator Mark Warner asked if she had participated in the chat.

She has repeatedly said there was no classified information in the conversation.

Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel declined to say whether the bureau would investigate claims that cabinet members improperly leaked national security information in the chat.

“I was just briefed about it late last night, this morning. I don't have an update”, said Patel.

Warner asked for an update “by the end of the day”.

Senator Angus King pressed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on why climate change was not included as a national security threat in the report.

“We recognize environmental changes and their potential impact on operations, but our focus remains on the direct threats to people's health, wellbeing, and security,” Gabbard said.

King rebutted by saying that climate change exacerbates mass migration, famine, displacement, and political violence.

Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, should resign amid Monday's leak.

Wyden called the Signal chat “obviously reckless, obviously dangerous, both the mishandling of classified information and the deliberate destruction of federal records or potential crimes that ought to be investigated immediately”.

“I'm of the view that there ought to be resignation, starting with the national security adviser and the secretary of defense, Director Radcliffe and Director Gabbard,” Wyden said.

Democratic senator Mark Warner grilled Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen.

Gabbard claims that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

Ratcliffe said that, when he was confirmed as CIA director, he was briefed by agency officials about “the use of Signal as a permissible work use” and “a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration”.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, delivered the intelligence community's annual threat assessment, listing China's military, Mexico's drug trade and Russia's nuclear weapons among some of the most alarming threats to the country's national security.

Before FBI director Kash Patel began his remarks, a protester yelled “Stop funding Israel!”

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, called the protester a “lunatic”.

Democratic senator Mark Warner went on to describe the leaking of the Yemen war plans in a Signal group chat as part of a pattern of actions taken by the second Trump administration that weakens US national security.

“I can just say this. If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired, as I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error,” said Warner, the Senate intelligence committee's vice-chairman.

He outlined a litany of grievances against the Trump administration, from its cancellation of foreign aid to its firing of probationary federal employees.

“No, the Signal fiasco is not a one-off. It is, unfortunately, a pattern we're seeing too often repeated. I fear that we feel the erosion of trust, from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners, [which] can't be put back in the bottle overnight. Make no mistake, these actions make America less safe,” he said.

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, largely confined his opening remarks to warning of the threats posed from traditional enemies such as Iran and China, while implying that the intelligence community had lost its focus under Joe Biden.

“Given these threats, we have to ask, are our intelligence agencies well postured against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is no, at least not yet. As the world became more dangerous in recent years, our intelligence agencies got more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions rather than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we've been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said.

News that the Atlantic's top editor was added to a group chat where US national security officials discussed their plans to bomb Yemen is looming over the Senate intelligence committee's annual hearing into global threats facing the United States.

Among the guests at the hearing are two reported members of the group chat, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, the CIA director. As the hearing began, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee, condemned the leak.

“Yesterday, we stunningly learned that senior members of this administration, and according to reports, two of our witnesses here today, were members of a group chat that discussed highly sensitive, likely classified information that supposedly even included weapons packages, targets and timing, and included the name of an active CIA agent,” Warner said.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me, all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101.”

Warner called Monday's leak “one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information”. He also called it a “pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information”.

“The erosion of trust from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners can't be put back in the bottle overnight,” he added.

Democratic senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, began his remarks by condemning the reckless use of a messaging app to discuss a sensitive military strike in Yemen.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” he said, “it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101. Who are all the names? Who are they? Well, it apparently included a journalist.”

The Senate intelligence committee has started its “World Wide Threats” hearing.

The hearing comes a day after the controversial leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen via a messaging app.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, director of the FBI, are appearing before the panel.

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Yesterday, Donald Trump said he was unaware of the alleged US data breach, but he did share a joke his close ally Elon Musk made on X in a post on his Truth Social platform.

The UK's deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has reacted to the alleged US data breach.

Rayner told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that she “doesn't have much more to add” in response to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly accusing Europe of “free-loading” off the US.

Rayner said, “I don't recognise that there is a challenge between the UK and US relations, they are as strong as they've always been.”

Rayner added that “people say things in private messaging” and insisted it was “for the vice-president to decide and to clarify what he means by those conversations”.

My colleague Peter Beaumont has noted five things US adversaries could learn from today's White House leaks.

“Friendly and hostile governments alike will also have learned that what Vance, Hegseth and others say in public – in disparaging Europe, for example – they say in private, too.

“Any notion that the Trump administration's bark is worse than its bite should be thoroughly disabused by the contempt expressed by Vance for Europe and by the transactional nature of the conversation.”

Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Britain is a “freeloading” country that expects the US to meet its defence needs.

At the lobby briefing this morning, prime minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson spoke at length about the contribution the UK makes to joint military operations with the Americans, following the extraordinary leak of messages showing the contempt President Trump's most senior allies have for Europe's record on defence.

But the spokesperson also refused to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical, JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

At the lobby briefing this morning, asked if Britain was a pathetic freeloader, the PM's spokesperson replied:

You can see, from the way in which the UK has worked closely with the US, supplying regional security and defence, our commitment to working with the US on matters of regional security.

You'll know the UK provided air-to-air refuelling support for recent strikes against Houthi key rebel targets [the raid discussed in the messages inadvertently shared with Godlberg].

We also continue to support the US-led coalition against Daesh with routine combat air patrol over Iraq and Syria.

And we'll continue to work with the US and other allies to ensure stability and security in the Middle East.

Asked again if Britons were freeloaders, the spokesperson repeated the point about the UK working with the US closely in the Middle East.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Tech CEO accused of aiming to privatize space and satellite operations as federal agencies reportedly seek contracts

Elon Musk appears to be laying the groundwork to privatize some space and satellite operations now under the authority of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), or steer lucrative contracts toward his SpaceX and Starlink companies, former agency employees say.

They're sounding the alarm as at least four other federal agencies have reportedly begun pushing new contracts toward Musk's Starlink satellite internet company. Musk, the world's richest man, has been tasked by Donald Trump with drastically slashing the federal government workforce and costs.

The situation raises conflict of interest questions for one of Trump's closest allies who backed him with millions of dollars of funding in the 2024 election. Musk boasts that his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) “slashes spending”, but critics say he's using his position to steer government funding toward his companies.

Noaa could offer the biggest prizes yet for Musk, presenting the opportunity for SpaceX to have a commanding financial advantage in a commercial US space market expected to grow to a value of nearly $2tn in value over the next decade. Already Doge likely has access to competitors' confidential business information at Noaa, former employees at the agency say.

More importantly for the public, it would put control of the nation's communications infrastructure in the hands of a rightwing billionaire. Noaa's activity quietly touches the basic functions of daily life, and everything from dependable cellphone service to how Americans connect to the internet to weather forecasting is at stake, five former Noaa employees who spoke with the Guardian said.

“There's a lot of smoke but we're not sure where the fire is yet,” a former employee said. “We're waiting to see when the next shoe drops.”

In the wake of a firing spree that gutted some Noaa space operations, Donald Trump Jr's investment firm stoked speculation by purchasing $50m worth of SpaceX shares. Noaa operates as part of the US commerce department and is responsible for a range of economic activity relied upon by the public. Musk's Doge team has laid off about 1,300 Noaa staff so far.

SpaceX primarily launches rockets and satellites for Musk and national governments. Starlink, meanwhile, has nearly 6,000 satellites in low-earth orbit and provides satellite broadband internet service and military communications to at least 2.7 million people in 100 countries.

SpaceX is the biggest player in the private space industry and several former Noaa employees praised the company as an often good partner prior to Musk's attack on the agency. The space technology company had strong momentum prior to the new Trump administration, making it difficult to parse what is legitimate business and what could be construed as corruption, former employees said.

A new emergency Freedom of Information Act request for communications among Noaa offices and Doge in part seeks to shine some light on those questions. The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) request noted that privatization of the agency has long been a goal of the right and was called for in the Project 2025 rightwing playbook. The move “is driven by greed and corruption”, Peer's executive director, Tim Whitehouse, said.

“The danger is that Musk's enterprises could morph into government-sponsored monopolies that would operate with no fear of antitrust prosecution,” Whitehouse added.

Leadership for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered staff in February to find tens of millions of dollars in funding for new Starlink contracts, Rolling Stone reported. The FAA is in the process of updating ageing air traffic control networks and last year awarded a $2.4bn contract to Verizon, but Starlink has already edged into the process.

At the US Government Services Administration, Doge ordered federal staff to use Starlink for internet services, an employee told NBC News. Another agency plans to contract with Starlink, according to a federal employee familiar with the situation who spoke with NBC News. Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protection recently authorized an evaluation of Starlink to help monitor the border.

The nascent space traffic coordination program manages thousands of satellites, debris and spacecraft, and helps prevent up to 50,000 near-collisions, called conjunctions, daily. Starlink accounts for a large number of those.

Called the Traffic Coordination System for Space (Traccs), the program would also eventually provide launch and re-entry services for commercial satellites and spacecraft, former employees said. Musk's company already works closely with Traccs, but the program has avoided “vendor lock” and contracts with multiple companies, in no small part because Musk's agenda may not always align with the nation's, one former official said.

“SpaceX is a great service provider, but as long as he's in control of the company it's not anything that can be counted on,” a former Noaa employee said.

Those who spoke with the Guardian said it didn't appear that SpaceX had any interest in privatizing or taking over Traccs prior to Trump's re-election, but Musk's Doge fired all but one Traccs member – in effect crippling a sorely needed operation. That could open the door for privatization, and SpaceX is best positioned.

“They discover something is broken and conveniently say: ‘Oh, we can fix this,'” a former Noaa employee said.

Noaa satellites in lower-earth orbit are largely utilized to forecast weather three to seven days out, and the data is given for free to weather forecasting providers such as AccuWeather, and utilized in aviation, shipping, defense and other critical industries.

Some companies want to profit off the data, and few are better positioned than Musk's to land contracts or take over. But private industry's data and forecasts are of extremely poor quality compared to those from the Noaa, a former employee said.

Noaa weather satellites have redundancies and fail-safes intentionally built in, and huge effort is put into calibrating them with weather on earth: Noaa flies planes into storms to confirm that the data its satellites are providing is accurate, for example.

The data is “highly reliable, 24/7, no breakdowns, no ifs, ands or buts”, a former agency employee said. If Noaa satellites fail, explode or crash, they added, then people who rely on that data may die, or serious economic damage may be inflicted.

“The risk of having outages is so significant because that data is used all the time for everything, and for far more than people realize,” a former employee said.

Musk, by contrast, has a mission of eliminating redundancies and finding efficiencies, and former agency employees noted his rockets and satellites have a history of crashing and exploding.

Meanwhile, Noaa monitors space weather, including solar flares, coronas and radiation, and geomagnetic storms that can damage the electric grid and telecommunications on earth and beyond. That could have implications for Musk's well-known plans to colonize Mars.

“If you're serious about sending people to Mars, then you have to be able to monitor and respond to space weather,” an employee said.

SpaceX, telecom giants and other industries are lobbying the federal government to auction off valuable bands on the radio frequency spectrum – the electromagnetic waves that enable wireless communication, including among the military, the CIA, Noaa and their satellites.

The obscure function is essential to a wide range of commercial activities, such as cellphone use, and industry “wants to get their hands on all that they can” because it's a finite resource, a former agency employee said.

A large part of Noaa's forecasts stem from its satellites monitoring water vapor movement in the atmosphere, and the agency owns the radio frequencies at which vapor vibrates. If the Musk-aligned FCC sells bands too close to that frequency, potential interference could impede satellite function and disrupt reliable weather forecasting and cellphone use.

“Starlink wants more and more spectrum, and you hope [the FCC] would not be stupid enough to auction off the bands next to where water vibrates, but … I wouldn't put it past anybody,” an employee said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A major security leak is triggering bipartisan outrage after the Atlantic revealed that senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.

According to the Atlantic, the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally invited into a Signal chat group with more than a dozen senior Trump administration officials – including the vice-president, JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and others.

The group discussed secret military plans for recent US attacks on the Houthi armed group in Yemen.

The leak has shocked people across the political spectrum. The minority Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, called it “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time”. He urged Republicans to seek a full investigation.

What did Hegseth say? On Monday Hegseth said that “nobody was texting war plans” and attacked Goldberg as “deceitful and highly discredited” without refuting any specifics from the Atlantic story.

An appeals court judge claimed on Monday that Nazis were given more rights to contest their removal from the United States during the second world war than Venezuelan migrants deported by the Trump administration.

The comments came during a contentious hearing shortly after a lower court thwarted the Trump administration's effort to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court rejected its use and ruled accused migrants must get hearings first.

What does the administration claim? That the Alien Enemies Act, which permits deportation of foreign nationals during wars or invasions, is applicable because the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua's activities constitute an “invasion”. But they have not provided solid evidence that those deported are even gang members: one is a 23-year-old gay makeup artist with no apparent gang affiliations.

Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 65 people in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including women, children and two journalists, the Palestinian health authority said on Monday, nearly a week after Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas.

Palestinians in Gaza have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel launched its new offensive in the territory, which started on Tuesday last week with a wave of airstrikes that killed about 700 people, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the territory run by Hamas – ending two months of relative calm in which many had returned north to their damaged homes.

How many people have been killed in the war? The Gaza health ministry said at least 50,082 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 had been wounded since the beginning of the war, which began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.

And how many journalists? More than 170 journalists and media workers have been killed since October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), whose director said in a statement: “This nightmare in Gaza has to end. The international community must act fast to ensure that journalists are kept safe and hold Israel to account.”

The discovery of underground ovens and 200 pairs of shoes in what activists call an “extermination camp” has horrified Mexico, sparking protests and spotlighting the more than 120,000 people registered as missing.

Ukraine has accused Moscow of making “hollow statements about peace” after 88 people were injured in a Russian missile attack, as US and Russian officials began talks in Saudi Arabia.

Turkish authorities arrested more than 1,100 people, including journalists, after tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests.

Swedish shoppers boycotted major supermarkets for seven days, protesting over “runaway” food price rises.

Tesla car sales slumped in Europe last month, reflecting a backlash over Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. The carmaker sold fewer than 16,000 vehicles across Europe last month, down 44%, according to Jato Dynamics. Meanwhile, police in Texas said they found and seized “incendiary devices” at a Tesla dealership in Austin yesterday.

It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers: why can't people remember early childhood? Freud called the phenomenon infantile amnesia, and for many years scientists wondered whether it resulted from trouble in creating or retrieving memories. Now, research appears to suggest an answer.

US honeybee deaths have hit record highs, with some commercial beekeepers reporting the loss of 60% of their colonies on average over winter, a survey found. It's pushing many beekeepers close to ruin. “There's no one single thing affecting honeybees but we are trying to figure out what the most important stresses are right now,” said Scott McArt, a Cornell associate professor.

Derek Harris has lived in Sharrington, England, for 50 years. In January he heard that the telecoms firm BT would be withdrawing the village's telephone box. But he and other campaigners argued it was an “iconic heritage asset,” and vital to combat poor phone signal. Yesterday, BT backtracked: the village's red box will stay connected.

US Department of Agriculture calls in university to help study decline as Trump administration staff cuts sting

Honeybee deaths have hit record highs in the US, with the unprecedented loss of colonies pushing many beekeepers close to ruin as scientists scramble to identify the main cause of the huge declines.

Commercial beekeepers have reported losing more than 60% of their colonies, on average, over the winter, according to an ongoing Project Apis m. survey that covers more than two-thirds of America's managed bees.

This enormous rate of decline is higher than record reductions seen last year and is on track to be the “biggest loss of honeybee colonies in US history”, according to Scott McArt, an associate professor of entomology at Cornell University.

McArt said that the extraordinary rate of loss became apparent during this winter's mass movement of honeybee hives to California to pollinate the vast almond crop there.

Honeybees, although introduced to the US, have become vital to the agricultural system by pollinating half of all crops, including apples, berries, pumpkins, melons and cherries. Beekeepers are increasingly struggling to maintain the bee numbers necessary to undertake this work.

“Something real bad is going on this year,” said McArt. “We have been seeing high losses year after year but if anything it is getting worse, which is troubling. Some places are having devastating losses and there was a shortfall in pollination in some almond orchards this year. Whether these impacts will cascade to other crops remains to be seen, it's certainly possible.”

The latest honeybee losses are valued at $139m and have come as the honey price has climbed by 5% amid a drop in honey production. Many beekeepers are now struggling to absorb these shortfalls, with some going out of business altogether.

“It's all gone,” said one beekeeper in response to the Project Apis m. survey. “The equity on the house is gone, our retirement is gone, the family member's money is gone. All that's left are empty boxes. We don't even have the dead bees. They are gone too.”

A certain portion of a colony typically perishes over their more moribund winter months but this rate of loss was typically only around 10% or 20% until around two decades ago when a phenomena called colony collapse disorder, where colonies completely disappear or die, started to emerge in the US. Now, typically half of all colonies are lost on average.

Scientists have ascertained that the climate crisis, habitat loss and pesticide use have badly affected all bees, the vast majority in the US being 4,000 native, wild species rather than honeybees. For managed honeybees, a lack of nutrition, poor handling practices and rampant infestation by varroa mites, a type of parasite, and diseases have also taken their toll.

The loss of bees, both captive and wild, in the US is already starting to limit the supply of some food crops and is reducing the yield of honey. The declines are part of a broader crisis in the insect world where species are being wiped out at an alarming rate. Researchers warn that the loss of insects imperils basic functions of life on Earth, such as food production, the flowering of plants and waste disposal.

The latest, record leap in honeybee losses is now being investigated by staff at the US Department of Agriculture, which is analyzing bees, wax and pollen to determine if parasites and viruses are to blame for the deaths.

However, cuts in staff numbers by Donald Trump's administration has required Cornell University to step in and take on further required research to determine if the samples have been affected by pesticides. It will take around a month before scientists haver a better idea as to the main drivers of the latest losses.

“There's no one single thing affecting honeybees but we are trying to figure out what the most important stresses are right now,” said McArt. “There are a suspicions of a lot of things at the moment, you should see my inbox right now. There are theories about a new virus bring involved but we have to gather the data. We can't rule anything out at this stage.”

The record loss of honeybees follows figures released last year showing that, conversely, there are now an all-time high number of honeybee colonies in the US – 3.8m, around 1m more than five years previously.

This is down to more people becoming interested in beekeeping, meaning that more colonies are being split and created, McArt said. “That is driving up colony numbers but it doesn't mean they are doing well,” he said.

“The colony loss rates are increasing, if anything, even though we are putting more supply into the system. Another important point is that we have very good evidence of range declines and even extinctions among wild pollinators, which aren't being managed by anyone.

“Comparing honeybees and wild bees is like comparing a chicken and a woodpecker. That doesn't mean honeybees, which are a part of agriculture like chickens, aren't beautiful. They bring a lot of joy to people and without their crop pollination we wouldn't be doing well at all.”

Mette Frederiksen says trip by members of the Trump administration ‘not what Greenland needs or wants'

Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has accused the US of putting “unacceptable pressure” on Greenland – which she has vowed to resist – before an unsolicited visit to the Arctic island by members of the Trump administration.

The White House surprised Nuuk and Copenhagen on Sunday by announcing that a US delegation led by the second lady, Usha Vance, would be arriving in Greenland later this week.

Also due to participate in the visit from Thursday to Saturday are the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, now embroiled in an embarrassing security leak, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright.

“I have to say that it is unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark in this situation. And it is pressure that we will resist,” Frederiksen told Danish channel TV 2 on Tuesday.

The Danish leader also dismissed the idea of the trip being a private visit, saying: “You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.”

Trump's threats to acquire Greenland, she said, should be taken seriously. “President Trump is serious … He wants Greenland. Therefore, it cannot be seen independently of anything else,” she told Danmarks Radio (DR).

She said: “It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs or what Greenland wants from a visit. Therefore, no matter how we twist it, it is a completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, the Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population, but it is also on Denmark and thus the kingdom.”

Copenhagen, Greenland's former colonial ruler, retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, which is still part of the kingdom of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire for the US to gain control over the island, which he has said is crucial for American security.

Greenland's prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, has accused Washington of “foreign interference” in relation to the planned visit, amid political uncertainty in the territory as coalition talks continue less than a fortnight after a general election.

The US president responded by saying the delegation had been invited by “officials” on the Greenlandic side. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he told reporters on Monday.

The Nuuk government, however, disputed that. “For the record, the Greenlandic government has not issued any invitations for visits, either official or private,” it said in a statement. “The current government is acting as an interim government pending the formation of a new coalition, and we have kindly requested all countries to respect this process.”

The territory is led by a caretaker government as the Greenlandic Democrats continue with coalition talks following an election earlier this month. On Monday, Greenland's most US and Trump-friendly party, Naleraq, left negotiations over their belief that Greenland should rapidly declare independence.

Kuno Fencker, a member of parliament for Naleraq, which came second to the Democrats in the election, said the party had been “thrown out” of coalition talks, in part because of the upcoming US visit.

“It has an effect because many of the members think that we, especially me, are selling the country to the US,” he said, adding that it was not in his authority to do so.

Accusing the Danish media of “fear-mongering” over the US and Trump, he said: “Divide and rule is being used extremely towards Greenland and fear-mongering about the United States. And especially Donald Trump is framed as the big villain, big bad wolf, here.”

The White House has said Waltz and Wright will visit the US space force base in Pituffik, in the north of Greenland, for briefings from US personnel, and they are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog-sled race.

The White House National Security Council has said the delegation aimed to “learn about Greenland, its culture, history and people”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

White House says both sides agree to ‘ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes'

The White House has just published two readouts from its talks with Russia and Ukraine, effectively announcing an agreement for a ceasefire at sea “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

It also said the two countries agreed to “develop measures for implementing” the earlier agreement to stop strikes against energy infrastructure, both statements said.

Ukraine and Russia will also “continue working toward achieving a durable and lasting peace,” the statements read.

In the Ukraine-specific readout, the White House also said the US confirmed it “remains committed to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.”

The Russia-specific document noted that the US would help “restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

Both versions ended stressing that “the United States reiterated President Donald J. Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict must stop, as the necessary step toward achieving an enduring peace settlement.”

“To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh,” they said.

US state secretary Marco Rubio just welcomed the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to Washington DC, but the entire media coverage of their meeting lasted exactly 36 seconds as they posed for a picture in front of their national flags.

They did not respond to questions from reporters.

The Ukrainian readout, posted by the Ministry of Defence on its Telegram account, confirms the main agreement, but contains some additional guidance not in the original text.

The statement, released in the name of defence minister Rustem Umerov, says that “the movement of Russian military vessels beyond the Eastern Black Sea will be considered a violation of the spirit of this agreement.”

It added it will also “be considered a violation of the obligations to ensure freedom of navigation in the Black Sea and a threat to the national security of Ukraine.”

“In such case, Ukraine will have the full right to exercise the right to self-defence,” it noted.

Curiously, it also goes further than the US statement on the energy strikes, saying that “all parties agreed to implement the agreements … on a complete ban on attacks on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine and Russia.”

The statement also added that “for the effective implementation of the agreements, it is important to hold additional technical consultations as soon as possible to agree on all the details and technical aspects of the implementation, monitoring and control of the agreements.”

Let's see what comes out of Russia.

It's worth noting that while we technically got two separate statements on US talks with Ukraine and Russia, they are very, very similar.

In fact, the key parts on ceasefire at sea and agreement “to develop measures for implementing” the ban on energy infrastructure strikes are literally the same to avoid any confusion in interpreting what has been agreed by the sides.

After US president Donald Trump spoke with Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier this month, the two sides issued completely different readouts, leading to confusion over the extent of the ban on strikes on infrastructure and whether it only covered energy, or also critical civilian infrastructure.

This time we get two very similar texts, only marginally customised to cover individual discussions: with Russia, on restoring its access to agricultural and fertiliser exports; with Ukraine on returning prisoners of war, civilian detainees, and forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

Let's see what details come out in further briefings we are surely going to get from the other sides of the agreement: Ukraine and Russia.

The White House has just published two readouts from its talks with Russia and Ukraine, effectively announcing an agreement for a ceasefire at sea “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

It also said the two countries agreed to “develop measures for implementing” the earlier agreement to stop strikes against energy infrastructure, both statements said.

“To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh,” they said.

The UK police investigating the fire of the electricity substation in Hayes that disrupted the operations of Heathrow airport and European air space last Friday have confirmed it found “no evidence to suggest that the incident was suspicious in nature.”

It said it was “no longer treating this as a potentially criminal matter,” supporting other partners as they look into what caused the fire.

“Should any relevant new information or evidence come to light it will be looked at and considered as appropriate,” they said.

Republican US senator Tommy Tuberville claimed in an interview with Fox Business earlier that Greenlanders are “all in on it,” referring to US plans to take control over the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

His comments sparked a furious reaction from Danish diplomats and lawmakers, adding fuel to the growing frustration with what they see as the US interference in Danish and Greenlandic politics.

Danish ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen told Tuberville in a social media post that he “simply got this wrong.”

“You have to revisit your facts on Greenland, including what the people want.

It is not respectful to send a delegation of senior officials at this time, when the Greenlandic politicians say that they do not want this visit.”

Rasmus Jarlov, outspoken chair of the defence committee in the Danish parliament, went further saying “it is very hard to deal with this.”

“The leader of Greenland viciously says no. Every single member of the Greenlandic parliament says no. They just had an election two weeks ago. No one who wants to be American was elected. Not a single one,” he said.

He added that a recent poll showed that 85% of Greenlanders are against leaving Denmark, and only 6% backed the move towards the US.

He continued:

“It is almost unanimous. Never has a NO been clearer.

Yet these [expletive] people just continue to lie and tell the American public that people in Greenland want to be part of the USA. And the American ‘journalists' let them get away with it.

It is unbelievable.”

Earlier I brought you the latest comments from Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, talking about the “unacceptable” pressure put by the US on Greenland with this week's visits of vice-president JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, and senior US officials (11:45).

Here is a video of what she said:

On the earlier topic of US Signal group on Yemen, we've had an on-the-record reaction from the UK, with prime minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson refusing to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical of Europe, JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

And the spokesperson insisted that the UK remains happy to share intelligence with the US despite the leak, which involved detailed planning for a military attack being shared inadvertently on Signal, a commercial chat app, with a journalist.

Asked if the government was satisfied that any intelligence it shared with the Trump administration would be properly handled, the spokesperson relied:

Yes. The US is our closest ally when it comes to intelligence and defence. We have a longstanding relationship on intelligence and defence cooperation … We will continue and continue to build on the very strong relationship we already have with the US.

The spokesperson would not discuss the leak in detail. But asked if the government was “100% confident” about sharing secret information with the US, the spokesperson replied: “Yes.”

For more UK reactions, you can follow my colleague Andrew Sparrow's live blog here:

We're getting more lines from Russia on its talks with the US over the weekend and on Monday.

Reuters is reporting that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed the country was willing to strike a new agreement on the safety of shipping in the Black Sea – a possible stepping stone towards a ceasefire with Ukraine – but only if the United States ordered President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to respect it.

Each side criticised the other over the collapse in 2023 of an earlier agreement intended to ensure the safety of merchant shipping in the Black Sea after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Reuters said.

“We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and his team to do one thing and not the other,” Lavrov said in televised comments.

Reuters noted that Lavrov's comments indicated that Russia will demand a further tightening of US pressure on Zelenskyy before it will agree to a maritime ceasefire, which Washington says would be an important step towards a more comprehensive truce.

In his regular update last night, Zelenskyy said that “Russia remains the only actor dragging this war out, jeering at both our people and the global community,” as he called for “strong actions” to “push Russia toward peace.”

Russia sought to blame Ukraine for blocking a joint US-Russian statement on progress made in peace talks in Saudi Arabia, with senior Russian senator Vladimir Chizhov telling state TV channel Rossiya-24:

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and apparently agreed on a joint statement, which was not adopted though because of Ukraine's position, is very typical and symptomatic,” Reuters reported.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “there is an understanding that the contacts will continue, but there is nothing concrete at the moment.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Actor denies assault and says any crude comments he made on film set were due to his bad mood

The French actor Gérard Depardieu has admitted in court that he grabbed the hips of a woman who has accused him of sexual assault, but said it was to avoid slipping and was not a sexual attack.

“I grabbed her hips,” the actor, 76, told his trial for sexual assault at the Paris criminal court on Tuesday. The head judge noted that this was a change from his testimony during police interrogation when he had denied that any physical contact had taken place with the 54-year-old set decorator.

Depardieu is on trial for the alleged sexual assault of the set dresser as well as alleged sexual assaults of a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.

He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted. He denies any wrongdoing, telling the court on Tuesday: “I deny all of it.”

Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the #MeToo movement – said: “I grabbed her hips so as not to slip because I was so upset by her, by the heat. It was a Friday – it was the end of a film shoot with a man who was very tired.”

Depardieu said any crude comments he made while grabbing the set decorator were because he was in a bad mood at the end of the day's filming.

The court heard that the set decorator, Amélie, had been working on styling film sets in a building in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 10 September 2021.

She told the court that Depardieu, who had been seated on a stool in the corridor between takes, began talking to her about the set and complained of the heat in the building. She said he told her: “It's so hot, I can't get an erection.” He also allegedly said: “I know how to make a woman come without touching her.”

After he went to another room to film a scene, he returned to sit in the same corridor, she told the court. He asked Amélie why she was on the phone to her “bloke”, she said. She told him she was in fact busy on the phone trying to track down parasols for the film. He allegedly said: “Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy.”

Amélie alleged that he then grabbed her hips, pulled her towards him and trapped her between his thighs with great force, and grabbed her body, including her pubis, waist and chest. “He grabbed me by the hips, pulled me forwards [towards him], trapped me with his legs,” she said.

“That's where I understood the strength he had, he held me very, very hard. I remember his eyes, I saw this big face, red eyes, very angry, very agitated. And he was saying: ‘Come touch my big parasol', with a crazy look. I've never seen anything like that. That phrase is so idiotic; how would I have invented that – it makes no sense to talk of genitals like a parasol.”

She said: “That fear that I felt – what stands out for me is not his sexual desire, but his savagery. It was the fact that he knew I was afraid – I saw his eyes light up with a kind of pleasure in making someone afraid. I remember that savagery. He really terrified me, and that amused him.”

Depardieu denied assault. He said he had been unhappy with Amélie's work as a set decorator, because a bedroom scene wasn't ready and was done poorly. He had made comments that Amélie couldn't even run a bric-a-brac shop let alone decorate a set, he said.

Depardieu said he weighed 150kg at the time and was so overweight he couldn't possibly have gripped anyone between his thighs. He told the panel of three judges: “I would never put anyone between my legs. You can do a test if you like – with the paunch I have, I can't do it.”

He said he did tend to make vulgar comments on set, telling the court he could often shout things like “Pussy! Pussy!”

When the head judge questioned that he would actually speak like that on a film set, he said he could: “If it's hot, if I'm in a bad mood, things always go on too long.”

Depardieu said: “I don't see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I'm not somebody who rubs himself against others on the Métro. I've been told that exists, I don't know about those types of things, there are so many vices I don't know.” He said there was no way he would put his hands on a woman's backside.

He said, however, that he did use crude language on set but just to be “provocative” and to “relax” people. Asked by the head judge if he had said: “It's so hot I can't get an erection”, Depardieu replied: “Maybe I said that, yes, why not?”

Depardieu said the media had used the allegations against him to damage his reputation. He attacked the #MeToo movement as well as the women who had held protest placards outside a concert tour he was giving at the time of the allegations. “This movement is going to become a terror,” he said.

Amélie told the court that no conversation had taken place with Depardieu where he had criticised her work.

The double Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen described a childhood marked by fear and manipulation when he took the witness stand on Tuesday in a Norwegian court to testify against his father and former coach.

Gjert Ingebrigtsen has pleaded not guilty to charges of physically abusing two of his seven children, namely the track athlete and his sister, Ingrid. The 59-year-old faces up to six years in prison, with the trial due to run until 16 May in Sandnes, south-western Norway.

“My upbringing was closely tied to fear. I've been aware of a fear-based culture for a long time. As a teenager, it was a concept I really identified with, because I felt I had no free will or say in anything,” said Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who won 5,000m gold at the Paris Games and the 1500m in Tokyo.

“I was in an environment where everything was controlled and decided for me,” he was quoted as telling the Sør-Rogaland district court by the Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. “There was an enormous amount of manipulation.”

During the first day of the trial on Monday, Gjert Ingebrigtsen told the court he was innocent of the charges against him, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported. He is due to testify next week, NTB said.

Jakob Ingebrigtsen, 24, told the court about several incidents of violence.

Prosecutors allege Gjert Ingebrigtsen struck Jakob several times after he received a negative report about his behaviour from school when he was aged eight. “I remember being extremely scared. Now I've done something seriously wrong. I'm terrified of what's going to happen,” Jakob told the court about the lead-up to the incident.

Jakob also told the court that when at age 16 he met Elisabeth Asserson, who is now his wife, his father tried to put a stop to the relationship, fearing having any relationship would harm his son's sporting career. “I found it extremely difficult that someone like my own father could speak that way about Elisabeth, someone I cared about,” he told the court.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Swirl visible for several minutes is thought to have been caused by frozen exhaust plume from Falcon 9

The truth is out there … it is just not quite as exciting as was hoped.

A large, glowing spiral that lit up the skies over the UK on Monday night and prompted speculation of an alien encounter is believed to have been caused by a SpaceX rocket.

The growing swirl, visible for several minutes across Britain, was initially thought by some to be an aircraft, or even extraterrestrial activity, but has now been attributed to a launch at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

Elon Musk's company SpaceX held a launch for the US government shortly before 1.50pm local time (1750 GMT) and it is understood the Falcon 9 rocket's frozen exhaust plume caused the display.

The Met Office said on the social media site X: “The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky.”

Lord Dover, a senior technical officer at the University of Hertfordshire's Bayfordbury Observatory, said the spiral was visible for about 10 minutes from 7.52pm – moving across the sky before dipping over the horizon.

“(The SpaceX) rocket… dumped fuel in the upper atmosphere to shed weight before returning to Earth,” he said.

“This fuel formed an expanding, swirling cloud that developed into a giant spiral shape as it travelled over the Atlantic.

“These sightings are becoming common in some parts of the world, but it's still unusual for rocket launches to be visible like this from the UK.”

The celestial display was visible across much of Europe, with hundreds taking to social media to share footage and imagery.

Steven Hall told the BBC that as he was taking out his bins in Suffolk he saw a “huge catherine wheel which appeared to have its own atmosphere around it”.

He added: “It did pass my mind, is this an unexplained, unidentified flying object.”

Dave, from Bristol, said he initially thought the blue spiral was “a plane with its headlight on”.

He said: “It suddenly went blurry and I thought ‘Oh, it's gone into cloud,' but then realised there weren't any clouds.

“I watched this fuzzy light for what felt like about a minute when all of a sudden it started shooting out these spiral arms and spinning.

“I realised straight away it was SpaceX because I've seen it so much on YouTube, but I can totally see how others would have been weirded out by it – it really did look alien.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Academics from US hoping to escape funding freezes and ideological impositions are being actively recruited

Laced with terms such as “censorship” and “political interference”, the Belgium-based jobs advert was far from typical. The promise of academic freedom, however, hinted at who it was aimed at: researchers in the US looking to flee the funding freezes, cuts and ideological impositions ushered in by Donald Trump's administration.

“We see it as our duty to come to the aid of our American colleagues,” said Jan Danckaert, the rector of Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), in explaining why his university – founded in 1834 to safeguard academia from the interference of church or state – had decided to open 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, with a particular focus on Americans.

“American universities and their researchers are the biggest victims of this political and ideological interference,” Danckaert said in a statement. “They're seeing millions in research funding disappear for ideological reasons.”

The university is among a handful of institutions across Europe that have begun actively recruiting US researchers, offering themselves as a haven for those keen to escape the Trump administration's crackdown on research and academia.

Since Trump took power in late January, researchers in the US have faced a multipronged attack. Efforts to slash government spending have left thousands of employees bracing for layoffs, including at institutions such as Nasa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US's pre-eminent climate research agency. The government's targeting of “wokeism” has meanwhile sought to root out funding for research deemed to involve diversity, certain kinds of vaccines and any mention of the climate crisis.

In France, the director of the prestigious Pasteur Institute in Paris, Yasmine Belkaid, said it was already working to recruit people from across the Atlantic for work in fields such as infectious diseases or the origins of disease.

“I receive daily requests from people who want to return: French, European or even Americans who no longer feel able to do their research or are afraid to do it freely,” Belkaid told the French newspaper La Tribune. “You might call it a sad opportunity, but it is an opportunity, all the same.”

The sentiment was echoed by France's minister for higher education and research, Philippe Baptiste, in a recent letter that called on research institutions to send in proposals on how best to attract talent from the US. “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the US,” he said. “Naturally, we wish to welcome a certain number of them.”

On Thursday, the Netherlands said it was aiming to swiftly launch a fund to attract researchers to the country.

While the fund would be open to people of all nationalities, the country's education minister, Eppo Bruins, hinted at the tensions that have gripped US academia in announcing the plans.

“There is currently a great global demand for international top scientific talent. At the same time, the geopolitical climate is changing, which is increasing the international mobility of scientists,” Bruins said in a letter to parliament.

“Several European countries are responding to this with efforts to attract international talent,” he added. “I want the Netherlands to remain at the vanguard of these efforts.”

The Dutch effort comes after France's Aix-Marseille University said it had set up a programme – titled Safe Place for Science – that would put aside funding for more than two dozen researchers from the US for three years.

“We wish we didn't have to do this,” said Éric Berton, the university's president. “We're not looking to attract researchers. But we were quite indignant about what was happening and we felt that our colleagues in the US were going through a catastrophe … we wanted to offer some sort of scientific asylum to those whose research is being hindered.”

Two weeks after the programme was launched there have been about 100 applications, with researchers from Yale, Nasa and Stanford among those who have expressed interest. The university continues to receive about 10 applications a day, said Berton, many of them from researchers involved in studying climate, health or social sciences.

Berton said he hoped universities across Europe would join his in providing a safe space for researchers. “I think that we need to realise the historic moment we're living through and the serious, long-term consequences this could have,” he said. “Europe must rise to the occasion.”

At VUB, the opening of the 12 postdoctoral positions was also aimed at acknowledging the global impact of Trump's crackdown. Two research projects in which the university was involved – one delving into youth and disinformation and another investigating the transatlantic dialogue between the US and Europe – had been cancelled due to “changed policy priorities”, it said.

For the university in Brussels, the openings were also a vindication of sorts. In a 2016 interview with Fox News, Trump had sought to characterise life in Brussels as akin to “living in a hellhole”, falsely accusing migrants in the city of failing to assimilate.

“At the time, the statement elicited many emotional reactions in Europe,” the university said. “This gives additional symbolic meaning to the VUB initiative.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Messages inadvertently shared with Atlantic journalist lay bare the unvarnished truth about how Vance and Hegseth feel about European allies

If Europe wasn't already on notice, the extraordinary leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen was another sign that it has a target on its back.

The administration officials gave Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic a front-row seat to the planning for the strike against the Houthis – a stunning intelligence leak that has caused anger against Republicans who called for criminal investigations against Hillary Clinton and others for playing fast and loose with sensitive information.

On the face of it, the strike against the Houthis had far more to do with the administration's policies on protecting maritime trade and containing Iran than its concerns about Europe freeloading on US defense spending and military prowess.

But Vance appears determined to push that angle as a reason to postpone the strike.

“I think we are making a mistake,” wrote Vance, adding that while only 3% of US trade goes through the Suez canal, 40% of European trade does. “There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” he added. “The strongest reason to do this is, as [Trump] said, to send a message.”

Vance was contending that once again the United States is doing what Europe should be. It is consistent with his past arguments that the US is overpaying for European security and the derision he displayed toward European allies (almost certainly the UK and France) when he described them as “some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. (Both fought in Afghanistan and the UK fought alongside the US in Iraq).

It was during this policy discussion, Goldberg wrote, that he was convinced that he was reading remarks by the real Vance, as well as defense secretary Pete Hegseth, national security advisor Michael Waltz, and senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller.

Then Vance went a step further. He tacitly admitted a difference between his foreign policy and Trump's saying that the strike would undermine the president's Europe policy – one that has been led by Vance in his divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference where he accused European leaders of running from their own electorates and of his Eurosceptic comments on Fox News.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote. “There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

Those designated on the call also reflect the vice-president's growing clout in foreign policymaking circles. Vance named Andy Baker, his national security advisor who helped lead the transition team at the Pentagon, as his representative. Hegseth named Dan Caldwell, a leading proponent of “restraint” in the exercise of US foreign power abroad to protect Europe and counter rivals like Russia, indicating the Vance team's presence at high levels of the Pentagon as well.

At heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance's views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump. Trump broadly sees the world as transactional and optimists in Europe have claimed he could force a positive outcome by forcing those nations to spend more on defense budgets. But Vance appears far more confrontational and principled in his antipathy toward the transatlantic alliance, and has attacked European leaders for backing values that he says are not aligned with the US.

That makes Vance even more of a concern for Europe. Kaja Kallas, the European foreign policy chief, accused Vance of “trying to pick a fight” with European allies. Another European diplomat said: “He is very dangerous for Europe … maybe the most [dangerous] in the administration.” Another said he was “obsessed” with driving a wedge between Europe and the US.

Back on the chat some sought – carefully – to talk Vance down. Hegseth said the strike would promote “core” American values including freedom of navigation and pre-establish deterrence. But he said the strikes could wait, if desired. Waltz, a foreign policy traditionalist, said: “It will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.” But he agreed that the administration sought to “compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans”.

“If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance replied. Hegseth agreed that “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.” But, he added, “we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”

Miller, the Trump confidant, effectively ended the conversation by saying that the president had been clear. “Green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return.”

Broadly, the administration's policies on Europe are coming into focus. And there are few stepping up to voice backing for Nato or for Europe writ large. On a podcast interview this weekend, the senior Trump envoy Steve Witkoff mused about the potential for the Gulf economies to replace those of Europe. “It could be much bigger than Europe. Europe is dysfunctional today,” he said.

Tucker Carlson, the host and another Trump confidant, agreed. “It would be good for the world because Europe is dying,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Investigation into death of two-year-old Émile Soleil, who went missing from a village in 2023, takes surprise turn

A long investigation into the mysterious death in 2023 of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested the boy's grandparents on suspicion of murder.

The death of Émile Soleil, who was two and a half when he went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, has remained unexplained even after the discovery of his skull and teeth by a walker just over a mile from the village nine months after his disappearance.

Prosecutors at the time said the cause of his death, which shocked the country, could have been “a fall, manslaughter or murder”. Police later found more bones and items of the boy's clothing.

Émile was at his grandparents' summer home in the small hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Two neighbours last saw him walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000ft) up in the French Alps. His mother and father were absent on the day of his disappearance.

Some media outlets had focused on the role of the boy's grandfather, who was questioned in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school, but police had considered his involvement as only one of many possible hypotheses explaining the boy's death.

But on Tuesday morning the grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of “voluntary homicide”, the chief prosecutor of Aix-en-Provence, Jean-Luc Blachon, said in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse.

Contacted by AFP the couple's lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, said she had no comment, having “only just heard” about the development.

Two other members of the family were also arrested, prosecutors said. Their identity was not revealed.

Speculation that a development in the case was imminent resurfaced earlier this month when investigators returned to the village. Tuesday's arrests were the result of fact-finding “over recent months”, the prosecutor told reporters, adding that forensic police were examining “several spots in the area”.

A funeral mass for the toddler was held in February this year in the presence of several hundreds of mourners. Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying “the period of silence must yield to the period of truth”, adding: “We need to understand, we need to know.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

UK Health Security Agency's tool highlights viruses and bacteria, many not yet seen in the country, that could pose biosecurity risk

Deadly disease-causing organisms from pathogen families that include bird flu, plague and Ebola pose a threat to health in the UK and should be prioritised for research, government experts have said.

The first tool of its kind from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) lists 24 types of viruses and bacteria where a lack of vaccines, tests and treatment, changes due to the climate crisis or growing drug resistance pose a biosecurity risk.

The pathogen families on the list cause many diseases not currently seen in the UK. However, climate change could change how and where they spread, said Dr Isabel Oliver, UKHSA's chief scientific officer, while a large outbreak overseas could have “major impacts globally, including socioeconomic impacts”.

Viruses in the Filoviridae family include the Marburg and Ebola haemorrhagic fevers, while Flaviviridae include mosquito-borne viruses dengue and Zika. Bacteria families highlighted include those home to Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, and Bacillus anthracis, which causes Anthrax.

Others listed include the Coronaviridae family, which includes Covid-19, and the Orthomyxoviridae family which includes avian influenza.

Oliver said UKHSA's scientists had considered “not just the fact that some of these families have got high potential to cause pandemics or epidemics, but also where there are currently gaps in the availability of either diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, or where there are evolving and growing changes around antimicrobial resistance, or where there is a significant sensitivity to climate change, that might mean that this threat evolves or changes more rapidly”.

She said one of UKHSA's concerns, reflected in the tool, was “the change in the distribution of mosquitoes and ticks that can carry viruses that cause adverse health effects to humans” linked to climate and environmental change.

The document, which will be updated regularly, does not indicate which pathogens UKHSA considers most likely to cause the next pandemic, Oliver stressed, but those most in need of increased scientific investment and study. She said it would be used in conversations with the scientific community “to help ensure that investment is focused to where it can have the biggest impact”.

Some diseases highlighted, including the Caliciviridae family member norovirus, already pose a “high” domestic burden in the UK, but have no specific treatment or vaccine available.

The first report from the UK Covid inquiry found that prior to 2020 there had been too much focus on the risk of an influenza pandemic, with officials then taking too long to adjust to the threat from a different type of virus.

The Paramyxoviridae family – which includes measles, as well as Nipah virus – is among those highlighted as a concern.

Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said he agreed with the assessment: “A novel measles-like virus would pose a threat far worse than Covid. Such a virus would have a much higher R number [indicating how contagious an infectious disease is] than the original variants of Covid – making it impossible to control by even the strictest lockdown. It would also be considerably more deadly, and (unlike Covid) it would be a threat to children. This is the kind of pandemic that public health agencies around the world are most concerned about.

“That said, there are many potential kinds of novel pandemic threats – so-called Disease X – and the UKHSA report is a timely reminder that we should not put all our eggs in one basket.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Far right party doubles its number of seats, while chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, hopes to form government before Easter



Germany's new parliament sits for the first time on Tuesday with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) the second biggest force, as negotiators seek to iron out key differences on tax and migration that are likely to dominate a new coalition government under Friedrich Merz.

The 630 members of the Bundestag, 230 of whom are newly elected, will sit in parliament at a unique time in postwar German history. The AfD has doubled its number of seats to 152, while centrist parties are overhauling the country's military and fiscal policy in response to rising threats to European security.

The MPs taking seats on Tuesday range in age from 23 to 84. The youngest is Luke Hoss, a student from the far-left Die Linke who has promised to give away most of his €11,000-a-month salary. The oldest is Alexander Gauland, a former journalist from the AfD who in 2018 downplayed Hitler and the Nazis as “just birdshit in our more than 1,000-year history”.

The new parliament contains about 100 fewer MPs than the previous one after the outgoing government reformed Germany's electoral law to shrink persistent bloat. Fewer than a third of MPs in the new Bundestag are women, slightly below the share in the previous legislature.

The gender inequality is lowest in the Greens, where women make up 61.2% of MPs, and highest in the AfD, where they make up 11.8%. Women are also greatly underrepresented in the centre right, accounting for 22.6% of MPs in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and 25% of MPs in the Christian Social Union (CSU).

Lawmakers of foreign descent are also disproportionately rare in the new parliament. The share of MPs with a migration background – those with at least one parent who was born without German citizenship – is 11.6%, according to estimates from the nonprofit group Mediendienst Integration, compared to about 30% in the general population.

Zada ​​Salihović, a 24-year-old from Die Linke who has become the second-youngest MP in the Bundestag after Hoss, said the new parliament was “still a reflection of a privileged minority” that did not adequately represent women, workers, young people, eastern Germans and people with migrant backgrounds.

“It's not a coincidence, it's an expression of structural barriers and power relations,” she said. “When parliaments are so homogeneous, it's not only the perspective of the majority that's missing – there's also a lack of fair solutions.”

The first sitting will open with a speech from Gregor Gysi, the longest-serving member of parliament, who began his political career in the Socialist Unity party in communist East Germany. The 77-year-old will be free to decide the length and content of his speech, and will chair the session until the president of the Bundestag is elected.

The CDU/CSU has nominated the CDU party treasurer, Julia Klöckner, to be Bundestag president, a position similar to that of the speaker in other countries. The Greens had protested after reports that Klöckner, the former agriculture minister under Angela Merkel, had planned to introduce herself to the AfD faction this week, arguing that it would “send a wrong signal of normalisation”. Klöckner's presence at the meeting appeared to have been cancelled after scheduling conflicts, the news outlet Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland reported on Monday.

Tense coalition talks are under way between the CDU/CSU, the largest faction in parliament, and the Social Democratic party (SPD). The chancellor-in-waiting, Merz, hopes to form a government before Easter.

The probable incoming government scored an early win this month after securing the support of the Greens to amend the constitution and loosen Germany's debt brake. The proposal, which was approved on Friday by the Bundesrat, a legislative body akin to an upper house of parliament, paves the way for a debt-financed package of investments in defence, infrastructure and climate action.

The proposal would have probably failed to pass in the new parliament, which contains a “blocking minority” from the AfD and Die Linke, who oppose sending weapons to Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Russian missile attack injures 88 in Sumy, officials report; Saudi Arabia ceasefire talks to continue with nothing yet agreed. What we know on day 1,126

Ukraine's special forces said on Monday they destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with Himars rocket systems. The special operations command published drone footage and announced: “Special operations forces in cooperation with the GUR of the ministry of defence, missile forces and artillery destroyed two enemy Ka-52 and two Mi-8 helicopters in the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation.” The strikes occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces, the group said. Ukrainian forces have since 18 March been striking across the border into areas of Belgorod oblast including the village of Demidovka, according to Russian and Ukrainian war watchers. Some claimed Ukrainian troops had managed to seize a small amount of territory in Belgorod. Their reports could not be verified.

A Russian missile attack hit a densely populated district including schools in Ukraine on Monday, wounding 88 people including 17 children, said officials in the city of Sumy. Many more children escaped injury as they had been evacuated to air raid shelters, said the regional governor, Volodymyr Artiukh. Ukraine's foreign minister, Adrii Sybiha, said: “Instead of making hollow statements about peace, Russia must stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians.” Sumy is just across the border from Kursk oblast where Ukrainian forces have been holding Russian territory since August 2024.

As of Monday night no ceasefire partial or otherwise had been agreed between Russia and Ukraine despite Russian claims of the Ukrainians breaching one by attacking energy stations. After Donald Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on 18 March, the Russian president was said to have ordered a halt to such attacks for 30 days. However, talks involving the US, Ukraine and Russia adjourned in Saudi Arabia on Monday with no ceasefire as yet signed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday evening that “since 11 March, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped”.

It will be the Ukrainian and US delegations' turn to meet on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. The talks in Riyadh appeared to have coalesced around the safety of shipping in the Black Sea. Washington is supporting the idea of a Black Sea ceasefire deal – a major aim of Russia – before securing a wider agreement. Ukraine has inflicted heavy naval losses on Russia in the Black Sea, including sinking its flagship there and blowing up submarines and other vessels as well as crippling Russian bases – forcing Moscow to withdraw its navy from Crimea. Simultaneously, Russia has been unable to halt Ukrainian grain and other exports despite pulling out of what was known as the “Black Sea grain initiative” and returning to attacking shipping and Ukraine's civilian port infrastructure.

A “massive targeted cyber-attack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company said, adding that it was working to restore its systems on Monday. The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules but disrupted its online booking system.

After reports surfaced that China might send peacekeepers to enforce any peace deal, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Monday: “Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent.” China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but says it has not given any weapons or sent any personnel. China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.

A Ukrainian artillery strike on Monday killed six people in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region, the region's Russia-installed governor said. According to Russian reports, two of the dead worked for the Russian military-owned propaganda TV station Zvezda, which is internationally sanctioned; while another worked for state-aligned and internationally sanctioned Izvestia newspaper – part of a media group chaired by a rumoured mistress of Vladimir Putin who is also sanctioned. Russian authorities described the media employees as journalists and claimed they were deliberately targeted. There was no comment from Ukrainian officials.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Vast majority unaware how many people were enslaved and for how long, although poll finds support for reparations is rising

Britons are widely ignorant of the scale and legacy of Britain's involvement in slavery and colonialism, a survey has found, with the vast majority unaware how many people were enslaved, how long the trade went on for, or for how long UK taxpayers were paying off a government loan to “compensate” enslavers after abolition.

The poll, released to coincide with Tuesday's UN International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, was commissioned by the Repair Campaign, which is working with Caricom to secure reparatory justice for member states through health, education and infrastructure projects.

The sample of more than 2,000 people representative of the UK population found 85% did not know that more than 3 million people had been forcibly shipped from Africa to the Caribbean by British enslavers.

It also found 89% were unaware British merchants had enslaved people in the Caribbean for more than 300 years and that 75% did not know it was after 2000 that British taxpayers finished paying off the money borrowed by UK government in 1833 – equivalent to 40% of the government's total annual expenditure at the time – to compensate enslavers for their “loss of property”.

Nonetheless, the survey found support for some form of reparations is growing, with 63% now agreeing that Caribbean nations and descendants of enslaved people should receive a formal apology, up 4% from last year's poll, while support for financial reparations has also increased, with 40% now in favour. Ninety per cent of those in favour of financial reparations said they should be directed toward long-term education, health and infrastructure projects.

Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group for Afrikan Reparations, said she was “not surprised” about the lack of understanding about the scale of slavery, and that reparative justice also required education.

“People point to reparations and think merely in financial terms, but one of the most important things is correcting the record – because until people learn what happened there will not be that widespread, public will to make reparation possible,” she said.

The Labour government has said the UK will not pay cash reparations, but is working with Caribbean partners on issues such as security, growth and climate change.

Ribeiro-Addy said there had to be a “willingness to listen” from the UK government, which is yet to make a formal apology for slavery, faced with a “large chunk of the world” that was unified on the need for reparative justice. “For us not to listen is disgraceful and could have consequences of its own,” she added.

Walker Syachalinga, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, which is investigating claims against institutions, companies and families, said of the survey's findings: “They speak to what has been a feature of English law and commerce – this idea of offshoring the more unpalatable aspects of our history while retaining the benefits.”

Denis O'Brien, Repair Campaign's founder, said the poll showed “heartening” growth in public support for an apology and reparations, but also “how little people in Britain really know about the country's past.”

Dr Hilary Brown, a programme manager at Caricom Secretariat, said: “Our shared humanity demands justice for the horrific crimes committed. Addressing the knowledge gap in the UK on the country's history of trading and enslaving Africans is urgent.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

With the cost of feeding a family up by an estimated £2,290, consumers, like many across Europe, are taking direct action

Marcel Demir was not impressed. The Swedish student had been monitoring the price of chocolate and crisps and had noticed that both had gone up astronomically.

“Absolutely, prices have gone up,” he said, standing outside a branch of Sweden's grocery store chain Coop in Stockholm Central train station. “I usually buy crisps and chocolate and they've gone up a lot. Chocolate recently. Crisps over the last year.”

The 21-year-old from Eskilstuna in south-eastern Sweden is not alone in his consternation.

According to some estimates, the annual cost of feeding a family in Sweden has gone up by as much as 30,000 kronor (£2,290) since January 2022. A packet of coffee is soon expected to reach the symbolic threshold of 100 kronor (£7.64). That's an increase of more than a quarter since early last year, according to the government agency Statistics Sweden.

Last week, after the biggest rise in food prices for two years in February, thousands of people across Sweden decided to vote with their feet, boycotting the country's biggest supermarkets for seven days from last Monday.

Helped by viral posts on TikTok and Instagram, the campaign has become a national topic of conversation and a political flashpoint.

Protesters blame the rise in prices on an “oligopoly” of supermarkets and big producers prioritising their profits over customers, and a lack of competition between companies. But supermarkets blame far-ranging factors including war, geopolitics, commodity prices, harvests and the climate emergency.

It is one of several cost-of-living protests that have unfolded across Europe in recent weeks. Shoppers in Bulgaria boycotted big retail chains and supermarkets last month in protest at rising food prices, reportedly leading to a drop in turnover of almost 30%. In January, a boycott in Croatia spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

The Swedish protest initiative, “Bojkotta vecka 12” (Boycott week 12, so called because it was held in the 12th week of the calendar year), asked consumers to stop shopping at big food shops including Lidl, Hemköp, Ica, Coop and Willys to protest against rising prices.

“We have nothing to lose, but everything to gain,” social media posts said. “Food prices have run away while food giants and the big producers are making billions in profits at our expense.”

Demir was not wrong: of all foods, chocolate prices went up the most last month, rising by 9.2% according to tracking site Matpriskollen. Cooking fat prices rose by 7.2% and cheese by 6.4%. Milk and cream rose by 5.4%.

Not everyone is convinced by the merits of the seven-day action, however.

Though Sandra Gustavsson, 34, has been noticing the rising cost of food, she is more in favour of a complete overhaul of shopping habits – such as using a “reko-ring”. This is a way of buying locally produced goods without intermediaries.

“Since Covid it feels like food prices have just gone up, up, up,” said Gustavsson, who works as a head of operations and lives in Gothenburg. “One week is good because it starts a conversation,” she added. “But otherwise I don't think it has an effect.”

Filippa Lind, a leading figure in the boycott, said conversation about the action – for and against – was everywhere. Lind, a student from Malmö, said she was doing it both as somebody who was affected by the “unreasonably high prices” and as an “act of solidarity for others”.

Calling for government to act, she said: “Politicians need to step in and break apart this oligopoly that is causing high prices because of lack of competition between grocery companies.”

Now they plan to continue their protest with a three-week boycott of Ica, which is Sweden's leading grocery retailer with around a third of the market share, and the dairy producer Arla. After that, they say, they will add more companies to the boycott list.

“I hope it will lead to political action that will indefinitely lower the prices on basic goods,” said Lind.

Accusing the centre-right, Moderate party-led coalition government of inaction, the Social Democrat economic spokesperson, Mikael Damberg, said in parliament on Tuesday: “In Sweden today, ordinary families empty their savings accounts and borrow money to get through everyday life.”

In response, the finance minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, said that inflation had fallen since the government took office in 2022, when it was about 10%. In February 2025, the inflation rate was 1.3% – up from 0.6% in January.

But, she acknowledged, food prices were still high. “To support those who have it hardest is important,” she said. “It is also important now to see what we can do about food prices.”

The minister of rural affairs, Peter Kullgren, said price rises had been caused by largely international factors such as higher commodity prices due to crop failures, but said that competition in trade needed improving.

“Food prices have increased over time and they hit the economically weakest households hardest: families with children, students and the old on low pensions. It needs to be addressed,” Kullgren said.

He added that tackling the problem and ensuring prices stabilise was a “high priority” for the government, which met with food industry figures last Thursday. He described their discussions about high food prices as “constructive” and promised: “We will now take that work further.”

On Friday, the government also presented a new food strategy that included measures to increase Swedish food production. Kullgren said he wants to see better competition in the food industry, including the launch of new grocery stores to encourage competition throughout the country.

He also warned that boycotts could have “the opposite effect” of the one intended, and said he could not support them.

Jenny Pedersén, a spokesperson for Hemköp, was unable to comment on how customer numbers had been affected by the boycott, but said food prices in Sweden were being affected in the same way they were in other countries.

“There are many factors that are affecting food prices,” she said. “Everything from war, geopolitics, commodity prices, processing costs, climate change, weather and harvests.

“There are a few categories driving inflation at the moment – in particular dairy, coffee and cocoa/chocolate. Dairy is one of the biggest grocery store categories, and therefore has a big impact on inflation, both its rise and fall.”

The Coop chain said it had seen a “slight decline” in customer numbers last week compared with the same time last year, but were unable to pinpoint a definitive reason.

“We do not rule out that there is a certain effect of the boycott, but it is still difficult to assess,” said its spokesperson Håkan Andersson.

The Ica spokesperson Jenny Gerdes said the impact of the boycott varied significantly between stores, but that some stores had seen “some impact”, including increased food waste.

“We understand our customers' concerns about rising food prices and respect their right to express their frustration,” she said. “It has become more expensive to grow, produce, package and transport food, but also to run a store.”

Johanna Eurén, a spokesperson for Willys, said: “We have full understanding for customers and the worry and frustration that food prices have increased. We understand that people want to show their discontent.” However, she added: “We probably think the boycott is a bit misguided.”

Lidl and Arla were also contacted for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Report finds that 98 domestic abuse victims in England and Wales died by suspected suicide in 2023-2024

Domestic abusers are driving their victims to suicide, police have warned as they admitted to past mistakes and pledged to investigate more “hidden” cases of violence against women.

The concession came as a new report revealed that deaths by suicide among victims of domestic abuse surpassed the number of people killed by an intimate partner for a second year in a row.

The 1,012 domestic abuse-related deaths recorded in the past four years were described as a “grim milestone” by Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for domestic abuse. She said it showed “how deeply ingrained violence against women and girls is in our communities”.

Of the 262 domestic abuse-related deaths recorded in England and Wales between the start of April 2023 and the end of March last year, 98 were classified as suspected victim suicide following domestic abuse (SVSDA).

The latest report by the Domestic Homicide Project, which is funded by the Home Office and led by the NPCC using live police records, also examined deaths where someone had fallen from a height.

Twenty-two such deaths were recorded across 13 forces during the four-year period. Of these, 36% were recorded as SVSDA and 27% as unexpected deaths.

Three of the women who died from a fall were pregnant at the time of their death, a proportion the report called “notably” high, considering that just five women in the entire four-year sample were pregnant.

The analysis was carried out in collaboration with the campaign group Killed Women, which has pushed for domestic abuse to be a key line of inquiry for police investigating any death of a woman who has fallen from a height.

In 2024, the Guardian's Killed Women Count campaign reported on every woman allegedly killed by a man. At the end of the year, the number of deaths stood at 80.

Rolfe, a Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, told a briefing that she expected to see a rise in the number of manslaughter convictions as a result of a new “unexpected deaths policy”, which will prompt officers to consider whether domestic abuse could have been a contributing factor in an individual's death.

She said there was a challenge in Britain's “adversarial” legal system when it came to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a causal link between domestic abuse and someone taking their own life.

“Of course, the burden of proof should sit with the prosecution,” she said. “But what's really clear from the research and speaking with families is that in the past, in too many cases, investigators have missed obvious patterns of coercive, controlling behaviour.

“I don't think police are missing homicides that are staged [to look like] suicide. However, it's very clear that there is more for us to do to be really curious about what's happened, to ensure that evidence at the scene of an incident is very thoroughly captured and explored.”

Rolfe also said that she wanted “to be able to answer victims' families' questions and be able to look them in the eye and say that every possible line of inquiry was followed”.

She added: “I've met some incredibly impressive families who have felt they themselves have needed to investigate after their loved one's death, and that's wrong, because that's our job, and we must do that.”

The report also revealed that 68% of victims and/or perpetrators of domestic abuse were known to the police or another agency, and called for better information-sharing to prevent future deaths.

In 54% of domestic homicides, the perpetrator was already known to the police, and in 90% of SVSDA cases involving a history of coercive and controlling behaviour, the suspect had previous contact with agencies other than the police.

The proportion of deaths that were killings by current or former partners remained at about 30% across the four-year period, the report found.

The 1,012 domestic abuse-related deaths recorded over the four years include 501 domestic homicides – 332 by current or ex-partners and 169 by another adult relative. The most commonly recorded risk factors in relation to suspects were mental ill health, a history of coercive and controlling behaviour, alcohol use and drug misuse.

Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: “The better we understand the links between domestic abuse and homicides, suicides and unexpected deaths, the better equipped we are to prevent them from happening in the first place.”

The One Day actor will star in Sophia Chetin-Leuner's Porn Play, one of four new premieres announced by the London theatre

Ambika Mod is to star as an academic addicted to violent pornography in a new play at the Royal Court in London. Mod, best known for her screen performances in One Day and This Is Going to Hurt, will take on her highest profile theatre role to date in Porn Play, written by Sophia Chetin-Leuner and directed by Josie Rourke.

Billed as “funny, unsettling and honest”, it opens in November at the Royal Court's smaller Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Chetin-Leuner, whose play This Might Not Be It was set in a mental health unit and staged at the Bush last year, said: “Ever since I was a teenager, going to see plays at the Royal Court has shaped my ideals and purpose of who I want to be as a writer – so it's a terrifying privilege to have Porn Play debuting here.” The play was shortlisted for Soho theatre's Verity Bargate award in 2022. Chetin-Leuner said she began writing it to explore the effects of pornography on women but that it has “evolved into something much more delicate and intricate over the years”.

Mod, who studied at the St Albans performing arts school Theatrix, is also an improv and sketch comedian. Last summer she appeared with the comedy troupe the Free Association at the Edinburgh fringe. Her stage productions have included Nassim Soleimanpour's White Rabbit Red Rabbit, a monologue which performers deliver sight unseen.

Porn Play is one of four new premieres announced by the Royal Court. Deaf Republic, which opens in August, is adapted from the poems of Ukrainian-American author Ilya Kaminsky and will be staged by the company Dead Centre, collaborating with the poet Zoë McWhinney. It will be told through spoken English, sign language, creative captioning and puppetry, using an ensemble of deaf and hearing actors.

That will be followed by a co-production with the National Theatre of Greece entitled Cow | Deer created by Katie Mitchell, Nina Segal and Melanie Wilson. A performance with no words, it will evoke the lives of the eponymous animals and is described by the trio as “an experiment in recalibration … looking beyond the purely human into the more-than-human world”.

Opening in October is a new play by Nick Payne, The Unbelievers, starring Nicola Walker who is currently in the throuple comedy Unicorn in the West End. The Unbelievers will be directed by Marianne Elliott who called it an “honest exploration of motherhood”. The theatre also announced the return of Soleimanpour's Echo, which had a short run last summer, and a tour for Breach theatre's Section 28 musical After the Act, previously staged at the New Diorama in London when it was run by David Byrne, who took over at the Royal Court in 2024. It was also announced that Tife Kusoro, whose play G drew acclaim last year, will join the theatre on attachment for 18 months and write a new play.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Academic who died in 1987 is thought to be responsible for documents that vanished over a 30-year period

Scotland's national archive has traced the mysterious disappearance of more than 3,000 historical documents over a period of 30 years to a history professor with an all-consuming interest in stamps.

The theft began to unravel when a National Records of Scotland archivist attended an auction in London in 1994. There, he discovered that 200 of the items for sale belonged to the archive, some still marked with their NRS reference numbers.

The items, 3,100 items in total, mainly family, estate and business correspondence, were traced back to an academic and archivist, Prof David Macmillan, who died in 1987. Born in Ayrshire, Macmillan studied history at the University of Glasgow before teaching at the University of Sydney and then Trent University in Ontario, Canada, where he was a professor for 20 years.

Records showed that he made annual visits to the NRS archives as a user from 1969 until 1980, when he was caught taking a single item from the archive in Edinburgh and his access was immediately revoked. It was assumed at the time that this was an isolated incident.

But the scale of his thefts became apparent in 2012, when a researcher saw a reference in an online catalogue at Trent University to an item he thought may have belonged in Scotland and raised concerns. NRS archivists went on to discover about 2,900 items which had been stolen by Macmillan and then gifted to Trent University's archives after his death.

Although Prof Macmillan was not convicted of any offences, NRS is confident that he carried out the thefts, which experts believe were motivated by his interest in stamps and postmarks. The correspondence he took was not of high financial or historical value, and it remains a mystery why someone whose own working life was sustained by the use of archives would abuse the trust of these institutions in such a blatant manner.

Dr Alan Borthwick, head of medieval and early modern records at NRS, said: “In essence he was looking for correspondence, especially from parts of the world where Scots were involved in general personal or business matters, but also routine domestic correspondence, which might turn out to have unusual postmarks – a bit magpie-like, he was attracted by something ‘shiny' even if most people couldn't see the attraction.”

NRS now has almost all its documents back in their rightful position, overseen by more robust security measures than Macmillan encountered, which protect its collection of 38m documents spanning nearly 1,000 years of Scottish history.

Of the 3,100 items returned, about 2,000 were stolen from the NRS archives, with others taken directly from other institutions across the UK including the National Archives and the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh and the National Library of Scotland.

About 500 items were found to belong to collections held by private owners, and 100 items remain of unknown origin.

Alison Byrne, chief executive of NRS, said: “These historical thefts were on an unprecedented scale and carried out we believe by one individual who was a regular visitor to the institutions he stole from.

“Thanks to the highly detailed and painstaking work of NRS archivists, we have been able to restore these records to their original collections and ensure they are available for study once again.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Employees who may have to return home risk death or imprisonment at hands of authoritarian governments

Foreign workers at US government-backed media outlets being cut by the Trump administration say they face deportation to their home countries, where some risk imprisonment or death at the hands of authoritarian governments.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration moved to defund the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent federal agency that oversees the Voice of America (VoA), the US's largest and oldest international broadcaster, and provides grants to Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe and other news agencies. The agency had around 3,500 employees with an annual budget of $886m in 2024.

“We have many coworkers in different services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to their own country, their lives would be at risk,” Jaewoo Park, a journalist for RFA, told the Guardian.

“Authoritarian governments have praised what Trump is doing right now,” Park said. “In Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they came to work at RFA. It's very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if Radio Free Asia doesn't exist.”

Chinese and Russian state media have praised the cuts of the news agencies, with a Russian broadcaster calling the cuts a “holiday” for Russian state media outlets.

The shuttering of the agency was unexpected and has caused chaos for Park and others. “My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and we're very concerned because I might go back to South Korea because I'm on a working visa. My wife is almost due and we just bought a home last year,” he added. “It's very concerning and depressing.”

But the impact of the decision will be felt globally, said Park. He cited Radio Free Asia's broadcasts to North Korea which, he noted, defectors from North Korea have cited as an important source of independent news.

“We know North Korea is a very oppressed country. They cannot hear anything other than the government press,” he said.

Workers at Voice of America have also pointed out the risks and dangers posed to some employees on visas who may have to return to their home countries now their positions are in jeopardy.

Two contributors for VoA are currently imprisoned in Myanmar and Vietnam and four contributors to Radio Free Asia are currently imprisoned in Vietnam. Russia, Belarus and Azerbaijan also reportedly have journalists affiliated with the news agencies currently imprisoned.

“Dozens of VoA staffers in Washington are on J-1 visas [non-immigrant visas meant to encourage cultural exchange], and if they lose them, they may have to return to countries whose governments have a record of jailing critics,” wrote Liam Scott in the Columbia Journalism Review, a VoA journalist who was notified their contract would be terminated on 31 March. “Two Russian contractors on J-1 visas who are set to be officially terminated at the end of March are considered at significant risk of being imprisoned if they return to Russia, according to a VoA staffer with knowledge of the situation.”

Stanislav Aseyev, a Ukrainian journalist, shared in a post on X that he was tortured for writing for Radio Liberty after being told it was an “enemy” of Russia.

“Now, the ‘enemy of Russia' is being destroyed by America itself, and my torture seems doubly in vain,” he wrote.

A VOA employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian: “Screwing over the people who worked for them and helped them, reminds me of what happened to Afghan interpreters.” Following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Afghan interpreters for the US military were left behind, stranded and in danger while trying to obtain special visas to escape to the US.

“It would be an even bigger shame if people that sacrificed for our country were thrown under the bus. It's a tremendous own goal in terms of US foreign policy and US national interests,” they said.

Federal workers, journalists and labor unions filed a lawsuit last week against the US Agency for Global Media over the shuttering of the agency by the Trump administration, seeking immediate relief to reverse it.

Donald Trump issued an executive order to defund the US Agency for Global Media, on 14 March. Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, formally joined Voice of America as special adviser in late February 2025.

Lake lost the 2022 election for governor of Arizona and a 2024 US Senate race in Arizona as the Republican nominee. She claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump and filed lawsuits claiming her 2022 election bid was also stolen from her. Those lawsuits were dismissed and her lawyers were recently ordered by a federal court to pay $122,000 in legal fees to Maricopa County for the “frivolous” lawsuits.

Lake claimed in a press release that the agency was “not salvageable” and accused it of “massive national security violations, including spies and terrorist sympathizers and/or supporters infiltrating the agency”.

The US state department and US Agency for Global Media did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Asked about the visa and immigration statuses for workers at the news agencies during a press briefing on 21 March, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “I have the question out to the secretary. It's something that I'm following up with as well. He's a busy guy.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Head of tech giant's consumer electronics and mobile devices division passed away at a hospital on Tuesday

South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics said on Tuesday that its co-chief executive officer Han Jong-hee has died due to cardiac arrest. Han was 63.

Han was in charge of Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile devices division, while co-CEO Jun Young-hyun oversees the chip business of South Korea's biggest company.

Han passed away at a hospital on Tuesday while being treated for cardiac arrest, a company spokesperson said, adding that a successor had not yet been decided.

The South Korean firm has been suffering from weak earnings and sagging share prices in recent quarters after falling behind rivals in advanced memory chips and contract chip manufacturing, which have enjoyed strong demand from artificial intelligence projects. Samsung has also ceded its smartphone market crown to Apple.

Han, who joined Samsung Electronics nearly 40 years ago, built his career in the TV business. He became vice-chair and CEO of Samsung Electronics in 2022. Han was also one of the company's board members.

He chaired Samsung's shareholder meeting last week, where he and other executives were grilled by shareholders after the company's failure to ride an AI boom made it one of the worst-performing tech stocks last year.

In semiconductors, Samsung lags behind SK Hynix in HBM chips that Nvidia and others rely on for AI graphic processing units.

“First and foremost, I sincerely apologise for the recent stock performance not meeting your expectations. Over the past year, our company failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market,” Han said.

He was scheduled to attend Samsung's launch event for new home appliances on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ballal released after spending night on floor of military base after he was detained following attack by Jewish settlers in West Bank

Hamdan Ballal – the oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces – has been released from detention, it has been confirmed.

My colleague Lorenzo Tondo has more in this report:

Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians left a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they were being held on Tuesday. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.

The three had spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack, according to Ballal's lawyer, Lea Tsemel.

The Israeli military said on Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation. On Tuesday, it referred further queries to police, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lamia Ballal, the director's wife, said she heard her husband being beaten outside their home as she huddled inside with their three children. She heard him screaming, “I'm dying!” and calling for an ambulance. When she looked out the window, she saw three men in uniform beating Ballal with the butts of their rifles and another person in civilian clothes who appeared to be filming the violence.

“Of course, after the Oscar, they have come to attack us more,” Lamia said. “I felt afraid.”

In an earlier post, we reported that Israeli shelling had, according to officials, killed at least five people in southern Syria earlier on Tuesday.

The Syrian foreign ministry has now put out a statement in reaction to the deadly attack (this text has been translated):

The Israeli forces' brutality is unacceptable. We affirm our absolute rejection of these crimes. 

We call for an international investigation into the crimes committed against innocent people and into Israeli violations. We also call on the Syrian people to hold on to their land and reject any attempts at displacement or the imposition of a new reality by force. 

We affirm that these attacks will not deter Syrians from defending their rights and their land.

Press freedom organisations have condemned the killing of two journalists in Gaza on Monday, who died in separate targeted airstrikes by the Israeli armed forces.

Hossam Shabat, a 23-year-old correspondent for the Al Jazeera Mubasher channel, was killed by an airstrike on his car in the eastern part of Beit Lahiya.

Video reportedly from minutes after the airstrike, which has not been verified by the Guardian, shows people gathering around the shattered and smoking car and pulling a body out of the wreckage.

Mohammed Mansour, a correspondent for Palestine Today, was also killed on Monday, reportedly along with his wife and son, in an airstrike on his home in south Khan Younis.

In the hours after the deaths, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Palestinian press freedom organisations released statements condemning the attacks. “CPJ is appalled that we are once again seeing Palestinians weeping over the bodies of dead journalists in Gaza,” said Carlos Martínez de la Serna, CPJ's program director.

“This nightmare in Gaza has to end. The international community must act fast to ensure that journalists are kept safe and hold Israel to account for the deaths of Hossam Shabat and Mohammed Mansour. Journalists are civilians and it is illegal to attack them in a war zone.”

Oscar-winning Palestinian director Hamdan Ballal, who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces, has been released from detention.

At least 50,144 Palestinian people have been killed and 113,704 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement earlier today.

The Israeli military issued more calls to evacuate parts of northern Gaza, telling Palestinians to head towards “known shelters” in the south even though there is no guarantee of safety there.

Israeli legislators have given their approval to the 2025 state budget, a key test for Benjamin Netanyahu's fragile coalition government that would be at risk of collapse if the vote didn't go his way and snap elections were called.

At least five people have been killed in Israeli shelling of the southern Syrian province of Daraa, local authorities said. It came after the Israeli military said it had launched attacks on the Syrian airbases of Tadmur and T-4.

In a post on X early this morning, the United States Central Command (Centcom) appeared to confirm fresh attacks on Yemen, targeting Houthi rebels. The post came after reports of new US attacks on the northern province of Saada, which reportedly injured at least two people and destroyed a cancer hospital.

No Other Land, a film about Israeli displacement of a Palestinian community, won the documentary feature film Oscar at the beginning of this month.

The documentary, which has Palestinian and Israeli directors, focuses on the steady forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes in Masafer Yatta, a region in the occupied West Bank targeted by Israeli forces.

The film's co-directors are Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham. It highlights the parallel realities in which the two friends live - Abraham with his yellow Israeli number plate that lets him travel anywhere, while Adra is confined to a territory that only ever gets smaller for Palestinians, despite it being their homeland.

Despite the critical acclaim, the film could not find distribution in the US and was self-distributed instead. “I believe it's clear that it's for political reasons,” Abraham told Deadline about the lack of formal distribution.

In an acceptance speech after winning an Oscar, Abraham said:

We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people which must end, the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed.

When I look at Basel, I see my brother but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military law that destroys his life and he cannot control.

There is a different path. A political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. And I have to say as I'm here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path.

And why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel's people are truly free and safe. There is another way. It's not too late for life, for the living.

The lawyer for Oscar award winning Palestinian director Hamdan Ballal, who was attacked by a group of Israeli settlers, says he will be released from detention by the Israeli military (see post at 11.18 for more details).

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Ballal, one of four co-directors of the No Other Land documentary, made the announcement. It is unclear when Ballal will be released.

Tsemel said on Tuesday that her client and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.

She had earlier said they were accused of throwing stones at a young settler, allegations they deny.

Ballal had his house in the Israeli-occupied West Bank surrounded by settlers during yesterday's attack in the village of Susya, the Center for Jewish Nonviolence group (CJNV) said.

On Tuesday, Israel confirmed it had killed an Al Jazeera employee in the Gaza Strip, accusing the journalist, Hussam Shabat, of being a “sniper terrorist” for Hamas, the AFP news agency reports.

Al Jazeera said Shabat was killed on Monday by an Israeli strike on his vehicle in northern Gaza. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the attack as part of a “massacre of journalists” in the Palestinian territory.

A joint statement released by Israeli military and Shin Bet internal security agency said that forces had “eliminated... a sniper terrorist from the Beit Hanun Battalion of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who was also employed as a journalist by Al Jazeera”.

Referring to Shabat, the Israeli statement that said security forces had “in October 2024... exposed the terrorist's direct affiliation with the military wing of the Hamas terrorist organisation”.

Israel has repeatedly accused Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza of being “terrorist operatives” affiliated with groups like Hamas and has suspended the network's broadcasts. The network vehemently denies these accusations.

Jonathan Dagher, head of the RSF's Middle East desk, said in a statement that Israel's accusations from 2024 “can in no way justify his murder, as they are based on documents that in no way constitute that the journalist had any affiliation” with Hamas's armed wing.

According to the Israeli statement, “internal Hamas documents” proved Shabat had taken part in military training conducted by the militant group's Beit Hanun Battalion in 2019.

Al Jazeera denies Israel's accusations and says Israel systematically targets its staff in Gaza.

Israel's state budget has become law, the Times of Israel reports.

The passing of the budget occurred before a 31 March deadline that would have seen Netanyahu's government fall if not passed.

“The budget has everything we need to win on the front and on the home front. We all approached this budget with a great sense of mission and responsibility,” said finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.

“We promoted measures that will support growth and allow the Israeli economy to maintain its strength and continue to prosper. This is a war budget, and, God willing, it will also be the victory budget.”

Israel Katz, Israel's defence minister, said on Tuesday that if Hamas continues to not hand over hostages taken on 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group will pay “a heavy price,” Reuters reports.

“Our main goal now is to return all the kidnapped people home. If Hamas continues its refusal, it will pay increasingly heavy prices in taking territory and thwarting terrorist operatives and infrastructure until it is completely defeated,” Katz said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

First-half goals from Jackson Irvine and Nishan Velupillay gave Australia a crucial win in China as they seek to pip Saudi Arabia to automatic World cup qualification

Aha, Joey Lynch's report is with us.

That means we're done here, so thanks for your company and see you next time. Peace.

I would like to apologise to young Benji and his parents,” Mr Gallico said in a club statement. “My actions were wrong. I should never have pushed Benji, or any child for that matter, the way I did on Saturday.”

What a sentence that is!

This is great to see.

I can't lie, crocs are perhaps my favourite animals – now that you ask. The purity of their evil is special.

For your ears…

Oh, more questions. Irvine praises Ryan Teague's quality and composure on debut, noting that he's done really well at club level. Otherwise, he praises China's second-half improvement but thinks Australia defended the box well and limited them to crosses and shots from distance. “Everything to play for,” he says in conclusion. “Exciting times.”

Irvine is player of the match and extols a massive team effort for this win and the one against Bahrain at the weekend. He's had a difficult club season in front of goal, he says, but he seems pretty happy with today's work.

The Australia players linger, celebrating a massive win. They've still plenty of work to do – they have to assume Saudi will beat Bahrain, so they'll need either a win in Japan or a draw in Riyad to qualify at this juncture.

A tremendous win for the Socceroos. A win in Japan, or a draw in Saudi, and they qualify for the World Cup automatically.

90+2 min Credit where it's due, the home fans are still having it.

90+1 min Another change for Australia, former golden boy Arzani on for Boyle, who's played well.

90+1 min A long ball and Abduweili controls well, a touch setting Wang Ziming for a shot, which he slices miles from anywhere.

90 min We'll have three added minutes.

89 min This has been a pretty good effort from Australia, who took what they needed in the first half and have protected it well enough in the second.

89 min What is wrong with people? Barbra Banda is a hero.

87 min and that's Wang's last contribution; he's replaced by Wang Ziming.

86 min Wang volleys clear and Degenek hesitates, opting to let the ball bounce, and Serginho reads that better than he does, collecting and moving on to Zhang, who shoots wide. He's put loads into this game, but hasn't found the quality to affect it.

84 min China might just've run out of ideas. Australia are doing a much better job of controlling possession now, spreading play wide then turning to go backwards, and so on. I'm not sure China have the legs left to press them.

82 min Two further changes for Australia, Caceres and Duke replacing Borrello and Velupillay.

81 min Of course, Australia are no strangers to playing off to reach the finals.

80 min Whoever finishes third and fourth in the group will then move into a fourth round with the other third and fourth-placed teams – there are two groups of three with the winners of each to qualify and the second-places to play off for the right to join an intercontinental playoff.

77 min Two more changes for Australia: Karacic and O'Neill replace Miller and Teague. Miller, in particular, was extremely effective in the first half, his attacking impetus crucuial to securing that 2-0 half-time lead.

76 min “Japan v Saudi-Arabia was reasonably fun, as far as goalless draws go,” returns Kári Tulinius. “Hervé Renard sent his Green Falcons out to get a draw, and they did. Samurai Blue had a number of good chances, but couldn't convert. Like previous iterations of the team, they play extremely attractive football, but lack that cutting edge up front which might get them far in the World Cup. Meanwhile, the stars of the show in Saitama were the fans, who cheered on their side and sang all the way through the match.”

The China fans have also been excellent. I guess Saudi are assuming they can beat Bahrain and that australia won't beat Japan, meaning a win in the final match will take them through.

74 min Credit to China, they've given this a good go, and they're on the attack again when Wang Yudong catches Degenek in possession down the left, finding Zhang, who crosses … but again, Ryan dives to collect. He's been very secure so far.

72 min Accordingly, if Australia see this one out and given their vastly superior goal difference, a win against Japan will see them through; a draw will be enough if Saudi don't beat Bahrain.

70 min Japan v Saudi has ended goalless so, assuming for a moment that Australia see this out, they'll be three points ahead of Saudi with two games to go.

68 min Now then! Zhang wins the ball outside the box down the left, quickly punches a cross into the middle … where Degenek does well to intercept and clear.

67 min A double chsnge for China. Off go Huang and Xie; on come Wang Yudong and Wang Haijian.

66 min This time, Wang punches the corner clear, Australia look to sustain the attack, and Miller is penalised for fouling Serginho.

65 min Australia might've weathered the storm. They win another corner, this time down the left…

64 min They're playing added time in Saitama, where it remains Japan 0-0 Saudi.

62 min Teague, on debut, humps a booming corner to the back post where Degenek, having lost Abduweili, steers a side-footed volley wide of the near. That was a really good chance to finish this, and a reminder that Australia are better when looking to score than when hoping to defend.

61 min Australia need to find a way of keeping possession, or at least an out-ball. Currently, they're having to defend attack after attack, but as I type, Miller wins a corner off Jiang, their first of the second half.

60 min The corner is swung way too deep to the edge, and Yang's eventual shot is nowhere near goal.

59 min Here come China again, Yang bursting down the right and slinging over a cross that forces Miller to chest behind, under pressure form Li.

57 min Nice again from China, Huang dashing around the outside and clipping back a cross for Zhang, who arrives at the ball ahead of Burgesss … but can't wrap his head around it, instead powering an effort into the near-post side-netting. Australia need to do something to halt the home side's momentum here, because this is one-way traffic.

55 min And here come China again, Zhang finding Abduweili, who lays off immediately for Serginho and, from the edge, he panels a shot that's too close to Ryan; the keeper dives to palm behind, and the corner comes to nowt.

54 min We've not seen Australia as an attacking force this half. I guess they're happy with that thy've got, but their defence doesn't look strong enough to rely on.

52 min Xie curls the corner in and again, Ryan is there, this time punching clear. He's been solid so far tonight but, as Brighton fans will confirm, he's always got a ricket in him.

51 min China keep at it, though, Xu seeing a shot blocked behind for a corner, which gets the home crowd going – they're bouncing away behind the goal and the noise is decent.

50 min Australia's narrow back three are making it difficult for China to attack through the middle, but they send it wide to Li, who swings cross out … and Abduweili contorts to impart brow to ball … but Ryan plunges left to field easily enough.

48 min China have started the half on the front foot, Australia sitting off. I guess they don't want to risk pressing because they don't want to leave open space to be attacked. And, as I type, a ball in behind looks to have released Zhang down the left side of the box, but a phalanx of defenders get between him and the men up in support, then Australia clear and Borrello turns Han … who manhandles him to the ground.

46 min China have made a half-time change, Serginho coming on for his debut in place of the ineffectual Wei.

 46 min We go again…

Australia re back out early, keeping warm and such. David Moyes' Everton did that the year they finished fourth, the idea being to show their opponents they were readier to go … then in typical Ev style, they drew Villarreal in Champions League qualifying and got battered.

Half-time entertainment:

With 57 minutes gone in Saitama, it remains Japan 0-0 Saudi Arabia.

A fine first half for the Socceroos, who look good to record an important victory.

45+3 min Miller has been a danger all half and again, he gets down the right before digging out a cross … but there's no one there to attack it.

45+3 min China aren't quite out of this yet – they've shown an ability to get behind Australia, but not yet found a killer pass or cross.

45+1 min We'll have three additional minutes.

45 min It seems that Trent Alexander-Arnold is indeed leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid. I guess for free, that makes some kind of sense, but on the other hand, brilliant though his ball-striking is, he offers every opponent a defensive weakness to target.

43 min Ach, China work an overload, them, looking for Li down the right, Xu passes into touch. Still, they moved the ball nicely there.

41 min Australia have played well so far. The quality isn't great, but they started with aggression and intensity, not allowing China to settle, and that's a lot of the reaoson they lead 2-0.

39 min China crowd the six-yard box – there are 13 men in it – but the delivery isn't great. Still, though, Burgess feels forced to head behind, so Wei will go again … and this time, Ryan collects competently enough.

37 min A quiet period. China are doing their best to haul themselves back into the game, but are struggling to find the attacking edge. Still, again they get down the right, forcing Burgess to slide a cross behind at cost of a corner.

35 min Better from China, Xu getting around the side of the Australia defence and cutting back, but there's no one there to collect; no matter. Wei then picks up possession and from the edge, unleashes a nasty outswinger that flies just past the far post.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Analysts warn a European force would have difficulty sustaining a peacekeeping mission over time — particularly if there's no backing from the United States.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was among the first leaders to volunteer troops to help protect a postwar Ukraine. With French President Emmanuel Macron, he's working to recruit partners for a coalition of the willing to staff an international peacekeeping force.

The British public — including those of fighting age — is generally amenable to the idea of sending troops to Ukraine. The U.K. has a long history of military intervention overseas; Brits are used to turning on the telly and seeing their compatriots deployed in foreign countries. Prince William visited Estonia last week to show support for the British soldiers guarding NATO's border with Russia.

But within the security community, concern is growing about whether a European force could sustain such a mission long term — particularly if there's no meaningful backing from the United States.

There's a “lot of caution about how the force will operate, what the mandate will be, whether they could enjoy American cover or not, or whether they could become sitting ducks for being tested by Putin,” said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a security think tank. And there are “grave doubts” in the defense community about the capacity to support a European mission for what “is likely to be years and years of commitment.”

The British Army, like many worldwide, faces major challenges in recruitment and retention. In 2010, it numbered  more than 100,000 full-time personnel; by 2024, it had fallen to 72,000.

“Generation Z is not joining the Armed Forces in the way my generation did,” former Defense Minister Ben Wallace, 54, said once.

Recent polling suggests younger Britons are, indeed, less willing to enlist. Only 11 percent aged 18 to 27 say they would fight for Britain if called upon — half as many as in the same survey 20 years ago. Thirty-seven percent said they would fight only if they agreed with the cause; 41 percent said they wouldn't under any circumstances.

On a recent afternoon in central London, young people entering an army recruitment office — a self-selecting group — expressed more enthusiasm.

“If it means keeping the peace, definitely, I'd go to Ukraine,” said Dominykas Beloglazovas, 18, emerging from the office after asking about the army.

If a ceasefire allows a European peacekeeping or “reassurance” force — an idea Russia has rejected — the heavy lifting would likely fall to Britain and France. Other countries, including Australia, Canada, Denmark and Sweden, have also said they are considering sending forces in some form.

In Britain, Cambridge law professor Catherine Barnard says, there's consensus around the war. “There is a strong British understanding that Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022,” she said. “It's not a messy situation in the sense that these things are unclear. … You don't have the complexity around the situation like we did in Iraq.”

Officials have discussed a force of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops. After a meeting of military chiefs of Ukraine's allies outside London on Thursday, Starmer mentioned potential air and sea support, also.

Reversing the “hollowing out” of British forces in recent years would require spending “something on the far side of 3 percent” of GDP, according to Ben Barry, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Starmer pledged recently to increase defense spending to 2.5 percent by 2027.

Britain and others “could probably provide 30,000 troops in Ukraine,” Barry said, but would “struggle to sustain them for the long term.”

Outside the recruitment center, Beloglazovas wasn't surprised by his peers' lack of enthusiasm to join the army.

“I want to sign up for the sake of protecting this country,” he said. “It's a part of me that has to be filled in.” But he recognized that “not many people want to join, because they are scared, and there's a lack of patriotism nowadays.”

Recruitment challenges here long predate the war in Ukraine.

“It's fiendishly difficult,” said Eyal, the analyst. “One of the problems that nobody likes to discuss when we talk about boosting defense expenditure is that you can buy a lot of military equipment if you throw money at it, but you can't manpower overnight. That takes time.”

Still, he noted, action often generates an uptick in interest.

“If the deployments in Ukraine are not too dangerous, that could actually improve or provide a short boost,” he said.

At a cafe near the recruitment center, two men were asked whether they would feel duty-bound to enlist if British troops were stationed in Ukraine. They debated.

“I'd likely sign up,” said Dan Clarkson, 25, a skilled trades worker eating chicken and chips on his lunch break. But he'd want to believe in the “reason behind it.” “Things like fighting for land and power, I think that's a bit dated.”

He opposes conscription, he said, and didn't think many his age would join even if there were a draft. (Britain abolished compulsory national service in 1960, and there's no talk of reinstating it.)

“In World War I and World War II the country seemed very patriotic. Now I think, no one's really bothered. If things kick off, the mood is ‘I'll just move to Spain' or something. Everyone's been bubble-wrapped for the last 20-odd years. There's no, ‘Let's stand and fight for the country.' There's nothing like that.”

Vytautas Stankevicius, 34, ruled out the idea of enlisting for medical reasons but expressed skepticism about the mission overall. “Even if they agree to peace, they aren't going to keep the agreement for peace,” he said. “Putin wants to get all the old lands Russia had when it was in the Soviet Union. As soon as Putin sees an opportunity, he's going to strike again.”

Back at the recruitment center, Richard, a 21-year-old soldier whose service is split between a ceremonial role, in dress uniform and bearskin hat, and front line work, said talk of deployment to Ukraine was premature.

“I don't think it's about to happen anytime soon,” said Richard, who spoke on the condition his last name be withheld because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “The civvies and public think it's kicking off, but we don't think so.”

“But if it does, I'd go and help with the civilian side of stuff, then I'd feel like I'm helping towards something, yeah?”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Hossam Shabat and Mohammad Mansour are among more than 170 journalists killed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for  Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram only hours before he was killed was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called the “assassination” of its correspondent, Shabat, and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said that it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

This is Hossam's team, and we are sharing his final message :“If you're reading this, it means I have been killed—most likely targeted—by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old—a college student with dreams like anyone else. For past 18… pic.twitter.com/80aNO6wtfO

In the post, Shabat said that for the past 18 months, he had dedicated “every moment of my life to my people,” documenting the horrors in Gaza to “show the world the truth they tried to bury.”

“By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven't known in the past 18 months,” he wrote. “I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honor of my life to die defending it and serving its people.”

The message was signed: “For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.”

More than 170 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the war in October 2023, according to CPJ, which has maintained a database of all journalists killed for their work over the past 30 years.

During the war, Shabat became known for his live reporting from on the ground and heartfelt interviews with people who had lost so much. Wearing a press vest and helmet, he documented moments of grief and tragedy in crowded hospitals, displacement camps and the sites of strikes. He spoke with parents mourning their dead babies, people calling out for their family in the rubble, and mothers whom he calmed down when they couldn't speak through weeping.

He also found moments of joy — such as his tearful reunion with family after a year and a half of war.

A post shared by Khaled Beydoun (@khaledbeydoun)

Videos posted by Al Jazeera after his killing show a crowd of people surrounding his lifeless body, shouting his name and weeping. The video could not be immediately verified by The Washington Post.

In March 2024, Shabat visited a northern Gaza hospital to document sick children who were facing deteriorating conditions. There, he and other Gaza-based journalists discovered Fadi al-Zant, who, after videos of the emaciated 6-year-old went viral, became one of a handful of children evacuated to receive medical care in the United States, as The Post reported in July.

Mansour, who was also a correspondent for Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun, was killed by a missile strike at his home in Khan Younis, and his wife and child were injured, the newspaper said. “Attacks against civilians, including journalists, are never acceptable under any circumstance,” Kengo Sakajiri, the paper's executive editor added in a statement.

In a statement, the IDF said it had “struck several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in the area of Khan Younis and Rafah” on Monday, and that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance, additional intelligence and precise munitions.”

When Shabat, along with five other journalists, was first labeled a militant by Israel in October, Al Jazeera warned that what the network described as “fabricated accusations” may serve as a “pretext for further violence” against the journalists.

The IDF in October said six Al Jazeera journalists were “exposed” as alleged members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad based on what it said were documents found in Gaza that Israel alleged confirmed their military affiliations, including directories and training documents. The Israeli military released the documents, along with screenshots of them that included IDF-transposed labels and English translations.

Posting the photos and names of the journalists, the Israeli military said most of the journalists were allegedly part of “Hamas's military wing [spearheading] propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera.” The Post could not verify the authenticity of the documents.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for several areas of northern Gaza late Monday, forcing another round of displacements for Palestinians who were able to return to their homes in the devastated north in late January for the first time since the early days of the war. The military described it as a final warning before the areas would come under attack.

Nearly 125,000 people have been displaced in recent days as they fled Israeli bombardment and ground operations, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Monday, before the latest evacuation orders. The United Nations estimates that over the past week, Israel has issued evacuation notices for more than 14 percent of the enclave, along with “vast ‘no go' areas along the border,” spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Monday.

It was past 10 p.m. in Gaza when the evacuation order for Jabalya came in, leaving families with few options other than fleeing on foot, in the dark, in search of relative safety. Two hours before, similar warnings were issued for the areas of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.

“People left under the cover of darkness,” Razan Faisal, a resident of Jabalya who opted to stay behind, said in an interview Tuesday. “We have many elderly people and children, and evacuations involve walking for long hours, which is extremely difficult,” she said, adding that the situation in Jabalya is dire. “There is no aid, and only a few supplies are available in the market at extremely high prices.”

Since March 18, the day Israel broke the fragile truce and resumed bombing Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 792 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday. More than 60 percent of them are women and children, according to the ministry.

JERUSALEM — Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was attacked Monday by a group of Jewish settlers in the West Bank and later arrested by the Israeli army, according to activists and a neighbor who spoke to The Washington Post.

Ballal was released Tuesday after being interrogated by police, according to a statement by activists familiar with his condition. They added that Ballal went to a hospital after being freed.

The Palestinian director was in his home village of Susya, part of the cluster of rural Palestinian communities known as Masafer Yatta, when settlers approached the village and tried to graze their sheep on private Palestinian land just before iftar, the sundown meal at which Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan, according to Nasser Nawajah, who lives in the small village and reports on settler violence for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. He spoke with Ballal's wife, who described the attack.

A video taken by Khamudi Mahmoud, a resident of the village, shows a tall man wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap aggressively approaching Ballal in a rocky clearing as Ballal backs away and a crowd of villagers shout behind him.

Dozens of masked settlers wielding batons, knives and a rifle then attacked property and residents, activists who document settler attacks in the area said in a statement afterward.

“Hamdan tried to retreat, and he brought his kids and wife inside the house and stood at the door to protect them,” Nawajah said. Four settlers began to hit the door of Ballal's house, injuring Ballal's head, according to Nawajah, recounting what Ballal's wife told him.

The settlers fired bullets next to the house and then dragged Ballal away while he was injured, Nawajah said.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted to X that a “violent clash” broke out between Palestinians and Israelis and that it involved “mutual stone-throwing.”

The United Nations said it is making the “difficult decision” to scale back its presence in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. About one-third of the roughly 100 international staff members in Gaza will be temporarily relocated, the agency said in a statement.

“We are not abandoning Gaza,” U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said in a news briefing Tuesday, adding that the decision to reduce international staff numbers was because the U.N. was unable to guarantee the safety of its employees.

On Monday, the United Nations said a strike that hit a U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza, killing a Bulgarian employee and injuring five other international staff members, came from Israeli tankfire — something the Israel Defense Forces has denied. The U.N. has called for an investigation, with spokesman Stéphane Dujarric saying Monday, “The Israelis knew exactly where this U.N. facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.”

Also Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its offices in Rafah was “damaged by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties. Fortunately, no staff were injured in this incident, but this has a direct impact on the ICRC's ability to operate.”

The IDF said in a statement that its forces had “fired at a building after identifying suspects inside and feeling threatened. … Upon review, it was found that the identification was mistaken, and the building belongs to the Red Cross.” It added that the incident would be investigated.

Aid groups have warned about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. The U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Monday that nearly 125,000 people in the enclave have been displaced in recent days as they flee Israeli bombardment,

“This is a human catastrophe,” UNRWA said Monday, emphasizing that Israel's siege and blockade of all aid into Gaza has caused food shortages and sent prices soaring.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram, hours before he was killed, was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called Shabat's “assassination” and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

Top officials in the Trump administration discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application that mistakenly included a journalist, the White House acknowledged Monday, a development that swiftly drew criticism from Democrats and Washington's national security establishment.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the message thread revealed in an extraordinary report by the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, “appears to be authentic,” and that administration officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

The “inadvertent number” belonged to Goldberg, whose article details a robust policy discussion that occurred in the lead-up to a March 15 military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants. Goldberg reported being added to the group chat, which occurred on the encrypted messaging platform Signal, by President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. Other participants appeared to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and several other senior aides, the Atlantic article says.

Hughes, the National Security Council spokesman, characterized the discussion as “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials” executing Trump's national security strategy. But the disclosure immediately raised questions about how the administration has discussed classified national security matters and whether anyone will be disciplined.

Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent days that they will investigate unauthorized leaks to journalists, citing reporting in a number of publications. Several of them also for years criticized the handling of classified information by Democrats in other cases.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

At least four people have been killed in the blazes, which have burned more than 36,000 acres and threaten population centers home to more than 200,000 people.

SEOUL — Wildfires driven by strong winds and dry weather are ravaging southeastern South Korea, killing at least four people and burning more than 36,000 acres, officials said Tuesday.

Five wildfires were 88 percent contained on average as of Tuesday morning local time, according to a government news release. One has been completely contained, and the largest — which has burned more than 31,000 acres near population centers that are home to more than 200,000 people — was 55 percent contained.

Four people — three firefighters and a government official assisting with firefighting efforts — were found dead near the fires, according to South Korea's Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

“Wind speeds will reach 10 to 20 meters per second today afternoon while temperatures will hit [78 degrees Fahrenheit], raising the risk that the wildfires will spread,” Lim Sang-seop, the chief of South Korea's forest service, told reporters Tuesday.

The largest fire was threatening Uiseong, forcing at least 1,550 residents to flee, Lim said. Nearly 50,000 people live in the county. Overnight, the fire had entered the outskirts of the city of Andong — which is home to at least 153,000 people — forcing more than 1,260 people to evacuate, he added.

“The containment rate was 60 percent yesterday, but the fire perimeter grew overnight due to winds, lowering the containment rate to 55 percent,” Lim said.

Almost 80 helicopters and more than 3,100 personnel from the military, the forest service and local fire stations will be deployed Tuesday, he said.

Wildfires are not uncommon in South Korea, especially in the country's eastern areas that are sparsely populated and covered by woodlands. Hundreds of wildfires erupt every year, according to the country's forest service, although most are small and contained.

The country's largest recorded wildfire occurred in the country's east coast in April 2000, when fires burned more than 58,000 acres and caused $32 million worth of damage. In March 2022, fires burned more than 40,000 acres, also on the east coast, and wreaked $750 million of damage.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Follow:


            The medical staff looking after Pope Francis considered stopping his treatment so he could die, according to the lead doctor, after the 88-year-old pontiff was hospitalized with a drawn-out respiratory illness.
    


            Professor Sergio Alfieri told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera the most critical moment came on February 28 when the pope had a breathing crisis and inhaled his own vomit.
    


            “We had to choose whether to stop and let him go or force it and try with all the drugs and therapies possible, running the very high risk of damaging other organs. And in the end, we took this path,” Alfieri said.

High anxiety and whispers of a conclave: How the Vatican is dealing with Pope Francis' hospitalization



            Alfieri, who led the team at Rome's Gemelli hospital, said the decision to continue with treatment was made by Francis' nurse. “The Holy Father always decides. He delegated all kinds of health care choices to Massimiliano Strappetti, his personal health care assistant who knows perfectly well the Pontiff's wishes.”
    


            He reportedly told Alfieri: “Try everything, we won't give up. That's what we all thought too. And no one gave up.”
    


            Francis left the hospital on March 23 after 38 days in hospital, the longest since his election as pope 12 years ago. The pontiff had a number of breathing crises during his time in hospital, with Alfieri previously saying that two of them put the pope's life in danger.
    


            During his stay the Vatican provided an extraordinary level of detail about Francis' condition.
    


            Alfieri said this was the pope's decision and that the Vatican's bulletins were prepared by the medical team with some additions from Francis' personal secretaries.
    


            “From the first day he asked us to tell him the truth and he wanted us to tell the truth about his condition… nothing was ever changed or omitted.”
    


            Francis has returned to his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he will receive treatment including mobility and respiratory-related physiotherapy, especially for voice recovery, and engage in personal prayer, according to the Vatican.



            Doctors also advised the pope to have 24-hour medical assistance, including oxygen therapy, and in case of any emergencies.
    


            The pope will return to work gradually. He has shown determination to recover, resuming some duties and signing documents. Francis has not led the Angelus prayer for the past seven Sundays, but has still offered reflections every week – most recently calling for “peace” in war-torn regions.
    


            “You have continued to pray for me with so much patience and perseverance. Thank you so much. I also pray for you,” he said in a post on X on Sunday. “Let us pray together for peace, especially in martyred Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.”

The grandparents of a French toddler who went missing nearly two years ago have been arrested on suspicion of his murder, prosecutors said Tuesday.

Two-year-old Émile Soleil disappeared from his grandparents' garden in Le Haut-Vernet, a hamlet in the French Alps, in July 2023. Nine months after his disappearance, his remains were discovered by a hiker near the village.

Now the long investigation into the toddler's death has taken a shocking turn with four individuals — including Émile's grandparents and two of their adult children — being taken into police custody.

Emile's grandfather Philippe Vedovini and his wife, who was not named by the prosecutor, were arrested in the commune of La Bouilladisse on suspicion of “voluntary homicide” and “concealing a corpse,” according to a statement by the Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor.

Emile's disappearance gripped the nation as long and widespread searches yielded nothing. His parents were absent on the day he vanished. At the time they told a Christian website they still hoped for a miracle.

The case also sparked media attention, particularly surrounding Émile's grandfather, who, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, was questioned by police in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school. But police had considered his involvement as only one possible explanation behind the boy's tragic death.

Earlier this month, investigators returned to Le Vernet, with forensic teams combing through “several spots in the area.” The prosecutor confirmed that forensic operations are still ongoing in various locations, with new developments expected as the investigation unfolds.

CNN has reached out to the grandparents' lawyer.

Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has been sworn in for a seventh term, and he mocked those who derided him as “Europe's last dictator” by saying his country has more democracy “than those who cast themselves as its models”.

“Half of the world is dreaming about our ‘dictatorship', the dictatorship of real business and interests of our people,” Mr Lukashenko, 70, said in his inauguration speech at the Independence Palace in the capital of Minsk.

Hundreds of opposition supporters living abroad held anti-Lukashenko rallies on Tuesday to mark the anniversary of Belarus' short-lived independence in 1918 following the collapse of the Russian Empire.

Mr Lukashenko marked three decades in power last year, and his political opponents have denounced the tightly orchestrated January 26 election as a farce.

The Belarus Central Election Commission declared he won with nearly 87% of the vote after a campaign in which four token challengers on the ballot all praised his rule.

Opposition members have been imprisoned or exiled abroad by Mr Lukashenko's unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Months of massive protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of nine million people followed the 2020 election and brought on the harsh crackdown.

More than 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and independent media outlets and non-governmental organisations were closed and outlawed, bringing condemnation and sanctions from the West.

Thousands of Lukashenko supporters attended Tuesday's inauguration ceremony, where he denounced his critics as foreign stooges who were at odds with the people.

“You don't and won't have public support, you have no future,” he declared. “We have more democracy than those who cast themselves as its models.”

Belarusian activists say it holds more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Centre.

“The election was held amid a deep human rights crisis, in the atmosphere of total fear caused by repressions against civil society, independent media, opposition and dissent,” according to a statement released Tuesday by Viasna and 10 other Belarusian human rights groups.

They said Mr Lukashenko's hold on power is illegitimate.

Mr Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, relying on subsidies and political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself in office for a quarter of a century, an alliance that helped the Belarusian leader survive the 2020 protests.

Mr Lukashenko allowed Moscow to use the country's territory to invade Ukraine in February 2022 and later hosted some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons.

Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after running against Mr Lukashenko in 2020, vowed to keep fighting for the country's freedom.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, according to Palestinian medics.

The dead include three children and their parents, who were killed in a strike on their tent near the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital.

The hospital has received a flood of dead and wounded since Israel resumed its heavy bombardment of Gaza last week, shattering the ceasefire that had halted the 17-month war.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.

Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023 in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.

Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because it operates in densely populated areas.

Meanwhile, one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land was still missing on Tuesday after reports he was beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by the Israeli military.

Lawyer Lea Tsemel told the Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained.

Mr Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya late Monday, according to Ms Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they are being held at a military base for medical treatment, and she said she has not been able to speak to them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village.

Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Pope Francis' medical team briefly considered suspending treatment, but instead decided on an aggressive course that put his organs at risk, the doctor co-ordinating his hospital care has said.

Dr Sergio Alfieri said the 88-year-old pontiff and people close to him alike understood “that he might not survive the night”, after the bronchospasm attack during which the pope inhaled vomit.

“We needed to choose whether to stop and let him go, or to push it and attempt with all of the possible drugs and the treatments, taking the very high risk of damaging other organs,” Dr Alfieri told told the Milan daily Corriere della Sera.

“In the end, that is the path we chose.”

Francis was released on Sunday after 38 days of treatment for double pneumonia, under doctors' orders to observe two months of convalescence during which he should avoid large gatherings.

The pope appeared weak and frail when he greeted the crowd outside the Gemelli hospital before his discharge.

The Vatican has said it is not clear if the pope will meet with the King on a Vatican state visit next month, or any Holy Week activities leading up to Easter on April 20.

Dr Alfieri said that the pope remained “alert” throughout the February 28 ordeal and that his personal health care assistant, Massimiliano Strappetti, “who knows perfectly the pontiff's wishes”, urged them “to try everything. Don't give up”.

Dr Alfieri acknowledged that the treatment risked damaging the pope's kidneys and bone marrow, “but we continued, and his body responded to the treatments and the lung infection improved”.

The medical bulletin that night said the pope had suffered a bronchiospasm so severe that he inhaled vomit “worsening his respiratory picture”. Doctors used a non-invasive aspiration to clear his airways.

Three days later, in a second life-and-death crisis, the pope suffered a pair of acute bronchiospasms episodes. Doctors used a camera tube with a device to remove mucus plus that yielded abundant secretions.

The bulletin emphasised that the pope “always remained alert, oriented and collaborative”.

Dr Alfieri said he believed that prayers for the pope help keep him alive, something that the doctor said is backed by scientific literature.

“In this case the whole world was praying. I can say that twice the situation was lost, and then it happened like a miracle,” the doctor said, adding that “of course he was a very co-operative patient”.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Brazil's government has apologised to families of victims of the country's military dictatorship whose remains could be among those found in a clandestine mass grave 35 years ago.

Dozens of families are still waiting to know whether their parents, children, siblings and friends are in one of more than 1,000 blue bags discovered in 1990 in a ditch in a Sao Paulo cemetery in the isolated district of Perus.

That was the first of many mass graves uncovered by Brazil's authorities after the end of the 21-year military rule in 1985.

The clandestine grave at the Dom Bosco cemetery also contained the remains of several unidentified people who were not linked to the fight against Brazil's dictatorship.

Monday's official apology is part of a deal between prosecutors, family members and the state.

It took place during Right to Truth Day, which is also celebrated in other countries.

Human rights minister Macae Evaristo said the Brazilian state was neglectful in the identification process of the bags and bones found in Perus.

For almost 25 years, the remains were held by three state universities and laboratories outside Brazil, but only a handful of families finally had their loved ones identified.

Ms Evaristo said Brazil's government has invested about 200,000 Brazilian reais (£26,860) each year for the identification of bags from Perus, but agreed that is not enough to give peace to families of victims.

“What the Brazilian government has been doing is continuing the process of seeking investigation and accountability. We need to remember that our ministry was dismantled,” Ms Evaristo said, in a reference to the 2019-22 presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, an advocate of the country's military dictatorship.

“Families have the right to the truth. Brazilian society has the right to the truth.”

Families uncertain if their loved ones' remains were in the Perus mass grave attended the ceremony.

Gilberto Molina, who represented them, had his brother Flavio's remains finally identified in one of the bags in 2005.

The Brazilian State only recognised it was responsible for the crime in his brother's third death certificate, early in 2019.

“It was a funeral of almost 50 years. For some other families it still is an even longer one,” Mr Molina said. “I hope that every family here still has perseverance in their quest for justice.”

Brazil's truth commission in 2014 reported that at least 434 people were killed and more than 100 disappeared completely during the country's military dictatorship.

The disappearance of former politician Rubens Paiva, portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film I'm Still Here, renewed public interest in the dictatorship's abuses, attracting an audience of more than six million in Brazil.

Nilmario Miranda, a former government minister and long-time human rights activist, said uncovering a mass grave with victims of the dictatorship in 1990 — only a few years after redemocratisation — was a major affair led by then Sao Paulo Mayor Luiza Erundina.

Faced with anonymous death threats, she appointed City Hall officers to oversee the searches.

“It was all under the rug of society, it was all hidden and you couldn't speak about it. That put the deal that ended the dictatorship in check, the one that spared torturers and executioners,” Ms Miranda said, in a reference to Brazil's 1979 amnesty law that did not punish crimes of the military during the regime.

That law could soon be partially reversed by Brazil's Supreme Court in cases of people who were killed then by state agents and had their remains vanished.

Antonio Pires Eustaquio, who became a manager at the Don Bosco cemetery in 1976 and helped families in their quest for justice for decades, celebrated the apology.

“This can only happen in a democracy. Dictators don't apologise for their mistakes,” Mr Eustaquio said.

“I remember that at that time people always wondered whether I was going to be killed for I knew where the illegal ditch was. My being here means democracy won.”

But Crimeia Almeida, whose husband, her father-in-law and a brother-in-law went missing as guerrilla men about 50 years ago, said the state's apology is not enough.

“The apology is not enough. It is nice, we get emotional, but it doesn't solve the criminal act,” she said.

President Donald Trump has downplayed revelations of a US security breach.

It comes after it was reported that top national security officials for President Trump, including his defence secretary, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic”.

Mr Trump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, more than two hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.

The material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing”, editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.

It was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security.

The US has conducted air strikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.

Just two hours after Mr Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the US began launching a series of air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

The National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat.

In addition to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, it included vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Mr Trump's director of national intelligence.

Mr Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Mr Trump's national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.

Mr Hegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Mr Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Mr Trump from the publication.

He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Mr Goldberg ended up on the message chain.

“Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,” Mr Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defence secretary.

Mr Trump on Tuesday in a brief interview with NBC News' Garrett Haake downplayed the incident as “the only glitch in two months” of his administration “and it turned out not to be a serious one”.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday said in post on X that no war plans were discussed and that no classified material was sent to the thread”.

Ms Leavitt said on Monday the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Mr Waltz and the national security team. Mr Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Mr Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man”.

Earlier on Monday, Mr Trump told reporters: “I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine”.

Government officials have used Signal for organisational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting.

Ms Leavitt said the White House counsel's office has provided guidance to Mr Trump's top officials on a number platforms to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.

The sharing of sensitive information comes as Mr Hegseth's office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defence personnel to determine how reporters have received information.

Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Mr Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defence secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.

The administration's handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic politicians. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.

“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Mr Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a speech on Monday afternoon.

“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.

He said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Mr Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the administration immediately”.

Some Republicans also expressed concerns.

Senator Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters: “We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top United Nations official in the world's youngest nation warned on Monday.

Calling the situation unfolding in the country “dire,” Nicolas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if president Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage “and put the interests of their people ahead of their own”.

There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict.

But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Mr Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Mr Machar, an ethnic Nuer.

More than 40,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Mr Kiir and Mr Machar together in a government of national unity.

Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 — and again until 2026.

The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Mr Machar.

Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire.

Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Mr Machar's home in the capital Juba and arresting several of his key allies.

Mr Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating “particularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players”.

He said Mr Kiir and Mr Machar do not trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move toward a future with a stable and democratic South Sudan.

“Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,” Mr Haysom said.

“Given this grim situation,” he said, “we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war”.

Mr Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.

He said the UN takes the threat of the “ethnic transformation” of the conflict very seriously.

To try to prevent a new civil war, the UN special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.

He said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Mr Kiir and Mr Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions “through dialogue rather than military confrontation”.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail for legal purposes — not for communicating with anyone — as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive.

In a court filing made public late on Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he have a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson.

Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal site where Mangione is being held.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.

Defence lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there is “no connection to Mr Mangione for any of said alleged threats.”

Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference.

Mr Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.

Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges.

He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He has not entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Mr Thompson's death.

Mr Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.

The case also channelled some Americans' frustrations with health insurance companies.

Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.

Some people have lionised the accused killer, donated money to his defence and even flocked to his court appearances.

Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.

Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.

If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing.

But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.

Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there are not enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defence.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

French actor Gerard Depardieu has acknowledged that he used crude and heated language around a woman who accuses him of sexual assault and grabbed her hips but denied assaulting her, as he gave evidence for the first time at his trial in Paris.

She told the court that he had behaved “like a madman” who took “pleasure in frightening me”.

The second day of the Paris trial centred on the Oscar-nominated actor's behaviour during the filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.

The 76-year-old has denied assaulting the women.

But during more than an hour of evidence on Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualised language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.

Depardieu said he had been in a “bad mood” because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.

“I understand perfectly if she's a bit upset,” he said. “I don't have to talk like that, get angry like that, voila.”

But he insisted that he is not a sexual predator.

“I'm not touching the butts of women,” Depardieu said.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (£62,000) if convicted. The verdict is not expected immediately after the trial.

The set dresser gave evidence after Depardieu. She described the alleged assault in detail.

She said he grabbed her hips then started “palpating” her behind and “in front, around”. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.

“That's when I had a reflex of ‘My God'. I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn't do it,” she said. “He terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.”

“It was very brief, there was no shouting,” she said, adding that she had been too “petrified” to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu's hands from her.

“I saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that's what I felt, it's savagery,” she said. “He terrified me, and that amused him.”

She said Depardieu's calm and co-operative attitude in court bore no resemblance to his behaviour at work.

“Here, he's exemplary, he doesn't move, he's quiet, he doesn't make any noise,” she said. “He's not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.”

On the film set “he started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities”, she told the court.

The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.

In his evidence, Depardieu said he had noticed that the set dresser had been taken aback by his behaviour and language. He acknowledged that his behaviour can be boorish.

“I've always been told I have a Russian nature, I don't know if it's because of the drinking or the vulgarity,” he said. “I have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.”

French star actor Gerard Depardieu, on trial for sexual assault, told the Paris court Tuesday that he was not in the habit of ""groping"" women, and called the #MeToo movement a ""reign of terror.""He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement, which he told the court Tuesday ""will become a reign of terror"".

Gerard Depardieu is more than just a household name in France.

Two women have accused the French actor of assault on the set of 'The Green Shutters' in 2021.

Actor Gérard Depardieu arrived in a Paris court on Monday for his trial over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, a case placing one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence.

Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream analyzes the legal pushback to the Trump administration's deportation of illegal migrants on ‘America Reports.'

The Justice Department said this week that it has invoked the state secrets privilege in its ongoing court battle over the deportation of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, a national security tool that allows the government to withhold certain information from the courts for national security purposes. 

In the 10-page court filing submitted to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior Trump administration officials said they chose to invoke the privilege because disclosure would pose what they described as a ""reasonable danger"" to national security and foreign affairs. 

""The Court has all of the facts it needs to address the compliance issues before it,"" the Justice Department officials said, adding: ""Further intrusions on the Executive Branch would present dangerous and wholly unwarranted separation-of-powers harms with respect to diplomatic and national security concerns that the Court lacks competence to address.""

The news comes as Boasbeg has repeatedly pressed government lawyers for more information about its deportation flights last weekend, which sent around 261 migrants, including Venezuelan nationals and members of the gang Tren de Aragua, from the U.S. to El Salvador.

The flights left U.S. soil around the time Boasberg agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, or the little-used wartime immigration law passed by Congress in 1798, to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals.

Hours later, however, planes carrying hundreds of migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed on the basis of the law in question, arrived in El Salvador.

In the days that followed, Boasberg ordered both parties back to court to testify over the removals, and whether the Trump administration knowingly defied his court order.

The Justice Department had largely refused to comply with his requests for information – which included questions on how many individuals it deported ""solely on the basis"" of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation, where the planes landed, what time each plane took off from the U.S., and from where – citing national security protections.

Boasberg previously warned the Trump administration of consequences last week if it were to continue to violate his order, noting that their options were to either file information under seal or invoke the state secrets privilege.

Should the Trump administration invoke the state secrets privilege, Boasberg noted at the time, the court ""is obligated to ‘determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege.'""

This was disputed in the filing by Bondi and other senior Justice Department personnel, however, who said in the filing Monday night, ""No more information is needed to resolve any legal issue in this case.""

The legal back and forth comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly stressed that a federal judge, in their view, does not have the ability to rule on national security matters or immigration issues – putting Boasberg, and his ruling, directly in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

The Justice Department also appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C., which heard the case yesterday. The three-judge panel declined to immediately rule on the matter, though a decision is expected sometime this week.

President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, is facing a Senate hearing on Tuesday morning about his qualifications to run the massive retirement system, as well as his plans for the agency at a time when it has been targeted for significant job cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. 

The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.

Here's what to know about the hearing. 

The Senate hearing will be streamed at 10:10 a.m. ET at the Senate Finance Committee's website, which can be found here.

Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020. 

Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.

In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits. 

""The objective isn't to touch benefits,"" Bisignano told CNBC. ""The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,"" adding that he views himself as ""fundamentally a DOGE person.""

The executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to find fraud, waste or abuse within the system. 

Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner. 

The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.

The Big Four giants—EY PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG—have all launched legal arms to compete against the traditional legal sector, but recent cracks show that their vision is not playing out.

The Legal Services Act 2007 introduced Alternative Business Structure (ABS) licenses, which allowed the Big Four to compete in the UK legal market.

It wasn't the firms' first time in the market, having had legal practices since the 1990s, but the ABS saw the Big Four aggressively reshape their legal businesses.

PwC was the first Big Four to launch a dedicated legal services arm, PwC Legal, in 2014, followed shortly by EY and KPMG.

Deloitte completed the group with the launch of Deloitte Legal in 2018.

The push into the legal market was starting to look positive. In 2023, data by Saïd Business School revealed the Big Four generated $1.5bn (£1.25bn) in revenues from their legal segments.

The figures increased from $900m in 2015 to $1.2bn in 2017.

However, the cracks have started to show.

Last week, news broke that EY was making more cuts, this time for around 30 staff in its legal department, EY Law.

In a statement EY said: “These proposals would continue to strengthen EY's existing legal capabilities in corporate law, company secretarial, tax litigation and immigration but would, regrettably, result in a reduction of roles across other areas of the UK Law business.”

This isn't the first time EY has taken the shears to its legal arm. In December 2023, news broke it was shutting EY Riverview Law, the Manchester-based legal services business it acquired in 2018.

On top of that its headcount has fallen to around 160 after a series of high-profile departures, including nearly a dozen lawyers leaving for the City office of Hunton Andrews Kurth in December.

According to Scott Gibson, director of Edwards Gibson: “If we exclude Deloitte's ill-fated lock-stock and barrel acquisition of 27-partner TMT boutique Kemp Little in 2021, between 2019 and 2024, the Big Four's legal divisions combined hired 35 partners in London.”

“Against this, the quartet lost 40 serving partners (including two-thirds of the laterals who joined during that time) to rival law firms,” he added.

So, why are the Big Four not storming the legal market?

Christopher Clark, director at Definitum Search, says: “One challenge lies in the conflicts with the audit businesses, preventing a large number of legal instructions from getting off the ground.”

The Big Four's bread and butter is their accountancy departments, which are tightly regulated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

Plainly put, if the firm is auditing a business's financials, the rest of its business can't touch any work for that client.

Another issue is the structure of the Big Four firms. Nick Woolf, partner at Woolf&Co, highlighted that “however big their legal practice, they are always going to pale into insignificance compared to other parts of the firm.”

He noted the culture this creates explaining lawyers “who take pride in their own book of business, winning work themselves and seeing their own name in lights, are likely to be very disappointed by seeing none of these traits rewarded or even applauded in a Big Four firm.”

Woolf added that the Big Four had recruited the wrong partners for their needs.

Out of the Big Four, it seems KPMG is keeping its head above the water.

Gibson noted that the firm hired eight partners for KPMG Law UK in London versus just one for the rest of the Big Four.

“In 2024, whilst KPMG only managed to hire one partner in London, this was still 100 per cent more than the rest of the quartet combined,” he noted.

Speaking to City AM last July, the head of KPMG Law UK, Stuart Bedford, explained that the firm is not looking to challenge traditional Big Law on the likes of big corporate M&A deals. However, as he points out, there is a Venn diagram that overlaps with these firms and those deals.

“What we do is slightly different and tends to be the sorts of projects that actually those firms don't really focus on,” he added. 

This comes after KPMG revealed last month it launched KPMG Law US, the first law firm owned by a Big Four firm serving the US market.

A spokesperson for KPMG told City AM: “Whilst there is a lot of market uncertainty, we continue to grow and there are opportunities to help clients to not only remain compliant but optimise their businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory environment all while finding cost-effective ways of meeting their regulatory needs.”

An overview of the Big Four market, Gibson noted that firms “were able to sell themselves to lawyers with their ready made global networks, blue-chip client base, legendary organisational abilities, and gargantuan turnover.”

“In their numerous set-piece growth plans, the Big Four have themselves often conflated the volume of partner hiring from other law firms with success.”

He stated, “on that basis, with the possible exception of KPMG, the Big Four are failing.”

“If this was not already clear enough, unfortunately, EY's latest retreat from Big Law in the UK is likely to make it even harder for the rest of the quartet to attract and retain quality lawyers – let alone rainmaker partners,” Gibson added.

A spokesperson for Deloitte Legal told City AM: “Deloitte Legal's approach is blending legal expertise with our ability to deliver scale and leverage technology, alongside the broader range of Deloitte capabilities.”

“Our focus is on business solutions to the chief legal officer and becoming their business partner – a strategy that continues to resonate strongly with our clients and also with our people,” they added. 

This comes as the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

After two years of redundancies after redundancies, recent news showed the situation has escalated to the senior partnership. City AM has a long read on what is next for the Big Four.

Oops, something went wrong

Investors are betting on new Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan to turn around the troubled chipmaker.

While it's unclear whether Intel's financial problems can be fixed quickly, Wall Street analysts — and current and former employees — generally agree on what steps Tan needs to take, short of a breakup. Those steps include everything from cutting jobs to turbocharging Intel's young foundry business.

A semiconductor industry veteran, Tan was appointed to his new role on March 12. Investors applauded the news: Intel stock rose more than 15% the next day. Analysts liked Tan's experience as former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a semiconductor design software company, and his experience on boards of some 14 semiconductor companies, including Intel.

Now the hard part.

Tan is inheriting a company whose financial losses have made it a takeover target in recent months. Many Wall Street analysts and investors believe Intel — which is the only American leading-edge chip manufacturer — would be better off splitting up and selling its struggling manufacturing business. Case in point: The stock has risen on various reports in recent months of potential deals, some of which were allegedly being worked on with the support of the Trump administration.

Reuters reported last week that Tan plans to keep Intel's manufacturing business running for now and is looking to bolster Intel's faltering AI chip efforts to catch up to Nvidia (NVDA). He said as much in a letter to employees on March 12: ""Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before.""

Read more about Intel's stock moves and today's market action.

Yahoo Finance interviewed four Wall Street analysts and nine current and former Intel employees — including high-level executives. The employees were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance.

And Intel's product business, which designs the chips, can't outsource to rival manufacturers so easily — Intel semiconductors are specifically made in accordance with its own internal manufacturing processes. Not to mention, Intel's billions in CHIPS Act funding requires it to retain majority ownership of its foundry.

Intel declined to make Lip-Bu Tan available for an interview but told Yahoo Finance: ""Lip-Bu is spending a lot of time listening to customers and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success.""

Here's what company sources and Wall Street analysts said he has to do to to avoid a break up.

Intel is one of the few remaining chipmakers that both designs and makes its own chips.

On the design side, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as AMD (AMD) and, of course, Nvidia in an increasingly AI-dominated industry. On the manufacturing side, Intel has repeatedly faced delays.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger attempted to grow Intel's revenue by opening its in-house manufacturing business — a ""foundry"" — to outside customers on a large scale. Foundries such as Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) produce chips for other companies. Intel historically produced chips for its internal product business before Gelsinger launched Intel Foundry Services (IFS) in 2021.

The foundry strategy had mixed results. Intel is set to achieve a big feat by launching a new advanced chip manufacturing process called 18A this year, and IFS has deals with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). But analysts debate whether Intel can sustain the foundry, which lost $13.4 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue in 2024.

Bottom line: Intel needs to attract more big outside customers. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success.

In order for Intel's manufacturing business to survive, the company must succeed in launching 18A. While Intel manufacturing employees had previously suggested that the new technology was having trouble, those same employees said this week that 18A is progressing — and Intel manufacturing staff is feeling ""positive"" about its success.

As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said: ""[I]f the results are good and companies are happy, they'll increase their capacity at"" the foundry.

Per Reuters, Tan is looking to boost Intel's AI chip efforts to rival Nvidia and others.

Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, Intel scrapped a multiyear project, Larrabee, to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD's graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU, which ultimately failed. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores.

""Intel has a very good finance organization, but the company does sometimes make these decisions that are overly led by the early years' financial outcome,"" said a former high-level executive. ""You only learn from deploying. If you intend to be in that market long term, you might as well have access to the market, even if it costs you through the first generation.""

Former and current Intel employees describe the company, whose staffers refer to themselves as ""Team Blue,"" as slow and bureaucratic. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management.

It's a tough balancing act. The two current employees said any layoffs could depress morale and risk slowing the progress of 18A. Tan already has said Intel has ""hard decisions"" ahead. One of the employees said their colleagues are bracing for a potentially ""huge amount” of layoffs in the second or third quarter.

They said their teams are already understaffed, and cuts to middle management would result in those teams being moved around, creating chaos.

One of the high-level former executives said, ""The depth of talent at Intel is immense, and the loyalty that people have is astounding,"" later adding, ""The answer lies in inspiring the people you have.""

Oops, something went wrong

Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler said Tuesday that she is in favor of holding interest rates steady for ""some time"" as some economic data shows signs of softness and progress on inflation slows.

The Fed's rate-setting committee ""can react to new developments by holding at the current rate for some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new policies,” she said in a speech in Washington, D.C., citing a ""heightened level of uncertainty.""

The central bank last Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Kugler is particularly watching inflation amid an increase in consumer expectations for inflation in the short term because of Trump's tariffs.

""I am paying close attention to the acceleration of price increases and higher inflation expectations, especially given the recent bout of inflation in the past few years,"" Kugler said.

Kugler highlighted that prices of goods have started rising again after falling over the past year, which she says is ""unhelpful"" because it helped keep a lid on overall inflation and also impacts inflation expectations.

Fed officials will get a new reading on inflation during the month of February this Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge.

Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in February, up from the 2.6% seen in January. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.3%, unchanged from January.

Kugler said the PCE shows ""welcome progress"" from a peak of more than 7% in June 2022, but ""that progress has slowed since last summer.""

Kugler also noted that some economic data has shown weakness, pointing to recent retail sales, and that the pace of hiring during the first two months of the year has slowed compared with the strong gains in November and December, but she said that could reflect weather disruptions and seasonal adjustment challenges.

Overall, though, the economy's ""solid position"" allows the Fed to be patient for now as it weighs uncertainties stemming from Trump's economic policies.

Trump on Monday said he would like to see the Fed lower rates because inflation is coming down.

""I'd like to see the Fed lower interest rates,"" he said Monday during a Cabinet meeting, where he stressed that grocery and energy prices are coming down.

""That's just my opinion, because things are coming down. We have inflation under control. Tremendous amounts of money will be soon coming in from tariffs.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the same Cabinet meeting Monday also promised inflation would be contained, stressing that the administration is reducing ""excess employment in the government sector ... so everyone laid off from the government will have an opportunity to go into the private sector.""

That, Bessent added, ""is going to lead to disinflation"" and get inflation ""under control.""

Oops, something went wrong

Boeing (BA) wants President Trump to let it out of a guilty criminal plea agreement the jet maker reached with the Biden administration, according to a report.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Boeing is pushing Trump's new Justice Department officials to allow it to withdraw that 2024 plea, in which it admitted that its workers conspired to defraud aviation regulators.

Boeing did not comment on the Wall Street Journal report.

Avoiding a criminal conviction would be a major victory for the company that could allow it to avoid compounded headwinds as it tries to show progress on several fronts more than one year after a door plug blew off a Boeing-made Alaska Airlines (ALK) 737 Max 9 jet.

Criminal convictions can foreclose or suspend a company's right to contract with the federal government and frustrate its ability to secure loans, according to Eddie Jauregui, a white-collar defense attorney with Holland & Knight and former federal prosecutor.

Read more about Boeing's stock moves and today's market action.

Those consequences have particular meaning for Boeing, which counts the federal government as its largest customer and also happens to be the country's largest exporter. Just last week, Boeing won a major contract to build a new F-47 jet fighter for the Pentagon.

Admitting guilt was meant to insulate Boeing from facing a criminal trial on the government's allegation that the jet maker misled Federal Aviation Administration officials before two fatal 737 Max 8 crashes killed 346 people in the past decade.

Those allegations initially produced a deferred prosecution agreement reached in 2021, but last year the DOJ notified Boeing that it had breached the agreement after a door plug blew off a Boeing-made 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines.

After Boeing and Biden's DOJ officials reached the guilty plea deal last year, they submitted it to a federal judge.

But that US judge for the Northern District of Texas, Reed O'Connor, decided late last year in an order that the deal was insufficient, in part because of its terms governing the selection and conditions for a corporate monitor tasked with protecting against future fraud.

O'Connor cited provisions in the agreement that included race as a condition in selecting a corporate monitor as ""inappropriate"" and ""against the public interest.""

The judge said the crash victims' families opposed race as a consideration in the selection of the corporate monitor, as well as a section that omitted Boeing's compliance with the monitor's anti-fraud recommendations as a condition of its probation.

Families who lost loved ones in the crashes also objected to the deal and called it a ""sweetheart"" scenario for Boeing. In their objection filed in the Texas court, they said the DOJ made concessions to Boeing that it would not extend to any other criminal defendant.

O'Connor, a former President George W. Bush appointee, has a track record of siding with conservative litigants against the government, according to reporting from Reuters.

Before Trump took office, Boeing and the Justice Department told the judge they were still working ""in good faith"" on amending the plea deal.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the two sides are still negotiating changes to the deal and that the proposal is expected to be submitted to the judge by April 11.

There was another legal development this week involving Boeing. A federal judge in Illinois ruled on Monday in a separate case that former Boeing CEOs Dennis Muilenberg and Dave Calhoun, as well as Boeing suppliers, could not be held liable for negligence claims brought by families of victims killed in the 2019 Max crash.

The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked evidence that the executives knowingly participated in misconduct.

Oops, something went wrong

Former Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger spent a good chunk of 2023 and 2024 not only trying to transform the semiconductor icon but also seeking to get his fair share of the CHIPS and Science Act funding from the Biden administration.

Gelsinger — who has spent more than 45 years in the tech industry, mostly in semiconductor development at Intel — talked up the need for the law's funding for domestic chip manufacturing in TV interviews (including with this journalist). He also had photo ops with former President Joe Biden at Intel chip plant construction sites and seemed as excited about what the funding meant to Intel's future and the industry as discussing the outlook of artificial intelligence.

In effect, Gelsinger was the face of the CHIPS Act.

Though Gelsinger, who parted ways with Intel in December, is no longer CEO, and President Trump has criticized the CHIPS Act, Gelsinger still views the funding the same way.

""You'll raise the national consciousness of chips,"" Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance on a video call late Monday in one of his first interviews since leaving Intel.

Read more about Intel's stock moves and today's market action.

Listen: What Bill Gates thinks about Intel

Gelsinger announced Monday he will become executive chair and head of technology at Gloo, where he has been an investor and chair for over 10 years. Gloo is a technology platform that supports 450,000 churches, faith networks, service providers, and nonprofits, and it aligns with the values of the deeply religious Gelsinger.

Gelsinger added on the CHIPS Act: ""Supply chains move because they're advantaged. So in that sense, I see chips [making], plus some of the economic inducements, as being a formula that I fully agree with looking forward. But we can't go backward on what we put in place for the CHIPS Act. We need to continue to restore manufacturing. We need long-term research and development.""

The Biden administration's CHIPS Act was signed into law in 2022, introducing major government subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. The law was meant to shore up critical chip supply chains and reduce reliance on industry heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).

The law included $39 billion in subsidies for US chipmaking along with $13.2 billion for semiconductor R&D. Intel received a $7.86 billion grant from the CHIPS Act.

The funds were supposed to support new advanced packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. However, Intel said in February that its promised $28 billion chip fabrication plants in Ohio would be delayed in opening until 2030 and 2031. This marks a more than five-year delay in the opening timeline as Intel struggles to stabilize its business.

""The CHIPS Act was designed to, I'll say, close the gaps that had emerged with Asia,"" Gelsinger said.

Despite the need to diversify the US chip supply chain, the CHIPS Act has become a punching bag for President Trump as of late.

During his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Trump said the CHIPS Act was a ""horrible, horrible thing."" He told House Speaker Mike Johnson to ""get rid"" of the legislation and earmark the remaining cash to reduce debt or ""any other reason you want to.""

Interestingly, Trump touted Taiwan Semiconductor's plans to spend $165 billion to build new chip facilities in Arizona. But $6.6 billion of the funding for the project will come in the form of grants via the CHIPS Act, as Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley pointed out.

Trump has since called the CHIPS Act a ""disaster.""

""I think it has been a massive distraction,"" Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). ""The semiconductor industry did not really need it. I think ... there could have been other ways.""

Arya acknowledged, however, that the CHIPS Act has created good-paying manufacturing jobs in the country.

The face of the CHIPS Act probably agrees.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

""Liberation Day"" came early. Wall Street hinted at the start of a comeback in the hopes that President Trump's next round of April 2 tariffs will be narrower than many had feared. Investors are scrambling back into Big Tech, and for good reason. The recovery doesn't have to wait for the tariff deadline. The inklings of them not happening is enough.

The swift tumble of the Magnificent Seven and the not-so-magnificent puns that followed bolstered the case for the end of the AI trade. The shock of DeepSeek's success and the frustration over ballooning investment costs without clear returns was the kindling for Big Tech's unraveling. Talk of a new high-tariff era was the spark. But a change of heart speaks to the allure of seeing any setback as a buying opportunity. And it gets at the staying power of trillion-dollar enterprises.

When the market was down, with steep tariffs as the backdrop, the AI trade was unwinding. Under a more limited set of duties, however, beaten-down stock prices now look like excuses to buy back in. If you can wait out the trough, why not buy AI stocks on sale?

But after so much uncertainty, any clarity — for tech, for the market, for businesses, and for consumers — will come with a big asterisk.

It helps that the perceptions of a gentler tariff regime are coming directly from the White House. Trump administration officials have tried to spread the message that the market may be overreacting to the scope of the reciprocal tariffs. Several reports in recent days signaled that the levies will be more targeted than the president has let on, focusing instead on specific countries, about 15% of nations, with persistent trade imbalances with the US.

The market rejoiced at this semblance of clarity — but there's a “for now” coming. After four weeks of losses, coinciding with Wall Street's response to Trump's global trade remake, it's hard to tell if this is the start of a revival or just the latest gyration in an erratic narrative of threats, walk-backs, anticlimaxes, and muddled deals.

Is the clever move to follow the White House's cues to get ahead of the deadline? Or to wait and see how the cement dries? This is a market that has been burned before.

""Investors shouldn't be overly optimistic yet,"" said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. ""V-shaped recoveries are rare, and sustained stabilization typically requires a period of sideways movement before confidence can fully return.""

But for the tech optimists out there, the peeling back of trade uncertainty leaves the fundamental case for the tech giants intact: a wide moat around the business, an array of recurring revenue streams, and a perception of irreplaceability.

In one sense, the ticking time bomb of tariffs will come as a relief. The next phase of the tech trade follows reset expectations with more modest valuations, alongside revenue growth and a reinvigorated sense of urgency around AI innovation and supremacy.

Investors for the past month were confronted with new reasons to sell. When peak tariff uncertainty subsides, it should become more clear why they bought in the first place.

Oops, something went wrong

The US economy has undergone a narrative shift over the past month.

After two years of outperforming expectations, it now appears the economy is growing slower than many on Wall Street thought it would to start 2025. But while the economy is cooling, it isn't collapsing.

""Growth looks like it's maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending moderating a bit, but still at a solid pace,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during his most recent press conference on March 19.

Powell's description of an economy that ""seems to be healthy"" came after the Fed lowered its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projection for 2025 to 1.7% in its latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) last week. This marked a move lower from the 2.1% growth the Fed had projected back in December.

Economic forecasters across Wall Street have made similar revisions to their full-year GDP projections based on expectations that President Trump's tariff policies will weigh on business activity. JPMorgan now sees US economic growth of 1.6% this year, down from a prior forecast of 1.9%. Morgan Stanley is now at 1.5%, down from 1.9%, while Goldman Sachs projects growth of 1.7%, down from 2.4%.

Notably, none of these revisions have been calls for an outright economic downturn or some sort of rapid slowing in economic growth. For instance, in March, Goldman Sachs moved up its probability for a recession in the next 12 months to 20% from a prior projection of 15%. Given the chances of a recession in the next 12 months typically stand at about 15% at any given point in history, Goldman's move to 20% isn't exactly arguing that's the most likely outcome.

""If you go back two months, people were saying that the likelihood of a recession was extremely low,"" Powell said. ""So, [it] has moved up, but it's not high.""

Powell's assessment of the US economic picture falls in line with what many forecasters have been saying, but it is more optimistic than other data points. Popular betting market Kalshi is now pricing in a 40% chance of recession in the next year, about double the chances that were projected in mid-February. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool recently made headlines, as it's currently forecasting a nearly 2% decline in GDP for the first quarter. And several measures of consumer sentiment have tumbled in the past month as policy uncertainty has made consumers more wary about the economic outlook.

But most of those are indicative of vibes right now as fears of tariffs and federal layoffs make headlines. They don't reflect the reality of the economy's position.

It's happened before: In 2022, consumer sentiment and confidence measures — both considered ""soft"" survey data — plunged in a similar fashion. Back then, consumers kept spending, keeping the ""hard data,"" like the monthly retail sales report, afloat.

In a research note to clients on Sunday, Morgan Stanley's chief global economist wrote that ""all the cries about recession"" are ""probably"" overdone. He pointed to January's decline in retail sales spooking investors, only to then be reversed by a gain in February. 

The same could be said for S&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. On Monday, the index reading came in at 53.5 for March, a rebound from the 51.6 seen in February and above economists' expectations of 50.9.

S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist Chris Williamson wrote in a release Monday morning that his firm's data shows the US economy likely grew at a 1.5% annualized pace during the first quarter of 2025. As Williamson highlighted, this points ""to a slowing of GDP growth"" compared to the 2.3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Again, this reflects weaker growth but not a catastrophic slowdown. In terms of impacts to the stock market, research from RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina shows that when GDP for the year is between 0.1% and 2%, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) struggles. Notably though, as the chart below shows, stocks do far worse when GDP is between 0.1% and 1%.

The key investor question right now is whether economic growth forecasts have come down far enough — or if they will keep moving lower and further weigh on stocks. For now, Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan tells Yahoo Finance that the current signs of slowing aren't abnormal.

For instance, consumer spending fell in January for the first time in nearly two years. But the loss came after several strong months of above-trend spending to end 2024. After growing at an ""unsustainable pace"" to end last year, Ryan said his team had already expected that metric to cool to start 2025.

""The question is, do we get more than that?"" Ryan said. ""And at this point, you know, we're not there, given the labor market [is] still OK, and labor income growth is still enough to support consumption.""

Ryan pointed out that if labor market dynamics changed and the US economy started posting monthly job losses or the unemployment rate shot higher, then the outlook for consumer spending would also likely deteriorate.

But for now, metrics Ryan looks at — like the rolling average of workers continuing to apply for unemployment benefits — are ""nowhere near what I would consider sending a recessionary signal.""

Oops, something went wrong

Job-hopping has lost its luster.

The median pay increase for workers switching jobs sank substantially to 4.8% last month from a pinnacle of 7.7% two years ago, according to recently released data from the Atlanta Fed.

While job changers tend to receive higher pay increases than job stayers, the gap between job stayers and those who switch roles has fizzled and is now at its lowest level in a decade. A worker who stayed put and received an annual raise saw nearly the same bump in pay — 4.6%, the Atlanta Fed found.

“The pendulum is swinging back from the pandemic premium for new hires,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at employment search site ZipRecruiter, told Yahoo Finance.

“The gap between wage growth for job switchers and job stayers ballooned to the widest gap on record during the Great Resignation,” she said. “Companies rushed to rehire after the pandemic, and the No. 1 focus was on hiring incentives — signing bonuses and raising starting pay.”

The problem is that many companies felt burned by offering huge salaries and bonuses to people who stayed only a short while and then left for better opportunities.

Now the focus is on longer-term retention incentives such as retirement and health insurance benefits that make workers want to stay, Pollak said.

Federal job cuts and layoffs by large companies are contributing to a chilly job market overall, flashing the warning signs that the golden era for job seekers has ground to a halt. A recent Harris Poll found that 7 in 10 Americans think it's difficult to find a better position than the one they have now — and three-quarters say employers hold the power in the market.

“Hiring is so weak and unemployment durations are growing,” Pollak said. “Employers are opportunistically able to pick up great talents on the cheap.”

Talk about glum. A record-low 13% of job seekers described their search as going well, per the findings in a new ZipRecruiter report. Gloomier still — more than 6 in 10 job seekers reported zero job offers, the highest level in three years.

In 2022, wage growth contributed to people quitting their jobs for higher-paying options, Allison Shrivastava, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Yahoo Finance.

“At that time, finding a new job was easy for most, and companies had to compete to hire workers. Now, that competition has greatly decreased,” she said. “This shift … has made leaving their current job for a new one less attractive.”

The data backs that up. Workers are staying in their current jobs, as seen with the low quits rate tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics — 2.1% or 3 million people quit in January.

“The labor market is on ice,” Shrivastava said.

Another more recent cause of that cooling is the result of mixed messages about where things are going.

“Confusion and uncertainty (are) causing workers and companies to hold onto jobs and workers, while at the same time holding off on expanding their labor force,” she said. “This freezing can only last so long until the market gets frostbite, leading to an increase in layoffs or a further slowdown in hiring or quitting.”

On a brighter note: It could also be that some people were able to find roles that were a better fit for them in 2022 when job switching was commonplace, and they are happy where they are, Shrivastava said. “Either way, it's clear that people are going to be staying in their current jobs for longer.”

One caveat that can impact those lower starting salary figures: When people change fields, they tend to take a pay cut initially. And plenty of folks have been doing just that.

During the pandemic many workers had time to do some soul-searching about what they really wanted to do, and the number of those transitioning to new careers has risen.

“Only about 30% of job seekers say they want to switch industries, but more than 50% of recently hired workers got their jobs in a new industry,” Pollak told me.“That suggests that workers who keep an open mind, expand their search, invest in new skills, and follow opportunity are disproportionately successful.”

Whether you're a career switcher or simply a job shifter, it's not always about the money.

“Many job jumpers leave not just for money,” Jayne Mattson, a career coach, told me. “They leave companies because they aren't getting any professional development or growth, or they found employment during COVID and it is not the right role and they want to find a better fit.”

Mattson's advice for job seekers: Before you start your search, think of what you want in your next role and what it looks like.

“When people are leaving their job, I always ask, ‘What do you hope to get in your next role that you are not getting now?' If they're not clear of what they want to do, what their values and interests are, how will they know if they get an offer that is the right one?”

	Humans undergoing similar radiation for cancer treatment often suffer painful side effects

A protein unique to tardigrades (one shown here under a microscope) can help reduce DNA damage caused by radiation in mice.

1 hour ago

A protein found in tardigrades — tiny animals less than a millimeter long — can protect mice from radiation damage.

Most cancer patients undergo radiation therapy as part of their treatment, often leading to devastatingly painful side effects. But there may be hope for mitigating some of that damage. Mice with cells engineered to produce a protective protein unique to tardigrades experienced reduced radiation damage, researchers report February 26 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

Radiation attacks the DNA of tumor cells, preventing tumor growth and eventually killing it. But it also damages the DNA of healthy tissue near the tumors, destroying those cells, too. People undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer can develop damaged throats or mouths, making eating and drinking extremely painful. Prostate cancer patients may experience rectal bleeding.

“I treat cancer patients with radiation, and I see a lot of side effects from treatment itself — side effects that can be really debilitating and severe,” says James Byrne, a radiation oncologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

These unintended consequences can lead people to stop treatment before their tumors are under control. While at MIT, Byrne and biomedical researcher Giovanni Traverso had “started to explore possibilities of creating radiation protection,” Byrne says, when they realized they could use a little help from tardigrades. 

Tardigrades may be as tiny as dust mites, but they are tough little creatures — even capable of tolerating extreme conditions like outer space. Nicknamed “water bears,” they can survive radiation doses about 1,000 times the lethal dose to humans.

Tardigrades produce a key damage-suppressor protein known as Dsup, which binds to their DNA to protect them from radiation. Byrne and Traverso wanted to somehow arm mice with this protein so they would be better equipped to deal with radiation.

The duo and their colleagues used lipid nanoparticles — tiny particles composed of fat molecules that can carry chemicals — to deliver messenger RNA, or mRNA, with instructions for creating the Dsup protein directly into mouse cheek and rectum cells. Byrne and his colleagues discovered that when exposed to radiation, the DNA of mice producing Dsup proteins showed fewer signs of radiation-induced damage compared to the DNA of mice that couldn't make Dsup.

“It highlights some of the value of research into areas where one might not immediately see a clinical outcome, like studies of DNA damage in tardigrades,” says Zachary Morris, an oncologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved with the study. “You can take findings from more basic or fundamental science and pair them with new delivery mechanisms and suddenly be in a situation where you have a very impactful finding with immediate relevance to human health.”

The researchers now plan to carefully evaluate the safety of this system before testing it on humans. Since tardigrade mRNA is foreign to humans, they want to ensure that injecting it doesn't lead to adverse reactions. Instead of directly injecting cells as they did with mice, they also want to develop patient-friendly ways to deliver the mRNA to human cells, such as using hydrogels.

“We were hoping to use what nature has really perfected as [this] optimized radiation protection, to potentially help patient care in the long term,” Byrne says.

	John Green's new book unravels how social injustice sustains the disease

Henry Reider, a survivor of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, makes videos to fight stigma surrounding the disease in Lakka, Sierra Leone. His story and those of others like him are the subject of John Green's new book.

Everything Is TuberculosisJohn GreenCrash Course Books, $28

A few years ago, renowned author John Green met a boy named Henry at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. Henry was small and, at first glance, looked about 9 years old to Green. Everyone at the hospital seemed to know and love him, making Green believe he was the child of a health care worker. That is until staff revealed that Henry was a patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis — and that he was 17.

Henry was small because he grew up malnourished. At age 5, he became ill with tuberculosis, which waxed and waned within his body for most of his youth, further emaciating him.

Green's latest nonfiction book, Everything is Tuberculosis, weaves Henry's story into the social and medical history of tuberculosis — one of the world's deadliest bacterial diseases. Over 1 million people died of tuberculosis in 2023, despite our ability to cure infections with antibiotics and prevent them with vaccines. “We know how to live in a world without tuberculosis,” Green writes. “But we choose not to live in that world.”

That's partly due to stigma, a central theme of the book. Negative, unfair beliefs about tuberculosis have been used to dehumanize and blame people for their illness. In some communities, the sick have been shunned, thought to be cursed or possessed by demons. In 18th and 19th century Europe, the disease was romanticized as an affliction of poets and artists. Like stigma, Green argues, this belief allowed society to other the sick as fundamentally different and even accept their deaths as “divine compensation” for their poetry and art.

Today, people living with tuberculosis have told Green that fighting stigma is even harder than fighting the disease itself. Through stories of Henry and others like him, Green argues convincingly that 21st century tuberculosis is caused not by bacteria but by injustice. He retraces the path of this injustice, from the disease's racialization in the 19th and 20th centuries to the ongoing global misallocation of treatments. Green contends, for instance, that Henry might have accessed safer and more appropriate medication sooner if it weren't for where he lives. Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health couldn't afford the high costs set by U.S. pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson for a treatment that might have cured Henry earlier.

In the end, Green reminds readers that we all must care. “In a world where everyone can eat, and access healthcare, and be treated humanely, tuberculosis has no chance. Ultimately, we are the cause,” Green writes. “We must also be the cure.”

Scientists have gotten the best-ever view of 'space tornadoes' howling near the Milky Way's black hole. The cosmic twisters could play an important role in distributing organic molecules throughout the galaxy.

""Space tornadoes"" are swirling near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, new telescope observations have revealed in unprecedented detail.

Astronomers recently zoomed in on the cosmic twisters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. Although these rotating structures had been seen previously, the new observations with ALMA are 100 times sharper than the earlier views, the team reported in a new paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The researchers began by pointing ALMA at a region of the galaxy known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), which surrounds our galaxy's core supermassive black hole and is filled with seething clouds of dust and gas. The team wanted to uncover the mechanism driving the relentless motion of these clouds.

They used ALMA to trace certain molecular compounds — such as silicon monoxide, which is particularly good at revealing shock waves — within the maelstrom. This allowed the team to detect previously unseen details in the cosmic dust storms — including a new type of long, slender filament that seems to form when shock waves ripple past.

""Unlike any objects we know, these filaments really surprised us,"" because they appear to move quickly and in a direction counter to the structures surrounding them, Kai Yang, an astronomer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and lead author of the study, said in a statement.



The researchers describe these filaments as space tornadoes. ""They are violent streams of gas, they dissipate quickly, and they distribute materials into the environment efficiently,"" the authors said in the statement. The team's observations suggest that, in addition to emitting silicon oxide, these whirlwinds might disperse complex organic molecules — such as methanol, methyl cyanide and cyanoacetylene — throughout the CMZ and beyond.

""ALMA's high angular resolution and extraordinary sensitivity were essential to detect these molecular line emission associated with the slim filaments, and to confirm that there is no associations between these structures with dust emissions,"" Yichen Zhang, an astrophysicist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a co-author of the paper, said in a statement.

Further observations with ALMA will help the researchers determine how widespread these slim filaments are within the CMZ and how they contribute to molecular cycling in the region.

Alef has billed its Model A electric vehicle, which is capable of operating both as a road-based car and as an aircraft, as the cure for congestion.

A new kind of road-legal flying car is now a step closer to hitting the roads, and skies, after its maker Alef Aeronautics signed an agreement with aerospace companies PUCARA Aero and MYC to build it.

The Alef Model A is designed to work as both a road vehicle and aircraft, with its aim being to beat commuter congestion, representatives say.

Styled as a ""retro"" flying car, the Model A will operate as an all-electric car capable of vertical takeoff and landing. When in flight, the chassis can rotate 90 degrees to become a large, fixed wing for aerodynamic flight, with the body of the car made from mesh, allowing air to flow through when in flight mode.

When the body rotates, the ""cockpit"" section of the vehicle stays in place to keep the pilot stabilized. “To have a good distance, you need good aeronautics, which means you need wings,” said Jim Dukhovny, founder and CEO at Alef Aeronautics, in an interview with CNN.

""When you tilt, when you do the transition, you look like a biplane, you actually have two wings — a top wing and a bottom wing — which makes it incredibly efficient, incredibly battery efficient and gives it the long distance.""



Unlike other flying car prototypes, the Alef Model A is only a single-seater and therefore not envisaged as a taxi or passenger vehicle. In 2023, Alef Aeronautics told CNN that the vehicle would have a road range of 200 miles (321 kilometers) between charges, versus a flying range of 110 miles (177 km). On the road, it will have a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour) — below the minimum speed limit for highways in states such as Florida.

Engineers have been building this vehicle since 2015, the year that Alef Aeronautics was founded. While they initially thought they could build one in just six months, it wasn't until 2019 that a pilot first flew a full-scale prototype.

The Model A is expected to cost $299,999 when it launches, and the company has received a reported 3,200 pre-orders to date

There is still a great deal of uncertainty over how easily individual customers can take to the skies, however. In October 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced new rules for ""powered-lift aircraft,"" defined as ""an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff, vertical landing, and low speed flight"" such as flying taxis.

However, the rules state that only those already certified as pilots with a Private Pilot License (PPL), Commercial Pilot License (CPL), or Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL) will be able to fly powered-lift aircraft. This means presently that Model A operators will need to have spent several months and logged a minimum 40 hours of flying time to attain a license before being allowed to fly it.

Scientists have discovered the fossilized remains of a new fish species called Ferruaspis brocksi, which lived 15 million years ago, and some of the fish have their final meals preserved inside their stomachs.

Fossils of 15 million-year-old freshwater fish discovered in Australia represent a species completely new to science — and they still have the remains of their final meals in their stomachs.

The fossils of the new species, named Ferruaspis brocksi, were unearthed by paleontologists at the McGraths Flat fossil site in New South Wales, Australia, according to a new study published March 17 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Inside several of the fish's stomachs were the fossilized remains of their last suppers, including bits of insect larvae, two insect wings, and a bivalve (a mollusk with two hinged shells, such as a clam or a mussel).

The discovery is the first fossil of a freshwater smelt — a small, silvery fish — in the group Osmeriformes to have been discovered in Australia and will help scientists determine when these fish arrived on the enormous island.

""The discovery of the 15 million-year-old freshwater fish fossil offers us an unprecedented opportunity to understand Australia's ancient ecosystems and the evolution of its fish species, specifically the Osmeriformes group during the Miocene epoch, 11-15 million years ago,"" study lead author Matthew McCurry, a paleontologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, said in a statement.

Osmeriformes is a broad order of fish that includes various smelt species found worldwide, both in freshwater and marine environments. Smelt are relatively common across the U.S., particularly in the Great Lakes, the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska, though some species are also present in inland rivers and lakes. There are at least six species of smelt across the country, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), Eulachon or Columbia River smelt (Thaleichthys pacificus) and delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus).



Scientists have long wondered exactly when smelt and related species arrived in Australia because the fossil record for this group of fish and their ancestors has been notably sparse. ""Without fossils it has been hard for us to tell exactly when the group arrived in Australia and whether they changed at all through time,"" McCurry said.

In the new study, the researchers describe how they discovered the fossilized remains of F. brocksi embedded in goethite, an iron-rich mineral. By analyzing the fossils with high-powered microscopes, the researchers discovered that the specimens had been preserved with a surprisingly high level of detail. The position of the fish's bones and fins, cells that gave the fish color, and their final meals had all remained frozen in time for 15 million years.

Because the paleontologists discovered several fish from this new species preserved at the same site, they could piece together what the ancient fish species might have looked like, as not every fish was entirely preserved. According to the researchers, F. brocksi represents an early ancestor of species in the Osmeriformes order found across Australia and New Zealand today.

""The fossils formed between 11 [million] and 16 million years ago and provide a window into the past,"" McCurry said. ""They prove that the area was once a temperate wet rainforest and that life was rich and abundant in the Central Tablelands, NSW [New South Wales].""

Their stomach contents also offer a glimpse into the behavior of this ancient species. ""We now know that they fed on a range of invertebrates, but the most common prey was small phantom midge larvae,"" McCurry said.

Additionally, the unexpected discovery of fossilized pigment cells called melanophores allowed the researchers to determine what color the fish might have been. ""The fish was darker on its dorsal surface, lighter in colour on its belly and had two lateral stripes running along its side,"" study co-author Michael Frese, a researcher at the University of Canberra and Australia's national science agency CSIRO, said in the statement.

Melanophores are responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin, hair, eyes and feathers.

""Fossilised melanosomes have previously enabled palaeontologists to reconstruct the colour of feathers,"" Frese said, but melanosomes have never been used to reconstruct the color pattern of a long-extinct fish species.

Where is it? Tofua, Ha'apai, Tonga [-19.73996943, -175.072336]

What's in the photo? Smoke coming from a volcanic cone near the island's summit

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? April 23, 2022

This stunning aerial shot highlights the ""looming threat"" of a volcanic island in Tonga, which could violently explode in the future. The island also has a colorful origin story in Tongan mythology, which involves quarreling gods, a stolen mountain and a brightly shining anus.

The island, named Tofua, consists mainly of a massive ring-like caldera left by an explosive eruption millions of years ago. The caldera's steep walls stand up to 1,690 feet (515 meters) above sea level and harbor a deep crater lake that is around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) across. The island is part of the Ha'apai island group, a chain of volcanic islands and reefs located along a fault line between the Pacific and Indo-Australian tectonic plates.

One of the Ha'apai region's most famous inhabitants is the underwater Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano, which violently erupted in January 2022, unleashing a gigantic plume of ash and steam above the ocean's surface. The explosive outburst, which occurred around 50 miles (80 km) south of Tofua, released as much energy as hundreds of atomic bombs, unleashed giant atmospheric shockwaves that reverberated across the globe, triggered a localized tsunami and wiped out a small nearby island. It also added record amounts of water vapor to Earth's atmosphere.

Tofua is docile compared to Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai. However, the smoke in the image, which was pumping out of a volcanic cone north of the crater lake, known as Lofia, is a reminder that the island is still very much active and could blow its top once again in the future, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

""There's the looming threat that Lofia could erupt explosively, much like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai did in 2022,"" though nothing suggests an eruption is imminent, NASA representatives wrote in October 2024.

Tofua has erupted at least 12 times since 1774, according to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program. The most recent and eruptive phase began in 2015 and is technically ongoing. However, the activity has mostly diminished as of May 2024.

In Tongan mythology, there is a colorful tale to explain Tofua's giant caldera and the creation of Kao — a tall cone-shaped island around 2.5 miles (4 km) northeast of Tofua, which is just out of shot in the satellite image.

In ""Tongan myths and tales,"" (Kraus, 1924) which was compiled from oral tradition told by local people at the time, American anthropologist Edward Winslow Gifford wrote the story:

—Erupting 'sharkcano' spits out a giant underwater plume in Oceania

—Antarctica's 'Deception Island' is one of the only places on Earth where you can sail into an active volcano

—Eerily circular 'Goblin Forest' surrounds sacred volcano with human rights

""Three deities from Samoa, Tuvuvata, Sisi, and Faingaa, conspired to steal Tofua. So they came and tore up the high mountain by its very roots and its place was taken by a large lake. This enraged the Tongan gods very much and one of them, Tafakula, essayed to stop the thieves. He stood on the island of Luahako and bent over so as to show his anus. It shone so brilliantly that the Samoan deities were struck with fear, thinking that the sun was rising and that their dastardly works was about to be revealed. Hence, they dropped the mountain close to Tofua and fled to Samoa. The mountain became the island of Kao.""

It is unclear from the account why Tafakula's anus shone like the sun.

A new species of dinosaur named Duonychus tsogtbaatari has been discovered by scientists, and unlike other therizinosaurs, this species has only two clawed fingers instead of three.

A new species of dinosaur with strange claws has been unearthed in Mongolia by paleontologists.

This new genus and species is a therizinosaur, plant-eating, two-legged giants with long claws, and was discovered buried in the Gobi Desert, according to a new study published Tuesday (March 25) in the journal iScience.

Unlike other therizinosaurs, which have three fingers on their hands equipped with long, sharp claws, this new species only has two fingers. This unique anatomy inspired its scientific name, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, which is Greek for ""two digits"" and honors the Mongolian paleontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.

""Many species of therizinosaurs have been discovered, and this group had pretty much been defined by their three-fingered hands sporting large claws,"" study co-author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, told Live Science in an email. ""To find a specimen with only two fingers/claws was surprising as this was so out of the ordinary for this group of dinosaurs.""

Therizinosaurs are a group of dinosaurs that lived across what is now Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (100 million to 66 million years ago). Despite being part of the theropod group of dinosaurs — typically associated with carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex — therizinosaurs were herbivorous. These dinosaurs are known for their enormous, sickle-shaped claws, with some species growing talons as long as 20 inches (50 centimeters).

All other therizinosaurs that have previously been discovered, including Therizinosaurus and Beipiaosaurus, have three clawed fingers on their hands, making the discovery of two-clawed D. tsogtbaatari unusual.

""Therizinosaurs are already some of the most unusual dinosaurs out there, but Duonychus tsogtbaatari takes it to another level,"" study lead author Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, a paleontologist at Hokkaido University in Japan, told Live Science in an email. ""This newly discovered species from Mongolia breaks the mold with just two fingers instead of the typical three, offering a rare glimpse into how theropod hands evolved and adapted."" ""But what truly makes this discovery exciting is the incredibly well-preserved keratinous sheath on its claw — the first such case in a medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaur,"" Kobayashi added.

Duonychus tsogtbaatari fossil claw during excavation.

The new fossil was unearthed during the construction of a water pipeline in the Bayanshiree Formation in Ömnögovi Province, southern Mongolia. The specimen had excellently preserved hands, with a 3D sheath where the claw — made out of keratin, like our fingernails — would have been. Parts of the arms, spine and hips were also preserved.

""The hands, a hallmark of therizinosaurs, are exquisitely preserved with all the finger and wrist bones intact in this specimen,"" Zelenitsky said. ""Even the keratinous sheath of the claw is preserved revealing how big and sharp its claws really were.""

Other species of dinosaur, such as T. rex, had two fingers, but this marks the first time a therizinosaur has been found with fewer than three digits. This species likely evolved to lose one of the three fingers of its ancestors, the study authors suggested.



The researchers think that D. tsogtbaatari may have evolved this unique hand in order to better grip vegetation, allowing for more efficient feeding.

""The loss of the third finger in Duonychus tsogtbaatari might actually have made its remaining two fingers even better at what they were designed for — grasping,"" Kobayashi said. ""Based on the shape of its well-preserved claw and how it curved, Duonychus was likely using its hands to grab onto branches and pull vegetation closer, kind of like how chameleons do today."" ""We think many therizinosaurs may have used their hands for foraging in a 'hook-and-pull' motion, but Duonychus takes this to another level with its extreme claw structure.""

—Australia's 'upside down' dinosaur age had two giant predators, 120 million-year-old fossils reveal

—What if a giant asteroid had not wiped out the dinosaurs?

—Secrets of 1st dinosaurs lie in the Sahara and Amazon rainforest, study suggests

Additionally, Kobayashi suggested that the claws may have played other roles, such as in ""defense, courtship, or even play.""

The researchers are thrilled by this discovery, as it not only reveals unexpected diversity within therizinosaurs, but also marks the fifth time that a theropod dinosaur group has evolved to lose their third finger.

""While more fossils would help confirm this, all signs point to Duonychus representing a true evolutionary shift, not just a fluke,"" Kobayashi said. ""It's a remarkable find that reshapes our understanding of therizinosaurs and theropod evolution as a whole.""

Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.

""Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?"" he said.

Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.

A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.

Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.

Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid ""buy-in program,"" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.

Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The ""Work Without Worry"" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.

Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. ""It's a trap — a poverty trap,"" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.

Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.

Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.

Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. ""That's the trumpet I've been blowing,"" he said with a smile.

The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. ""If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,"" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her ""Condition of the State Address."" ""Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.""

Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.

National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.

In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.

Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.

""You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,"" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. ""I don't think it has to be expensive"" for the state and federal governments, she said.

Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.

Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. ""Awareness of these programs is really limited,"" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.

In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.

The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. ""This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,"" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.

Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, ""Zach of All Trades.""

On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.

After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.

Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.

There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. ""This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,"" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. ""If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.""

A Japanese man who spent nearly 50 years on death row before he was acquitted of murder will be compensated 217 million yen ($1.45m), in what his lawyers say is the country's largest-ever payout in a criminal case.

Iwao Hakamata, 89, was found guilty in 1968 of killing his boss, his boss's wife and their two children, but was acquitted last year after a retrial.

Mr Hakamata's lawyers had sought the highest compensation possible, arguing that the 47 years in detention - which made him the world's longest-serving death row inmate - took a toll on his mental health.

Judge Kunii Koshi, who granted the request on Monday, agreed that he had suffered ""extremely severe"" mental and physical pain.

The Japanese government will pay Mr Hakamata's financial compensation, in what local media is widely reporting as the biggest payout for a criminal case in the country's history.

Mr Hakamata's case is one of Japan's longest and most famous legal sagas.

He was granted a rare retrial and released from prison in 2014, amid suspicions that investigators may have planted evidence that led to his conviction.

Last September, hundreds of people gathered at a court in Shizuoka, a city on Japan's south coast, where a judge handed down the acquittal - to loud cheers of ""banzai"", or ""hurray"" in Japanese.

Mr Hakamata, however, was unfit to attend the hearing. He was exempted from all prior hearings because of his deteriorated mental state.

He had lived under the care of his 91-year-old sister Hideko since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014. Hideko had fought for decades to clear her brother's name.

Mr Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant in 1966 when the bodies of his boss, his boss' wife and their two children were recovered from a fire at their home in Shizuoka, west of Tokyo. All four had been stabbed to death.

Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting fire to their home and stealing 200,000 yen in cash.

Mr Hakamata initially denied doing so, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession, following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.

In 1968 he was sentenced to death.

For years, Mr Hakamata's lawyers had argued that DNA recovered from the victims' clothes did not match his, and alleged that the evidence was planted.

Although he was granted a retrial in 2014, prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin.

The case has raised questions about Japan's justice system, including the time taken for a retrial and the allegations of forced confessions.

Expectations often define success. A team could go 10-2 during the regular season and make the College Football Playoff, and leave fans underwhelmed because it was picked to win a conference or national title. Meanwhile, a team projected to win four games can create a positive buzz around the program with a. 7-6 campaign that includes a bowl win. 

While expectations vary, a team's preseason win total is the most reliable metric for judging whether a team lived up to its standard. After all, sportsbooks aren't rooting for anybody; they're only interested in making money.

While it's only March, and the real games are months away, books have begun posting win totals for the 2025 season. So what better time to play out the entire season than right now? Sure, a lot of these schools don't even know who their starting quarterbacks are, and there will be another flurry of roster movement once the spring portal opens up, but there's no time for patience!

So I played out every game on the schedule in my head for all 18 Big Ten teams, and I know how the season will end. There's no longer any need to wait. We'll just ignore that when I did this exact exercise last year, I went 9-9 on my predictions for each team. This year, I'm setting my own over/under at 8.5. Odds below via FanDuel Sportsbook.

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Western Illinois, at Duke, Western Michigan, USC, at Purdue, Rutgers, Maryland, at Wisconsin, NorthwesternLosses: at Indiana, Ohio State, at Washington

Analysis: There's plenty of buzz around the Illini as a College Football Playoff contender, and it makes sense. A team that won 10 games last year returns nearly every starter, including a third-year starting QB in Luke Altmyer. The schedule is friendly, too. I have Illinois going 9-3, so I clearly think a total of 7.5 is low. Pick: Over 7.5 (-134)

Over/under 8.5 wins

Wins: Old Dominion, Kennesaw State, Indiana State, Illinois, Michigan State, UCLA, Wisconsin, at PurdueLosses: at Iowa, at Oregon, at Maryland, at Penn State

Analysis: The Hoosiers were a major surprise last year, and while they won't collapse in 2025, it's hard to hit it that big in the portal for consecutive seasons. The odds are this team will fall back to Earth a bit, but it says a lot that Indiana fans will be mad at me for thinking their football team will go 8-4. Pick: Under 8.5 (-110)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Albany, UMass, Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan StateLosses: at Iowa State, at Rutgers, at Wisconsin, Penn State, Oregon, at USC, at Nebraska

Analysis: I didn't plan on coming in this low on Iowa, but here we are. It's not just about the quarterback situation. Iowa has been trending in the wrong direction along the lines of scrimmage in recent seasons. When you combine the questions with a schedule that isn't overly friendly, I think this projection is rather reasonable. Pick: Under 7.5 (-170)

Over/under 4.5 wins

Wins: FAU, Northern Illinois, Towson, Washington, Nebraska, IndianaLosses: at Wisconsin, at UCLA, at Rutgers, at Illinois, Michigan, Michigan State

Analysis: I don't believe the Terps were good last year, nor do I think they were as bad as their final record suggested. The schedule is much easier this season, as they won't see Ohio State, Penn State or Oregon. They also have a very soft nonconference slate. This team should get back to a bowl. Pick: Over 4.5 (-115)

Over/under 8.5 wins

Wins: New Mexico, Central Michigan, Wisconsin, Washington, at Michigan State, Purdue, at Northwestern, at MarylandLosses: at Oklahoma, at Nebraska, at USC, Ohio State

Analysis: Last year, I gave Michigan the benefit of the doubt coming off a national title. This year, I'm not. The wins over Ohio State and Alabama to end the season papered over some of the team's significant problems, and all the key players from that title team are gone now. Maybe Bryce Underwood is the Prince Who Was Promised right away, but I expect some growing pains. Pick: Under 8.5 (+148)

Over/under 5.5 wins

Wins: Western Michigan, Boston College, Youngstown State, UCLA, MarylandLosses: at USC, at Nebraska, at Indiana, Michigan, at Minnesota, Penn State, at Iowa

Analysis: A lot depends on the development of Aidan Chiles. If he taps into his potential in his second season as a starter, the Spartans could be 2025's version of Indiana. If he doesn't, it could be another rough season. Either way, there are too many tough road games on the schedule for me to assume Sparty takes a significant jump. Pick: Under 5.5 (+100)

Over/under 6.5 wins

Wins: Buffalo, Northwestern State, Rutgers, Purdue, Nebraska, Michigan State, at Northwestern, WisconsinLosses: at Cal, at Ohio State, at Iowa, at Oregon

Analysis: For those who haven't paid attention, Minnesota has failed to win seven or more regular season games only twice in the last six full (non-COVID) seasons. Last year, I made the mistake of going under on their 5.5 projection, but I won't do it again. It's not always fun or exciting to watch, but this program's consistency deserves respect. There's also a nice home schedule. Pick: Over 6.5 (-142)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Cincinnati, Akron, Houston Christian, Michigan, Michigan State, Northwestern, USC, IowaLosses: at Maryland, at Minnesota, at UCLA, at Penn State

Analysis: Nebraska is another team that could take a serious leap forward if Dylan Raiola rounds out his game and improves. He has the potential to be the best QB in the conference, which goes a long way toward winning games. I don't know if he goes that far in 2025, but I do think the Huskers take advantage of a schedule without Ohio State and Oregon on it. Pick: Over 7.5 (-122)

Over/under 3.5 wins

Wins: Western Illinois, UCLA, ULM, PurdueLosses: at Tulane, Oregon, at Penn State, at Nebraska, at USC, Michigan, Minnesota, at Illinois

Analysis: I think Northwestern will finish 2025 with a record a lot closer to its 2024 season than 2023, but even if it doesn't improve, it'll still go over this win total! Starting on the road against Tulane won't be easy, but my gut tells me Preston Stone will bring a consistent competence to the offense that didn't exist last year. I don't know if that's enough to lead to serious improvement, but four wins shouldn't be too difficult to find. Pick: Over 3.5 (-160)

Over/under 10.5 wins

Wins: Grambling, Ohio, at Washington, Minnesota, at Illinois, at Wisconsin, Penn State, at Purdue, UCLA, Rutgers, at MichiganLosses: Texas

Analysis: I'll be honest with you. I expected to go under here. My belief was that Ohio State would be like a lot of champions in the modern game: still very good, but struggling to replace key starters in an era where you can no longer horde depth so easily. Then I did the exercise, and this team won 11 games anyway! The truth is, it'll all come down to whether they can win two of three games against Texas, Penn State, and Michigan. Clearly, I think they can. Pick: Over 10.5 (+128)

Over/under 10.5 wins

Wins: Montana State, Oklahoma State, at Northwestern, Oregon State, Indiana, at Rutgers, Wisconsin, at Iowa, Minnesota, USC, at WashingtonLosses: at Penn State

Analysis: I don't know for sure who will start at quarterback for Oregon, but I'm confident the Ducks will be one of the more talented teams in the league. It also helps to avoid Michigan and Ohio State while getting USC at home. Road games against Penn State and Washington will be the big tests. Pick: Over 10.5 (-110)

Over/under 10.5 wins

Wins: Nevada, FIU, Villanova, Oregon, at UCLA, Northwestern, at Iowa, Indiana, at Michigan State, Nebraska, at RutgersLosses: at Ohio State

Analysis: This is one of those spots where if the Nittany Lions don't go over the total, it'll feel like a disappointment. There's been so much put into retaining players on the roster, as well as poaching Jim Knowles from Ohio State. There's an all-in feel to this team that they need to deliver on. I think they will in the regular season. After that? Who knows? Pick: Over 10.5 (+134)

Over/under 3.5 wins

Wins: Ball State, Southern Illinois, RutgersLosses: USC, at Notre Dame, Illinois, at Minnesota, at Northwestern, at Michigan, Ohio State, at Washington, Indiana

Analysis: After last season and with a new coach in charge, Purdue could finish below this projection at 3-9, and it'd feel like a breath of fresh air to fans. And that's precisely what I think happens! The Boilermakers should start the year 2-0, and then it's about finding home wins. I have them beating Rutgers, but would it truly shock any of us if they took down an Illinois or Indiana? Maybe even Northwestern on the road? Of course not. But if they only do it once, they finish below the total. Pick: Under 3.5 (-200)

Over/under 5.5 wins

Wins: Ohio, Miami OH, Norfolk State, Iowa, MarylandLosses: at Minnesota, at Washington, Oregon, at Purdue, at Illinois, at Ohio State, Penn State

Analysis: Rutgers has finished over its projection each of the last two seasons, going 6-6 in the regular season in 2023 and 7-5 last year. They have experience returning, including at QB in Athan Kaliakmanis -- who played well last year. All of this makes you think they should go over, but that's not how it worked out here! It's one of those odd years when you would rather have Oregon and Penn State on the road because you probably aren't winning those games anyway. Meanwhile, a lot of your coin-flip games are on the road. Oh, and there's never a good time to have Oregon, Ohio State, and Penn State on your schedule! Toss in an Illinois team coming off a 10-win season, and somebody at the Big Ten's Scheduling Department clearly has it out for the Knights! Pick: Under 5.5 (-110)

Over/under 4.5 wins

Wins: at UNLV, New Mexico, Maryland, Nebraska, WashingtonLosses: Utah, at Northwestern, Penn State, at Michigan State, at Indiana, at Ohio State, at USC

Analysis: The Bruins got off to a slow start last year, but by the time the regular season ended, they felt like a team moving in the right direction. Momentum doesn't always carry over to the offseason, but five wins doesn't seem like a ridiculous request with this schedule. Taking care of business at home will determine how good the Bruins' season is. Pick: Over 4.5 (-192)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Missouri State, Georgia Southern, at Purdue, Michigan State, Michigan, Northwestern, Iowa, UCLALosses: at Illinois, at Notre Dame, at Nebraska, at Oregon

Analysis: USC has finished the regular season with eight wins or more just twice in the last six full seasons. The Trojans have only done it once in Lincoln Riley's three seasons in charge, and that was in his first year. This is a simple fact I'm sharing. There's no need to get mad at me about it. I'm taking the over here, but I don't feel good about it at all. Pick: Over 7.5 (-118)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Colorado State, UC Davis, at Washington State, Rutgers, Illinois, PurdueLosses: Ohio State, at Maryland, at Michigan, at Wisconsin, at UCLA, Oregon

Analysis: The hope is that Demond Williams can take the Huskies to another level after finishing 6-6 in their first Big Ten regular season, but a projection of 7.5 wins feels overly optimistic to me. The Huskies play both Ohio State and Oregon -- albeit at home -- and a road trip to Michigan won't be fun, either. Plus, we saw last year that the cross-country trips weren't easy on anybody. Travel struggles included a Huskies' loss at Rutgers, so I'm not willing to assume this team beats Maryland on the road, either. Pick: Under 7.5 (-138)

Over/under 5.5 wins

Wins: Miami OH, Middle Tennessee, Maryland, Iowa, WashingtonLosses: at Alabama, at Michigan, Ohio State, at Oregon, at Indiana, Illinois, at Minnesota

Analysis: It's a make-or-break season for Luke Fickell. The embattled Badgers coach has gone 12-13 in two seasons at Wisconsin, and saw the schools' 22-year bowl streak end last year. There have been major changes since, but I don't know how impactful they'll be. Also, the schedule is assault and battery. The Badgers will be on the road for games against Alabama, Michigan and Oregon. But, hey, at least they get Ohio State at home, right!? All in all, of the nine Big Ten opponents on the schedule, eight made a bowl last season. Pick: Under 5.5 (-144)

Anthony Davis returned to the floor for the Dallas Mavericks on Monday, scoring 12 points in a 120-101 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. 

Though limited to a 28-minute ceiling, Davis mostly looked like himself against the Nets, his first action since his Feb. 8 Dallas debut. He opened the game with a clean cut and dunk, moved well defensively, and generally inspired some optimism for a team that has been devoid of any essentially since his acquisition.

These are, of course, the post-Luka Dončić Mavericks we're talking about, so there's no such thing as pure optimism. While the victory over Brooklyn and the return of a mostly healthy Davis helped Dallas (35-37) move back into the No. 10 slot in the Western Conference Play-In picture, it's worth wondering whether or not that's even a worthwhile goal for a floundering Mavericks team. They are, after all, still missing key contributors Daniel Gafford, Dereck Lively II, Caleb Martin, Dante Exum, Olivier-Maxence Prosper, and, of course, Kyrie Irving, who will miss the remainder of the season and at least a good chunk of next season with a torn ACL.

Just reaching the postseason will be an uphill battle. Their competition in Phoenix has won four of its past five games and is far healthier. The Suns, also 35-37, control the tiebreaker and therefore reclaimed that No. 10 slot by beating the Milwaukee Bucks later Monday. Getting that No. 10 seed means two road games -- one likely in Sacramento, the other in either Minnesota or Los Angeles against the Clippers -- just to get to the postseason. Waiting for them there would be an NBA-best Oklahoma City Thunder team eager to avenge last season's second-round defeat to Dallas. The odds of any sort of substantial playoff run here are, obviously, slim.

Davis isn't focusing on those odds. He sees a chance to reach the postseason, so he's playing for it. 

""I seen we were a man down forever, sometimes playing seven guys, six, eight, and if I felt like I was 100% to go play I was going to do that and I stressed that to my team and I stressed that to the organization as well tonight. So we felt I was able to play and that's what I wanted to do,"" Davis said after the win. ""I'm not the one throw in the towel and sit down.""

It's an admirable sentiment, especially coming from a player who has dealt with injuries as frequently as Davis has. He feels he has a job to do, and there is unspoken pressure that comes along with that. Jokes about his durability aside, he's not only trying to lead his team into the playoffs, but prove something to a fanbase that is in open rebellion at the moment. Davis isn't Dončić. Some fans will never forgive him for that. But those who stick around will at least see a new star doing everything in his power to help their team compete. It's a good way to win points in a new city.

It probably isn't the best way to approach the rest of the season if the Mavericks have any sort of long-term championship ambitions, though. 

Obviously, there is a real benefit in missing the postseason from a draft perspective. Dallas knows well the importance of every last slot. In 2023, it tanked viciously to land Lively. Had the Mavericks finished one slot lower, that pick would have gone to the Knicks. Dallas isn't at risk of losing this year's pick, but the Mavericks need to maximize it wherever it lands because all of their first-round picks between 2027 and 2030 are gone from previous trades. A few slots could make a world of difference, especially with the flatter lottery odds structure that the league instituted in 2019.

A few draft slots are important, but Davis is more so. We're talking about a player who aggravated a pre-existing injury in his very first game as a Maverick. The ""street clothes"" moniker isn't fully fair, but it comes from a real place. Davis is a walking injury risk. The stakes this season aren't especially high because the Mavericks are already doomed in the bigger picture. What if Davis, like Irving, suffers an injury that goes into next season while pushing for a Play-In spot the Mavericks probably shouldn't even want? What if the adductor strain that kept him out for a good chunk of this season lingers into next year?

That would be a worthwhile risk if Irving were healthy and Dallas had a chance to compete for much this season. Given the state of the rest of the team, though, there just isn't much to be gained by putting Davis back on the floor. 

It's a commendable effort on Davis' part, especially in a league in which tanking is rampant. It just creates quite a bit of risk with a pretty minimal reward for the Mavericks.

Well, we've hit the George Costanza portion of the coaching carousel. 

By that I mean:

Sean Miller has left Xavier to be the coach at Texas. It's a move that shocked — and angered — people at Xavier (understandably so). Miller was there for three seasons, took the Musketeers to two NCAA Tournaments and decided to bolt for Austin, Texas, and the promise of a bigger program in a bigger league with bigger money. 

Now Xavier is left to scramble and hire a coach just as the portal opens. Will the school look to bring in another former coach, Charleston's Chris Mack, or will athletic director Greg Christopher be so bothered by the circumstances of Miller's sneaky exit that he looks to hire outside the Xavier family for the first time in generations? One to watch, and one that could fill quickly. 

What's more, Josh Pastner agreed Monday night to be the next coach at UNLV, sources confirmed. Pastner coveted the job from the moment it opened and was able to break through a long list of candidates interviewed there. He'll have a five-year deal and the press conference will be Wednesday. Pastner's career record is 276-187. He spent the past two seasons working in television, but I spoke to Pastner as recently as February and he told me then he was eager and wanting to get back into coaching this cycle. UNLV was for sure the best job opportunity available to him. 

It's entirely possible we'll have even more job-swap action before the Sweet 16 gets going again Thursday night, so that in mind, here are the other recent hirings ... which also prompted job openings. 

» Ben McCollum leaves Drake after one year to run Iowa» Niko Medved goes home to guide Minnesota» VCU's Ryan Odom is now at Virginia» Will Wade is on the ground at NC State

I've got more in the capsules below, including other hirings that are now a week-plus old.

We're at 38 coaching flips as of Tuesday. Hitting 40-plus in the next 48 hours feels ... unavoidable.

Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts' status for Opening Day remains uncertain as he continues to deal with the illness that caused him to miss the Tokyo Series against the Chicago Cubs. 

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, however, struck a more optimistic tone with respect to Betts' status as he told reporters that Betts was able to keep solid food down and go through a workout on Monday. Per Roberts, Betts is slated to play in Tuesday's exhibition against the Los Angeles Angels. If he fares well enough, then he should be able to play on Thursday for the traditional Opening Day contest against the Detroit Tigers. 

Betts, a late scratch from Sunday's exhibition game against the Angels, told reporters, including ""Dodgers Talk,"" that he's switched medications recently, and that he feels better except for persisting stomach issues. Indeed, Betts said earlier on Monday that he'd been unable to keep down solid food and has instead subsisted off smoothies. Predictably, he's lost serious weight in the process: he's now checking in at 150 pounds after entering spring training weighing around 175 pounds.

""I don't think anybody really knows ... My body's just kind of eating itself, and so it's hard to not fuel it,"" Betts said. ""Every time, literally, every time I fuel my body, I throw it up and I don't know what to do about it.""

Betts, 32, was expected to enter the season serving as the Dodgers' starting shortstop. If he's unable to go -- either on Opening Day or for the onset of the season -- the Dodgers would ostensibly slot in veteran Miguel Rojas at the six, as they did in Tokyo. In five seasons with the Dodgers, Betts has hit .284/.372/.530 (145 OPS+) with 132 home runs and 62 stolen bases. His contributions have been worth 27.8 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. 

The Dodgers will resume their regular-season schedule on Thursday, when they host reigning American League Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal and the Tigers. The Dodgers won both games of the Tokyo Series, staking them out to an early 2-0 record.

Sacramento State is hiring former Sacramento Kings star Mike Bibby as its next coach, ESPN reporteds. Bibby, 46, played for the Sacramento Kings from 2001-08 during the franchise's heyday and most recently served as a TV analyst for NBC Sports California.

Bibby has zero coaching experience at the collegiate level. He coached at Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix, Arizona from 2014-19 and briefly coached at Hillcrest Prep High School in 2019.

Former Sac State coach David Patrick resigned in May 2024 to take a job as an assistant at LSU. The program tabbed Michael Czepil as the interim coach for the 2024-25 season. He wasn't retained after the Hornets finished 7-25 (3-15 Big Sky) and lost 83-70 in the first round of the Big Sky Tournament to Weber State.

Bibby led Arizona to the national title in 1997 before he was drafted by the Vancouver Grizzlies with the No. 2 pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Bibby played in the NBA from 1998-2012 and was an First-Team All-Rookie selection in 1999.

Bibby's hire comes less than two months after Sac State hired Brennan Marion -- a rising Group-of-Five offensive coordinator at UNLV -- as its next coach.

In crunch time on Feb. 28, the Boston Celtics' Jaylen Brown was threatening to end the Cleveland Cavaliers' eight-game winning streak. The reigning Finals MVP had scored back-to-back buckets against the smaller Darius Garland, so he set a ball screen on the Cavs All-Star, hoping Cleveland would cede the switch. Instead, Brown's man, Dean Wade, ceded nothing. Wade cut off the ballhandler, Derrick White, then recovered back to Brown, forced him left and contested his shot. The Cavs got the stop, then extended their two-point lead and their streak.

Wade finished with only five points in 19 minutes. Unlike when he scored 20 fourth-quarter points including the game-winner against the Celtics last season, he was not the hero. There was no courtside celebration with the Kelce brothers after the buzzer, no ESPN podcast appearance days later. That offensive explosion, though, was an anomaly -- it was the third time in his career that he'd scored 20-plus in a game, and he's only topped 15 once since then. The way Wade shut the door against Boston this time was much more emblematic of his role.

""I call him White Blanket,"" Cleveland center Tristan Thompson said. ""White Blanket, you can't score on him.""

Thompson remembers when White Blanket had to shuffle back and forth between the Cavs and the G League's Canton Charge. ""Man, they had him working like a motherf---er,"" Thompson said. ""We was working him to the bone especially because we weren't good then. But he grinded. He's the prototypical work-your-ass-off-to-get-where-you're-at [player]."" Six years into his NBA career, Wade is a ""key contributor to our team,"" someone who can not just hold his ground against players like Brown, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Cade Cunningham. ""He be givin' em problems.""

The odds of anyone in Wade's position in 2019 -- an undrafted rookie on a two-way contract -- lasting in the NBA are slim. The odds of staying with the franchise that scooped you up are miniscule. Since 2017, when the league introduced the two-way contract, 829 such deals have been signed. Wade is one of six players to have signed a two-way as a rookie and remained on the roster for six years. (The others? Duncan Robinson, Lu Dort, Naz Reid, Amir Coffey and John Konchar.)

""When I was a two-way, I didn't even think about the future,"" Wade said. ""You couldn't. There was just so much going on. So the only thing I really focused on was that day: what I was going to do, workouts that day, and then get home and then see what I could do on Call of Duty.""

Because Thompson left the team in 2020 and returned three years later, Wade and Garland are Cleveland's longest-tenured players. More than once, the Cavs' communications department has had to correct media that has given the designation to Garland alone.

""I tell him he's playing with the house's money,"" Thompson said. ""He should never question anything he does on that court because he earned this.""

His six seasons in Cleveland have been a ""crazy ride,"" Wade said. ""I don't know if they just couldn't get rid of me or what, but I'm still sticking around."" One does not, however, become an integral part of the team that owns the East's best record by accident. ""He makes us better,"" Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""He makes us more versatile."" Before a knee injury in January, the 6-foot-9 Wade started 26 games this season, mostly at the small forward spot, but the coaching staff is equally comfortable using him as a smallball center. He's not a big personality, not a highlight machine and not an awards candidate. He's just the type of player who can swing a playoff series.

""I was really worried when we lost him,"" Atkinson said. ""I'm like, 'Man, this guy's kind of like the link that drives winning.' We've been able to sustain, but I'm just thrilled to have him back.""

Wade was a reliable defender in high school and college, but he wasn't this. ""He's turned into an incredible wing defender,"" Clint Kinnamon, who coached him at St. John High School in the small town of St. John, Kansas, said. ""He always had really good athleticism, but if you told me he was going to be one of the premier wing defenders in the league, I may have been shocked as a high school coach."" After his four years at Kansas State, he and his agents sold teams on his ability to guard 3s, 4s and, once he got stronger, backup 5s. He could move his feet well for his a big man, but didn't anticipate being the guy his coach would call on to guard stars of all sizes at the next level.

""I was not thinking I was going to be a real defensive stopper type of player,"" Wade said. ""I turned myself into that, but I never thought, especially coming out of college, that would be my role.""

Wade joined a Cleveland team that was coming off a 19-63 season, its first after LeBron James had left for the Los Angeles Lakers. He was on the summer league squad that, under then-coach John Beilein, reportedly endured two-a-days in which both practice sessions lasted more than two hours. ""When I got in the league, man, we were definitely in a weird spot,"" Wade said. Beilein and the Cavs parted ways during the All-Star break, 54 games into a five-year contract. This was shortly after they had traded for center Andre Drummond, whom they played in jumbo lineups next to Thompson that season and JaVale McGee the next. Wade and Larry Nance Jr. found themselves playing the 3 next to two non-shooting centers.

""It was crazy,"" Wade said. ""We had some messed-up lineups out there.""

Sometimes, for a developing player, a terrible team can be a terrific environment. ""The front office has been amazing the whole time, through a rough start,"" Wade said. ""I didn't know where it was heading the first couple years, but they promised, man: 'Stay the course, stay the course and buy in and good things are going to happen.'"" As a rookie, the Charge put Wade ""in a lot of different situations, and he was always successful,"" Nate Reinking, then their coach and now an assistant with the Cavs, said. He played a lot of center in switch-everything lineups, which meant he spent a lot of time defending small guards.

Early on, Wade paid attention to how Thompson, Nance and Kevin Love went about their routines. In Year 2, ""I put my head down and was in the weight room a lot,"" he said. He needed to be able to take bumps if he was going to be a high-level defender, and he was determined to become a high-level defender because that would get him on the court.

""I think a lot of defense, especially with the athletes and the players we have in this league, it's a mental drive thing,"" Wade said. ""If they wanted to, they could.""

Wade took a jump, and, after logging just 71 NBA minutes in his first season, logged 1,212 in his second. As he got stronger and earned the trust of his coaches, he started to see himself differently. He wanted the opportunity to guard the best players in the world. 

""I took pride in that,"" Wade said. ""I still take pride in that to this day.""

Garland said that Wade ""always has that chip on his shoulder from being undrafted and just not being a guy that people are looking at."" He is never brash publicly, but you can see the chip whenever he's matched up with a big name, wholly locked in to his assignment.

Wade played for Kinnamon for nine years, starting as a third grader. Initially, Wade was ""so shy,"" Kinnamon said, that he'd sometimes tell his mother, Trish, that he didn't want to go to the gym. Trish, who has coached volleyball, track and basketball at St. John, would ""guide him over,"" Kinnamon said, and, once he got there, it was hard to get him to leave.

From when he was young, Wade ""wanted to soak up any information that you had,"" Kinnamon said. He was ""always coachable,"" and he wanted to please his coaches. He could be too shy on the court, though, so Kinnamon had to encourage him to shoot the ball and take it to the rim. 

""He did not ever want to appear to be selfish,"" Kinnamon said. 

That was still true when Wade was in the G League. Reinking told him that he didn't have to force things or do anything spectacular, but couldn't turn down shots. 

""It was more about just building his mindset to let it fly,"" Reinking said. ""He had so much skill, but he's such a team guy.""

Wade, who has made 37% of his 3s in the NBA, said has been hearing that he has to shoot more ""pretty much my whole career,"" but less so these days: ""I'm taking the right shots now."" In high school he ""was trying to get my teammates involved, be a good teammate,"" and after that he passed up shots ""because I thought we could get better ones."" His Cavs coaches, including Atkinson, have consistently delivered the same message, he said: ""Dude, if you don't take the shots when you're open, that's the best shot we're going to get as a team, so be a team player and take those shots. We believe in you.""

Brad Korn, who joined Bruce Weber's staff at Kansas State before Wade's sophomore season, said he and Wade related to each other right away. ""Us small-town kids, I think sometimes maybe we don't dream big enough, almost,"" Korn said. ""Like we're OK with being good, but we don't know that it's OK to dream bigger."" A native of Plano, Illinois, Korn wanted Wade to understand his potential: He had a real opportunity to make the NBA, to never have a real job.

Korn worked with Wade individually for three years, but downplayed his role. ""It wasn't like I was some guru,"" he said. ""He had all the talent and ability. I just don't think he quite knew exactly how to apply it, or that it's OK that he can apply it."" In his office, which overlooked the practice court, Korn put up a sign that read ""DBAP."" It was an inside joke about a phrase that Weber would use with Wade -- ""Dean, be a player"" -- but it was also a coaching tool. When Wade made a mistake in practice, Korn would simply point to the sign.

Wade is ""a natural,"" Korn said. Yes, coaches have gone at him about being more aggressive -- though Korn himself only ever did it once, when Kansas State was trailing at halftime against its rival Kansas Jayhawks in Wade's senior year, a game it would go on to win -- but Wade's instinct to make the right plays is not a bad one, especially now that he's on a team stacked with scorers. ""I didn't have to learn how to play off the ball [in the NBA],"" Wade said, and that's one of the reasons he's found a home in Cleveland.

""We can't have it both ways,"" Korn said. He added, ""If Dean went out there and tried to score every possession or every time he touched the ball, I mean, honestly, he'd probably be in Germany.""

On and off the court, Wade is low maintenance. He's ""just a regular Joe that you can run into on the street and have a conversation with,"" Kinnamon said. Every summer, he returns to St. John, where his parents still live, and to Manhattan, Kansas, where he has a house.

Not only is he ""a perfect fit for this team,"" as Reinking put it, Cleveland is ""the perfect city for me and my family,"" Wade said. ""A quieter city, a hard-working, blue-collar kind of city. The people really embrace the team. Even when we were bad, man, they were packing that place out."" He would like to stay as long as he can.

If not for a last-minute phone call, though, Wade never would have even worked out for the Cavs. Two days before the 2019 NBA Draft, Wade was at Detroit Metro Airport, having completed what he thought was his final pre-draft workout, when his agent called and told him not to get on his flight home. Wade would instead go to Cleveland, but that flight that got canceled, so he stayed at the Westin in the airport. His bags were already checked, so he used the ""little toothbrush and toothpaste"" that was provided for him, slept a bit and took off the next morning.

""They picked me up from the airport [in Cleveland] at 7 a.m, my workout was at 8,"" Wade said. ""I went straight to the gym on like four hours' sleep, same clothes as I had the night before.""

Wade had a killer workout, then flew home to Kansas, where his family threw him a draft party he didn't ask for. ""My mom didn't tell me,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I don't want to have a draft party, I don't want to have a bunch of people here.' She invited my whole family and friends."" Wade watched some of the first round, but then ""kind of went and chilled, ate -- mom and grandma cooked everything."" Before the draft was over, the Cavs offered him a two-way. The Minnesota Timberwolves did, too, but Cleveland seemed like a cleaner path to playing time. He told everyone the news, ""and it was a blast from then on,"" he said.

That night, Wade ""knew I probably was gonna go undrafted,"" he said. He'd had a stress reaction in his left foot as a junior, and he'd broken his right foot as a senior. ""I didn't know who was gonna take a chance on, you know, a big that had foot problems in college.""

Was Wade lucky to have landed in the right spot? It seems so, as it has certainly worked out for him. But the Cavs were lucky to sign him six years ago, too. ""I don't know if I'm right, but if he doesn't get hurt his junior year, he might've been a lottery pick, honestly,"" Korn said. Kansas State got to the Elite Eight that season despite the fact that Wade barely played in the NCAA Tournament. What if he had starred on the national stage and led the team to the Final Four?

In the fourth quarter of the Cavs' win against the Milwaukee Bucks on March 9, Wade made two corner 3s and guarded Giannis Antetokounmpo on the other end. It was their 14th victory in a row (the streak snapped 16 last week), and Atkinson told reporters that having the flexibility to put Wade on the former MVP was ""very important,"" as it allowed them to have another big man roam behind him. Wade is the rare role player who can contain the ball on the perimeter, protect the rim, make open 3s and maintain advantages on offense. Everything about Cleveland suits him, but the appeal of that skill set is that it would work anywhere.

""Dean's that guy,"" Korn, who now coaches Southern Missouri State University (SEMO), said. ""He could go play for the Cavs, he could go play for the Knicks, he could go play for the Lakers, he could play for K-State, he could play for Kansas, he could play for SEMO. He's a plug-and-play guy.""

With only a month remaining before the 2024 NFL Draft, the widespread expectation is that University of Miami quarterback Cam Ward will be the No. 1 overall pick. The main question seems to be whether the Tennessee Titans will stick at No. 1 overall or decide to trade the pick.

On Monday, Ward hoped to put that discussion to rest. Miami held its Pro Day on Monday afternoon, and of course, Ward's throwing session was the main event. And after a throw to tight end Elijah Arroyo while rolling out to his left, Ward let the Titans know about his plans.

“I said I'm solidifying it today. I made sure they heard it.”Cam Ward tells us on @nflnetwork his message to Titans prez Chad Brinker and GM Mike Borgonzi in middle of pro day after dime throw: pic.twitter.com/kPXCHM5OuI

While there was another highlight throw later on in the workout, this somewhat more under-control frozen rope to Arroyo was the throw after which Ward let Tennessee brass hear what he had to say.

All 32 teams showed up at Miami's Pro Day to see Ward and Co. get in their workout, but the Titans were obviously the headliners. They had their general manager, head coach, offensive coordinator and more in the building to watch Ward throw live for the first time.

""They finally got to see me throw in person. That should be all they need to see,"" Ward said. ""At the end of the day, if they want to give me the pick or not, I'm going to be happy with whatever team I go to. I just want to play football.""

If he is indeed the top selection in the draft, Ward will be the first Hurricane picked first overall since Russell Maryland back in 1991, and the first Miami quarterback picked No. 1 since Vinny Testaverde in 1987.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is one of the NBA's most durable players. He has missed only six games this season and has never missed more than eight in a single season. However, freak accidents can happen in the NBA, and unfortunately, Tatum was hit with one in the third quarter of Boston's 113-95 win over the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

Tatum had the ball behind the arc and was defended by Kings big man Domantas Sabonis. Seeing the mismatch, Tatum went up for a 3-pointer. Sabonis attempted to contest him, but stuck his foot into Tatum's landing zone. Tatum landed on that foot and immediately crumpled to the floor in pain. 

I hope Jayson Tatum is OK pic.twitter.com/WrdK6qxn8N

Tatum went to the locker room from there and did not return with what the Celtics called a left ankle sprain. After the game, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said Tatum seemed ""to be doing OK"" and was icing the ankle. Tatum was not made available to reporters but was not wearing a boot on the affected foot. 

The foul on Sabonis was a flagrant-1 based on a rule that came about as the result of a similar play. In the 2017 Western Conference finals, Kawhi Leonard got hurt when Zaza Pachulia closed out into his landing zone, so when a defender steps under an airborne shooter, it is now considered a flagrant. Tatum remained in the game for his free throws but exited from there.

Fortunately for both Tatum and the Celtics, Boston has little left to play for in the regular season. Tatum has already reached 65 games, so he is eligible for an All-NBA selection. Boston, meanwhile, trails Cleveland by five games for the No. 1 seed and leads New York by seven in the loss column for the No. 3 seed. With 10 games to go before the postseason, the Celtics are basically assured the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, so they can afford to be cautious with Tatum as they assess this injury.

Still, Boston needs Tatum at full strength for the postseason, and ankle sprains can be tricky. A lower ankle sprain can be managed over the course of a few weeks. A high-ankle sprain takes longer, and then there is the severity of the sprain to consider. 

For now, all Boston can do is hope that Tatum's sprain won't linger into the playoffs.

Monday night was supposed to be a chance for the home crowd to celebrate the (1) USC Trojans, as they were heavily favored against (9) Mississippi State. However, four minutes into the game, disaster struck when JuJu Watkins fell to the floor in agony after being fouled in transition, and the mood shifted dramatically inside the Galen Center. 

Watkins was carried off of the floor with what was later reported to be a torn ACL, and while it seemed to just be an unfortunate injury, the emotions of seeing their star player injured had the USC crowd and bench upset, and Mississippi State became the outlet for them. The crowd booed loudly every time Mississippi State had the ball and the injury seemed to galvanize the Trojans as they jumped out to a 28-8 lead after the first quarter, with Kiki Iriafen stepping into the starring role. 

The game remained physical and tense throughout despite it being a blowout. USC's Malia Samuels hit the floor hard after a foul at the rim, leading coach Lindsay Gottlieb to glare over at the Bulldog bench after going out to check on her. At the end of USC's 96-59 win, the two teams met in the customary handshake line and some players had to be separated after exchanging words. 

Words are exchanged between USC and Mississippi State during handshake line following USC's win which saw JuJu Watkins injured pic.twitter.com/52otJrJk8c

It was pretty clear USC felt Mississippi State's physicality crossed a line, while the Bulldogs would defend it as hard-nosed basketball. It's hard to blame the Trojans for being upset given they saw their best player suffer a season-ending injury, and because it happened on a foul, Mississippi State became the target of their anger and frustration. 

""We don't play to hurt, we play to compete and that's just an unfortunate situation. There was no harm, and I hope us as a society, I know social media can be ugly, that you understand that the other lady that was involved that's on my team is a woman of class,"" Mississippi State coach Sam Purcell said after the game. ""She's comes from a family too of loving parents, I'm sure she is remorseful and obviously didn't want to have that happen. I hope that we understand as a society that it was a thoughtful apology and don't take it further than it needs to. On behalf of the Bulldogs, again, we're praying for her recovery because she's the ultimate competitor and we want to see her back on that court.""

Filed under:

The Titans said they'd take a ‘generational talent' at No. 1. They lied.

With just under a month until the 2025 NFL Draft we now have a pretty good idea of who the Titans are going to take with the No. 1 overall pick. All signs are pointing to Miami QB Cam Ward having his name called first, with the Titans spending ample time with Ward at his pro day on Monday, paired with the obligatory dinner with the prospect — all things that happen when a team is zeroing in on a player.

As a result Ward is now the runaway favorite to be the No. 1 pick, being given -750 odds on Fanduel, with Abdul Carter being the next-closest pick at +500. 

Selecting Ward is the obvious pick. The clear selection. It's also absolutely the wrong move, and the Titans are going to screw this up. What will ensue is a spin campaign to talk up Ward, and the Titans desperately try to move away from their now-infamous comment that the team would not pass on a “generational talent” with the No. 1 pick. Actually they'll pass on two in Abdul Carter and Travis Hunter, instead reaching for arguably the worst quarterback prospect taken with a No. 1 overall pick — maybe ever.

None of this is to say that Ward will be a bad NFL quarterback. In fact, there's every chance he could be quite good. The problem is that you don't draft “quite good” with the No. 1 pick. You have to find a transformative talent that can turn a franchise around, and Cam Ward simply isn't it — but this is patently on brand for a Titans team adept at whiffing on skill position players with their early picks. 


    Related
  

Despite having four general managers in the last two decades, the Titans can only boast early round success with three skill position players since 2005: RB Chris Johnson in 2008, RB Derrick Henry in 2016, and WR A.J. Brown in 2019. The rest is a veritable who's-who of mediocrity.

Bad teams aren't created simply by making bad draft picks, but also consistently finding mediocrity. While the Titans have been quite good at drafting linemen and linebackers to bolster their system, something has been consistently rotten with this team's skill position scouting, which leads the organization to taking big bets on players that have no business being taken as high as they do.

The biggest issue with the Marcus Mariota pick a decade ago was that Mariota was a scheme-dependent quarterback who had the physical tools, but we really had no idea if he had the ability to translate into the NFL after playing in an QB-friendly Oregon offense. That never materialized, so he struggled.

This is exactly the issue with Cam Ward as well. A player who was functionally fine, but spent his entire college career running an Air Raid in Washington State and Miami. It's an offensive system that routinely puts up big college numbers and lets a QB show off — but players routinely fail who come out of Air Raids into the pros. Now one is going to go with the No. 1 overall pick.

This quote from Ward is also setting off some major alarm bells. 

“I just think the playbooks match up not only for there, but Cleveland and New York. A lot of those three teams did the same things that we did in Miami. So I think it'll be plug and play.”

While it's clear Ward himself is trying to talk about his play in a way that he can solidify his draft spot, I also really, really hope he doesn't believe this to be true. There are no similarities between the West Coast offenses those three NFL teams run, and the Air Raid he led in Miami. It won't be “plug and play,” but take a significant amount of work to learn an NFL system. If a young QB is downplaying how difficult it's going to be, well, that concerns me.

There's also simply a raw talent issue here too. Ward would be the worst quarterback prospect taken in the Top 3 based on the NFL's scouting reports since the league posted its own talent grades in 2011.

Granted this is just one talent evaluator's rubric — but it's simply astonishing to see what an outlier Ward is among his peers who were taken with top picks in the last 15 years. There's certainly nothing to indicate that he's a “generational talent,” like the Titans assured everyone they were going to be taking with the No. 1 overall pick.

This is where this all gets tricky. Obviously quarterback is the single most-impactful upgrade the Titans can make. Hell, last year they benched Will Levis and played Mason Rudolph for god's sake. The issue is that while Ward might make Tennessee a better team immediately, they're once again losing sight of the forest for the trees. A truly generational talent, someone like Abdul Carter or Travis Hunter might not lead to more wins immediately — but they're without a doubt the best possible players. Guys who can help build a foundation for success. From there the team can look to strike in a much better QB draft as we'll see in 2026, when Arch Manning, Garrett Nussmeier, and Drew Allar will enter the NFL.

Instead the Titans are going to make the same mistake as they did a decade ago in taking Marcus Mariota. Waiting for his to blossom, then realizing it wasn't going to happen. It wasn't just that Mariota wasn't good, but it led to the Titans trying to put talent around him in 2017, hoping he could still be great. In that draft Tennessee took WR Corey Davis with the No. 5 overall pick. The next QB off the board that could have been theirs? Patrick Mahomes.

This is going to be a mess, no matter how the Titans try to spin this pick.

Let's grade the biggest men's college basketball coaching hires so far.

Only college sports has the offseason start while the postseason is still going on. Men's college basketball is feeling that in a big way right now, with tons of coaching hires and transfer portal additions happening at the same time as the 2025 NCAA tournament trims its field to the Sweet 16.

The coaching carousel is already in full swing with some of the openings already being filled by power conference teams. Will Wade was agreeing to a deal with NC State hours before his McNeese Cowboys team won their first NCAA tournament game in program history. Texas made a surprising coaching moves days after being eliminated from March Madness, while Indiana and Iowa acted quickly to fill their openings.

The coaching hires are just getting started in men's college basketball, and there's bound to be more surprising openings over the next month. Let's grade the hires made during this first wave and set early expectations for the coaches at new programs going forward.

Coaching the Indiana Hoosiers should be one of the best jobs in college basketball on paper. Indiana has tradition, it has deep NIL pockets, and it has a rabid fanbase. Anyone who could return the Hoosiers to glory would be an icon in Bloomington forever, but after 20+ years of disappointment, that's easier said than done.

The home run hire for Indiana was never going to come to fruition. The decision is hire Darian DeVries feels more like trying to hit a double. DeVries can get results: he made the NCAA tournament three times in his last four seasons at Drake in a one-bid league. He should have made the tournament in his first season at West Virginia this year but got screwed by the Selection Committee. The nice thing about hiring DeVries is he already comes with a star player: his son Tucker DeVries will certainly be following his dad to Indiana for his fifth season of college basketball. He's the type of big wing shooter Indiana desperately needed the last couple years.

The minimum for DeVries' tenure should be making the NCAA tournament every year. I think he can do that with the resources he'll have at Indiana. It's hard to predict big success when he's never won an NCAA tournament game, though much of that could be attributed to the randomness of March. Mark Pope had never won a tournament game either when Kentucky hired him, and now he's in the Sweet 16. This feels like an okay hire, if still a little underwhelming. 

Grade: B

It's going to be odd to see someone other than Fran McCaffery on the sidelines for Iowa men's basketball after a 15-year tenure. New hire Ben McCollum parlayed one great season at Drake into a Big Ten job after spending 15 years himself coaching DII Northwest Missouri State. 

Northwest Missouri State was a powerhouse under McCollum with four DII national championships. All Drake did was go 31-4 in his first season and win an NCAA tournament game over Missouri. The big question for the start of McCollum's tenure is if he can convince star point guard Bennett Stirtz to join him in Iowa City. Stirtz was a stud for McCollum at Northwest Missouri State and morphed into the best mid-major player in the country at Drake. He has real NBA draft interest, and could start a major NIL bidding war if he returns to college and tests the market. 

It's risky hiring a DII coach with one year of DI experience for a Big Ten job. If McCollum brings Stirtz with him, Iowa can compete for an NCAA tournament spot next season. Even if he doesn't, the Hawkeyes should be patient with McCollum, because his system gets great results. This feels like a high-risk, high-reward hire, but I love it for Iowa.

When Will Wade was fired from LSU back in 2022, college basketball was a totally different landscape. Wade was canned for his connections to the sport's sweeping FBI investigation, and spent the last two years rebuilding his reputation at McNeese, where he led the program to its first ever NCAA tournament victory this year with a surprising win over Clemson.

Wade's “strong-ass offers” will be totally legal these days. NC State should have plenty of resources to build a contender in a weak ACC coming off a shocking Final Four run in 2023. Wade has proven he can identify talent even at the lower levels, and he gets them to buy into a defense-first system which relies heavily on athleticism and switching principles. I trust him to get talent, and I trust him to coach it up.

The Wolfpack should be a top-5 program in the ACC year-in and year-out if the resources are there. Other programs like Indiana might have been scared of Wade's baggage, but those worries should be buried in the past. Wade gets the job done, providing both a high floor and high ceiling for NC State going forward.

Poor Xavier has now seen Sean Miller leave twice. The last time it happened, Miller was landing five-star recruits and regularly making the second weekend of the tournament at Arizona. He might still be in Tucson if the Wildcats never got entangled in the old FBI investigation. 

Miller should have elite resources at Texas just as he did at Arizona, pending what happens with revenue sharing. That makes this a promising hire. The Longhorns have never had a problem landing McDonald's All-Americans, with a lineage that stretches from Kevin Durant to Tre Johnson. Miller will get them playing defense at a high-level, and he got Xavier to take a lot more threes than usual this season, too.

Texas is always going to be considered a sleeping giant in basketball. Miller might not be a home run hire at this stage of his career, but he's still a good pick with plenty of years in coaching left at 56 years old. 

Grade: B+

Ryan Odom gave Virginia the greatest embarrassment in college basketball history when he led No. 16 seed UMBC over the Cavaliers' No. 1 seed back in 2018. Now Odom is headed to UVA after a successful stop at VCU that saw him dominate the Atlantic-10 this past season.

Virginia is still reeling from Tony Bennett's surprise retirement before the season. There was a reason Bennett hung it up at 55 years old: he didn't think Virginia could maintain its impressive results in the new era of college basketball, where NIL money is king. Can Odom get better resources than Bennett had at the end of his tenure? If not, it's going to be hard to get better results, though the ACC being down does allow for some upward mobility.

Odom just knows how to coach. He got Utah State into the tournament in back-to-back years before making the big dance in two out of his three seasons at VCU. He's been known to recruit international players, and that could be a big help again if Virginia can't win bidding wars for top transfers. Anyone would have a hard time living up to Bennett's legacy without top NIL dollars, but Odom has been successful everywhere he's been, and that makes me think he'll figure it out one way or another.

Grade: A-

Minnesota men's basketball is never going to be an easy job, but it feels like the program made the best possible hire with Niko Medved. The Minneapolis native graduated from the school in 1997 and has been building his resume as one of the sport's best mid-major coaches ever since. 

Medved made the NCAA tournament in three of his last four years at Colorado State, where he produced pros like David Roddy and Nique Clifford. Medved finally got his first NCAA tournament win this year, and he should have had another one if not for Derik Queen's buzzer-beater for Maryland. 

Medved's offensive sets were beautiful to watch at their best at Colorado State. He has a tough jump in front of him trying to compete in the Big Ten, but if anyone can do it at Minnesota, it feels like it's him. 

Grade: A

Filed under:

What teams fit for the top 10 prospects in this class, schematically?

One thing that goes underrated when it comes to the NFL Draft and draft process is how important schematic fit is. Of course, there are prospects who are more scheme-diverse (the Travis Hunters of the world), but in order to optimize those guys, being in the right scheme and correct system can turn them from a very good player to one of the best in the world.

I think the 2025 draft class is a really good example of guys who can be good in certain schemes or teams. Using the top 10 from my post-NFL Combine big board, we'll break down the best schematic fits for each guy at the top of the class, regardless of draft position.

I know this one might seem like a copout, but the Titans have a great scheme and need for a guy like Carter on their team. Carter wins with speed and violence around the corner, which can be mobilized in Tennessee where there's already a prominent interior pass rusher such as DT Jeffrey Simmons. With Harold Landry III in New England, the EDGE depth is lacking in Tennessee, which frees up an Abdul Carter-sized hole on the outside.

The Packers are in a spot where they could use more production from their cornerback spot, but a sneaky need for them is at wide receiver. They have nobody on the outside who can stay healthy or consistently catch passes. Enter Hunter, who could be the solution at both corner or receiver. I love Hunter as a corner, where his ball skills and instincts just make much more sense so he can make impact plays on defense. CB Jaire Alexander might be on his way out of Green Bay, and the Packers need a CB1. Hunter is the ideal fit there.

In what might be the dream fit of all dream fits, Jeanty to Chicago makes far too much sense. The Bears' RB room has guys who aren't exactly impact players. D'Andre Swift is a boom or bust style of back, and Roschon Johnson is more of a thumper than a home-run hitter. Jeanty can do both, a tackle-breaking machine who can be explosive as a runner and receiver. Behind a revamped offensive line, Jeanty could instantly take off in the NFL.

I think Graham can be scheme-versatile, a wrecking ball who uses leverage and technique to win on the interior despite shorter arms. However, he's at his best in a four-down defense where he can just fire off the ball and win as a penetrating three-technique. The 49ers have been looking for a player like Graham, a guy who can impact the run game and get vertical push as a pass rusher at defensive tackle. 

With new Jets' OC Tanner Engstrand coming from Detroit, I think they could be in the market to find their own Sam LaPorta, a guy who can create matchup problems by being a plus blocker and an impactful receiver as well. Warren is a monster after the catch and has a wide catch radius that'll help him in the toughest areas of the field. Jeremy Ruckert and Stone Smartt are the top two tight ends on the roster right now; not exactly a great start for the position in New York. Warren instantly adds a boost there.

I think Starks has been a victim of some draft fatigue, but he's an incredibly versatile player who went from playing on the roof at Georgia in 2023 to being more of a nickel and playing man coverage in 2024 without missing too many beats. Starks' versatility and ball production just makes too much sense in Baltimore, where he can either play the nickel with Kyle Hamilton as the deep safety, or let Hamilton go back to the nickel and let Starks play deep.

This was the first team-prospect fit I thought about when making this story. Bucs' HC Todd Bowles loves versatility from his defenders in the front seven, and Walker might be one of the most versatile defensive prospects in the entire draft. He's a hammer coming downhill, and I think he can survive on the edge despite not having ideal length at the position. Bowles can move Walker around from the outside to off the ball, very similarly to what the Commanders do with LB Frankie Luvu, and in that some of the pass rush woes the Bucs have had will be helped along with their issues off the ball.

The Panthers were one of the worst teams in the NFL at defending the run last season, especially along the edge. They didn't really address the spot too heavily in free agency, but Stewart makes a lot of sense here. While he's not a perfect prospect, his blend of speed and power along with his strength defending the run would fit nicely in Carolina. Plus, he'll be playing out wide where he can continue to develop as a pass rusher.

Johnson and the Dolphins is a fit that I think makes a whole lot of sense. After CB Jalen Ramsey, the Dolphins cornerback room is in very dire straits. With Johnson's physicality and instincts in quarters and cover 2 types of defenses, he can make a lot of plays on the ball just like he did at Michigan. Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver is a disciple of Mike Macdonald, and with Johnson having success in those kinds of defenses it makes too much sense to link the two.

Finding a great fit for Campbell can be a little tough, because while Campbell can be a good tackle, he might be a phenomenal guard on the interior. A team that could use his versatility at any spot could be the best for him; let him try being a tackle and then kick him inside to guard if it doesn't work out. 

Enter the Houston Texans, who need help almost everywhere along the offensive front. Campbell is a technically sound player with incredible core strength, and profiles as one of the best pass protectors in the class. I think adding a player like Campbell to the Texans can help fill any holes at tackle or guard, but it gives Houston an impact player up front.

Tim Sherwood is understood to have sparked Sky Sports warning email after Man City “picked up the phone”, according to one expert.

An independent commission hearing to examine 115 charges laid by the Premier League against Man City started in September and ended in December 2024.

The Premier League opened an investigation into Man City way back in 2018 and after a number of legal delays, charges were finally laid in February 2023 and the club were referred to an independent commission.

The charges against the Citizens relate to the requirement to accurately report financial information, including around the value of sponsorship deals, the submission of details of manager and player pay information and to a club's responsibility as a Premier League member to adhere to UEFA's financial regulations and to the league's own profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).

They are also accused of failing to co-operate with the league's investigation. In all, there are charges relating to every season between 2009-10 and 2022-23.

It is believed that the outcome will be revealed soon and a report last week claimed that Sky Sports ‘have urged their pundits not to ‘make snap judgements' and to ‘stick to the facts' before commenting on the forthcoming verdict'.

The report added:

‘They have warned that both sides may claim victory regardless of the outcome and have reminded the likes of Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane that any verdict and potential punishment could be subject to an appeal.

‘The email asks recipients to allow themselves ‘sufficient time to digest the outcome' and to direct viewers to Sky Sports News for further information and reaction.

‘Mail Sport understands that the move is aimed at ensuring that the broadcaster is accurate, fair and balanced in its reporting and avoids any controversy in what is an incredibly sensitive matter.'

And now former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson reckons it was all triggered by comments by former Tottenham boss Sherwood recently, which Sky Sports had to apologise for live on air.

Borson told Football Insider: “This is going to be a big challenge for everybody to figure out how to cover the story just because of how difficult the decision might be to digest for the public.

“I think all they're trying to say is let's not effectively say things that are immediately contradicted by the actual decision because we're just going to look quite silly and have to potentially reverse our position on some of this stuff.

“I think this might have been triggered by something that was said recently on Soccer Saturday by Tim Sherwood.

“He made some comments on there, which they literally had to apologise for during the show.

“I suspect that was because City picked up the phone and said ‘There is a limit. There is the opportunity for fair comment in terms of discussing these matters, but there is an obligation to be fair to the club in terms of the way that it's reported'.

“I think that's what's in the background. It is a perfectly reasonable view as to fairness.”

Raducanu on feeling competitive and happy off court

Emma Raducanu has, by her own admission, never been afraid to do things ""a little bit differently"".

So it feels on brand that the British number two has reached the first WTA 1,000 quarter-final of her career without a full-time coach.

Raducanu secured her fourth win in a row at the Miami Open by beating American 17th seed Amanda Anisimova on Monday.

It is the first time the 22-year-old has strung together that many victories in one tournament since the 2021 US Open - when she sealed a fairytale triumph as a teenage qualifier.

""I'd say I'm a bit of a free spirit so I don't need restrictions or being told what to do,"" Raducanu, ranked 60th in the world, said.

""I think when I'm being really authentic, that's when I'm playing my best.""

As she prepares to play US Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wednesday's quarter-final, BBC Sport analyses how Raducanu is thriving without a full-time coach.

Emma Raducanu is set to regain her place in the world's top 50 after the Miami Open

Whether it has been winning a Grand Slam title as an unknown rookie, employing a carousel of coaches, or tailoring her schedule outside of the accepted norm, Raducanu regularly does what she thinks is right for her.

That doesn't always work out for the best, but she continues to stay true to her convictions.

Ending a short-lived partnership with Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of this tournament was another decision which was initially met by surprise.

But her run on the hard courts in Miami - a faster surface which suits her style - suggests the move has paid off.

Raducanu has played with a freedom and confidence only seen sporadically since her stunning US Open success.

""I feel when I am boxed into a regimented way then I am not able to express myself in the same way,"" Raducanu told Sky Sports.

In Florida she has been guided by Mark Petchey - a well-known figure in British tennis circles who worked with her as a teenager.

Petchey, who used to coach Andy Murray in his salad days on the ATP Tour, has been giving pointers on the practice courts and offering coaching advice from Raducanu's box.

Petchey has been working alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue and fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura.

What Raducanu describes as a ""different approach"" has brought an emphasis on having fun at the right times, with shorter, less intense practice and warm-up sessions.

""This week has been a great eye-opener to just when I'm happy and expressive and myself,"" Raducanu said.

""Having people that I've known for a very long time, since before the US Open, is the most valuable thing for this week at least.""

Raducanu's chopping and changing of coaches has been well documented - and the reasons behind their departures have varied.

In 2023, after splitting with a fifth coach in two years, Raducanu believed her ""provoking"" and ""challenging"" questions went some way to explaining the high turnover.

When she came back from wrist and ankle surgeries in 2024, the Briton turned to a trusted figure in childhood coach Nick Cavaday.

He provided stability and a solid sounding board, but the partnership ended in January when he stepped down because of a health issue.

Raducanu's father Ian secured the services of Platenik, but her results in Miami without him have left some wondering if she even needs a full-time coach.

Examples of players competing for long periods of time without a coach are rare. A recent one is Nick Kyrgios, who reached the 2022 Wimbledon final. 

Never one to miss an opportunity to be provocative, the controversial Australian responded to Raducanu's run by calling coaches ""overrated"".

""People awfully quiet that Raducanu is winning now - where all the experts at now?"" Kyrgios posted on X.

Raducanu seems committed to finding a new full-time coach - but the availability of suitable candidates is limited with a third of the season gone.

Mark Petchey has been working with Raducanu in Miami alongside her long-time confidante Jane O'Donoghue

Raducanu's representatives describe Petchey - balancing the role in Miami with his work as a television commentator - as a ""familiar face"" who is providing ""support"".

It is not clear, though, how long the arrangement will go on for.

Former British number one Tim Henman, who has advised Raducanu over the years, believes Petchey's involvement ""makes sense"" given he knows ""Emma's game"".

""It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts for,"" said Henman, who will return to the coaching box himself at this year's Laver Cup as a vice-captain.

""Emma has been fairly vocal that she is comfortable switching coaches - and that's her prerogative. 

""I started playing professional tennis at the end of 1992 and finished in 2007. I had three coaches. 

""I liked the consistency and continuity of working with a coach for a period of time. It was right for me but that doesn't mean it is right for Emma.""

Questions have regularly been raised about Raducanu's resilience, given the amount of injuries and issues she has dealt with since her US Open win.

This season has also been challenging. A back injury disrupted her pre-season before a traumatic stalking experience in Dubai and then Cavaday's exit. 

The gritty manner in which she beat world number 10 Emma Navarro in the Miami second round answered some of the sceptics. 

She also showed steel to swat aside third-round opponent McCartney Kessler and Anisimova, who were both hampered physically.

Raducanu feels she has rediscovered her ""competitive spirit"", conceding: ""I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.""

Whatever she goes on to achieve in Florida, the next challenge is sustaining her level over a longer period - something she has so far been unable to do.

Henman points to Raducanu playing more tournaments - even though she lost six of nine matches before the Miami Open - as a reason behind her improved durability.

Raducanu has competed in seven events this year - more than she ever has in the opening three months of the season.

After Miami she will move back inside the world's top 50 for the first time since August 2022.

""It is easy to look at the results but I would look more at the journey of tournament play - that's a big, big positive,"" said Henman.

""There is no doubt in my mind she's a great player and should be back knocking on the door of the top 30, seeded at Slams and the top 20 if she stays healthy.""

Australia Air Force Pilots Also Heard Chinese Navy Live-Fire Warning on Radio

Reuters

By Kirsty Needham

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), monitoring a Chinese navy warship as it circumnavigated Australia last month, heard it warn it would use live fire in its exercises on a civilian radio broadcast, defence pilots said on Tuesday.

A People's Liberation Army Navy frigate conducted the unprecedented live-fire exercise in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand in February, causing 49 commercial flights to be rerouted.

China has said it gave adequate warning about the drill under international law, but Australian and New Zealand authorities said it fell short of best practice for notifications.

Commercial airlines first heard about the live-fire drill when a Virgin Australia pilot picked up a Chinese navy broadcast on the 121.5 MHz emergency radio channel.

Ahead of a national election due by May, opposition Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton criticised the Labor government for ""a situation where our national maritime surveillance was outsourced to a Virgin airline pilot"".

At the Australian International Airshow in Avalon on Tuesday, RAAF maritime surveillance pilots said Australia's P-8A Poseidon were flying ""high duration, high frequency sorties"" and monitoring the Chinese navy warship's transmissions on UHF and VHF at the time, in details that had not previously been made public.

""The transmissions that came through are just standard warnings of their positions as well as their intent of live-fire exercises,"" said P-8A Poseidon flying officer Patrick Makeham.

He described this as ""similar to saying that we will be conducting live firing exercise in those areas"".

Air Commodore Gus Porter, director-general of RAAF air combat capability, said the P-8A aircraft were used for anti-submarine warfare and to deter aggression.

""You don't need to be on top of a task group 24 hours a day to be tracking exactly what they are doing,"" he added.

The RAAF P-8A aircraft conduct routine surveillance patrols in international waters in the South China Sea, which China has criticised.

Australia last month complained to China over what it was ""unsafe and unprofessional"" actions by a Chinese fighter jet releasing flares within 30 metres (100 feet) of an Australian P-8A aircraft.

Tennis fans have condemned the ""terrible"" and ""disrespectful"" treatment that Alex de Minaur received from the crowd in his stunning win over Brazilian young gun Joao Fonseca at the Miami Open on Monday night. De Minaur dropped the first set before coming back to win 5-7 7-5 6-3 to advance to the Round of 16.

The Aussie World No.11 had to overcome a raucous crowd that was packed with Brazilians cheering on Fonseca, who has become a fan favourite in recent months amid a meteoric rise. Spectators were going wild for Fonseca all throughout the match, but they crossed the line with some of their treatment of de Minaur.

The Aussie had to stop his service motion a number of times because fans were yelling out, with many also cheering when he made an error or served a fault. Chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani asked fans to be more respectful on a number of occasions, and appeared to grow highly frustrated when he was ignored.

A number of boos also rang out around the Hard Rock Stadium when de Minaur sealed the victory on match point. The Aussie showed his class by applauding his 18-year-old opponent as he left the court.

Taking to social media, viewers blasted the ugly scenes and said the crowd had gotten out of control. One person wrote: ""I think the support that Fonseca is getting is really cool in one way, but cheering at a fault is kinda disgusting behaviour. And it's very satisfying to see a player win when the crowd is against them. Shout out Alex de Minaur.""

Another person commented: ""The crowd is being so disrespectful, it's been incredibly hard to watch. The most disruptive ones need to be kicked out because why are they allowed to yell consistently during de Minaur's service games?""

While a third added: ""A few matches ago this was fun but it's just becoming disrespectful. Both great players but you can see the noise getting to De Minaur.""

De Minaur won widespread praise for the way he handled the crowd and Fonseca to progress. ""A lot of it was mental and staying focused in the moment,"" said on court after the match. “There's no other way. You can go out there and complain and get rattled. You can do a lot of different things. But that won't help you win the match.

""Ultimately, that's what I told myself. It's gonna be a battle not only against the player, but against the crowd. Just put your head down, do the work, and try to compete every single point.”

The Aussie is attempting to find some form amid a worrying slump that has seen him slide from World No.6. The 18-year-old Fonseca is a staggering 27-5 in his last 32 matches - including four titles - but the Demon prevailed to face 29th seed Matteo Berrettini.

It was awful. It was an incredible match and the crowd couldn't even cheer for the winner.

Crowd was pathetic for cheering every first serve fault from De Minaur.

— DjDoug4ever (@djdoug4ever) March 25, 2025

Just incredible composure by De Minaur, especially with the questionable egging on of the crowd by Fonseca in the last gameHe'll remember that win (potentially because he won't be able to beat Fonseca that way again)

— Trenton Jocz (@TrentonJocz) March 25, 2025

God, how disrespectful Brazilians are to De Minaur... they don't even shut up when he's about to serve. What a shame.

— Devonne (@Dev0nne10) March 25, 2025

This crowd at De minaur vs Fonseca is terrible

— Homachi (@Oma_with_a_H) March 25, 2025

What do you guys think of the De Minaur vs Fonseca match? Fonseca is playing lights out but goodness, it's the worse crowd I've ever seen in my whole life and Fonseca is hyping them even more. Alex definitely feels it.

Earlier on Monday (local time), 'lucky loser' Adam Walton advanced to the Round of 16 to continue his stunning run at the ATP 1000 event. The stunned Australian beat Hong Kong wildcard Coleman Wong 7-6 (8-6) 4-6 6-4 to set up a duel with American third seed Taylor Fritz in what will be the biggest match of his life.

The 26-year-old Queenslander had been knocked out in the qualifying stages, but hung around hoping to snag a place as a 'lucky loser' should any of the other players drop out. No.21 seed Hubert Hurkacz then withdrew with injury, and because the Pole had a bye in the first round, Walton replaced him and was sent straight into the second round.

He then beat Italian player Luciano Darderi, before knocking off Wong to make the last 16. ""I'm very happy right now, it's just very good fortune this week,"" Walton said. ""I got thrashed in qualifying and got the call three days later to play again, it almost feels like a new start, a new tournament. I'm just happy to be through to the last 16.""

Meanwhile, top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to beat fellow Aussie Jordan Thompson 7-5 6-4. The German World No.2 was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.

Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his haul of seven Masters 1000 titles. ""Jordan made it difficult for me for sure. He's a quality player,"" said Zverev. ""When you're in rhythm, he knows how to break it a little bit. So he did extremely well today. I'm happy with my level from 1-4 onwards.""

Grant Ellis has given out his final rose.

After being torn between his final two, Juliana and Litia, on the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor, the 31-year-old broke up with Litia, 31, and got engaged to Juliana, 28 — but not without a little drama.

“I love you very much. I want to give you everything you deserve, but I'm not your person,” Grant told Litia on proposal day. “I'm sorry that it got to this point. My emotional connection is farther somewhere else.”

“When did it change?” she replied.



“It didn't change. I do love you — I don't want you to feel like I haven't been open or honest,” he said. “I hope you don't look at me differently.”

“Well, I do, for sure,” Litia fired back, noting that Juliana is a “beautiful person” who should have “a lot of questions” about Grant based on how things played out.

As he walked Litia to her car, Grant asked if he'd been misleading. “The switch-up is crazy,” she replied. “I'm disappointed. … I just want to be so clear that I'm confused and I'm sad. And I'm mad.”

During the live portion of the show, Litia claimed that Grant said during their dates that he could “stop the show right now” because he was so sure Litia was his “No. 1 emotional connection.”

When Grant jointed her on stage, she revealed more details — hinting that Grant “said a lot” during overnights and revealing that he gave her a journal to write down her feelings during their time on the show for them to read at the end. He apologized for speaking with such confidence and speaking “too soon.” Litia shot back and said there was “no transparency” from Grant that he was conflicted.

Back in the Dominican Republic, Juliana arrived and told Grant that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.

“Through this whole journey, you've been someone who has inspired me,” Grant said. “I truly believe that you are somebody who is my best friend and I'm so grateful for our journey. … I'll be there for you as your man, as your friend, as your partner. Juliana, will you marry me?”

Juliana said “a million times yes” as she cried tears of joy.

Earlier in the episode, Grant said “I love you” to both women (he first told Litia during last week's episode) after they met his parents. He was subsequently torn over who to pick. “I went to bed last night thinking I knew what I wanted, but I woke up and realized I don't,” he told the cameras. “I feel alone and I have to make a decision. … I don't know.”

As he struggled, Grant's dad came to see him — and told him to go with his heart. “I'm just scared that when I leave here, things will be different,” Grant said, to which his dad reminded him that his fears were normal but not a reason to be scared to make a choice.

Grant's agony over his final pick has been teased all season, with host Jesse Palmer hinting that it got down to the wire. In his Us cover story last month, Grant shed light on what was going through his mind as he struggled with his decision.

“It definitely wasn't [down to] one hour,” he said of the show making it seem like he made his decision at the final moment. “There were external factors that played into me being hesitant. You don't wanna hurt people. You have a lot of weight in terms of being a lead of a different ethnic group. There's a different level of pressure that comes with being a man of color in this role — and a different expectation. It leads to some added thinking that deserves a little extra time. There were some things that really weighed and were hard for me.”

He added, “But ultimately, you go with what makes you happy and you go with what you feel is gonna be the best decision for your future.”

For Grant, he hopes his future includes two kids.

“Preferably a boy and a girl. But if I have two girls or two boys, it doesn't matter,” he said, adding that he's willing to relocate for his partner. “If things play out the way they should, I'll do whatever is gonna make us happy, whether that's me moving or us traveling or us getting another piece of property. I'm willing to go that distance.”

While he's caught some heat on social media for falling in love with both women, Grant is confident he handled things the best way he could.

“I don't live with regret. I'm very happy, and I wouldn't have it any other way,” he said at the time. “If I could rewind time, I would make the same decision.”

The Bachelor finale continues with After the Final Rose on ABC.

Bachelor Grant Ellis was joined by new fiancée Juliana Pasquarosa during the live portion of the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor.

Despite a tense proposal day — which saw Grant, 31, very torn between Juliana, 28, and Litia Garr — the couple confirmed they still going strong.

“You've got to have fun with it because life is just too serious to take seriously,” Juliana said of the backlash and social media speculation about the ending. They later revealed that they are moving to Boston — and accepted a trip to Italy from ABC.

Both Grant and Juliana's parents were in the audience to support the couple. “It's been a blast,” Juliana's dad told host Jesse Palmer. “We're excited to get the two families together, finally.”



Earlier on Monday, Bachelor Nation saw Grant propose to Juliana.

“I truly believe that you are somebody who is my best friend and I'm so grateful for our journey,” he told her, before getting down on one knee. “When you're going through the toughest times in your life, I want you to know you don't have to go through it alone. I'll be there for you as your man, as your friend and as your partner.”

Before the engagement, Grant told both Juliana and Litia, 31, that he loved them — and the two contestants dropped the L-bomb back. On proposal day, Litia was shocked when Grant ended things, accusing him of misleading her. Grant and Litia reunited at the live portion of the Monday episode, where she claimed he said he could “stop the show” early because he knew she was his No. 1.

Grant apologized as Litia declared, “Every woman deserves to have a man who's going to choose her without a shadow of a doubt.”

Prior to the finale night drama, Grant had gushed to Us Weekly about his connection with Juliana, a client service associate from Newton, Massachusetts.

“From night one, we really connected over our love of playing the piano. We always had that physical chemistry, and then we started to really develop an emotional connection,” he told Us. “Every relationship was different, but that was a relationship that really developed over time.”

While Juliana didn't have a one-on-one date until the second half of the season, he still tried to make her feel special.

“Group dates are always difficult. It's really awkward. It's not every day [in real life that] you're going on a group date,” he said. “But you make eye contact, check in and make sure you let the person know that you gave them reassurance that you're thinking about them — and hopefully your words don't get misinterpreted.”

The Bachelor franchise is set to return with Bachelor in Paradise this summer.

Despite years of experience coaching on The Voice, Adam Levine wasn't prepared for this talented battle round.

During the Monday, March 24, episode of NBC's singing competition series, viewers watched Conor James and Tinika Wyatt get paired up to perform a unique rendition of “How Deep Is Your Love” by The Bee Gees.

“Tinika is sneaky amazing. She's so good,” Adam, 46, shared in a confessional interview before his two contestants took to the stage. “Conor's sheer ability — the range, the tone, there's a million things I could say — I wish I could keep everybody, but unfortunately I can't. I think this will be a tough one.”

The Maroon 5 frontman was quickly reminded that coaching contestants on The Voice isn't for the weak.



After Conor and Tinika sang their hearts out, fellow coach Kelsea Ballerini called it her “favorite battle” of the season. Michael Bublé said he couldn't choose a winner because he loved them both so much.

And while John Legend gave a slight edge to Conor, he admitted, “It's going to be hard to say” a favorite.

When host Carson Daly made the announcement that it was time for Adam to pick his winner, the “Moves Like Jagger” singer expressed just how difficult the decision was.

“Both of you guys, it's just energy I want to be around,” he said. “Having to make this choice sucks particularly badly because I don't want to be without either one of you guys.”

“Tinika came in here and made my life hell because it would be a loss not to have you,” he continued. “It would be a horrible spot. From the bottom of my heart, you guys are both incredible.”

After careful thought and consideration, Adam picked Conor as the winner of the battle and reiterated his belief that the contestant could win the whole show.

“I had to pick Conor just because Conor has a unicorn quality to him,” Adam explained in a confessional. “The dude can sing anything and make it feel like it means something special.”

In an unexpected twist, Kelsea, 31, chose to steal Tinika in the final moments of the episode. As a result, Adam's former contestant was not eliminated from the competition after all.

“With my steal, I just wanted to feel something,” the country singer said. “Hearing her voice, I just knew. Tinika adds a level of soul to Team Kelsea that I'm very excited about.”

The Voice airs on NBC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Stream old episodes anytime on Peacock.

Jennifer Coolidge opened up about how she was stuck in a typecasting rut before The White Lotus and her new film Riff Raff.

“When I did Best in Show for the longest time, I was just offered these sort of trophy wife parts over and over,” the actress exclusively told Us Weekly. “There would be scripts at my front doorstep. And I'd pick 'em up and I'd be like, ‘Ah, I know exactly what these are gonna be.'”

Coolidge's intuition was right on the money as most of the offers coming her way had a similar theme.

“And sure enough, a lot of 'em were just sort of the same woman and a rich guy, spoiled wife being offered continually as if that was all I could do,” she confessed.



As Coolidge hoped to find variety in her projects, she found game-changing success with The White Lotus. Coolidge played Tanya McQuoid on Mike White's critically acclaimed HBO anthology series, the only character to return for both seasons 1 and 2 of the show, and a role that earned her multiple Emmys.

Coolidge then got the offer for Riff Raff, the crime comedy drama which also stars Ed Harris, Pete Davidson, Gabrielle Union, Lewis Pullman, Bill Murray and more. Coolidge portrays Harris' “self destructive” ex-wife, Ruth.

“I was so thrilled because I wouldn't have ever guessed, you know, especially with the way my career's been going,” she admitted. “I could be asked to be in Legally Blonde and in a movie like that. And then, you know, I would eventually be able to down the line be in something where it was so not Legally Blonde.”

The film follows Harris's character Vincent, a former criminal, as his idyllic life is turned upside down when his son (played by Pullman) and ex show up for a messy family reunion turned reckoning that forces him to face his past.

“Ruth was a part that I've never been offered before, someone like that, that was just really rough around the edges,” Coolidge said of the role. “I thoroughly enjoyed myself. [It was] really great getting to do just something different.”

The thriller (with hints of comedy) isn't a film Coolidge would have “normally” gotten the chance to do, she said, which made taking on the part even more attractive to the beloved star.

“I think it was the thriller side. I get cast in a lot of comedies. I really don't get offered roles like this,” she told Us. “White Lotus is comedic and dramatic at the same time, too. But I think this movie is even darker than White Lotus.”

In addition to showing off her acting range, Coolidge gushed about working with such a stellar cast.

“It was all quite intimidating, to be honest,” she said. “I've been very lucky and I've gotten to work with some really cool people. But I have to say I really did keep pinching myself when I was there filming. It never occurred to me that I would be able to work with these guys . I couldn't believe that I was able to work with these people that I've admired.”

Riff Raff is available to rent and purchase on demand now.

When it comes to playing a love interest for someone from the Wayans family, Essence Atkins is determined to catch them all.

“I just need to be Kim [Wayans'] love interest, and then I'll have the trifecta,” Atkins, 53, joked during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly. “I have been the love interest of all of them. So at this point, I feel kind of like an honorary member of the family.”

Atkins poked fun at how it also “feels a bit incestuous,” adding, “But not really. I love them so much and I love working with them. It's always such a pleasant, professional and fun experience. I would love to dispense it as medicine. Are you going through something difficult? Work with the Wayans — you'll feel better. It'll bring some healing to your soul.”



The actress currently stars on CBS' Poppa's House with Damon Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr., but it's a family affair behind the scenes with Kim Wayans and Damien Dante Wayans directing several episodes, Shawn Wayans and Michael Wayans being credited as writers and Marlon Wayans appearing in the Monday, March 24, episode as Damon Sr.'s onscreen brother.

Before Poppa's House, Atkins played Marlon's ex-wife on his short-lived sitcom and Shawn's girlfriend in Dance Flick.

“The truth of the matter is that it's always going to be an immediate yes when I hear ‘Wayans.' This is my sixth project with that family. I have met all of them at this point and worked with the majority of them,” she shared with Us. “I really wanted to work with Damon Wayans Jr. again [after Dance Flick] and I had always wanted to work with Damon Wayans, so that's really all I needed to know. It was an immediate yes.”

Poppa's House, which premiered in October 2024, follows legendary talk radio host Poppa (Damon Sr.), who has his point of view challenged at work when a new female cohost (Atkins) is hired. At home, Poppa finds himself still parenting his adult son (Damon Jr.), who is trying to pursue his passion while balancing the responsibilities associated with being a father and husband.

Atkins's Ivy has been introduced as a potential love interest for Damon Sr.'s Poppa — but she's not in a rush to see them get together.

“Initially when we were beginning the series, we thought it would happen sooner. But I think that there's something really beautiful about them becoming friends first and that they really grow in respect for one another and admiration for one another,” Atkins explained. “Also in being able to see behind the curtain of one another, they have a little bit more trepidation and a little bit more caution about leaping forward.”

Atkins noted that both Ivy and Poppa are starting to develop an “awareness” of their connection, adding, “He's gaining an awareness of like, ‘Well, what do I get? It looks good, but what does the inspection report say when you buy a home?' That's wisdom, and I think that that leads to a much more satisfying take when it actually happens. It won't feel so jumped or rushed.”

She continued: “These characters have earned this closeness. We've seen them grow on each other. We've seen them get on each other's nerves. I like the pace that we're continuing at. As far as how long it will take, I don't know. I definitely think that there'll be moments this season where you'll be rooting for it to happen.”

Poppa's House airs on CBS Mondays at 8:30 p.m. ET. New episodes stream the next day on Paramount+.

The legendary Michael Caine has thoughts about Taylor Swift.

“I think Taylor Swift is incredible, a giant star,” Caine, 92, said in his recently released book, Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life. “You know, she was a country singer to start with? And now she fills stadiums all over the world, with audiences of 100,000, and politicians are desperate for her to support them. That's extraordinary.”

Caine was interviewed by Matthew d'Ancona — he noted, “I've never done a book of interviews” — to share “life hacks” for the book, which was released in the United States on Tuesday, March 25. (Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life had its initial release in the U.K. late last year.)

Swift, 35, and her widespread success became a topic of conversation while Caine was discussing how the idea of “stardom” has changed during his years in the entertainment industry. (Anyone else dying to know which of Swift's songs Caine dubs his favorite?!)



“You can just tell how much hard work lies behind what she's achieved, too. It's no accident,” Caine said of the singer. “She has really earned her success, and it hasn't come overnight. She's down-to-earth, which is almost always part of it. Not spoiled by all the accolades and money. That's impressive.”

 

Caine agreed that “stardom is definitely different” now compared to the Golden Age of Hollywood, which included stars like John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart and Elizabeth Taylor, to name a few. (Some of these legendary stars, Caine has even worked with in the past.)

“People's attention is more divided than it used to be, there's more competition from all sorts of directions,” Caine continued. “There's not really the sense there used to be of the big cultural event of the week. So, there are definitely fewer actors and musicians whose name alone can guarantee a movie or a record will make money.”

He added: “But stardom is still stardom.”

This memoir is the eighth book written and released by Caine. The first few being trivia books before releasing his first memoir, What's It All About? An Autobiography in 1992. Following his 2023 retirement from acting, Caine decided to dip his toe in to fiction writing, releasing a mystery novel titled Deadly Game in December of that year.

Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life is out now.

Michael Caine's 70-plus years in Hollywood allowed him to form friendships with some major stars — and the actor has no qualms when it comes to sharing stories about them.

Caine's latest memoir (his eighth published book) Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life was released in the United States on Tuesday, March 25, and features “life hacks” from the legendary star. While sharing tricks of the trade he's learned along the way, Caine couldn't help but spill the tea on his famous friends. (This book was initially released in the U.K. late last year.)

From anecdotes about working with Beyoncé to referring to the late Quincy Jones as his “celestial twin,” Caine has some pretty epic anecdotes up his sleeve.

Keep scrolling for stories from the actor about his famous friends:



Ledger worked with Caine on 2008's The Dark Knight, the second movie in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Caine recalled the late Ledger as a “lovely guy, very gentle and unassuming,” but noted that the late star really turned it on when it became time to transform into The Joker.

“It was chilling. Absolutely floored me the first time I saw him in action – I was terrified!” Caine wrote of Ledger's portrayal, noting that the late star will be remembered as a “great actor.” Ledger died at age 28 from an accidental overdose in January 2007.

“You think of what he might have gone on to achieve, it's just heartbreaking. We were all terribly shocked, and it made doing the publicity for The Dark Knight that summer much more intense, because all the journalists wanted to talk about his death,” he recalled. “I was so pleased when he was awarded the posthumous Oscar, because it must have been at least some sort of comfort for his poor family. The truth is, we'd all hoped he would win an Academy Award and thought he should, even while we were still filming the movie.”

Caine worked with “the amazing” O'Toole in the 1959 stage show The Long and the Short and the Tall, and they struck up quite the friendship.

“We became great friends and one night he took me out on the Saturday after the show to get pissed. Which I did, as did he,” Caine recalled. “We woke up the next morning and we had no idea where we were. We were both fully clothed lying on top of a double bed.”

When they woke up, it was Monday!

Caine and Allen frequented the same restaurant and once, Farrow asked to meet the famed director.

“She said, ‘Well, if you're ever there and you see Woody Allen at another table, invite me along to dinner.' And so I did. Which is how they really met,” Caine recalled, noting elsewhere in the book that he didn't anticipate how things would end between them. (Farrow accused Allen in 1992 of molesting their adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow, which he has vehemently denied.)

Caine immediately clocked the late Jones as “a great person” when they first met. After Caine invited Jones to his birthday party, the two stars realized that they share a birth date and time.

“We call ourselves ‘celestial twins,'” Caine wrote, noting that it became “a bit of a tradition” for him and Jones to celebrate their milestone birthdays together.

“For our sixtieth birthdays in 1993, we had a great bash in L.A. Ice-T came along and challenged me to rap with him!” he recalled. “Then we had another great party for our eightieth in Vegas, with Stevie Wonder singing ‘Happy Birthday' and Chaka Khan doing the theme song from Alfie.”

Jones died in November 2024 but was still alive when Caine wrote this book.

“Those are amazing memories, to be cherished,” he wrote. “We had a sense of humor in common, and he was such easy company from the get-go. I think that's the heart of friendship, isn't it? You don't have to watch yourself and what you say, you can relax and be natural. When I say we are twins, I do mean that he feels like another brother to me. A great addition to my life, and I hope I was to his. I can't remember a bad moment in our friendship.”

Caine called the actor “special” in his book, recalling the first time they crossed paths.

“I just instinctively greeted him with a hug and announced to the whole room, ‘This is my son!' Sometimes, you sense a connection,” Caine shared. “I just liked the guy immediately, he has a big heart. It turned out he was going through some tough times back then, so I think perhaps it made an impression upon him to be embraced and treated with love. Anyway, we've been great friends ever since.”

The actor said that he always has dinner with the “multi-talented” Diesel when they're in the same place at the same time.

Caine got a chance to work alongside Beyoncé in the 2002 movie Austin Powers in Goldmember. The singer shared her big dreams with the legendary star.

“You could already tell how focused she was and how big a star she was going to be,” he recalled. “I remember the first day on set, I asked her what her ambition was, and she said, ‘I want to win an Academy Award for a movie.' Not a trace of arrogance, just clarity. She was nominated a couple of years ago. I'm sure she'll win an Oscar eventually.”

Grant's Season 29 Winner Revealed in Finale Episode","https://www.justjared.com/2025/03/24/who-won-the-bachelor-2025-grants-season-29-winner-revealed-in-finale-episode/","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:31:37 GMT","

Grant Ellis is engaged and we can reveal spoilers from the season finale of The Bachelor.

Reality Steve already dropped the spoilers before the season even started, but now ABC has confirmed the winner of the most recent season of the show.

The three-hour season finale episode aired on Monday night (March 24) and Grant popped the question during the dramatic conclusion, which was filmed in the Dominican Republic. 

Host Jesse Palmer said during the finale that in Bachelor history, it has never come down to the wire in this way with Grant being unable to come up with his decision until moments before he had to choose between the final two women.

Head inside to find out who won... 

The final two women were 28-year-old Juliana, a client service associate from Massachusetts, and 31-year-old Litia, a venture capitalist from Utah. 

Juliana (left) and Litia (right)


Litia was the first woman to arrive at the final rose ceremony, where she professed her love to Grant and said that she started falling for him in the second week. 

""I love you so much and I feel so lucky to be loved by you,"" she told him.

Grant unfortunately did not reciprocate the feelings. ""Litia, I love you, very much and I want to give you everything that you deserve, but I'm not your person,"" he said. 

""I'm sorry to have gotten to this point. My emotional connection is stronger with someone else,"" he said. 

Juliana wins and is engaged to Grant!

Juliana was next to show up at the rose ceremony and she was revealed as the final recipient of a rose... and an engagement ring!

""I just want you to know I love you and you'll make me the luckiest girl in the world if I get to spend the rest of my life with you,"" Juliana said to Grant.

Grant got down on one knee and asked Juliana to marry him. She said yes!

Elizabeth Olsen will not be making an appearance in the next two Avengers movies. 

The 36-year-old actress revealed in a recent interview that she will not be reprising her role of Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch in the upcoming films Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.

“I didn't realize this until about six years ago, but because Marvel and its influence takes up so much physical time and space in the world, it's really important for me to make choices outside of Marvel that reflect my own taste,” Elizabeth told The Hollywood Reporter while discussing her film The Assessment.

“Your taste does create the artist that you are, and that wasn't something I was thinking about when I first started working. So the opportunity to return to films like [The Assessment] is a reflection of the people I want to work with and my own personal taste,” she added.

Maria Shriver is opening up about her divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The 69-year-old journalist got vulnerable in her new memoir, I Am Maria, detailing how the split affected her. 

“My twenty-five-year-long marriage blew up. It broke my heart, it broke my spirit, it broke what was left of me,” she wrote, per People. 

“I was consumed with grief and wracked with confusion, anger, fear, sadness, and anxiety. I was unsure now of who I was, where I belonged. Honestly, it was brutal, and I was terrified,” she added.

Maria and Arnold got married in 1986, and share Katherine, 35, Christina, 33, Patrick, 31, and Christopher, 27, together. 

In 2011, Arnold admitted to having an affair with house staffer Mildred Baena, which resulted in the birth of Joseph Baena.

He was drinking an iced quad espresso in a venti cup with extra ice and six shots.

At the time, fans figured out that he was likely consuming around 384 mg of caffeine with this drink, at around 64 mg per shot.

On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Pedro said of his coffee order going viral, “I cannot begin to tell you how violating this was!”

“There's so much context to why it has become six shots of espresso. It was always a quad but then I feel like the cups got bigger and, I don't know, the shots got less strong. At some point, it became six,"" he said. “It was an incredibly private morning ritual that I never wanted anyone to know about.""

“You sip it and you get really high, and you answer emails and stuff,” he added, noting that he doesn't drink any additional coffee besides this drink.

Pedro was recently linked romantically to this major star, but a source just clarified the nature of their relationship.
