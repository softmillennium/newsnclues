Evinova, a clinical trial technology company, is partnering with Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative (QLHC) to integrate Evinova's remote patient monitoring (RPM) offering into I-SPY 2.2, a platform trial that provides a framework to study multiple novel therapeutic treatment arms for women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. 

A platform trial is a clinical trial design that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple interventions or treatments against a common control group within a single, ongoing protocol that could lead to efficient and adaptable research. 

Evinova's RPM module will be used to warn healthcare professionals of early symptoms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), a possible adverse event for one treatment arm in the study.

Evinova's RPM allows for real-time monitoring of patients' health status and treatment intake between clinical visits and notifies healthcare providers of the potential onset or worsening of symptoms related to a potential toxicity, specifically ILD. 

With this data, healthcare providers can triage patients requiring further clinical evaluation and intervene quickly based on guidelines.

According to Evinova, this could potentially reduce the likelihood of progression to high-grade ILD and dose reduction, hold or interruption of treatment.

"One of the primary goals of I-SPY 2.2 is to get better treatments to patients faster and with fewer side effects," Dr. Laura Esserman, founder of the I-SPY trials and QLHC, said in a statement.

"New bispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates have the promise of eliminating traditional chemotherapy, but they too are associated with potential serious side effects. One of those complications is ILD, but early identification may be the key to preventing it from becoming a serious complication. Evinova makes it possible for us to monitor people using the drug every day, from the comfort of their home."

Cristina Duran, president of Evinova, said that with real-time alerts to both patients and sites, Evinova's RPM solution for toxicity monitoring will give care teams the ability to review and take proactive actions based on guidelines.

"At Evinova, we're passionate about accelerating better health outcomes through technology like RPM that enables global life science leaders to overcome critical research challenges and deliver a better clinical trial experience for both sites and patients," Duran said.

THE LARGER TREND 

In 2023, AstraZeneca launched Evinova with the aim of bringing digital health solutions already in use globally by the pharma company to clinical research organizations, trial sponsors, and care teams and patients. 

The company uses established digital technology solutions to streamline clinical trial design and delivery in order to reduce time and costs in medicine development. The venture also dives into digital remote patient monitoring and therapeutics.

Other companies involved in remote patient monitoring include Sibel Health, a spin-out of Northwestern University, which closed a $30 million Series C equity financing round in March and received its seventh FDA clearance. 

Sibel Health's FDA-cleared ANNE One platform contains advanced wearable sensors, AI-enabled data analytics, and an integrated mobile software and cloud platform. It also offers wireless monitoring of patients' vital signs and can be used for patients 12 years and older. 

In 2024, Doccla, a provider of virtual ward and remote patient monitoring services, secured £35 million ($38.6 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. 

That same year, CoachCare secured a $48 million strategic growth investment.

CoachCare works with individual practices and hospital systems to provide a remote patient monitoring service for patients with acute and chronic conditions, and it offers connected devices for providers to capture patient data. The company also provides a virtual health platform for follow-ups and chronic care management.

Sacramento County's Department of Health Services seeks to gain more grant funding to provide health care for homeless people. Staff will present at the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday about their mobile and street medical service called Wellness Without Walls.

These mobile clinics have a variety of healthcare services, including HIV treatment, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and substance counseling, according to Sacramento County Department of Health Services' website. 

In partnership with the department's primary health services and sexual health promotion unit, the program was created to eliminate barriers to accessing health care. Homeless residents don't always have transportation needed for a doctor's visit, or they fear losing their belongings while away at a clinic. These mobile clinics attempt to bridge the gap of accessing health care, the resolution states.

“These programs not only address immediate health concerns but also build trust within the unhoused community, encouraging individuals to seek ongoing care,” the resolution states.

Originally established in 2014, there are currently three mobile clinics and one dental clinic, the department stated. These mobile clinics have primary care services for clients as young as 4 years old. They also have wound care equipment and labs and medical referrals. The Department of Health Services stated that this program has served more than 2,000 patients since its launch.

The Department of Health Services wants to expand services through providing additional locations in Sacramento County, according to the presentation prepared for the Board of Supervisors. Many of the mobile clinics work in silos and Medi-Cal resources can be restrictive, with clients facing difficulties meeting criteria. The agency added the program has faced obstacles with getting care for uninsured clients. Consistency with client follow-up has also been met with difficulty.

Wellness Without Walls holds pop-up medical clinics throughout the county. Tuesday, the day of the presentation to the Board of Supervisors, the a clinic will be 9 a.m. - noon at 1492 Northgate Blvd. Upcoming locations can be found at https://bit.ly/4jivLR9

My Ayur Health: Transforming Healthcare Through Ayurveda Innovation.

Virginia, United States, March 25, 2025 -- In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, the demand for holistic and natural healing methods has seen a dramatic rise. My Ayur Health, https://myayurhealth.com/, co-founded by Nandhakumar Raju and Dr. Mishra, is at the forefront of this transformation, offering an innovative platform that integrates the timeless wisdom of Ayurveda with cutting-edge technology. The platform aims to make Ayurvedic medicine accessible and affordable to people worldwide, addressing a critical gap in the healthcare ecosystem. By providing a comprehensive marketplace for virtual consultations, personalized health assessments, and natural remedies, My Ayur Health is redefining how people approach their health and well-being.



The Timeless Wisdom of Ayurveda Ayurveda, often referred to as the "Science of Life," is one of the world's oldest medical systems, originating in India over 5,000 years ago. It emphasizes a holistic approach to health, focusing on the balance between mind, body, and spirit to achieve overall well-being. Unlike conventional medicine, which often focuses on treating symptoms, Ayurveda seeks to identify and address the root cause of ailments. With its reliance on natural remedies, dietary guidance, and lifestyle modifications, Ayurveda has proven to be effective in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, stress, and digestive disorders. Despite its proven benefits, access to qualified Ayurvedic practitioners and authentic treatments remains a challenge for many, particularly in the modern era where fast-paced lifestyles often compromise holistic health practices.

Challenges in Modern HealthcareThe global healthcare system is grappling with numerous challenges, from rising costs to the growing prevalence of chronic diseases. Allopathy, the predominant system of medicine, while highly effective for acute and emergency care, often falls short in addressing the long-term management of chronic conditions. Additionally, the reliance on synthetic drugs has led to widespread concerns about side effects and over-medication. In developing nations, accessibility to quality healthcare remains a significant hurdle, while in developed countries, the focus on quick fixes often overshadows the importance of preventive and holistic care. These challenges have highlighted the need for alternative approaches that prioritize prevention, affordability, and accessibility, a gap that My Ayur Health aims to fill.

HCA Healthcare Announces $1.84 Million HCA Healthcare Foundation Grant to United Way

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, today announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, will give $1.84 million to Mile High United Way to launch United for Healthy Starts, a national collaboration between four United Ways to help increase access to social, economic and educational support services for families. The effort is led by Mile High United Way in Denver and includes United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, United Way Miami and United Way of Greater Nashville.


“It's a privilege to help champion the overall health and well-being of families through United for Healthy Starts,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of the HCA Healthcare Foundation. “Meaningful community impact can be made when organizations come together to support and learn from one another. We are excited and expect to see a positive influence from this United Way initiative across the country, as we work together to help give communities healthier tomorrows.”




United for Healthy Starts aims to increase access to services to improve social, economic and overall health outcomes for families. Through this new grant, the initiative is designed to help families have strong, healthy starts through home visitation and wrap-around services tailored to the needs of each family supported. By establishing a national, collaborative learning community, United for Healthy Starts will also work to help create new nonprofit partnerships, with the intention of strengthening service delivery and innovation and achieving a scalable impact beyond the grant.




"We are thrilled to continue this longstanding collaboration between two historic anchor institutions committed to improving the lives of families – HCA Healthcare and United Way,” said Christine Benero, Mile High United Way president and CEO. “Through United for Healthy Starts, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are truly putting a stake in the ground for mothers and young children, especially those facing barriers to healthy outcomes. This important grant in the Denver, Dallas, Nashville and Miami communities will help our work to develop new innovations in home visitation and support, and we hope the learnings will allow us to bring this model to more communities in the future.”




HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have a long history of working with and supporting United Way. In 1981, HCA Healthcare co-founder Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. co-founded the first chapter of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society in Nashville, Tennessee and later received its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. Over the last 30 years, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have given more than $17 million in support of United Way's work to help improve communities nationwide.




The HCA Healthcare Foundation's Healthier Tomorrow Fund supports evidence-informed programs that address high-priority needs and advance community health by supporting efforts to pilot, replicate and scale meaningful, measurable initiatives in communities where HCA Healthcare has a presence. Since its inception, the fund has committed more than $17 million in grants to nonprofits across the country.

 NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, today announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, will give $1.84 million to Mile High United Way to launch United for Healthy Starts, a national collaboration between four United Ways to help increase access to social, economic and educational support services for families. The effort is led by Mile High United Way in Denver and includes United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, United Way Miami and United Way of Greater Nashville.



“It's a privilege to help champion the overall health and well-being of families through United for Healthy Starts,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of the HCA Healthcare Foundation. “Meaningful community impact can be made when organizations come together to support and learn from one another. We are excited and expect to see a positive influence from this United Way initiative across the country, as we work together to help give communities healthier tomorrows.”



United for Healthy Starts aims to increase access to services to improve social, economic and overall health outcomes for families. Through this new grant, the initiative is designed to help families have strong, healthy starts through home visitation and wrap-around services tailored to the needs of each family supported. By establishing a national, collaborative learning community, United for Healthy Starts will also work to help create new nonprofit partnerships, with the intention of strengthening service delivery and innovation and achieving a scalable impact beyond the grant.

Long Beach, California-based Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH provides managed healthcare services to low-income families and individuals under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces. Valued at a market cap of $17.1 billion, the company participates exclusively in government-sponsored healthcare programs. 

Companies worth $10 billion or more are typically classified as “large-cap stocks,” and Molina fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the healthcare plans industry. The company operates with a cost-efficient business model, focusing on streamlined healthcare delivery to maintain strong profit margins. With a broad geographic presence across multiple U.S. states, the company continues to expand its reach while leveraging strategic acquisitions and operational efficiency to strengthen its market position.

Despite its notable strength, this healthcare company has dipped 26.2% from its 52-week high of $423.92, reached on Mar. 27, 2024. It has gained 5.9% over the past three months, lagging behind the SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF's XHS 8.7% uptick over the same time frame.

In the longer term, MOH has fallen 24.6% over the past 52 weeks, considerably underperforming XHS' 7.3% rise over the same time frame. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of MOH are up 7.4%, compared to XHS' 9.5% return.

To confirm its recent bullish trend, MOH has been trading above its 50-day moving average since late February. However, it has remained below its 200-day moving average since late April, with some fluctuations.

On Feb. 5, MOH released its mixed Q4 results, and its stock plummeted 10.1% the following day. While adjusted earnings rose 15.3% year-over-year to $5.05 per share, it fell 13.1% short of Wall Street expectations. Rising medical care costs, lower investment income, and weaker-than-expected membership growth further weighed on investor sentiment and led to its earnings miss. However, on the brighter side, higher premium revenues and new contract acquisitions resulted in a 16% increase in its revenue to $10.5 billion, which met analyst estimates. 

For fiscal 2025, MOH expects adjusted EPS to be at least $24.50, representing an approximately 8% growth compared to the previous year. 

MOH has lagged behind its rival, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's UNH 5.4% gain over the past 52 weeks but has outpaced UNH's 2.1% rise on a YTD basis. 

Despite MOH's recent underperformance relative to its industry peers, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from the 14 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $343.46 suggests a nearly 9.9% premium to its current levels.

Oops, something went wrong

A collaboration with hospital systems and their leaders, OnDefend's new Ransomware Defense Validation service reimagines defense strategies through proactive and continuous security control validation.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 25, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OnDefend, a leader in preventative cybersecurity testing and advisory services, today announced the launch of its Ransomware Defense Validation (RDV) service. Developed with direct input from prominent healthcare Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and launched in collaboration with major healthcare systems, RDV addresses the pressing need for organizations to proactively defend against ransomware threats.

The healthcare community faces a new pandemic—a cyber one—and the risks to patient safety, data security, and operational continuity have never been greater. As a managed service, RDV, powered by BlindSPOT, OnDefend's proprietary Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platform, equips organizations to regularly test and validate the effectiveness of their prevention, detection, and response security controls against known and emerging threats.

Data collected from OnDefend's global security testing services found:

24% of malicious emails bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs).

7 out of 10 attack simulation engagements identify exploitable security tool failures.

5 out of 10 incident emulations identify notification delays or failure to meet Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the response vendors.

A Collaborative Approach to Solving an Industry-Wide Challenge

RDV originated from conversations between OnDefend's security teams and healthcare leaders who shared concerns about common security control failures and the lack of regular visibility and validation.

"Cybersecurity isn't about setting up defenses and hoping for the best. It's about constantly testing, adapting, and staying ahead of threats. If you're not testing your security, the attackers will do it for you," said Larry Whiteside Jr., former CISO at Spectrum Health and Women's Care OBGYN.

These discussions highlighted the need for a proactive solution tailored to the unique challenges of healthcare cybersecurity, going above and beyond current healthcare standards and regulations.

How Ransomware Defense Validation (RDV) Works

RDV is delivered by OnDefend as a managed service using BlindSPOT to safely simulate real-world ransomware attacks on a healthcare systems' defenses to prove their:

Secure Email Gateways (SEGs): effectively filter malicious emails from reaching employee inboxes.

Threat Detection Tools (EDR, SIEM): effectively identify and alert security teams to real-world attack activity.

Threat Response Teams (SOC,MDR,NDR): immediately respond and neutralize real-world cyber threats in real-time.

"Ransomware Defense Validation provides security leaders with critical visibility into their defensive investments, ensuring they are resilient against the cyber threats targeting their industry," said Chris Freedman, CEO of OnDefend. "The goal of this managed service is to validate security tools and hold monitoring vendors accountable, all while empowering our customers to demonstrate they are achieving the return on investment they deserve."

RDV Outcomes & Industry Impact

Early access customers who implemented RDV found their security teams' overall posture improved, showcased continuous risk reduction, proved return on investments, and are prepared to safeguard essential healthcare operations.

This service is now available to healthcare organizations nationwide.

Sustainability initiative Better Cotton has embarked on a two-year pilot project in Côte d'Ivoire aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for farmers while strengthening cotton supply chains.

Sustainability initiative Better Cotton has embarked on a two-year pilot project in Côte d'Ivoire aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for farmers while strengthening cotton supply chains.

This initiative is set to develop a health programme specifically designed to serve the needs of approximately 8,000 local residents initially.

In Côte d'Ivoire, nearly half of the populace endures living beneath the poverty threshold and health indicators rank among the poorest in West Africa.

Despite the Côte d'Ivoire government's endorsement of a comprehensive social protection strategy and the enactment of a Universal Health Coverage law in 2019, which requires citizens to enrol, participation rates remain low.

As of 2024, only 27% of the population has registered for the programme, with a mere 5% actively utilizing the health care services offered by this system.

With this project, Better Cotton aspires to establish a scalable model that could benefit underserved populations worldwide.

Better Cotton smallholder livelihoods manager Maria Kjaer said: “Farmer health and well-being are essential to supporting sustainable agriculture. We have the opportunity to remove healthcare barriers for farming communities to create a real, positive impact.”

The initiative has received financial backing from Better Cotton, ISEAL, and Olam Agri. Its execution is facilitated by the financial assistance provided through the ISEAL Innovations Fund. This fund garners support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the UK Aid from the British government.

For the project, Better Cotton has collaborated with SECO, an Olam Agri subsidiary, and Elucid, a social enterprise to develop an ecosystem that improves health which reducing costs.

Elucid's digital healthcare platform will be deployed across select farming regions in Côte d'Ivoire.

This platform will register cotton farmers and link them with local accredited healthcare providers while facilitating secure payments and gathering user feedback to enhance service offerings, notes Better Cotton.

Elucid managing director and co-founder Samuel Knauss said: “With this project, we are bringing our healthcare model to cotton farmers by strengthening the capacity of agricultural producer organisations. This will ensure that farmers can access essential and emergency care without financial hardship. Building on our success in the cocoa and coffee sectors, we aim to show that investing in healthcare not only improves farmer well-being but also strengthens cotton supply chains and creates lasting impact for communities.”

The partnership will involve agricultural producer organisations (APOs) to promote local engagement with the platform, monitor its usage effectively, and ensure it addresses pertinent issues faced by the community.

The project's success is expected to expand social protection coverage for farmer households, eliminate healthcare access barriers, and pave the way for continued investment in these services even after the project concludes.

SECO vice president and managing director Jean-François Touré said: “This project shall serve as a reference for the industry, particularly as Côte d'Ivoire advances the implementation of its Universal Health Coverage programme. Through this partnership with Better Cotton and Elucid, we aim to create a lasting, scalable impact for farming communities.”

Better Cotton's initiative not only seeks to offer valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices but also aims to provide data on the relationship between health outcomes and farmer incomes, potentially informing similar efforts across various commodities and regions.

Last month, Better Cotton completed its evolution into a certification scheme with the aim of upholding stringent sustainability and transparency protocols across the cotton sector.

Medicaid, a federal health insurance program for low-income children and adults, is facing dual challenges at both the state and federal level.

Nationally, Republicans in Congress are pushing to cut about $880 billion in spending on healthcare and energy over 10 years. The nonpartisan policy institute Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said this will be impossible to do without cuts to Medicaid, which covers about one in five Americans.

It is not yet clear what form those cuts could take, but proposals have included changing payments into fixed or per capita amounts, reducing the matching rate for Medicaid expansion population and adding work requirements. 

The Trump administration has promised cuts would not reduce benefits and has said taxpayers lose as much as $521 billion annually to fraud, most of which they claimed came from entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Meanwhile, Maine state lawmakers last week failed to pass the supplemental budget with the two-thirds majority required to immediately address the $118 million shortfall in the state's Medicaid program.

Most House Republicans did not vote for the measure, saying they wanted to see more reforms to the program. In response, the state said it would need to temporarily pause payments to certain healthcare providers.

On Thursday, Democrats, who hold the majority, advanced a budget over Republican opposition that bails out the Medicaid program, but only for the next year. The budget does not include anticipated $100 million increases in MaineCare costs in fiscal year 2027, the Portland Press Herald reported. Maine's governor signed the budget late Friday afternoon.

Alex Carter, policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, told The Maine Monitor that the state Medicaid deficit would be “just a small symptom — the tip of the iceberg — of what we would see if such massive cuts were made to federal Medicaid spending.”

So what does Medicaid actually cover in Maine?

First and foremost, it is important to note that Maine's version of Medicaid is called MaineCare. The program is jointly funded by the state and federal government. 

There are some services — such as hospital visits, nursing facility stays or home health services — that states are required to cover under Medicaid, and then there are additional services states can opt into. For example, Maine has opted to also provide coverage for older adults in residential care who are spending down their income to reach the threshold for Medicaid, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

Thirty-two percent of the state's total budget was spent on MaineCare in the 2023 fiscal year, according to the DHHS.

As of December, MaineCare had nearly 400,000 members enrolled in its various programs, which include Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and additional state-specific categories.

Nearly a fourth of those enrolled in MaineCare are part of the expansion of eligibility that Mainers approved by referendum in 2017 and Gov. Janet Mills adopted when she took office in 2019.

One possible way Congress could cut Medicaid would be to reduce financial support to states for this expansion population. Right now, Maine's federal funding match rate for the expansion population — about 94,000 Mainers — is 90 percent.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that if Congress reduces that matching rate for people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, Maine would lose $117 million in federal money, forcing state leaders to cover the cost or remove 25,000 people from Medicaid.

Last year, about two-thirds of Maine's nursing home residents and about half of Maine children were covered by MaineCare.

Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association, said MaineCare makes up about 18% of the hospital business across the state — although it ranges widely. 

Eighteen percent doesn't sound like a lot, said Michaud, “but it is in our world.”

Lisa Harvey-McPherson, vice president of government relations for Northern Light Health, said revenue from MaineCare payments is different for each hospital in the system and ranges from 12 to 64 percent.

“Some provider types in Maine are almost fully reliant on MaineCare, like nursing homes and community behavioral health services,” she said. “We rely on community services to provide care to our patients throughout the state of Maine.”

Nearly half of all births at hospitals across the state were covered by MaineCare, according to a three-year average from 2021 to 2023 by the Maine Hospital Association. For rural hospitals, that increased to 55 percent, Michaud said.

MaineHealth said 13 percent of its total revenue is from MaineCare payments, and 43 percent of behavioral health patients are on MaineCare.

Katie Fullam Harris, chief government affairs officer, added that MaineHealth is “exceedingly concerned” about any reductions in eligibility or payments to providers.

“Maine's healthcare infrastructure is teetering on the edge of real challenge right now,” she said. “There's no room to absorb additional costs.”

In Carson City, Nev., home health care workers will be at the statehouse on Tuesday asking lawmakers for a big raise, citing growing demand as the state's population rapidly ages.

It's the second such request in two years. A campaign in 2023 delivered a $16 minimum wage for home caregivers, who are employed by private agencies that are funded through Medicaid. Prior to that, their wages had been stuck between $10 and $12 an hour for more than a decade.

"It was just ridiculous," says Regina Brown-Ross, a home care worker and union organizer with SEIU Local 1107. "People can't function on $12 an hour."

In 2025, getting by remains a struggle for many caregivers, even on $16 an hour. Home care workers, who are mostly women and people of color, often lack health insurance. Like other low wage workers, they must contend with rising food and housing costs.

So now they're asking for $20 an hour, hoping that lawmakers will approve the request as part of the state's next budget bill.

Two years ago, the $16 minimum wage for caregivers was championed by Democrats, who still control both chambers of the Nevada legislature, but was eventually signed into law by Republican Governor Joe Lombardo.

Today, the workers also want the state to approve more hours of coverage for their clients, many of whom only qualify for part-time care.

"A lot of the clients — they don't have enough hours and they need more help," says Brown-Ross.

This would also be a benefit to the caregivers: If they could be paid for more hours with each client, they wouldn't need to take on so many, relieving them of long drives between clients.

Their push for higher wages is shining a spotlight on a struggle that caregivers across the country face as demand for their services soars.

Already, there's evidence that the previous wage bump in Nevada, which took effect in January 2024, has reduced turnover. Before their wages rose to $16, half of home care workers in the state didn't last a year in their roles. In the four months after the new minimum took effect, turnover fell to almost nothing, according to Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services.

Since then, the ranks of home health agencies and SEIU Local 1107 have grown. Since 2023, more than 1,300 home care workers have voted to unionize in 12 consecutive elections, adding muscle to their latest fight.

Irma Nunez, a longtime caregiver who took part in the lobbying effort in 2023, says that at the time, they had a receptive audience among state lawmakers when they shared stories of bathing and feeding patients and helping them go to the bathroom. The need for in-home help struck a chord.

"People told us personal stories about their dads, moms, grandparents, family members," she says. "They knew what we were talking about."

To make ends meet, Nunez used to pick up as much work as she could, taking on multiple clients, driving from house to house, working a couple hours here, a couple hours there, seven days a week.

The bump she received in January 2024, from $11 to $16 an hour, allowed her to reduce her workload slightly and take better care of her own health. But $20 an hour would provide her a better safety net, she says, and allow her to start saving a bit for her own retirement.

The push for higher caregiver wages has been cheered on by some of the seniors and people with disabilities who rely on the care, like Nunez's longtime client Thomas Draa.

A high school science teacher, Draa was in a car crash 20 years ago that left him unable to use his legs. Since then, he's needed help getting out of bed, washing, dressing, and getting in his van to go to school.

That help hasn't always been reliable. "We had people coming and going, or not showing up to get me up, and I wouldn't go to school that day," he says.

Then came Nunez. For the past 12 years, she's been at his house every day, arriving at 4:30 a.m. so Draa can make it to school by 6 a.m., an hour before the students arrive.

She returns in the afternoon to get him back into his house and back into bed. "I wouldn't be able to go to school or work if it wasn't for Irma," Draa says.

"I always thought it was just crazy," he says of caregivers' wages. "They make such a little amount of money, for what an important job it is."

Brown-Ross started working as a caregiver after a decades-long career as a singer, performing around the world in solo shows and as a backup singer to the likes of Gladys Knight, Ray Charles and Smokey Robinson.

But while touring in China in the early 2010s, she suffered damage to her voice.

"I couldn't sing my phrases. I couldn't hold a note. It was the most devastating time for me," she recalls.

She needed to find a job, and soon one came calling: Her mother-in-law had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Determined to keep her at home, Brown-Ross began taking care of her, eventually getting certified as a caregiver and formalizing the arrangement through a state program that allows family members to be paid for their work. She was hired by an agency and paid the going rate, then $12 an hour.

"To go from working with Ray Charles and Gladys Knight, making money, to being a home care worker … was difficult for me," says Brown-Ross.

It wasn't just the meager wages. It was the lack of respect for caregivers and recognition of their work.

"They deserve to have dignity in their own profession," she says.

Brown-Ross's mother-in-law died in 2018. Since then, she's taken on other clients, including an elderly cousin who fought in World War II, a teenager with autism, and a woman with disabilities.


                Regina Brown-Ross sings inside her home on January 24th, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. As a caregiver, her focus is on helping her clients maintain dignity, independence, and quality of life, often incorporating music therapy.

Recently, she's started to rehabilitate her own voice, and is getting back into singing — finding parallels between her two careers.

"I loved bringing joy to my audiences and taking them on a journey, helping them to feel better," she says. "I bring that same premise to my home caregiving. I help them to do the things that they're no longer able to do for themselves."

FRAMINGHAM — The state Department of Public Health will hold a public hearing April 9 at the Memorial Building in response to MetroWest Medical Center's plans to reduce the level of its maternity services at Framingham Union Hospital.

Tenet Healthcare Corp., the Dallas-based publicly traded company that owns Framingham Union, recently announced plans to shift the status of the hospital's maternity services from a Level IIB Special Care Nursery to a Level I Well Baby Nursery.

Level II nurseries treat babies born greater than 32 weeks or those that are full term and require close monitoring of problems that are expected to soon be resolved. The "IIB" designation means the hospital can provide some respiratory assistance for short periods of time.

Level I nurseries provide care only for healthy full-term babies or babies born close to their due date, typically 35 weeks or later.

The plan has been criticized by city officials and nurses at Framingham Union Hospital.

The Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents about 300 nurses at Framingham Union, opposes a reduction in services. The Daily News spoke with nursing staff about the move during a gathering outside of the hospital on March 11.

Ginnie Ford, a nurse in the unit since 1978, explained that mothers with more needs will have to be transferred to either UMass Memorial Health in Worcester or to a hospital in Boston.

"We need this (not to change). Most of our patients are low income," she said during the March 11 gathering. "Our mammas are really high risk." She explained that while Tenet said the unit won't lose any staff, it's already flexing the numbers down.

"Tenet could hire more OBs (obstetricians); when I started there were 32 OBs, now there's two," Ford added.

Mayor Charlie Sisitsky, who requested the hearing be held in Framingham, expressed concern about the discontinuing of more specialized maternity services in a letter to the DPH. He wrote that he was told by the CEO of Tenet that about 50 out of 500 deliveries each year require an advanced level of maternity services.

"We are further concerned that discontinuing the specialized maternity services may deter women from seeking maternity care at all from MWMC," he wrote. "This could have a cascading effect on overall maternity services and would eventually lead to lower delivery numbers that MWMC could then claim that any maternity services could no longer be justified."

In a statement to the Daily News about the closure, a Tenet spokesperson wrote that the hospital will still be able to create "a memorable and patient-centric" birthing experience for lower-risk deliveries while having the ability to transfer higher acuity patients to a facility that offers more specialized care.

In a Facebook post about the hearing, Sisitsky wrote: "We are thrilled that the DPH has agreed to hold the hearing here in Framingham."

"This decision reflects our commitment to ensuring that local voices are heard," the mayor continued. "We encourage all residents to attend and engage in this important conversation about the future of maternity care in our community."

The DPH's public hearing will take place on Wednesday, April 9, at Nevins Hall in the Memorial Building, 150 Concord St. Nevins Hall can hold more than 1,100 people and is equipped with technology for presentations and live broadcasts.

While no time has been provided, the city posted on Facebook that a time would be added later this week.</p>

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 25, 2025) – Hospitals can be overwhelming places for children and are often filled with unfamiliar sights, sounds and experiences. But specialists in the Child Life program at UK HealthCare's Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) work to make the environment less intimidating.  

Recently, the Child Life program expanded to three additional within KCH: the Pediatric Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic, the Center for Advanced Surgery and the pediatric specialty clinics located at Kentucky Children's Richmond Road. 

Previously, the Child Life Program only had dedicated specialists in the inpatient acute, progressive and critical care units of KCH, as well as the neonatal intensive care unit and the cardiac care unit. Specialists also assist patients in the Makenna David Pediatric Emergency Center, the DanceBlue Hematology Oncology Clinic and the Children's Sedation and Procedure Unit.  

Through play, education and emotional support, the Child Life Program helps young patients and their families navigate medical challenges with confidence. Their work goes beyond distraction; it empowers children to understand their medical experiences and cope with them in healthy ways.  

“Every interaction with a Child Life specialist has the potential to change a child's hospital experience for the better,” said Jennifer Guilliams, director of Child and Family Life at KCH. “There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Our specialists meet each patient where they are, using play, education and emotional support tailored to their unique needs. With this expansion, more young patients will receive the reassurance and care they deserve, delivered by an extraordinary team committed to making a difference.”

Child Life Specialists, Ashlee Amerine (Center for Advanced Surgery), Ashley Semones (KCH Richmond Road clinics) and Lyndsay Overton (Children's Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic) shared with UKNow their roles in Child Life program, the strategies they use to ease fears and the impact they have on young patients. 

UKNOW: Describe your roles in the Child Life program. 

Ashlee Amerine: I often tell my families I'm like the “teacher” of the hospital. My role is to help patients and families understand why they are here, teaching them about a diagnosis or a surgery they might be having. My role is also to provide support and normalization to their environment to help aid in coping. I help out with procedures such as IV starts or anesthesia inductions as well as providing support and positive coping to patients as they separate from their parents to go off to surgery. My job is to help make their experience a little less scary, and a little more fun. 

Ashley Semones: I help to prepare, educate, support, distract and play with kids to help reduce stress and anxiety. I know child development very well. There is so much power in play. 

Lyndsay Overton: My role is to help explain to patients and families what is going to happen while they are with us in the Pediatric Infusion & Diagnostic Clinic. Many of these patients and families have been coming for years and know our nursing staff well. These patients have chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, lupus and many others. The patients might come a few days in a row, once a week, once a month or once every six months. It depends on what the doctor's plan of care is for them. The treatments can take an hour or sometimes all day. I help with IV placements, lab draws, port access/de access and dressing changes to help patients cope, and give activities, games, toys and craft kits to do to help pass the time. 

UKNOW: What inspired you to pursue a career in Child Life? 

Ashlee Amerine: I always loved working with children and had a draw to working in the health care field. I originally thought I may want to be a physician's assistant, but then changed my path after learning about child life. A family friend is a certified child life specialist in Minnesota and told me about the profession and it felt like it was meant to be for me.  

UKNOW: What unique challenges do children face in specialized medical settings that child life can help address? 

Ashlee Amerine: Children often have misconceptions within the health care environment because most of what they are experiencing is new and unfamiliar. Child life specialists can help children understand through developmentally appropriate language, preparation of pictures and even using medical equipment to play out a procedure they may be having. Helping children understand what will be happening to their bodies can help ease fears. As child life specialists we can also work to normalize the environment such as bringing in familiar toys to play with or help celebrate their birthday.  

UKNOW: What prompted the expansion of Child Life services into specialized areas of care? 

Lyndsay Overton: When the Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic opened in 2023, the request for child life services came from staff, families and patients who had received previous treatments at KCH. The KCH Leadership team advocated for this service for these patients and families who have frequent visits. 

UKNOW: How does your approach change when working with children in specialized medical fields? 

Ashley Semones: Meeting every child and family where they are in a developmentally appropriate way. Doing a child life assessment to figure out what works best for each child and family. Every child is different and has unique things that impact their coping and their journey. 

UKNOW: What strategies do you use to support parents and siblings of children undergoing complex medical treatments? 

Lyndsay Overton: I always try to approach meeting every patient and family with open eyes and ears. I think to myself that maybe I can find something that some other of our medical team missed to better this patients experience. Common strategies are medical play, comfort positions and nonpharmaceutical management techniques. 

UKNOW: Can you share a success story where Child Life interventions made a significant impact in a specialized setting? 

Ashley Semones: I spend half my day with KCH Richmond Road clinics and half my day with Easter Seals (a local nonprofit for children and adults with special health care needs). For the clinics, organizing the Halloween trick-or-treat trail and clinic Christmas market were wonderful holiday events. For Easter Seals, watching kids take their first steps, learn to talk, and daily hugs and smiles. Kids are so amazing, and I am so proud of these kids.

March is Child Life Month, a time to recognize the profound impact of child life specialists on young patients and their families. Their work extends far beyond the walls of a hospital room, turning fear into confidence, uncertainty into strength and hospital stays into opportunities for healing and growth. Through their dedication, every child feels seen, heard and supported when it matters most.

Child life specialists rely on community support to bring comfort and joy to young patients. Learn more about how to support the Child Life Program through monetary or in-kind donations.

Aurora Public Schools is partnering with Community College of Aurora to launch the state's first health science high school. Aurora voters approved a bond in 2024 that will fund the project. The school will prepare students for careers in health care and address the growing demand for health care workers.

The magnet school, which doesn't have a name yet, will give students a head start in the workforce by offering hands-on experiences and college-level courses. Lisa Adams, Ed.D., the director of Career and Technical Education (CTE) at APS, says this health science high school is the first of its kind in Colorado.

The program is especially important now, as the health care sector continues to face challenges related to workforce shortages, particularly after the pandemic.

"There are about 50,000 health care worker positions available right now, including a deficit of 10,000 registered nurses," Adams explained. "This school is part of our effort to bridge that gap."

The school's curriculum will provide students with the opportunity to explore various health care fields before they graduate. Programs offered will include nursing, behavioral health, medical imaging (X-ray focus), respiratory therapy and surgical technology.

"We are really excited about this project because we understand that students are asking for more hands-on learning, particularly in health care," Adams explained. "What could be better than upskilling our students, preparing our students for their future, but also upskilling the community?"

Each pathway is built to include concurrent enrollment in college-level courses through a partnership with the Community College of Aurora (CCA). Students will have the chance to earn college credits and industry certifications that are stackable and transferable to further education or immediate employment.

Through collaboration with UCHealth, students will receive hands-on training in these fields.

David Mafe, chief diversity officer and vice president of human resources at UCHealth, says this approach will prepare students for health care fields that serve Aurora and its surrounding communities.

"Students will not just learn the theory behind health care, they will have the chance to work directly with medical professionals in real-world environments, including simulation labs and clinical settings," Mafe explained.

The school will be located near North Middle School. Its proximity to UCHealth will allow students to gain experience through onsite opportunities.

Students who complete the program may have the opportunity to work for UCHealth, where they could benefit from the Ascend program, a debt-free education program that helps employees continue their education while working in health care.

Once fully operational, the school is expected to graduate around 120 students annually, offering the community a steady pipeline of qualified, industry-ready workers.

The health science high school is set to open in 2027.    

"Our hope is to be able to hire as many of them as we possibly can," Mafe said. "We need workforce pipelines. We need people who are excited about this work, and this is exactly the demographic that we need in our organization."
