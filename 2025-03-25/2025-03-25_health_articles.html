A research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) on January 31, 2025, titled "Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 modulates retinal immune cells, vascularity and proteolytic activity in aged mice."

The study found that blocking an inflammatory receptor called CysLTR1 in the retinas of aging mice improved retinal health.

Age-related vision problems are a growing concern worldwide, and inflammation plays a key role in damaging the retina over time.


Researchers treated aged mice with montelukast (MTK), a drug commonly used for asthma, which specifically blocks CysLTR1. The oral treatment lasted eight weeks and results were compared with both untreated aged mice and healthy young mice.

After treatment, the older mice showed major improvements in retinal health.


One key finding was a reduction in immune cells called microglia, which tend to increase with age and contribute to chronic inflammation in the retina.

With CysLTR1 blocked, the number of these immune cells dropped significantly, suggesting reduced retinal inflammation. Lower inflammation is linked to a lower risk of age-related eye diseases like macular degeneration.


"The reduction in immune cells caused by Cysltr1 suppression may dampen neuroinflammation, a known promoter of tissue aging."

Another important result was the restoration of blood vessel function.

The tiny blood vessels in the retina had narrowed in aging mice, reducing blood flow and oxygen supply to the eye. MTK treatment increased the diameter of these vessels, improving circulation and possibly helping the retina work more efficiently.


The study also indicated that blocking CysLTR1 helped boost the retina's natural ability to clear out waste proteins.

As we age, this cleaning process slows down, allowing harmful material to build up in the eye. After treatment, the aged mice had stronger proteasome activity-the system responsible for breaking down cellular waste-and fewer signs of waste accumulation.


Importantly, the treatment did not harm retinal nerve cells, which are essential for vision.

This evidence indicates that the therapy was not only effective but also safe.


While more research is needed to confirm these results in humans, this study highlights the potential of repurposing MTK to protect against age-related vision decline.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Most Comprehensive Model of the Brain's Metabolism, Incorporating More Than 16,800 Biochemical Interactions, Has Identified Key Targets To Reverse The Age-Related Decline In Brain Function.

The New Analysis of Complex Interactions Between Neuronal Activity, Metabolism, and Blood Flow Found That Restoring Blood Chemistry to Youthful Levels Through Diet, Exercise, and Supplements Could Improve The Brain's Resilience To Damage. Scientists Can Now Use This Model to Find Ways To Prevent Age-Related Diseases, Such As Dementia.

A New Open-Source Model of Brain Metabolism-The Most Complex Ever Generated-Has Shown How Altering Key Chemicals Could Restore Aged Cells To Their Youthful Activity and Resilience.

The Researchers, Writing in Frontiers in Science, Found That Reduction Blood Glucose, As Well As Increasing Blood Ketone and Lactate Levels, Could Help Restore Metabolic Function In Aging Brains. Potentially, These Could All Be Achieved Through Lifestyle Changes, Including Exercise and The Food We Eat.

Scientists Can Now Use This Open-Source Model to Find Ways To Prevent Age-Related Diseases, Such As Dementia.

This Study Provides an X-Ray View Into The Battery That Powers The Brain. We can now track how the energy system of the brain ages at the molecular level. 

Youthful Resilience

The Detailed Simulation - An Analysis of Complex Interactions Between Neuronal Activity, Metabolism, and Blood Flow - Is Based On Data From Human and Rodent Brains. It provides a glimpse into how Brain Metabolism Breaks Down With Age and Impair's Its Function, As Well As Identifying Actionable Potential Ways To Restore Youthful Resilience.

To understand the impact of aging on the brain's metabolism, the team included these elements in their model, which they used to compare the metabolic states of young and aged brains. In all, they calculated the impact of age-related changes on 16,800 interactions between proteins and chemicals Across Neurons, Glia, and the Blood.

The Model Revealed That Changes In The Amounts of Certain Molecules Can Have Complex Knock-On Effects, Affecting Many Different Metabolic Reactions At Once. This meant the cells were more vulnerable to damage as they were less ABLE TO ADAPT AND RECOVER.

IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED PARTIFICAL DRUG TARGETS, AS WELL AS The Potential Benefit of Supplementing With Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) - A Molecule That Plays A Vital Role In The Brain's Energy Supply. Nad-boosting supplements have been previously studied as a potential healthy aging therapy.

Dr Polina Shichkova, The Lead Author of the Frontiers in Science Study, Said: "We were Surprised by the InterDepENDCIES of Molecular Reactions, Tight Regulation, and Signaling Within This System. We Showed How The Fragility of Brain Metabolism Results From The Collapse of Metabolic Pathways."

A Discovery Beyond Lifestyle Factors

The Discovery Allowed the Team to Understand The Complex Molecular Mechanisms That Determine The Robustness, Flexibility, and Adaptability of the Aging Brain. By altering the Amounts of Key Chemicals, The Researchers Found That The Aged Cells Were Restored To Their Youthful Activity and Resilience.

The Model Will Be Available on the Open Brain Platform Hosted by the Open Brain Institute, Allowing Neuroscientists To Run Simulation Based On The Research.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/New-insights-into-therapy-resistance-in-breast-cancer.aspx'>New insights into therapy resistance in breast cancer</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 00:00:00 <p>
A review article published in Oncotarget, titled "Signaling pathway dysregulation in breast cancer," was released on March 13, 2025.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While many patients respond to treatment at first, some cancers return or stop responding.

The review explores how signaling disruptions inside tumor cells are often behind these setbacks.

The authors discuss several major pathways involved in breast cancer, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, HER2, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, NF-κB, and the DNA damage response (DDR).

These pathways help control cell growth, division, DNA repair, and survival. When altered by mutations or other changes, they can promote tumor progression and resistance to treatment.

One of the most disrupted pathways is PI3K/Akt/mTOR. It plays a central role in cell growth, but in many breast cancers-especially hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive types-it becomes overactive due to gene mutations, or the loss of a tumor-suppressing protein called PTEN.

"Up to 25–40% of BC cases exhibit variations that hyperactivate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, underscoring its critical role in oncogenesis."

Another key pathway, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, can also promote tumor growth. Even without mutations, it may become active when primary pathways are blocked, particularly in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers.

The review highlights several new and emerging treatments aimed at blocking down these signaling pathways.

Some drugs are already approved, while others are in clinical trials. The authors suggest that combining different treatments may help stop multiple pathways at once, making it harder for cancer cells to adapt.

Matching treatments to each tumor's unique genetic changes could also improve patient outcomes.

This comprehensive review gives researchers and clinicians a clearer understanding of how breast cancer resists treatment and where future therapies should focus.

A better understanding of these disrupted signaling systems could lead to more personalized and effective treatments for patients facing aggressive or recurring disease.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/Blocking-Piezo2-may-offer-a-new-therapeutic-approach-for-pulmonary-fibrotic-diseases.aspx'>Blocking Piezo2 may offer a new therapeutic approach for pulmonary fibrotic diseases</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 00:00:00 <p>
Pulmonary fibrotic diseases are a group of conditions that cause significant morbidity and sometimes mortality. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating progressive fibrotic lung disease with a median survival of 2.9 years from diagnosis.

Lung fibrosis results in dramatic mechanical changes including increased stiffness in the tissue that cells can sense and respond to, making it difficult for the lungs to expand and contract properly during breathing.


Piezo channels are a newly discovered receptor that are sensitive to mechanical signals. Since the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. Ardem Patapoutian for the discovery of Piezo channels in 2010, interest has increased in their role in tissue homeostasis and disease outside of neuronal signaling.


A group of researchers investigated the role of Piezo2 in pulmonary fibrosis using donor tissue from patients with IPF, mouse models of lung fibrosis, cell culture investigation of lung cells (fibroblasts) that create the fibrosis lesions, and by examining publicly available RNAseq datasets from other research groups.

Investigators found that: 

Piezo2 is highly expressed in human lung tissue from patients with IPF and in multiple (different) mouse models of lung fibrosis. Piezo2 is highly expressed in primary human lung fibroblasts in culture, the cells that are believed to play key roles in producing fibrosis in tissues (by proliferating and laying down matrix proteins, creating scar-like features).

Lung fibroblasts grown on stiffer substrates are reprogrammed to be more profibrotic, by proliferating, producing extra matrix proteins, and differentiating to scar-forming myofibroblasts. Inhibition of Piezo2 with either RNA silencing or a peptide inhibitor, to prevent them from sensing the stiffness of their environment, reduces profibrotic programming.

Lead investigator Patricia J. Sime, MD, Division of Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, says, "We are excited to report that this research that suggests inhibiting expression or function of Piezo2 could be a potential new therapeutic route to treating lung fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases."

Despite the introduction of nintedanib and pirfenidone for therapy of some fibrotic lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis can remain challenging to effectively treat. This is in part because lung cells can be driven to a profibrotic phenotype by multiple pathways that reinforce each other, so that targeting one pathway alone may not be effective to slow or stop disease progression.

First author Margaret A.T. Freeberg, PhD, Division of Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, continues, "Some types of lung fibrosis have been very difficult to treat. For example, IPF is a form of pulmonary fibrosis that often progresses."

Dr. Sime concludes, "This research identifies mechanical forces and a new specific target (Piezo2) that we can block to prevent fibrotic reprogramming of some lung cells."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), a member of the phosphodiesterase superfamily, has highly important roles in cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways and a variety of skin disorders.

Blocking PDE4 activity with PDE4 inhibitors increases intracellular cAMP levels and effectively relieves the skin inflammatory phenotype of psoriasis. However, traditional PDE4 inhibitors may cause adverse effects such as gastrointestinal reactions.

Natural products typically exhibit safety profiles and structural novelty, which are particularly advantageous for drug discovery. LW, a derivative of the natural product Moracin M, was found to have favorable PDE4 inhibitory activity (PDE4 IC 50 = 54 nM). Examination of LW in psoriasis treatment demonstrated good anti-inflammatory effects in cellular models.

In an imiquimod-induced mouse model, LW treatment markedly improved psoriatic symptoms, as evidenced by increased PASI scores and ameliorated skin pathology. Moreover, LW significantly downregulated inflammatory factors in the serum and alleviated spleen damage. Therefore, LW has substantial therapeutic potential, through effectively decreasing inflammatory factor levels and ameliorating psoriatic skin phenotypes. These findings support LW as a potential candidate compound for developing new psoriasis treatments.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/New-trial-aims-to-make-rectal-cancer-more-responsive-to-radiation.aspx'>New trial aims to make rectal cancer more responsive to radiation</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 00:00:00 <p>
City of Hope, a leading cancer research and treatment organization, has opened a phase 1 trial to transform rectal cancer from a radiation-resistant disease to one that can be cured using radiation and chemotherapy.

Many cancers are cured through radiation therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy, including prostate, head and neck, lung, cervical, and anal cancers. For patients who are eligible for a watch-and-wait approach, improving the efficacy of radiation may improve quality of life.


Papaverine is an investigational drug that sensitizes tumor cells to radiation therapy by blocking oxygen consumption in tumor cells. Researchers will test if papaverine can raise oxygen content in tumors and maximize destruction while preventing or prolonging the need for rectal cancer surgery.

City of Hope's DINOMITE trial has a primary goal of determining the side effect profile and most effective dose of papaverine when given with radiation therapy to patients with locally advanced but non-metastatic rectal cancer.


The ultimate goal in this trial is to improve radiation therapy by sensitizing tumors, not normal organs and tissues, to radiation therapy. Patients with localized rectal cancer may no longer need surgery if this approach is successful.

March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and rectal cancer constitutes about a third of colorectal cancer cases.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Scientists at deCODE genetics have revealed associations between bipolar disorder and rare loss-of-function variants in two genes.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings, bouts of mania or hypomania, and episodes of depression. It is a highly heritable and serious condition, that when untreated comes with a high suicide rate.


Significant progress has occurred over the last 15 years through genome-wide association studies leading to the identification of hundreds of biomarkers, i.e. DNA sequence variants, associated with the risk of psychiatric disease, including bipolar disorder.

The scientists performed a variant burden analysis for bipolar disorder using gene-based aggregation of LOF variants in whole genome sequencing data from Iceland and the UK Biobank and used data from the Bipolar Exomes study (BipEx) for replication and further meta-analysis efforts.


The study revealed the association of LOF variants in two genes, HECTD2 and AKAP11, with bipolar disorder. Both associations with bipolar disorder are novel, but AKAP11 has previously been associated with psychosis and schizophrenia.

AKAP11 encodes an anchoring protein that regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) bind to, leading to confinement of PKA to specific cellular locations. HECTD2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that adds multiple ubiquitin groups to proteins, thereby labeling them for destruction by the proteasome.

The products of both AKAP11 and HECTD2 interact with GSK3β, a protein inhibited by lithium, the most effective mood stabilizer available to treat bipolar disorder. These findings point to the dysfunction of specific cellular pathways in bipolar disorder.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/Research-identifies-pressure-sensing-protein-behind-gut-motility.aspx'>Research identifies pressure-sensing protein behind gut motility</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 00:00:00 <p>
Scientists have long known that nerve cells in the gut propel the colon to move, but exactly how these intestinal nerve cells do their job has remained elusive.

For more than a century, researchers have studied the role of enteric neurons - nerve cells contained completely within the intestines - in driving peristalsis, the movement of food through the intestines. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon has been unclear.

A new study led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has identified the mechanism behind gut motility. The study, funded by the NIH, found that a pressure-sensing protein called PIEZO1 plays a key role in coordinating intestinal movements and keeping inflammation in check.

The researchers used experiments in mice to demonstrate that PIEZO1 acts as a pressure sensor, helping regulate gut movement. They found that the protein is highly active in excitatory gut neurons - those responsible for triggering muscle contractions in the intestine.

Genetically modified mice were created to express glowing green PIEZO1-producing neurons. The results confirmed that the protein was abundant in these cells and played a key role in controlling gut movement.

The team tested mouse intestinal tissue under varying pressure conditions and found that the intestines contracted when pressure increased, but failed to contract without Piezo1. This suggests that PIEZO1 acts as a pressure sensor, helping regulate gut movement.

Researchers also used genetically modified mice whose gut neurons could be altered by light. When Piezo1-expressing neurons were activated by light, the mice expelled a small glass bead from their intestines twice as fast as normal mice.

Exercise has long been known to speed up bowel movement, and the researchers tested how the loss of Piezo1 might affect intestinal motility in mice. Running on a treadmill increased waste transit through the intestines in mice with functional Piezo1 genes.

However, mice whose Piezo1 gene was turned off had no such increase in intestinal motility, suggesting the gene senses the increased intestinal pressure from exercise. The researchers also created mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and found that mice with IBD whose guts had intact Piezo1 produced a bowel movement more quickly.

Mice without working Piezo1 lost more weight and gradually lost the layer of protective intestinal mucus and mucus-making cells that shield the walls of the colon. The worsened inflammation in these mice appeared to be due to the loss of acetylcholine, which is responsible for nerve signaling and smooth muscle movement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
