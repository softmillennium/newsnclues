The study, led by first author and corresponding author Andreas Koller from the University Hospital of the Paracelsus Medical University, found that blocking an inflammatory receptor called CysLTR1 in the retinas of aging mice improved retinal health. These findings suggest a new approach to slowing age-related vision loss and protecting eye health in older adults.

Age-related vision problems are a growing concern worldwide, and inflammation plays a key role in damaging the retina over time. The retina is the part of the eye that captures light and sends visual signals to the brain, making it vital for clear eyesight. In this study, scientists focused on the CysLTR1 receptor, which is known to promote inflammation and is found in high amounts in the retina. They explored whether blocking this receptor could reduce the harmful effects of aging in the eye.

To achieve this, researchers treated aged mice with montelukast (MTK), a drug commonly used for asthma, which specifically blocks CysLTR1. The oral treatment lasted eight weeks and results were compared with both untreated aged mice and healthy young mice. After treatment, the older mice showed major improvements in retinal health.

One key finding was a reduction in immune cells called microglia, which tend to increase with age and contribute to chronic inflammation in the retina. With CysLTR1 blocked, the number of these immune cells dropped significantly, suggesting reduced retinal inflammation. Lower inflammation is linked to a lower risk of age-related eye diseases like macular degeneration.

""The reduction in immune cells caused by Cysltr1 suppression may dampen neuroinflammation, a known promoter of tissue aging.""

Another important result was the restoration of blood vessel function. The tiny blood vessels in the retina had narrowed in aging mice, reducing blood flow and oxygen supply to the eye. MTK treatment increased the diameter of these vessels, improving circulation and possibly helping the retina work more efficiently.

The study also indicated that blocking CysLTR1 helped boost the retina's natural ability to clear out waste proteins. As we age, this cleaning process slows down, allowing harmful material to build up in the eye. After treatment, the aged mice had stronger proteasome activity-the system responsible for breaking down cellular waste-and fewer signs of waste accumulation.

Importantly, the treatment did not harm retinal nerve cells, which are essential for vision. This evidence indicates that the therapy was not only effective but also safe.

While more research is needed to confirm these results in humans, this study highlights the potential of repurposing MTK to protect against age-related vision decline. Because it is already an approved drug, testing it for age-related eye diseases like macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy could move forward more quickly. Blocking inflammation and supporting the eye's natural cleaning systems may be a promising new way to preserve healthy vision in aging populations.",news-medical

Youthful Resilience

The Detailed Simulation - An Analysis of Complex Interactions Between Neuronal Activity, Metabolism, and Blood Flow - Is Based On Data From Human and Rodent Brains. It provides a glimpse into how Brain Metabolism Breaks Down With Age and Impair's Its Function, As Well As Identifying Actionable Potential Ways To Restore Youthful Resilience. We Place Heavy Demands On Our Brain's Neurons To Navigate Our Everyday Lives. This has a lot of Energy and Support, which comes from the Blood Supply and Supporting 'Glial' Cells Called Astrocytes.

To understand the impact of aging on the brain's metabolism, the team included these elements in their model, which they used to compare the metabolic states of young and aged brains. In all, they calculated the impact of age-related changes on 16,800 interactions between proteins and chemicals Across Neurons, Glia, and the Blood. The Model Revealed That Changes In The Amounts of Certain Molecules Can Have Complex Knock-On Effects, Affecting Many Different Metabolic Reactions At Once. This meant the cells were more vulnerable to damage as they were less ABLE TO ADAPT AND RECOVER.

IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED PARTIFICAL DRUG TARGETS, AS WELL AS The Potential Benefit of Supplementing With Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) - A Molecule That Plays A Vital Role In The Brain's Energy Supply. Nad-boosting supplements have been previously studied as a potential healthy aging therapy.

Dr Polina Shichkova, The Lead Author of the Frontiers in Science Study, Said: ""We were Surprised by the InterDepENDCIES of Molecular Reactions, Tight Regulation, and Signaling Within This System. We Showed How The Fragility of Brain Metabolism Results From The Collapse of Metabolic Pathways, Not on a finding that calls for multiple target therapies. ""

https://news-medical.net,New insights into therapy resistance in breast cancer,https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/New-insights-into-therapy-resistance-in-breast-cancer.aspx,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A new review was published in Oncotarget, Volume 16, on March 13, 2025, titled ""Signaling pathway dysregulation in breast cancer.""



In this review article, Dinara Ryspayeva and colleagues from Brown University provide a detailed look at how breast cancer cells change the way they communicate and grow-helping tumors survive, spread, and resist treatment. The review highlights how certain gene mutations and disrupted signaling pathways influence therapy response across different types of breast cancer. It also outlines current treatment strategies and clinical trials, offering insights that could improve care for patients with aggressive or hard-to-treat cancers.



Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While many patients respond to treatment at first, some cancers return or stop responding. The review explores how signaling disruptions inside tumor cells are often behind these setbacks.

The authors discuss several major pathways involved in breast cancer, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, HER2, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, NF-κB, and the DNA damage response (DDR). These pathways help control cell growth, division, DNA repair, and survival. When altered by mutations or other changes, they can promote tumor progression and resistance to treatment.



One of the most disrupted pathways is PI3K/Akt/mTOR. It plays a central role in cell growth, but in many breast cancers-especially hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive types-it becomes overactive due to gene mutations, or the loss of a tumor-suppressing protein called PTEN.

""Up to 25–40% of BC cases exhibit variations that hyperactivate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, underscoring its critical role in oncogenesis.""

Another key pathway, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, can also promote tumor growth. Even without mutations, it may become active when primary pathways are blocked, particularly in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers.



The review also highlights several new and emerging treatments aimed at blocking down these signaling pathways. Some drugs are already approved, while others are in clinical trials. The authors suggest that combining different treatments may help stop multiple pathways at once, making it harder for cancer cells to adapt. Matching treatments to each tumor's unique genetic changes could also improve patient outcomes.



This comprehensive review gives researchers and clinicians a clearer understanding of how breast cancer resists treatment and where future therapies should focus. A better understanding of these disrupted signaling systems could lead to more personalized and effective treatments for patients facing aggressive or recurring disease.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Blocking Piezo2 may offer a new therapeutic approach for pulmonary fibrotic diseases,https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/Blocking-Piezo2-may-offer-a-new-therapeutic-approach-for-pulmonary-fibrotic-diseases.aspx,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Researchers have found a potential new way to slow the progression of lung fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases by inhibiting the expression or function of Piezo2, a receptor that senses mechanical forces in tissues including stress, strain, and stiffness. The new study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary fibrotic diseases and identifies potential new targets and options for therapy to improve patients' outcomes.

Pulmonary fibrotic diseases are a group of conditions that cause significant morbidity and sometimes mortality. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating progressive fibrotic lung disease with a median survival of 2.9 years from diagnosis. Lung fibrosis results in dramatic mechanical changes including increased stiffness in the tissue that cells can sense and respond to, making it difficult for the lungs to expand and contract properly during breathing.

Piezo channels are a newly discovered receptor that are sensitive to mechanical signals. Since the 2021 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. Ardem Patapoutian for the discovery of Piezo channels in 2010, interest has increased in their role in tissue homeostasis and disease outside of neuronal signaling, however, little has been published on their possible role in fibrotic lung diseases. A group of researchers driven to understand how mechanical forces in lung tissue contribute to and drive pulmonary fibrosis investigated the role of Piezo2 in pulmonary fibrosis using donor tissue from patients with IPF, mouse models of lung fibrosis, cell culture investigation of lung cells (fibroblasts) that create the fibrosis lesions, and by examining publicly available RNAseq datasets from other research groups.

Investigators found that:

Piezo2 is highly expressed in human lung tissue from patients with IPF and in multiple (different) mouse models of lung fibrosis.

Piezo2 is highly expressed in primary human lung fibroblasts in culture, the cells that are believed to play key roles in producing fibrosis in tissues (by proliferating and laying down matrix proteins, creating scar-like features).

Lung fibroblasts grown on stiffer substrates are reprogrammed to be more profibrotic, by proliferating, producing extra matrix proteins, and differentiating to scar-forming myofibroblasts.

Inhibition of Piezo2 with either RNA silencing or a peptide inhibitor, to prevent them from sensing the stiffness of their environment, reduces profibrotic programming.

Lead investigator Patricia J. Sime, MD, Division of Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, says, ""We are excited to report that this research that suggests inhibiting expression or function of Piezo2 could be a potential new therapeutic route to treating lung fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases. This is especially important as there is an unmet need for additional therapies for fibrotic diseases.""

Despite the introduction of nintedanib and pirfenidone for therapy of some fibrotic lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis can remain challenging to effectively treat. This is in part because lung cells can be driven to a profibrotic phenotype by multiple pathways that reinforce each other, so that targeting one pathway alone may not be effective to slow or stop disease progression.

First author Margaret A.T. Freeberg, PhD, Division of Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, continues, ""Some types of lung fibrosis have been very difficult to treat. For example, IPF is a form of pulmonary fibrosis that often progresses. While there have been advances in therapy, the approved medications for IPF can slow, but do not always halt progression. One of the reasons that fibrosis can be difficult to effectively treat may be explained by the multiple profibrotic disease pathways that reinforce each other. Blocking Piezo2 signaling to prevent fibroblast reprogramming represents a new pathway we can target in our fight against fibrosis.""

Dr. Sime concludes, ""This research identifies mechanical forces and a new specific target (Piezo2) that we can block to prevent fibrotic reprogramming of some lung cells. We believe this points to Piezo2 as an important new therapeutic target that might (by itself or in combination with other therapies) slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in our patients. Many new investigational drugs that target pulmonary fibrosis receive orphan drug designation from the FDA, and this may accelerate development and increase interest from pharmaceutical partners.""",news-medical

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), a member of the phosphodiesterase superfamily, has highly important roles in cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways and a variety of skin disorders.

Blocking PDE4 activity with PDE4 inhibitors increases intracellular cAMP levels and effectively relieves the skin inflammatory phenotype of psoriasis. However, traditional PDE4 inhibitors may cause adverse effects such as gastrointestinal reactions. Natural products typically exhibit safety profiles and structural novelty, which are particularly advantageous for drug discovery. LW, a derivative of the natural product Moracin M, was found to have favorable PDE4 inhibitory activity (PDE4 IC 50 = 54 nM). Examination of LW in psoriasis treatment demonstrated good anti-inflammatory effects in cellular models.

In an imiquimod-induced mouse model, LW treatment markedly improved psoriatic symptoms, as evidenced by increased PASI scores and ameliorated skin pathology. Moreover, LW significantly downregulated Inflammatory factors in the serum and alleviated spleen damage. Therefore, LW has substantial therapeutic potential, through effectively decreasing inflammatory factor levels and ameliorating psoriatic skin phenotypes. These findings support LW as a potential candidate compound for developing new psoriasis treatments.",news-medical

Many cancers are cured through radiation therapy alone or radiation in combination with chemotherapy, including - but not limited to - prostate, head and neck, lung, cervical and anal cancers. For patients who are eligible for a watch-and-wait approach, improving the efficacy of radiation and avoiding the need for surgery may improve quality of life, particularly if patients receiving surgery will need a permanent colostomy and require stool to be collected in an external bag."" Terence Williams, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at City of Hope and principal investigator of the clinical trial (NCT06834126)

Papaverine is an investigational drug that was found in both preclinical and ongoing clinical trials to sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy by blocking oxygen consumption in tumor cells. The researchers will test to see if papaverine can be used in a different way to turn off oxygen consumption in the tumor cell and raise oxygen content. Since radiation works better when oxygen is present, the physician scientists believe this technique will allow for maximal tumor destruction and prevent or prolong the need for rectal cancer surgery.

City of Hope's DINOMITE trial has a primary goal of determining the side effect profile and most effective dose of papaverine when given with radiation therapy to patients with rectal cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) but that has not spread beyond the pelvis.

Surgery would be reserved for patients whose tumors recur in the pelvis after radiation and chemotherapy.

The ultimate goal in this trial will be to improve radiation therapy in a way that sensitizes tumors, but not normal organs and tissues, to radiation therapy and prevent patients with localized rectal cancer from needing surgery.

City of Hope experts are leveraging a discovery made in the laboratory, building upon recent work in Dr. Williams' lab and prior work at a colleague's lab. City of Hope is a leading institution known for its ""bench to bedside"" approach to translational medicine, rapidly moving research from the lab to clinical trials and patient care.

March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and rectal cancer constitutes about a third of colorectal cancer. Innovations in radiation oncology to make radiation work more effectively, such as the approach to be tested in this trial, could prevent the need for patients to undergo a life-changing surgery.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Scientists find links between bipolar disorder and rare loss-of-function variants in two genes,https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/Scientists-find-links-between-bipolar-disorder-and-rare-loss-of-function-variants-in-two-genes.aspx,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Scientists at deCODE genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen, reveal today in Nature Genetics associations between bipolar disorder and rare loss-of-function variants in two genes.

Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings, bouts of mania or hypomania, and episodes of depression. It is a highly heritable and serious condition, that when untreated comes with a high suicide rate. While there are several mood-stabilizing drugs available to treat the disorder, pharmaceutical treatment of bipolar disorder can have difficult side-effects and better treatments are urgently needed.

Significant progress has occurred over the last 15 years through genome-wide association studies leading to the identification of hundreds of biomarkers, i.e. DNA sequence variants, associated with the risk of psychiatric disease, including bipolar disorder. These biomarkers represent common variations each carrying a small risk, but in confluence, they are beginning to account for a considerable part of the variance in psychiatric traits and disorders. Variants predicted to cause loss of function of genes tend to be rare but hold great promise for informing on the underlying biology.

To harness the information contained in rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants, the scientists performed a variant burden analysis for bipolar disorder using gene-based aggregation of LOF variants in whole genome sequencing data from Iceland and the UK Biobank and using data from the Bipolar Exomes study (BipEx, www.bipex.broadinstitute.org/results) for replication and further meta-analysis efforts. The study revealed the association of LOF variants in two genes (HECTD2 and AKAP11) with bipolar disorder. Both associations with bipolar disorder are novel, but AKAP11 has previously been associated with psychosis and schizophrenia.



AKAP11 encodes an anchoring protein, that regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA) bind to, leading to confinement of PKA to specific cellular locations. HECTD2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that adds multiple ubiquitin groups to proteins, thereby labeling them for destruction by the proteasome. The products of both AKAP11 and HECTD2 interact with GSK3β, a protein inhibited by lithium, the most effective mood stabilizer available to treat bipolar disorder. These findings point to the dysfunction of specific cellular pathways in bipolar disorder and cast the gene products of AKAP11 and HECTD2 along with GSK3β as promising targets in the search for new treatments for bipolar disorder.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Research identifies pressure-sensing protein behind gut motility,https://news-medical.net/news/20250325/Research-identifies-pressure-sensing-protein-behind-gut-motility.aspx,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","After every meal, the intestines perform an action called peristalsis - moving food through their hollow interiors with coordinated contractions and relaxations of the smooth muscle.



For more than a century, scientists have known that nerve cells in the gut propel the colon to move, allowing the organ to perform its life-sustaining function. But exactly how these intestinal nerve cells do their job has remained elusive.



Now a new NIH-funded study led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has identified the mechanism behind this phenomenon, showing that the gut's motility is altered by exercise, pressure, and inflammation.



The study results, based on experiments in mice and published March 24 in Cell, reveal that a pressure-sensing protein called PIEZO1 - named after the Greek word for pressure and the discovery of which won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - plays a key role both in coordinating intestinal movements and keeping inflammation in this organ at bay.

If replicated in humans, the researchers said, the findings could inform the design of precision-targeted treatments that tame intestinal inflammation and treat disorders of gut motility, such as diarrhea and constipation.

Eventually, we might stimulate PIEZO1 to speed up excretion, block it to treat diarrhea, or use it as a novel target to treat intestinal inflammation in IBD patients."" Ruaidhrí Jackson, assistant professor of immunology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS and co-senior author on the study with Hongzhen Hu from the Icahn School of Medicine

These findings, Jackson added, show how the nervous and immune systems interact in the gut to maintain healthy function and protect the organ against inflammation. The results also add to a growing body of research showing that these two systems engage in a powerful interplay in various organs, including the brain, lungs, and skin.

A long-standing mystery provides an early clue

Scientists have been long fascinated by observations that the intestines can move independently without input from the central nervous system. Indeed, dissected intestines with no connection to external nerves can still do this vital work, Jackson explained.



Researchers already knew that enteric neurons - nerve cells contained completely within the intestines - interact with smooth muscle cells to drive peristalsis, but exactly what happens at the interface remained a mystery.

As an immunologist, Jackson had previously studied the role of the PIEZO1 protein in immune cells that sense the mechanical force generated by breathing. This earlier work revealed that the protein can spur inflammation in the lungs when it senses mechanical pressure.

Jackson wondered if this protein could also be somehow involved in digestive peristalsis.

To explore this idea, researchers analyzed gene activity in mouse and human gut neurons and found that the Piezo1 gene, which produces the PIEZO1 protein, is highly active in excitatory gut neurons - those responsible for triggering muscle contractions in the intestine by releasing the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which helps nerves communicate and propels muscle movement.

By genetically modifying mice so that PIEZO1-producing neurons glowed green, the researchers confirmed that the protein was, indeed, abundant in these cells.

PIEZO1 protein acts as a pressure sensor to cause gut movement

To better understand PIEZO1's exact role, the team tested mouse intestinal tissue under varying pressure conditions. In normal mice, the intestines contracted when pressure increased. However, in mice genetically altered to lack Piezo1, the tissue failed to contract under pressure, confirming that PIEZO1 acts as a pressure sensor, helping regulate gut movement.

Next, researchers used genetically modified mice whose gut neurons could be altered by light. When Piezo1-expressing neurons were activated by light, the mice expelled a small glass bead from their intestines twice as fast as normal mice. In another experiment, the researchers used chemicals to turn off Piezo1 neurons in the gut. In these mice, digestion slowed notably. Taken together, the findings confirmed that the protein plays a key role in controlling gut movement.

PIEZO1 responds to exercise and inflammation

Exercise has long been known to speed up bowel movement, Jackson said - a phenomenon often called the ""runners' runs"" by those who practice the sport. Because exercise can increase pressure on the intestines from jostling and contact with other organs, the researchers next tested how the loss of Piezo1 might affect intestinal motility in mice.



As expected, running on a treadmill increased waste transit through the intestines in mice with functional Piezo1 genes. These mice had bowel movements after just 10 minutes of exercise. However, mice whose Piezo1 gene was turned off had no such increase in intestinal motility, suggesting the gene senses the increased intestinal pressure from exercise.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is also known to increase intestinal motility due to inflammation. To test Piezo1's role in this condition, the researchers created mouse models of IBD. Mice with IBD whose guts had intact Piezo1 produced a bowel movement more quickly, compared with animals in which Piezo1 was inactivated.

Surprisingly, slower intestinal motility wasn't the only side effect from losing Piezo1 -turning off the gene also worsened IBD symptoms. Compared with mice that had intact Piezo1 genes, animals without working Piezo1 lost more weight and gradually lost the layer of protective intestinal mucus and mucus-making cells that shield the walls of the colon.



The worsened inflammation in these mice appeared to be due to the loss of the naturally occurring autoinflammatory chemical acetylcholine, which is responsible for nerve signaling and smooth muscle movement.

Not only does acetylcholine stimulate smooth muscle activity, Jackson explained, it also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Thus, he hypothesized, the inflammation caused by IBD might spur Piezo1 to cause enteric neurons to generate excess acetylcholine in an effort to tamp down inflammation - which in turn causes the increased intestinal motility characteristic of this condition. This may also explain how inflammation of the colon tends to produce diarrhea and excessive bowel movements, the researchers added.

Finding ways to modulate Piezo1 activity might eventually be used to fight IBD inflammation, Jackson said. This approach would target Piezo1 in gut neurons to release acetylcholine. This strategy would be markedly different from the way most IBD drugs work, which is by suppressing key inflammatory proteins that can render patients vulnerable to infections.

Jackson and colleagues plan to explore the design of such therapies in future work.",news-medical
