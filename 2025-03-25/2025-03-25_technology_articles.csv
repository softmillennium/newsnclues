https://techmeme.com,OpenAI rolls out image generation powered by GPT-4o to ChatGPT,https://www.theverge.com/openai/635118/chatgpt-sora-ai-image-generation-chatgpt,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","is a senior AI reporter working with The Verge’s policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.

OpenAI is integrating new image generation capabilities directly into ChatGPT starting today — this feature is dubbed “Images in ChatGPT.” Users can now use GPT-4o to generate images within ChatGPT itself.

This initial release focuses solely on image creation and will be available across ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Free subscription tiers. The free tier’s usage limit is the same as DALL-E, spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge, but added that they “didn’t have a specific number to share” and ”these may change over time based on demand.“ Per the ChatGPT FAQ, free users were previously able to generate “three images per day with DALL·E 3.” As for the fate of DALL-E, Christianson said “fans” will “still have access via a custom GPT.”

“This model is a step change above previous models,” research lead is Gabriel Goh told The Verge, adding that the team used the GPT-4o “omnimodal” — or a model that can generate any kind of data like text, image, audio, and video — foundation for this feature.

Some of the improvements Goh noted include “binding,” which refers to how well AI image generators maintain correct relationships between attributes and objects; a model with poor binding, for instance, might get a prompt for a blue star plus a red triangle and create a red star and no triangle. Most image models struggle with this, Goh said, often mixing up colors and shapes when asked to render multiple items — typically around 5 to 8. He says this new image generation tool can correctly bind attributes for 15 to 20 objects without confusion, representing a significant improvement in accuracy and reliability.

Users will also notice an improvement in text rendering, which makes it easier to generate coherent text without typos on an image (in existing tools, you’ll often notice that text gets garbled pretty easily). Getting text rendering right was a significant challenge, Goh said. If small titles or text elements have typos or errors, the entire image can become unusable.

“This was just like a process of iteration that took many, many months to get right,” Goh said. While not perfect, he said the team reached a point where the text quality is consistently usable (where it tends to blunder is really small text). “It’s been just many months of small improvements.”

The system uses an autoregressive approach — generating images sequentially from left to right and top to bottom, similar to how text is written — rather than the diffusion model technique used by most image generators (like DALL-E) that create the entire image at once. Goh speculates that this technical difference could be what gives Images in ChatGPT better text rendering and binding capabilities.

In a briefing before the feature launch, the team demonstrated several examples showing the system’s capabilities, including scientific diagrams like Newton’s prism experiment with correctly labeled components, multi-panel comics with consistent characters and text bubbles, and informational posters with accurate text. They also highlighted practical applications like creating transparent background images for stickers, restaurant menus, and logos.

“If I go to draw an image, I do so with the limitation of my own skill... but also with all of the knowledge of the world that I’ve built up,” ChatGPT multimodal product lead Jackie Shannon explained. “The model brings world knowledge to the equation, so when you ask for an image of Newton’s prism experiment, you don’t have to explain what that is to get an image back.”

The new system does take longer to generate images than before, though OpenAI suggests this is a worthwhile tradeoff. “While we certainly have room to improve on latency…the quality of these images, the capability, the world knowledge, really makes up for the additional seconds that they’ll spend waiting,” Shannon said.

OpenAI’s new image generation system doesn’t include visual watermarks or indicators showing images are AI-generated. However, Shannon explained that “all of our generated images will include standard C2PA metadata to mark the image as having been created by OpenAI” and the company “will have some internal tooling to be able to look up images as well.”

“Ultimately, no system is perfect for this type of thing, but we’re continuously improving our safeguards and we think of this as a starting point,” Shannon added. “One thing that’s true about all of the images generated from ChatGPT is that the user owns them and are free to use them within the bounds of our usage policies as they would like.”

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Instagram is rolling out a new program to fast-track moderation reports made by school districts. After a district joins the new Schools Partnership program, any post or account they flag for potentially violating Instagram’s rules will “be automatically prioritized for review.”

The school’s account will then receive notifications about the status of their report, and whether Instagram takes action on it. The partnership program is available to middle schools and high schools in the US, and it will allow them to take action against harmful content students may post.

Schools are often made aware of threats or inappropriate content posted on social media platforms, and some use monitoring programs to keep tabs on what students post online. Educational institutions will get a banner on their profile indicating that they’re part of the program, and they’ll gain access to resources to “help support educators, parents, guardians and students navigate Instagram safely.”

Instagram has been trying to get ahead of the online child safety legislation popping up across the US. Last year, Instagram moved teens into more private accounts and began using AI to scan for signals that someone might be lying about their age. It also partnered with the nonprofit organization Childhelp to develop a curriculum that teaches middle schoolers how to recognize online exploitation, including sextortion scams and grooming.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,Gemini 2.5 Pro is Google’s ‘most intelligent AI model’ with thinking built-in,https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Following updates to the models that are available for all users, Google today announced Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) for Advanced subscribers and developers. Like before, Google is doing another mid-year/model update.

Notably, all models in the Gemini 2.5 family, including futures ones, are “thinking models, capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy.” Google is “building these thinking capabilities directly into all of [its] models” to allow them to “handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.”

Compared to 2.0 Flash Thinking, which was first revealed in December and got an update this month, Google is no longer explicitly attaching the “Thinking” label. Users can “Show thinking” in the Gemini app to see the train of thought.

In the field of AI, a system’s capacity for “reasoning” refers to more than just classification and prediction. It refers to its ability to analyze information, draw logical conclusions, incorporate context and nuance, and make informed decisions.

Gemini 2.5 features a “new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training.”

Gemini 2.5 Pro (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 and codenamed “nebula”) is the first model in this family. Aimed at complex tasks, Google notes how it “tops the LMArena leaderboard — which measures human preferences — by a significant margin.” It also leads on math (AIME 2025), and science (GPQA diamond) benchmarks “without test-time techniques that increase cost, like majority voting.”

It also scores a state-of-the-art 18.8% across models without tool use on Humanity’s Last Exam, a dataset designed by hundreds of subject matter experts to capture the human frontier of knowledge and reasoning.



There’s also a focus on advanced coding with a “big leap over 2.0” and “more improvements to come.”

“2.5 Pro excels at creating visually compelling web apps and agentic code applications, along with code transformation and editing.”

“On SWE-Bench Verified, the industry standard for agentic code evals, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 63.8% with a custom agent setup.”

In addition to native multimodality, Gemini 2.5 Pro has a 1 million token context window with 2 million coming soon.

It can comprehend vast datasets and handle complex problems from different information sources, including text, audio, images, video and even entire code repositories.

Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) is rolling out first to Gemini Advanced and Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI following in the coming weeks.

We’ll also introduce pricing in the coming weeks, enabling people to use 2.5 Pro with higher rate limits for scaled production use.

In the Gemini app, it replaces last month’s 2.0 Pro (experimental) with access to apps (@Gmail, @YouTube, etc.) and file uploads.",techmeme

In addition, the company introduced its highest-priced plan at $250 per month, designed for users who need to send a large volume of messages on Poe.

Poe allows users to utilize several AI-powered bots — including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, o3-mini, ElevenLabs, and more — in one place. It operates on a point system, enabling users to spend points across different models, with each bot having its own point cost per message.

Under the new $5/month plan, users can spend up to 10,000 points per day. In contrast, the $250/month tier offers 12.5 million points, which the company says is better for more “expensive” models, such as GPT-4.5, OpenAI’s o1-pro, and Google DeepMind’s Veo 2.

By popular demand, we are introducing two new subscription options today, at $5/month and $250/month. These align Poe with two simultaneous trends in AI: normal models are getting cheaper and the most advanced models are getting more expensive. (1/5) pic.twitter.com/1sUqOMdWfs — Poe (@poe_platform) March 25, 2025

With the introduction of these two new subscription plans, users now have a wider variety of options, which the company says was highly requested.

Previously, the least expensive tier was $20 per month, which provided 1 million points. A free plan is also available, but users can only ask a limited number of questions each day.

But she was able to find a transplant match “because a stranger was scrolling on TikTok.”

Thanks to that stranger’s kidney, she continued, she was here today. “For some people, having TikTok has literally been life saving,” the company wrote in a caption punctuated by a tearful smiling emoji.

The messages are part of a new ad blitz from TikTok, the popular social media app owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance. The campaign frames TikTok as a savior of Americans and a champion of small businesses as the app hurtles toward an April 5 deadline to sell the company to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the United States. President Trump, who paused a federal law demanding TikTok’s sale because of national security concerns related to its ties to China, has said he will give the app more time for a deal if needed.

But TikTok does not appear to be taking any chances.

In the past couple of months, the company has wallpapered Washington in marketing; bought wraparound ads in the print editions of The New York Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times; and poured money into national commercials. (Continuing the theme of saving lives, TikTok’s ads have also featured a creator who sells a product that helps with administering CPR.)",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,Napster pioneered music sharing over 25 years ago. It just got bought for $207 million,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/napster-pioneered-music-sharing-25-years-ago-bought-for-207-million-.html,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A quarter century ago, Napster was notorious on the internet for allowing people to swap songs for free, long before the music industry had come up with a model for the digital age.

The service was shuttered in 2001 amid mounting legal battles, and filed for bankruptcy the following year. But the brand isn't dead.

On Tuesday, Napster was acquired by 3D technology company Infinite Reality for $207 million. Infinite Reality CEO John Acunto told CNBC in an interview that the one-time file-sharing phenomenon will be used for marketing in the metaverse.

Infinite Reality plans to create virtual 3D spaces that allow music fans to enjoy concerts or listening parties together, and let musicians or labels sell physical and virtual merchandise.

""When we think about clients who have audiences — influencers, creators — I think it's very important that they have a connected space that's around music and musical communities,"" Acunto said. ""We just don't see anybody in the streaming space creating spaces for music.""

Napster is the latest iconic technology brand from decades past to get a new life, following acquisitions and revivals in recent years of Kodak, Nokia and luxury audio brand McIntosh.

""I think there's no better name than Napster to disrupt,"" Acunto said.

Napster was launched in 1999 by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, and became the first significant peer-to-peer file-sharing application. It allowed PC users to swap MP3 files, which could be played in a media player like Winamp, and build collections of digital popular music for free.

The record industry quickly took aim at Napster, accusing the company of allowing people to share pirated files. Heavy metal band Metallica sued Napster, and was followed by the Recording Industry Association of America. After bankruptcy, Napster's assets were sold off to a series of owners, current CEO Jon Vlassopulos told CNBC.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Producing wafers at TSMC Arizona is only 10% more expensive than in Taiwan: TechInsights,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/producing-wafers-at-tsmc-arizona-is-only-10-percent-more-expensive-than-in-taiwan-techinsights,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:16:35 GMT","Comments made by TSMC founder Morris Chang about high fab building costs in Arizona and higher operating costs in the U.S. created the impression that producing chips in America is way too expensive to be financially viable. However, analysts from TechInsights believe that this is not the case. According to the firm's recent study, the costs of wafers at TSMC's Fab 21 near Phoenix, Arizona, are only about 10% higher than those of similar wafers processed in Taiwan.

""It costs TSMC less than 10% more to process a 300mm wafer in Arizona than the same wafer made in Taiwan,"" wrote G. Dan Hutcheson from TechInsights.

While it definitely costs more to build a fab in the U.S. than in Taiwan, TSMC's cost was significantly higher because it built its first overseas fab in decades at a brand-new site with a new, sometimes unskilled workforce, according to Hutcheson. According to other people familiar with the fab-building process, it does not cost twice as much to build a fab in the USA than in Taiwan.

The dominant factor of semiconductor production cost is the cost of equipment, which contributes well over two-thirds of overall wafer expenses. Tools made by leading companies like ASML, Applied Materials, KLA, Lam Research, or Tokyo Electron cost the same amount of money in Taiwan and the U.S.; they effectively neutralize location-based cost differences.

A major source of confusion about wafer prices comes from labor costs. Wages in the U.S. are roughly triple those in Taiwan, which many mistakenly take as a significant factor in chip production. However, with the advanced automation of today's wafer fabrication facilities, labor accounts for less than 2% of the total cost, according to TechInsights's wafer cost model. Based on this model, the overall expense gap between operating costs of a fab in Arizona and Taiwan is minimal despite big differences in salaries and other local costs.

It should be noted that wafers that TSMC currently produces at Fab 21 travel back to Taiwan to get diced, tested, and packaged. Some of them then go to China or elsewhere to be put into actual devices; some will travel back to the U.S., though. Therefore, their logistics are somewhat more complicated than those of typical wafers processed in Taiwan. However, this hardly dramatically adds to costs, and TSMC now plans to build packaging capacity in the U.S. Nonetheless, TSMC is rumored to charge a 30% premium for chips made in the U.S.",techmeme

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Waymo announced that Washington, DC will be its next robotaxi city. The company aims to launch its Waymo One ridehailing service in the nation’s capitol in 2026 — though it acknowledged that it will first need to change the city law prohibiting fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers.

Currently, companies that want to test autonomous vehicles in DC are required to have a human driver behind the steering wheel in case something goes wrong. Tech advocates have been pressing the city council to loosen the restrictions to allow fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. A spokesperson for the DC transportation department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year. A Waymo product manager told a local news outlet that the company was primarily focused on neighborhoods like Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, and Penn Quarter. Waymo has not commented on the size of its service area nor which neighborhoods it is targeting if it launches next year.

The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year.

Launching a robotaxi service in the heart of the federal government is a risky move. The feds have largely taken a back seat in regulating autonomous vehicles, leaving it to the states to develop their own rulebooks for safe deployment. Legislation that would dramatically increase the number of AVs on the road has been stalled in Congress for over seven years, with lawmakers at odds over a range of issues, including safety, liability, and the right number of exemptions from federal motor vehicle safety standards.

But beyond that, DC is its own city with its own transportation challenges. It has some of the worst traffic congestion in the US thanks to an ever-expanding population and stagnate infrastructure. Waymo hasn’t said how many vehicles it intends to bring to DC.

Waymo currently operates its driverless ridehailing vehicles in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. It recently launched a partnership with Uber in Austin, and it plans to expand that deal to Atlanta later this year. It also plans to operate robotaxis in Silicon Valley and Miami.

In DC, customers will use the company’s ridehail app, Waymo One, to summon driverless vehicles. Waymo currently provides 200,000 passenger trips a week using the app.

DC has seen some autonomous testing before. Cruise, General Motors’ now-defunct AV subsidiary, tested several of its vehicles there. Another defunct company, Ford-backed Argo AI, has also previously tested autonomous vehicles in the district.",techmeme

A friend cautioned that at least one of the group members might rat him out for warning the new administration would gut his agency.

So Kamens started inviting colleagues, one by one, to join him in a group chat on Signal, a messaging app known for its security and privacy. Weeks later, and after being fired from his cybersecurity post, he is in eight private Signal groups with current and former federal workers, where they discuss who’s losing their jobs, trade messages of support and organize appeals to their firings.

“I’m not sure there is any government worker right now who isn’t talking to their colleagues on Signal,” Kamens said.

Two months into the Trump administration, there’s a sweeping shift underway in Washington as federal workers — and some high-level administration officials — migrate their correspondence to Signal in a zeal for secrecy. On Monday, the Atlantic magazine’s top editor said he was accidentally added to a Signal group in which U.S. officials planned a recent military attack in Yemen.

Until now, Signal was mostly known among Silicon Valley geeks and global dissidents for leaving few digital traces. It was lightly used among federal bureaucrats until they embraced it after Trump’s return to office as a tactic to shield communications, according to interviews with more than two dozen government workers — most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation — and people they have consulted for advice.

These new government users have corresponded with a jolt in the popularity of Signal, which is operated by a nonprofit. The app has been downloaded more than 2.7 million times in the United States so far this year, a 36 percent increase from the same period in 2024, according to estimates from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

The changes mark a cultural transformation for federal government officials, employees and the public they serve: Adopting Signal and other surveillance-dodging tactics of spies and billionaires comes at the potential loss of a real-time history of the Trump administration.

Lauren Harper, who leads efforts for a more transparent federal government at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said Americans will never have a full accounting of the policies made in their interests when officials and workers communicate in private channels that are closed off to U.S. citizens.

When you have “secrecy on each side,” Harper said, “the public has no way to understand what is happening inside the government.”

Government employees’ communications have for decades been dictated by federal records laws and ethics rules. Using private email accounts, personal cellphones and unofficial technologies such as WhatsApp and Signal could violate requirements that most government correspondence and internal communications are preserved and archived for public transparency.

Classified secrets or materials related to national security are held to an even higher standard. Communications about those matters must be transmitted only on the most secure government networks to minimize the possibility of disastrous leaks or cyberattacks.

Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server when she was secretary of state engulfed her 2016 presidential campaign and triggered an FBI investigation into what the bureau’s director, James B. Comey, said at the time was her “extremely careless” handling of classified information.

Pete Hegseth, now the Trump administration’s defense secretary, chastised Clinton’s email habits when he was a commentator on Fox’s TV networks. “Everyone knows what top secret means. … If you’re hiding that on a private server, that’s a very real problem, and likely criminal charges [should] follow,” he said.

In his account of the Yemen attack planning, the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg said a Signal user called “Pete Hegseth” texted in the group chat details of U.S. military planning in the March 15 attack on Houthi militants, including weapons packages, targets and timing.

Signal, like Clinton’s email server, is not an approved platform for exchanging classified or secret intelligence.

Hegseth appeared to deny the validity of the thread, telling reporters late Monday, “Nobody was texting war plans.” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said in a statement that the messages are a “demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials.”

Harper said the National Security Council is required to preserve its records under a federal law, the Presidential Records Act, which official government email is designed to do but Signal is not.

“You could make the argument that if they had followed the rules, they would have a harder time accidentally looping in a reporter,” she said.

It wasn’t the first time that Signal correspondence has become a flash point for the Trump administration. Chats over Signal and other unorthodox communications by members of Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service so alarmed a federal judge that he recently ordered DOGE to hand over documents, memos and correspondence to a group that had sued for access under public transparency laws.

DOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, has said it is not legally obligated to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Signal, like Meta’s WhatsApp, scrambles the content of all messages and calls. This process, called end-to-end encryption, prevents anyone — including hackers, law enforcement or Signal itself — from accessing what is written or said in the app. While Signal’s end-to-end encryption prevents interference, the messages are still visible at both ends, so that any phone compromised by hack or cyberattack could expose the messages. Spyware tools, such as Pegasus, can be installed without the phone owner knowing and send messages and screenshots back from the phone to the tools’ operators, avoiding Signal’s style of encryption altogether.

Signal also has a unique reputation among secrecy diehards for collecting almost no personal information about its users. That has made Signal a target of some governments around the world that argue that such encrypted apps are a danger to national security.

Those qualities have also made Signal a favorite of some Silicon Valley billionaires, including Musk.

His two-word tweeted endorsement, “Use Signal,” was partly credited for a download surge in the days after the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot and a controversial WhatsApp privacy policy change. Signal’s system to verify new users’ phone numbers temporarily crashed just after Musk’s post. Musk has previously said he uses both Signal and Apple’s iMessage.

Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

Among rank-and-file federal workers, the knowledge that their email messages, memos and other official work could be made public someday has long made them conscious of what they say. But in interviews, some federal workers said the Trump administration has reshaped their communications.

Rapid changes and the slashing of the federal workforce have made them desperate to share information with colleagues and counterparts elsewhere in the government. And more than ever, some workers say they worry that digital water cooler talk or questions about agency layoffs, return-to-office mandates and administration policies could be perceived as disloyal.

“I won’t communicate with my co-workers about anything on government platforms,” said a State Department employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation. “We are afraid we will be singled out and fired for participating in actions or rhetoric that is adverse to the administration.”

Some federal workers said they’re not using apps like Signal to conduct official government business. Rather, the app, accessed on personal phones, is one of the few remaining places where they feel they cannot be monitored in communications with family, members of the press and co-workers, according to the State Department worker and other federal employees.

When workers were asked last month to summarize five of their significant accomplishments from the past week, the State Department worker said Signal messages flew as colleagues tried to figure out whether and how to reply. Information that the agency’s leadership shares with employees tends to be overwhelmingly glowing, she said, and workers pass around more critical news articles on Signal.

Some federal workers admit they don’t know exactly what they’re afraid of — but they are afraid. “It’s exhausting and I don’t know if I’m being paranoid,” said a NASA employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing for her job.

This person recently stopped herself from posting a personal photo on social media that she worried could be interpreted as acknowledging the existence of climate change. The Trump administration has slashed regulation and federal policies aimed at reducing global warming.

A digital privacy and security advocacy group, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, fielded so many questions from government employees worried about possible Trump administration surveillance that it recently created a tip sheet on securing digital communications, said executive director Albert Fox Cahn. Using Signal is among the tips.

Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that advocates for an effective government and federal workforce, has been close to the federal government for decades and marvels at how quickly the communications norms and habits enshrined for decades have turned upside down.

“It’s a very different style of communication,” Stier said. “These are all symptoms of a workforce that has been traumatized and is deeply fearful of their bosses.”",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,Google unveils a next-gen family of AI reasoning models,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/google-unveils-a-next-gen-ai-reasoning-model/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","On Tuesday, Google unveiled Gemini 2.5, a new family of AI reasoning models that pauses to “think” before answering a question.

To kick off the new family of models, Google is launching Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, a multimodal, reasoning AI model that the company claims is its most intelligent model yet. This model will be available on Tuesday in the company’s developer platform, Google AI Studio, as well as in the Gemini app for subscribers to the company’s $20-a-month AI plan, Gemini Advanced.

Moving forward, Google says all of its new AI models will have reasoning capabilities baked in.

Since OpenAI launched the first AI reasoning model in September 2024, o1, the tech industry has raced to match or exceed that model’s capabilities with their own. Today, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, and xAI all have AI reasoning models, which use extra computing power and time to fact-check and reason through problems before delivering an answer.

Reasoning techniques have helped AI models achieve new heights in math and coding tasks. Many in the tech world believe reasoning models will be a key component of AI agents, autonomous systems that can perform tasks largely sans human intervention. However, these models are also more expensive.

Google has experimented with AI reasoning models before, previously releasing a “thinking” version of Gemini in December. But Gemini 2.5 represents the company’s most serious attempt yet at besting OpenAI’s “o” series of models.

Google claims that Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforms its previous frontier AI models, and some of the leading competing AI models, on several benchmarks. Specifically, Google says it designed Gemini 2.5 to excel at creating visually compelling web apps and agentic coding applications.

On an evaluation measuring code editing, called Aider Polyglot, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 68.6%, outperforming top AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek.

However, on another test measuring software dev abilities, SWE-bench Verified, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 63.8%, outperforming OpenAI’s o3-mini and DeepSeek’s R1, but underperforming Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which scored 70.3%.

On Humanity’s Last Exam, a multimodal test consisting of thousands of crowdsourced questions relating to mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 18.8%, performing better than most rival flagship models.

To start, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro is shipping with a 1 million token context window, which means the AI model can take in roughly 750,000 words in a single go. That’s longer than the entire “Lord of The Rings” book series. And soon, Gemini 2.5 Pro will support double the input length (2 million tokens).

https://theverge.com,"The Bambu H2D isn’t just a bigger 3D printer — it’s a laser cutter, pen plotter, and Cricut competitor too",https://theverge.com/news/634294/bambu-lab-h2d-3d-printer-laser-pen-blade-price-release-date,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

Last May, I told you how 3D printers still aren’t easy enough for the mass market, but Bambu Lab had built the easiest yet. Now, instead of making it easier, Bambu is building its biggest and most sophisticated model to date — a Swiss Army knife of 3D printers that can also cut, draw, and etch.

The new Bambu H2D, which starts at $1,899, has two 3D printing nozzles and a much bigger bed, but it also comes with a modular attachment system. Plug in a blade, and it dices through paper and vinyl. Plug in a pen, and it’ll draw logos or schematics in a flash. You can even engrave and burn laser images into all sorts of materials.

With 10-watt and 40-watt lasers, I carved out a wooden Pokémon stencil for my daughter, then turned one of her other drawings into a custom cork drink coaster. (See my embedded video!) First, Bambu’s laser gently etched the surface, then it cut out a coaster, all with one operation. I even managed to engrave a set of Apple AirTags, though I did burn one of their plastic shells trying to dial in the right settings.

Sure, you can already do these things with individual tools, and there are a handful of machines on the market that combine 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC routing into one device. But now, Bambu is about to muscle in on Cricut, GlowForge and iDraw’s turf with one machine to rule the prosumer hobbyist market. Or at least that’s the idea.

Fundamentally, the H2D works the same way as Bambu’s original printers: it has a robot gantry that moves left, right, forward and back at high speed, while a bed slowly lowers to let your print get taller as you go. (Specifically, it’s a CoreXY system.) But now, that robot gantry houses two alternating nozzles, a quick-release mount and dedicated power connector for other tools.

It makes sense: kind of like how a KitchenAid stand mixer also lets you use its rotary power to optionally spin a pasta maker or vegetable slicer attachment, why not use a 3D printer’s precise 3D motions to move pens, blades and lasers, too?

But those are optional, so let’s talk 3D printing first. You can print things fully twice as large as Bambu’s original X1 and P1 series printers (by volume) inside its 350 x 320 x 325mm build area, and the twin nozzles mean you can print in two different materials without constantly changing between those filaments and wasting some every time you do. One of Bambu’s go-to examples is an entire bicycle helmet including its padding, that you can print at once, with a strong carbon-fiber laced PETG outer shell mated to a soft TPU cushion.

Like last year’s Bambu A1 and A1 Mini, the H2D inherits easy toolless nozzle swaps, only now with nozzles designed to go up to 350 degrees Celsius and optional high-flow ones. Only the right nozzle supports TPU, but each can be connected to its own optional AMS to automatically retract and load different kinds of filament, and Bambu’s desktop app can now even tell you which rolls should go with which nozzles to minimize waste.

Speaking of AMS, the optional new four-color AMS 2 Pro, or single-color AMS HT, now have built-in heaters and electromagnetically opening and closing vents so they can dry filament too (important because many 3D printing materials absorb troublesome moisture). The AMS HT goes up to 85 degrees Celsius, the AMS 2 Pro up to 65 degrees.

The printer has autonomous vents, too, so you don’t need to open the door or remove the lid to ensure soft plastics don’t warp. And it has its own 65-degree chamber heater to keep things toasty for filaments. Everywhere I look, there are potential improvements, from a new, seemingly community-inspired dual wiper system for the nozzles, to the way its tubing is easier to connect and feeds slightly more reliably than before.

And that’s before you opt for the laser specific parts, including a set of green-tinted laser safety windows, additional cameras and flame sensors, and a big red button you can slam to quickly turn the whole thing off. I was apprehensive about heating flammable materials inside a 3D printer, especially once the printer’s touchscreen had me walk through its “Laser Terms and Conditions,” but I’ve yet to see any flame. After seeing how the printer’s own jet of air, fans, and optional fume extractor handled the heat during my first few laser operations, I feel reasonably confident.

I just don’t know how often I’d want to use a laser inside my 3D printer, and the laser left a burning smell in my garage for days even with the fume extractor at max. Plus, you (understandably) can’t start a laser or slicing operation remotely: as a precaution, Bambu makes you press a physical button on the printer and advises you to stick around. Thankfully, laser operations are much quicker than 3D printing, measured in seconds and minutes instead of hours and days.

Bambu’s “cutting module” has its own magnetic modules: a blade, and a cylindrical pen attachment that can fit various diameters. Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge

Bambu Suite is the new desktop app for laser, blade, and pen operations, and it’s a little barebones today. While you should be able to load and print community designs starting in April, the version I tried was limited to basic preset shapes, text, curved lines, QR codes, and images. You can adjust speed, laser strength or blade/pen pressure, have the printer take a photo of your materials on the bed, then overlay your project atop that photo before pressing print.

Even though I’ve had an H2D for about a month, I won’t be reviewing it anytime soon. That’s partly because there’s just so very many functions to test, but also partly because I want to give it some more time in the oven: like most 3D printers, it seems Bambu sent this one to reviewers before its functions are fully dialed in.

While Bambu’s touchscreen and software does a wonderful job easing newcomers into printing, cutting, and etching, and it’s got more cameras and algorithms than ever before (including LIDAR, timelapse, a new nozzle camera and a bird’s eye camera too), I’m actually finding its basic 3D printing modes aren’t as reliable yet as other printers I’ve used.

Bambu actually sent me a whole new printer after the first one failed tests that cheaper 3D printers easily passed; my second printer is doing far better, but I’m still getting better quality out of my old P1P. Plus, the H2D’s dual-nozzle feature isn’t working reliably for me. I did finish Bambu’s bicycle helmet after a nearly three-day print, but I won’t be able to wear it, given all the unsightly bits of carbon-fiber laced PETG sticking out and the conspicuous gaps in its TPU padding.

Here’s hoping that’s just growing pains. At the least, I’d go watch reviews from other, more experienced 3D printing enthusiasts before buying this machine.

The Bambu H2D starts at $1,899 with preorders starting in June. A $2,799 H2D combo with a 10W laser is available for pre-order today and ships at the end of April. An H2D AMS combo, meanwhile, includes the AMS 2 Pro, build plate, spool holder and accessory box. That’s in stock and available to order now. Finally, there’s a $3,499 H2D Laser Full Combo package with a 40-watt laser, cutting module, laser platform, cutting platform and emergency stop button. Pre-orders for that begin today and it ships at the end of April.",theverge
https://theverge.com,OpenAI rolls out image generation powered by GPT-4o to ChatGPT,https://theverge.com/openai/635118/chatgpt-sora-ai-image-generation-chatgpt,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","is a senior AI reporter working with The Verge’s policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.

OpenAI is integrating new image generation capabilities directly into ChatGPT starting today — this feature is dubbed “Images in ChatGPT.” Users can now use GPT-4o to generate images within ChatGPT itself.

This initial release focuses solely on image creation and will be available across ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Free subscription tiers. The free tier’s usage limit is the same as DALL-E, spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge, but added that they “didn’t have a specific number to share” and ”these may change over time based on demand.“ Per the ChatGPT FAQ, free users were previously able to generate “three images per day with DALL·E 3.” As for the fate of DALL-E, Christianson said “fans” will “still have access via a custom GPT.”

“This model is a step change above previous models,” research lead is Gabriel Goh told The Verge, adding that the team used the GPT-4o “omnimodal” — or a model that can generate any kind of data like text, image, audio, and video — foundation for this feature.

Some of the improvements Goh noted include “binding,” which refers to how well AI image generators maintain correct relationships between attributes and objects; a model with poor binding, for instance, might get a prompt for a blue star plus a red triangle and create a red star and no triangle. Most image models struggle with this, Goh said, often mixing up colors and shapes when asked to render multiple items — typically around 5 to 8. He says this new image generation tool can correctly bind attributes for 15 to 20 objects without confusion, representing a significant improvement in accuracy and reliability.

An example of Images in ChatGPT’s “binding” capabilities. OpenAI

Users will also notice an improvement in text rendering, which makes it easier to generate coherent text without typos on an image (in existing tools, you’ll often notice that text gets garbled pretty easily). Getting text rendering right was a significant challenge, Goh said. If small titles or text elements have typos or errors, the entire image can become unusable.

“This was just like a process of iteration that took many, many months to get right,” Goh said. While not perfect, he said the team reached a point where the text quality is consistently usable (where it tends to blunder is really small text). “It’s been just many months of small improvements.”

The system uses an autoregressive approach — generating images sequentially from left to right and top to bottom, similar to how text is written — rather than the diffusion model technique used by most image generators (like DALL-E) that create the entire image at once. Goh speculates that this technical difference could be what gives Images in ChatGPT better text rendering and binding capabilities.

An example of Images in ChatGPT’s ability to generate coherent text. OpenAI

In a briefing before the feature launch, the team demonstrated several examples showing the system’s capabilities, including scientific diagrams like Newton’s prism experiment with correctly labeled components, multi-panel comics with consistent characters and text bubbles, and informational posters with accurate text. They also highlighted practical applications like creating transparent background images for stickers, restaurant menus, and logos.

“If I go to draw an image, I do so with the limitation of my own skill... but also with all of the knowledge of the world that I’ve built up,” ChatGPT multimodal product lead Jackie Shannon explained. “The model brings world knowledge to the equation, so when you ask for an image of Newton’s prism experiment, you don’t have to explain what that is to get an image back.”

The new system does take longer to generate images than before, though OpenAI suggests this is a worthwhile tradeoff. “While we certainly have room to improve on latency…the quality of these images, the capability, the world knowledge, really makes up for the additional seconds that they’ll spend waiting,” Shannon said.

OpenAI’s new image generation system doesn’t include visual watermarks or indicators showing images are AI-generated. However, Shannon explained that “all of our generated images will include standard C2PA metadata to mark the image as having been created by OpenAI” and the company “will have some internal tooling to be able to look up images as well.”

“Ultimately, no system is perfect for this type of thing, but we’re continuously improving our safeguards and we think of this as a starting point,” Shannon added. “One thing that’s true about all of the images generated from ChatGPT is that the user owns them and are free to use them within the bounds of our usage policies as they would like.”

Discord is finally updating the themes on its desktop app to include a full dark mode that’s ideal for OLED monitors. The new Onyx dark mode is part of a number of UI updates to the Discord desktop app that make it closely match the mobile version of the app, alongside a much-improved overlay.

The Onyx dark mode is also joined by a Dark theme in the Discord desktop app, so there are now four options in total for free users. Discord has made the channel list resizable, improvements to overall spacing throughout the app, and there’s a new bar in the call interface that makes it easier to see if you have your microphone enabled and if your camera is on or off.

Discord has also tweaked the colors and illustrations throughout its desktop app as part of this refresh. “All of these updates are meant to enhance legibility, reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by visual noise, and maintain consistency across desktop and mobile devices,” says Peter Sellis, senior vice president of product at Discord.

While the UI improvements are immediately obvious, Discord has also added a new game overlay to its desktop app that no longer hits your frame rates. “Previously, the Overlay worked best by ’“hooking’” itself directly into your game’s window, sacrificing game performance in the process,“ explains Sellis. ”This new version of the Overlay delivers a snappier, faster experience, focused around what you care about most.“

https://theverge.com,"Waymo plans robotaxi launch in Washington, DC in 2026",https://www.theverge.com/news/634955/waymo-washington-dc-robotaxi-launch-2026,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Waymo announced that Washington, DC will be its next robotaxi city. The company aims to launch its Waymo One ridehailing service in the nation’s capitol in 2026 — though it acknowledged that it will first need to change the city law prohibiting fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers.

Currently, companies that want to test autonomous vehicles in DC are required to have a human driver behind the steering wheel in case something goes wrong. Tech advocates have been pressing the city council to loosen the restrictions to allow fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. A spokesperson for the DC transportation department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year. A Waymo product manager told a local news outlet that the company was primarily focused on neighborhoods like Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, and Penn Quarter. Waymo has not commented on the size of its service area nor which neighborhoods it is targeting if it launches next year.

The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year.

Launching a robotaxi service in the heart of the federal government is a risky move. The feds have largely taken a back seat in regulating autonomous vehicles, leaving it to the states to develop their own rulebooks for safe deployment. Legislation that would dramatically increase the number of AVs on the road has been stalled in Congress for over seven years, with lawmakers at odds over a range of issues, including safety, liability, and the right number of exemptions from federal motor vehicle safety standards.

But beyond that, DC is its own city with its own transportation challenges. It has some of the worst traffic congestion in the US thanks to an ever-expanding population and stagnate infrastructure. Waymo hasn’t said how many vehicles it intends to bring to DC.

Waymo currently operates its driverless ridehailing vehicles in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. It recently launched a partnership with Uber in Austin, and it plans to expand that deal to Atlanta later this year. It also plans to operate robotaxis in Silicon Valley and Miami.

In DC, customers will use the company’s ridehail app, Waymo One, to summon driverless vehicles. Waymo currently provides 200,000 passenger trips a week using the app.

DC has seen some autonomous testing before. Cruise, General Motors’ now-defunct AV subsidiary, tested several of its vehicles there. Another defunct company, Ford-backed Argo AI, has also previously tested autonomous vehicles in the district.

Waymo markets itself as a safer option than human-driven vehicles. The company has released insurance data that shows its vehicles cause less property damage and fewer bodily injuries when they crash than human drivers.

https://theverge.com,The Kindle Colorsoft is now a far better deal thanks to Amazon’s Big Spring Sale,https://theverge.com/tech/635652/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-deal-big-spring-sale-2025,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:50:07 GMT","When we reviewed the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition late last year, one of our biggest gripes was the e-reader’s initial starting price of $279.99. It’s a high price to pay for an ebook reader, particularly given its smaller 7-inch display and lack of stylus support, but those shortcomings are more forgivable now that the ebook reader is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $224.99 ($55 off).

At its core, the Colorsoft is really just a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition with a color screen. It’s the first Kindle to utilize E Ink’s color screen technology, which provides more vibrancy than Kobo’s like-minded Libra Colour — even if the 300ppi resolution is halved in color mode. The resulting contrast and color make browsing and reading books (or comics!) more pleasant and engaging, but don’t expect the kind of glossy, high-res images you might get on a dedicated tablet with an OLED or LCD display.

That said, the Colorsoft benefits from all the upgrades you’ll find on Amazon’s newer Kindles, as well as a slew of recent software updates. It features an auto-adjusting front light, robust IPX8 waterproofing, and faster page-turning performance than prior models. You’ll also get up to two months of battery life and wireless charging, not to mention a healthy 32GB of storage and zero ads. It’s the e-reader to get if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon.

In fact, it’s the only one.

https://theverge.com,GM-backed ‘coast-to-coast’ EV charging network grows to 130 locations,https://theverge.com/news/635641/gm-evgo-pilot-truck-stop-ev-charging-network-expansion-i75,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:22:00 GMT","is a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.

In their quest to build a coast-to-coast EV charging network, GM, EVgo, and Pilot announce they have installed electric vehicle chargers at 130 locations across 25 states. The partnership, which launched in 2022, aimed to install 2,000 DC fast chargers at 500 Pilot and Flying J truck stop locations nationwide. In a press release, the companies say the expanded charging network will make road trip plans easier as EV adoption grows and drivers prepare for spring and summer travel.

Pilot says its charging infrastructure now stretches along I-75 between Michigan and Georgia, as well as highway routes between Minneapolis and Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland, San Antonio and Houston, and Dallas and Nashville. Locationally, the GM-backed charging network project is a little over a quarter of the way towards its goal. At the end of 2023, the companies had 25 EV station locations with around 100 charging stalls.

Each station is set up with gas station-style canopies, with some that have space to drive electric trucks with trailers through the station for easy charging. Pilot has a site that shows which locations have EV charging stations and statuses on whether they’re in use. Most locations seem to only have the capacity for four vehicles to charge at any given time, such as at this two-stall Pilot Travel Center station in Good Hope, Alabama.

Each stall has two CCS1 plugs and up to 350kW speed when a single compatible EV is connected. GM says some EVs can charge up in “as little as 15 minutes,” but only few EVs can achieve the max charge speed, but only in small bursts and probably not up to 100 percent. For most EV models, you can expect a 20 to 80 percent charge in around 30 minutes. Comparatively, a Level 2 AC home charger could take 3-6 hours to fill up.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Amazon’s new James Bond movie will be produced by Amy Pascal and David Heyman,https://theverge.com/news/635566/amazon-james-bond-amy-pascal-david-heyman,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:11:37 GMT","is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.

Today, Amazon MGM announced that it has tapped veteran producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman to produce a new untitled Bond feature. Pascal, best known for her work on Sony’s Spider-Man cinematic franchise and other Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall, will produce the new Amazon project through Pascal Pictures. Heyman, who produced all eight of Warner Bros.’ live-action Harry Potter films and is currently working on HBO / Max’s reimagined series, is attached to the project through Heyday films.

In a statement about their new gigs, Pascal and Heyman said that it was an honor to take stewardship of the Bond IP after Broccoli and Wilson. “We are humbled to follow in the footsteps of Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson who made so many extraordinary films and honored and excited to keep the spirit of Bond very much alive as he embarks on his next adventure,” they said.

Amazon MGM’s head of film Courtenay Valenti noted Pascal and Heyman’s past success leading massive film franchises, and insisted that the studio is “approaching every creative decision with James Bond… with the greatest sense of responsibility.”

Valenti’s statement reads a little ominous given how reluctant Broccoli and Wilson reportedly were about letting Amazon fully take over the Bond franchise after MGM’s acquisition back in 2021. But with the old guard bowing out, this new development was inevitable, and now all there is to do is wait and see just what Pascal and Heyman decide to do with the series.",theverge

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

After Samsung first revealed its glasses-free 3D monitor last year, the company is finally letting customers reserve preorders for the display, with a since-removed Best Buy page showing a price of $1,999.99. The 27-inch Odyssey 3D G90XF comes with a 4K display that uses eye-tracking to “deliver a natural-looking high-definition 3D image.”

You’ll need to install Samsung’s Reality Hub app to make games appear in 3D. Samsung says it’s working with developers “to make the most out of this 3D technology,” as upcoming games like The First Berserker: Khazan and Lies of P. DLC Overture will be optimized for the monitor. The display features a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms gray-to-gray response time, along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.

Best Buy has since taken down its Odyssey 3D product page. Screenshot: The Verge

The Odyssey 3D can also convert “nearly all” content into 3D using the panel’s lenticular lens, but there are some big caveats. You can only use the feature if your PC has an Nvidia graphics card (RTX 3080 or higher is recommended), and you can’t use it with DRM-protected content. Samsung also notes that some video players might not support the 3D conversion tool, adding that it’s not available in HDR mode, either.

Along with the Odyssey 3D, Samsung is launching the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF) next month. The 27-inch model costs $1,299.99, according to a listing still live on MicroCenter, and offers a 4K OLED display sitting at 166 pixels-per-inch (PPI). It comes with a .03ms gray-to-gray response time, a 240Hz refresh rate, and a built-in system that protects against burn-in.

There’s a new 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G91F) model as well, with a product page on Best Buy (that’s also been taken down) suggesting a cheaper, $999.99 price. This monitor comes with a dual QHD display with a 1ms response time and a lower 144Hz refresh rate compared to the 240Hz with the Odyssey G9 G95C.

Lastly, Samsung is also launching a ViewFinity S8 (S80UD) monitor with a larger 37-inch 4K display for $599.99, as shown on this Best Buy product page. Despite these early retail listings, the exact pricing of these monitors is still unclear. Samsung spokesperson Courtney Camp tells The Verge there are “no details to share on pricing just yet.”

WWDC could also see the debut of new hardware and an update on the AI-powered Siri features that were recently delayed.

The company used last year’s WWDC to introduce Apple Intelligence, showcasing still-unreleased advanced features for Siri that would allow the voice assistant to see your screen and perform actions based on what’s being displayed, integrate more deeply with your apps, and understand personal context when completing tasks.

Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told Daring Fireball recently that “It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”

With any luck, Apple might offer a more evolved AI strategy alongside a specific timeline at WWDC, including the rumored smart display that’s seemingly impacted by the Siri setback. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman previously reported that Siri’s more advanced conversational features might not arrive until iOS 20 “at best,” however, and Apple reportedly restructured the team in charge of the project, replacing John Giannandrea with Vision Pro leader Mike Rockwell.

Details around iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and the next Californication of macOS are likely to be included during WWDC 2025, which Gurman also reported could include a significantly redesigned look, updating icons, menus, and buttons to make things more consistent across Apple devices.",theverge

Notably, the bloc’s major markets saw declines, with Italy (-6%), Germany (-4.6%), and France (-3.3%). Spain conversely recorded an 8.4% increase.

In February 2025, the year-on-year (YOY) decline was 3.4%, with the German market seeing the sharpest decline in volume of 6.4%, followed by Italy (-6.2%).

New EU car registrations by power source

Up until February 2025, battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for 15.2% of total EU market share, signifying an increase from the low baseline of 11.5% in the comparable period of January-February 2024. Hybrid-electric vehicles surged, capturing 35.2% of the market and remaining the preferred choice among EU consumers. Meanwhile, the combined market share of petrol and diesel cars fell to 38.8%, down from 48.5% over the same period in 2024.

Electric cars

Across the first two months of 2025, new battery-electric car sales grew by 28.4%, to 255,489 units, capturing 15.2% of total EU market share. Three of the four largest markets in the EU, accounting for 64% of all battery-electric car registrations, recorded robust double-digit gains: Germany (+41%), Belgium (+38%), and the Netherlands (+25%). This contrasted with France, which saw a slight decline of 1.3%.

February 2025’s YTD figures showed new EU registrations of hybrid-electric cars rising by 18.7%, driven by significant growth in the four biggest markets: France (+51.4%), Spain (+31.5%), Italy (+10.4%), and Germany (+9.8%). This led to 594,059 units registered in the first two months of 2025, representing 35.2% of the EU market share.

Registrations of plug-in-hybrid electric cars declined by 5% across the January-February 2025 period, with a total of 124,947 units. This decrease was primarily driven by significant reductions in key markets such as Belgium (-65.3%) and France (-49.3%). As a result, plug-in-hybrid electric cars now represent 7.4% of total car registrations in the EU.

Furthermore, the February 2025 YOY variation showed a rise of 23.7% for battery-electric and 19% for hybrid-electric cars, while plug-in-hybrid electric saw a slight decline of 1.4%.

Petrol and diesel cars

By February 2025 YTD, petrol car registrations saw a significant decline of 20.5%, with all major markets showing decreases. France experienced the steepest drop, with registrations plummeting by 27.5%, followed by Germany (-24.9%), Italy (-19%), and Spain (-13%).

With 489,838 new cars registered so far, the market share for petrol dropped to 29.1%, down from 35.5% during the same period last year. Similarly, the diesel car market declined by 28%, resulting in a 9.7% market share for diesel vehicles by February 2025. Overall, double-digit declines were observed in most EU markets.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Instagram is rolling out a new program to fast-track moderation reports made by school districts. After a district joins the new Schools Partnership program, any post or account they flag for potentially violating Instagram’s rules will “be automatically prioritized for review.”

The school’s account will then receive notifications about the status of their report, and whether Instagram takes action on it. The partnership program is available to middle schools and high schools in the US, and it will allow them to take action against harmful content students may post.

School partners will have a banner on their profile. Image: Instagram

Schools are often made aware of threats or inappropriate content posted on social media platforms, and some use monitoring programs to keep tabs on what students post online. Educational institutions will get a banner on their profile indicating that they’re part of the program, and they’ll gain access to resources to “help support educators, parents, guardians and students navigate Instagram safely.”

Instagram has been trying to get ahead of the online child safety legislation popping up across the US. Last year, Instagram moved teens into more private accounts and began using AI to scan for signals that someone might be lying about their age. It also partnered with the nonprofit organization Childhelp to develop a curriculum that teaches middle schoolers how to recognize online exploitation, including sextortion scams and grooming.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Sony brings premium features to its WF-C710N budget wireless earbuds,https://theverge.com/news/634731/sony-wf-c710n-wireless-earbuds-bluetooth-headphones,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.

Sony has announced a successor to its budget-minded WF-C700N wireless earbuds from 2023. The new WF-C710N still lack a memorable name but introduce improvements like upgraded active noise cancellation and features borrowed from Sony’s more premium earbud offerings. And despite the rising cost of many electronics, the WF-C710N are available for preorder today for $119.99 — the same price as their predecessors.

One of our biggest complaints when we reviewed the WF-C700N was their lackluster ANC, which was really only capable of removing very low frequency hums and rumbling. Although we haven’t tested the capabilities of the new WF-C710N, Sony says it has improved the performance of both the ANC and ambient sound mode through the use of dual microphones. However, it doesn’t look like Sony is using the dedicated ANC processors found in its premium earbud offerings.

Better battery life is another reason to consider an upgrade. With ANC turned on, the WF-C700N offered up to 7.5 hours on buds alone, or up to 15 hours when paired with a charging case that offered just a single full charge. For the WF-C710N, battery life is expanded to 8.5 hours for the buds, or up to 30 hours when paired with their charging case. With ANC turned off, Sony says battery life maxes out at up to 40 hours.

Quick charging has also been improved. Once the WF-C710N buds have died, just five minutes in their charging case — down from 10 — is enough to revive them for an hour of playback.

Sony has replaced the physical buttons on the older WF-C700N earbuds with touch sensors on its new WF-C710N. Image: Sony

Premium features that have finally trickled down from Sony’s more premium earbuds include a sensor that will automatically pause playback when the WF-C710N are removed from your ears. Sony has also switched from physical buttons on each earbud to touch sensors whose function can be configured in a mobile app. They can be used to control music playback, answer calls, adjust the volume, or launch your preferred music app. The earbuds are also IPX4 water-resistant (splashes are okay, but a complete dunking is not) and can connect to two Bluetooth devices for easy switching.

In addition to pink, black, and white, Sony is introducing a new transparent blue option to its WF-C710N wireless earbuds. Image: Sony

But if all you care about is how your earbuds look, the Sony WF-C710N are available in black, white, pink, and a new transparent blue color that makes the upgrade even more tempting.",theverge

She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

A growing body of evidence points to mounting health risks posed by climate change. Despite this, it seems the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will quit funding that kind of research. ProPublica first reported the news on Monday, citing internal records that the investigative outlet viewed.

NIH gave directions to staff members last week that likely puts a stop to any more funding for new academic programs or research into the impacts climate change has on health, according to ProPublica. It remains to be seen whether the new directive will affect active grants. But it follows news last month from Mother Jones that the Department of Health and Human Services halted funding for three existing climate and health programs at NIH. That includes the Climate Change and Health Initiative launched in 2021 that supported research into the health effects of wildfires, heat stress, and virus transmissions through mosquitoes, to name a few projects.

“This is a direct attack on our health, on the science that keeps us protected.”

The moves threaten efforts to protect Americans from more extreme weather and other disasters made worse by climate change, public health advocates warn.

“This is a direct attack on our health, on the science that keeps us protected,” Juan Declet-Barreto, Bilingual Senior Social Scientist for Climate Vulnerability at the Union of Concerned Scientists, tells The Verge.

Kids born in 2024 can expect “poorer air quality, hotter days, and lifelong social and community disruptions from climate change,” according to a US policy brief from health journal The Lancet, which publishes an annual report on health and climate change.

“HHS is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities. At HHS, we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science,” HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email to The Verge.",theverge

Musk’s allies in the Trump administration are threatening to prosecute anyone caught defacing Tesla vehicles by classifying the acts as “domestic terrorism.“

The most notable is the aptly named Otter Meeting Agent, a voice-activated meeting assistant that’s capable of using company data to answer questions and complete tasks.

Otter says its new Meeting Agent is a “transformative evolution” of the existing AI meeting chatbot it already offers. As such, the video Otter released demonstrating some of the Meeting Agent features shows off some text-based capabilities that the older AI assistant already provided, such as “attending” online meetings, transcribing conversations, and summarizing information. The Meeting Agent, however, can now answer questions based on information in the company’s meeting database, and users can ask it to schedule future meetings and draft emails using “natural voice interaction.”

Otter says the AI Meeting Agent can currently be used on Zoom calls, and is being “incrementally rolled out” to all Otter.ai users. The Meeting Agent will be supported on Microsoft Teams and Google Meet in the coming weeks.

Otter is also launching a Sales Agent that provides live coaching assistance during calls to help sales representatives close deals and handle complaints, and a Sales Development Representative (SDR) Agent that can autonomously demonstrate products “without human intervention,” according to Otter.

The Sales Agent is supported on “all virtual conferencing platforms,” and is available to Otter enterprise sales customers. The SDR Agent is live on Otter’s website and companies interested in purchasing it will need to contact Otter directly. Otter says it’s also planning to release additional Agents “in the future” that specialize in marketing, recruiting, and “other functions.”",theverge

That means that the brand originally launched in 1999 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) music file-sharing service is set to be reborn again. This time, new owners are reshaping the brand into one focused on marketing musicians in the metaverse.

Infinite announced today a definitive agreement to buy Napster for $207 million. The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company plans to turn Napster into a “social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement over passive listening, allowing artists to connect with, own, and monetize the relationship with their fans."" Jon Vlassopulos, who became Napster CEO in 2022, will continue with his role at the brand.

Since 2016, Napster has been operating as a (legal) streaming service. It claims to have over 110 million high-fidelity tracks, with some supporting lossless audio. Napster subscribers can also listen offline and watch music videos. The service currently starts at $11 per month.

Since 2022, Napster has been owned by Web3 and blockchain firms Hivemind and Algorand. Infinite also develops Web3 tech, and CEO John Acunto told CNBC that Algorand’s blockchain background was appealing, as was Napster's licenses for streaming millions of songs.

To market musicians, Infinite has numerous ideas for helping Napster users interact more with the platform than they do with the current music streaming service. The company shared goals of using Napster to offer ""branded 3D virtual spaces where fans can enjoy virtual concerts, social listening parties, and other immersive and community-based experiences"" and more ""gamification."" Infinite also wants musicians to use Napster as a platform where fans can purchase tickets for performances, physical and virtual merchandise, and ""exclusive digital content."" The 6-year-old firm also plans to offer artists abilities to use ""AI-powered customer service, sales, and community management agents"" and ""enhanced analytics dashboards to better understand fan behavior” with Napster.",arstechnica

In theory, search engines can potentially change that. By prioritizing results from high-quality, credible sources, a search engine could ensure that people found accurate information more frequently, potentially opening them to the possibility of updating their beliefs.

Obviously, that hasn't worked out on the technology side, as people quickly learned how to game the algorithms used by search engines, meaning that the webpages that get returned have been created by people with no interest in quality or credibility. But a new study is suggesting that the concept fails on the human side, too, as people tend to devise search terms that are specific enough to ensure that the results of the search will end up reinforcing their existing beliefs.

The study showed that invisibly swapping search terms to something more general can go a long way toward enabling people to change their mind.

Searching for affirmation

The new work was done by two researchers at Tulane, Eugina Leung and Oleg Urminsky. Much of their study focuses on a simple question that people might turn to a search engine to answer: is caffeine good or bad for you? If you wanted to search for that, you could potentially ask ""what are the health effects of caffeine?"" which should get you a mixture of the pros and cons. But people could also ask it in less neutral terms, such as, ""is caffeine bad for you?"" These more specific searches are likely to pull up a more biased selection of results than the general, neutral terms.

Leung and Urminsky did some tests that suggested this was likely to be a real-world problem. Using a Google Adwords planner, they pulled out some of the most common searches that included the word ""caffeine"" and found that over a quarter of them were narrowly focused and not likely to return a representative spectrum of information on the molecule's effects.",arstechnica

ATF is embedding personnel in some FBI field offices, starting in San Antonio, Texas, ""where some of the Molotov cocktail attacks have been carried out,"" the report said. There were previously three arrests. The FBI is reviewing security camera footage and gained access to cell phone location data in an attempt to find more culprits, the report said.

When contacted by Ars, an FBI spokesperson said, ""We can confirm the establishment of a task force to investigate the incidents targeting Teslas."" The FBI said that Director Kash Patel ""has been unequivocally clear: The FBI will be relentless in its mission to protect the American people. Acts of violence, vandalism, and domestic terrorism—like the recent Tesla attacks—will be pursued with the full force of the law.""

Patel shared the New York Post article in a post on X and confirmed that the agency ""has been investigating the increase in violent activity toward Tesla, and over the last few days, we have taken additional steps to crack down and coordinate our response.

The administrator of NASA is among the most high-profile of these positions. Nearly four months ago Trump nominated private astronaut Jared Isaacman to become chief of the space agency, but he has yet to receive a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

Almost immediately after his nomination, much of the space community fell in behind Isaacman, who has flown to space twice on private Crew Dragon missions, raised charitable funds, and is generally well-liked. Since then, Isaacman has worked to build support for his candidacy through conversations with people in the space community and officeholders.

However, publicly, not much has happened. This has raised questions within the space community about whether the nomination has stalled. Although some people have expressed concern about financial ties between Isaacman and SpaceX, according to multiple sources, the primary obstacle has been Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who chairs the Senate committee.

Cruz is not happy that Isaacman has donated to Democrats in the past, and he is concerned that the private astronaut is more interested in Mars exploration than the Moon. Cruz also did not appreciate Elon Musk's call to end the life of the International Space Station early. The station is operated by NASA's field center, Johnson Space Center, in Houston, where Cruz lives.

Nomination on track

Nevertheless, despite the slower pace, people familiar with the nomination process say Isaacman's candidacy remains on track. And recently, there have been some public announcements that support this notion.

In early March, the governors of several southern US states, including Florida and Texas, sent a letter to Cruz expressing ""strong support"" for the swift confirmation of Isaacman. A notable absence from this letter was the governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, where NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center is located. However, she also recently sent Cruz a letter praising Isaacman, calling him an ""exceptional selection"" to lead NASA. It is notable that the governors of all the US states with major human spaceflight activities have now lined up behind Isaacman.",arstechnica

A new ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that Apple cannot participate in Google's upcoming antitrust hearing, which could leave a multibillion-dollar hole in Apple's balance sheet. The judges in the case say Apple simply waited too long to get involved.

Just a few years ago, a high-stakes court case involving Apple and Google would have found the companies on opposing sides, but not today. Apple's and Google's interests are strongly aligned here, to the tune of $20 billion. Google forks over that cash every year, and it's happy to do so to secure placement as the default search provider in the Safari desktop and mobile browser.

The antitrust penalties pending against Google would make that deal impermissible. Throughout the case, the government made the value of defaults clear—most people never change them. That effectively delivers Google a captive audience on Apple devices.

Google's ongoing legal battle with the DOJ's antitrust division is shaping up to be the most significant action the government has taken against a tech company since Microsoft in the late '90s. Perhaps this period of stability tricked Google's partners into thinking nothing would change, but the seriousness of the government's proposed remedies seems to have convinced them otherwise.

Google lost the case in August 2024, and the government proposed remedies in October. According to MediaPost, the appeals court took issue with Apple's sluggishness in choosing sides. It didn't even make its filing to participate in the remedy phase until November, some 33 days after the initial proposal. The judges ruled this delay ""seems difficult to justify.""

When Google returns to court in the coming weeks, the company's attorneys will not be flanked by Apple's legal team. While Apple will be allowed to submit written testimony and file friend-of-the-court briefs, it will not be able to present evidence to the court or cross-examine witnesses, as it sought. Apple argued that it was entitled to do so because it had a direct stake in the outcome.",arstechnica

For years, Blizzard has not allowed any appeals or rollbacks for these Hardcore mode character deaths, even when such deaths came as the direct result of a server disconnection or gameplay bug.

Now, Blizzard says it's modifying that policy somewhat in response to a series of ""unprecedented distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks"" undertaken ""with the singular goal of disrupting players’ experiences."" The World of Warcraft developer says it may now resurrect Classic Hardcore characters ""at our sole discretion"" when those deaths come ""in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game.""

RIP OnlyFangs?

The high stakes inherent to WoW's Classic Hardcore mode have made it an appealing target for streamers and other online content creators looking to build an audience.

After weeks of OnlyFangs stream disruptions and character deaths from these server attacks, prominent guild member sodapoppin posted on the guild Discord that ""I'd expect OnlyFangs is over... it's a terrible ending IMO, but that's the ending we got."" In that same message, sodapoppin said it was clear that ""the DDOS attacks are centered on us"" and that he couldn't foresee asking guild members to continue streaming given the frequency and long-term consequences of those attacks.",arstechnica

Boeing previously agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States. Boeing could still plead guilty but face weaker penalties than it agreed to last year if the Justice Department and a federal judge agree.

Trump's Department of Justice ""is reviewing numerous pending criminal cases that haven't yet gone to trial or been approved by courts,"" and ""Boeing stands to benefit from fresh eyes at Trump's Justice Department, which is inclined to at least modify parts of the agreement,"" the WSJ wrote, citing people familiar with the matter. ""Allowing Boeing to rescind its plea agreement, or lightening the company's punishment, would mark one of the most prominent examples of the Trump administration's lighter-touch approach to some white-collar enforcement.""

In July 2024, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $243.6 million for violating a 2021 agreement that was spurred by 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a combined 346 people.

Boeing had avoided prosecution in January 2021 when it signed a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties and compensation to airline customers and the victims' families. But in May 2024, the Justice Department said it determined that Boeing violated the deferred prosecution agreement ""by failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations.""

Judge rejected previous plea deal

Boeing's plea deal was for a charge of defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration Aircraft Evaluation Group, and the plea agreement was submitted for review in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Judge Reed O'Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the plea deal in December because it ""requires the parties to consider race when hiring the independent monitor"" and because Boeing wouldn't actually have to comply with the monitor's recommendations.",arstechnica

Since December 2014, when season 1 of Marco Polo debuted, Netflix has supported the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Like Dolby Vision, HDR10+ is a more advanced form of HDR that uses dynamic metadata fine-tuned to specific content. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision let creatives set how each frame looks, enabling a final result that should have more detail and look closer to how the content's creators intended. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision are especially impactful when watching HDR content on lower-priced HDR TVs that could suffer from poor black levels and other performance gaps.

Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the Internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

“There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former decadelong member of the European Parliament.

The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump.

Ars does not accept paid editorial content.

LULEA, Sweden—Staring out the window of a puddle jumper descending from Stockholm into Lulea, I spy frozen seawater for the first time in my life. Not nearly as much as I expected, though, for the middle of February at the northern end of Sweden. I've flown here to drift electric Polestars on an icy lake called Stor-Skabram, near the small outpost of Jokkmokk, fully above the Arctic Circle. Yet the balmy weather serves as a constant reminder of the climate change that inspires much of the narrative around the electric vehicle industry.

EVs on ice

An opportunity to get somebody else's cars sideways as much as possible on ice and snow is a particularly enjoyable way to spend a day, if you like driving cars. More importantly, automotive manufacturers rely on this kind of winter testing to fine-tune traction and stability-control programming, ensuring their cars can work well in the depths of the deepest winter. For EVs in particular, winter testing presents a more complex range of equations.

First of all, an EV can't ever turn the electronic nannies off entirely, because electric motors will rev to the moon with instantaneous torque the very instant their tires lose traction. So while software uses wheel speed sensors and regenerative braking, as well as accelerometers that detect yaw rates, each EV needs to then maintain progressive output responses to driver inputs that allow for confident performance and safety simultaneously.

Then there's the issue of battery performance in cold weather, since chemical cells don't respond to frigid temps as well as simpler mechanical systems. For Polestar, these challenges seem extra important given the company's Scandinavian roots—even while nestled within the current Geely umbrella. (Then again, a bit of contrarianism springs up while considering Polestar's ubiquitous sustainability messaging, given the carbon footprint of flying journalists all the way to the top of the globe to enjoy some winter testing.)",arstechnica

The price of the non-laser H2D is lower than I expected though, so that’ll probably make a great replacement/upgrade for my P1S in a few years.",arstechnica

It’s an explosive scandal involving U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance, along with a host of other top defense and intelligence officials, that should force a reckoning as the dumbest people to ever run the United States endanger national security. But it’s also absolutely hilarious. At least, the good folks of social media think so.

Sure, as a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg should never have been on those chats. Sure, it raises serious questions about whether top U.S. defense officials should literally be thrown in prison over the breach. But those concerns melt away when you remember how breathtakingly ridiculous it all is.

These guys invited the editor of an incredibly popular magazine into a group chat to discuss secret war plans. They openly discussed ways to not impact Saudi Arabian oil interests in the region, according to Goldberg. And it says it all that Goldberg himself didn’t think it was real when he was first added to the group chat. It’s just too dumb to be real.

And yet, it’s our reality. So the internet is going to laugh, if only because there’s virtually no chance that powerful people are going to be held to account in the Trump administration. And the memes that we share to deal with that reality a small light in this trying time. Below, a handful of the funniest memes we saw floating around social media.

https://gizmodo.com,23andMe’s Meltdown Was Inevitable—and Deserved,https://gizmodo.com/23andmes-meltdown-was-inevitable-and-deserved-2000580301,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:10:01 GMT","The DNA testing company 23andMe is circling the drain, and it’s about damn time.

Earlier this week, 23andMe officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just as its CEO Anne Wojcicki stepped down from the position—the latest humiliations for a formerly thriving company once valued at $6 billion. Though it’s still possible that some version will outlast this financial turmoil, its days as a genetic testing juggernaut appear to be firmly over. Frankly, given the many mistakes and misleading promises 23andMe and similar companies have made throughout the years, it’s a well-deserved fate.

Shattered trust

Much attention has rightly been paid to the company’s abysmal handling of its customers’ data. Starting in April 2023, hackers gained access to the personal information of nearly 7 million customers, more than half of the company’s customers (the initial breach affected 14,000 accounts, which the hackers then used to access information from many others). Though the hackers weren’t directly privy to people’s DNA records, they were able to obtain names, birth years, and family tree information.

It took five months for the company to even notice the hack, and two months before it publicly admitted to the total scale of the breach. Along the way, the company attempted to lay the blame at its customers’ feet, scolding them for recycling passwords. To be clear, you should never reuse passwords—but the companies we trust with our data also have a responsibility to keep it secure.

The hack severely shook the public’s confidence in 23andMe and incurred a heavy cost. Last December, for instance, the company agreed to pay $30 million to settle a class action lawsuit filed against it for the breach. The company’s security failings are one thing, but the foundations of consumer genetics testing in general have always rested on shaky ground.

Overstated offerings

In 2010, four years after 23andMe first launched, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published an investigative report accusing the consumer DNA testing industry of regularly misleading the public. According to the report, companies often marketed these tests by falsely claiming they could accurately predict the chances of someone developing any number of medical conditions. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration banned 23andMe for selling its own version of these personal genetics tests (tests focusing strictly on ancestry were still allowed).

To its credit, 23andMe did retool its business model in response to the FDA. It eventually launched FDA-approved tests to reveal if someone carries genes linked to specific hereditary conditions (genes that could be passed on to their children), in addition to tests that provided insights into the risk of developing conditions like Alzheimer’s, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Egregious false advertising in the DNA testing industry may have declined somewhat since the GAO report, but some companies are still being caught for deceiving their customers.

Put simply, though: most people don’t really benefit from these direct-to-consumer DNA tests, largely because our hereditary factors are usually only one piece of the very big puzzle that is our health. Our genes can influence our risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes, for instance, but factors like lack of exercise or obesity have a much greater impact. And the actual lifestyle advice given to people at higher genetic risk for diabetes should be the same as what’s given to everyone at higher risk: move more and eat a healthier diet.

Insufficient science

Scientists are continuing to find new links between our genetics and health, and occasionally discovering new genetic disorders. But we’re not currently at, and will likely never reach, a point where a printout of someone’s DNA can provide them with a precise road map to their health. And that’s assuming we’re getting accurate results in the first place. A 2018 study found that up to 40% of genetic variants marked as potentially worrying in a person’s raw genetic data were actually false positives, for instance.

Speaking of inaccuracies, ancestry testing has its problems, too. The genetic markers commonly used to assess both a person’s health and heritage by these companies are subject to some interpretation, and it’s possible that two companies, given your DNA, will pop out two markedly different assessments of your ancestry (even twins can get different results from the same company).

I haven’t even gotten into the recent phenomenon of law enforcement agencies starting to use data from others’ DNA testing results to track down related crime suspects. While many people are supportive of this use, plenty aren’t. A 2020 Pew survey found support split down the middle.

At the end of the day, it seems that 23andMe’s downfall wasn’t just caused by the 2023 hack, but by its own irrelevancy. As Gizmodo has already noted, the company has repeatedly tried to pivot to new sources of sustainable revenue, from selling $1,000-a-year subscriptions marketed as healthcare to more recently making plans to further mine its customers’ DNA data for scientific research.

There’s only so much you can learn from a consumer DNA test, and it appears there’s also only so much money you can make from selling them to the public. While I won’t begrudge people for being curious about their genetics, my opinion when asked is the same as it’s been for years: don’t take any DNA tests that you and your doctors haven’t agreed is right for you. And if you’re a 23andMe customer, it might be wise to delete your account—just be aware that you can’t entirely scrub your data with them.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,An Astronomer Calculated the Exact Day a Star Will Blow—and It’s This Week,https://gizmodo.com/an-astronomer-calculated-the-exact-day-a-star-will-blow-and-its-this-week-2000580309,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:35:53 GMT","Astronomers have been watching a small constellation in the night sky, waiting for a nearby binary star system to explode. The wait may finally be over: A numerical estimate predicts the rare nova eruption could happen on Thursday, March 27.

T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), also known as the Blaze Star, is a binary star system located 3,000 light-years from Earth. It periodically explodes in a recurring nova every 79 years or so, and it’s due for an impending eruption.

The Blaze Star has spent the past decade behaving much like it did in the lead-up to its last visible eruption nearly 80 years ago, according to NASA. The current window for the rare astronomical event opened in February 2024 and remains open. Astronomy enthusiasts have been keeping a close eye on the skies since last year, waiting for that stellar boom. A paper published last year in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society estimated that the star is likely to explode on Thursday, March 27—so get ready to look up.

When will the Blaze Star explode?

To better pinpoint the next eruption date, the astronomer behind the 2024 study, Jean Schneider of the Paris Observatory, combined the previous explosion dates with the orbital dynamics of the star system. The researcher found that the nova eruptions occurred at intervals that were an exact multiple of the star system’s orbital period—meaning the explosions happened after a specific number of orbits the stars completed around each other. Rather than relying on the behavior of the star system, the paper suggests that T CrB explodes once every 128 orbits, with each orbital period being roughly 227 days.

Based on these calculations, the nova is set to take place on March 27. Should it fail to explode on Thursday, Schneider lists two subsequent dates: November 10, 2025 and June 25, 2026. In his paper, he also predicted August 12, 2024, which we can now obviously rule out. To be clear, Schneider is strictly running the numbers; his paper does not take into account the physics of how or why the eruption happens. It’s a one-dimensional approach, so his predictions could be way off—but wow would that ever be neat if the Blaze Star erupts according to his unusually strict timeline.

What is the T CrB nova?

Located in the Corona Borealis constellation, T CrB is a binary system made up of a white dwarf (the remains of a dead star with a mass comparable to that of the Sun squeezed into an Earth-sized body) and an ancient red giant star. The red giant, roughly 1.12 times the mass of our Sun, orbits the white dwarf every 227 days. The two stars are separated by only 0.54 astronomical units, about the same as the distance from the Sun to Venus.

The red giant star is slowly being stripped of its hydrogen by the strong gravitational pull of its companion, the white dwarf, as the two are interlocked in a dangerous orbital dance. The material from the red giant star forms an accretion disk, which swirls around the white dwarf. As the hydrogen from the red giant star accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, it causes a buildup of pressure and heat, which eventually triggers a thermonuclear explosion that blasts away all that material.

Unlike a supernova, which destroys a dying star, the dwarf star remains intact after the nova explosion. It does, however, blast the material into space in an explosive flash that’s bright enough to see from Earth with the unaided eye. The first recorded sighting of the T CrB nova was more than 800 years ago, and the cycle repeats itself roughly once every 79 years on average.

What you’ll see in the sky

When it does take place, the outburst will be brief but it will appear as a new star in the sky for a little less than a week. The star system itself is currently invisible to the unaided eye at a magnitude of +10. However, following its nova explosion, T CrB will be elevated to a magnitude of +2, almost as bright as the North Star.

The nova will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere in the Corona Borealis constellation, which forms an arc shape in the night skies. You can spot the stellar explosion without a telescope for several days after it happens. The star system will then begin to dim and won’t brighten again for roughly another 80 years, so make sure you catch this rare celestial event.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Air Force Will Soon Test Shipping Cargo Via SpaceX Rockets,https://gizmodo.com/air-force-will-soon-test-shipping-cargo-via-spacex-rockets-2000580471,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:38:44 GMT","The U.S. Air Force announced on Monday that it intends to build two landing pads on a remote island in the Pacific. It wants to land rockets there as part of a test of the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program, which involves shooting rockets into space loaded down with supplies to ship stuff around the planet faster.

The pitch for Rocket Cargo Vanguard is that it could allow the U.S. military to deliver anything anywhere on the planet in “90 minutes or less.” How? By shooting a rocket (presumably a reusable SpaceX one) loaded down with supplies into space and then bringing them back down to Earth. The military is pretty good at firing rockets, both into space and through the air, it’s less good at making sure those things land safely.

Enter Johnston Island, a small land mass in unincorporated U.S. territory that’s about 700 nautical miles off the cost of Hawaii. As first noticed by Stars and Stripes, the Air Force uploaded a notice to the Federal Register on March 3 that signaled its intent to build test platforms on the island.

It’ll take some time before they can start building, however. “Johnston Atoll includes the Johnston Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and is within the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument,” the notice said. Because of that the Pentagon will have to study the effects landing massive rockets on the island may have on the “essential fish habitat, migratory birds, and other protected species.”

The Air Force thinks that all these studies will show that building two landing pads on the island so it can try landing rockets there will have “no significant impact” on the island, but it plans to make its reports public in early April. Once those reports go live, it’ll allow a 30 day period for the public to comment on the proposal.

The military has been working on shooting cargo into space for at least half a decade. Now retired general Stephen R. Lyons gave a speech at a National Defense Transportation meeting in 2020 where he teased a future of rocket shipping. “Think about moving the equivalent of a C-17 payload anywhere on the globe in less than an hour,” Lyons said. “Think about that speed associated with the movement of transportation of cargo and people. There is a lot of potential here and I’m really excited about the team that’s working with SpaceX on an opportunity, even perhaps, as early as 21, to be conducting a proof of principle.”

A military is only as good as its logistics. One of the reasons the American military has been so dominant in the 20th and 21st century is its ability to move humans, supplies, and equipment anywhere on the planet. One of the most iconic images from the Global War on Terror is a Burger King supply truck disembarking from a C-17 in Afghanistan in 2004. Imagine the same thing happening, in 90 minutes or less, via Elon Musk’s rockets.

One of the problems with the rocket shipping plan is cost. Fueling and flying a C-17 loaded down with up-armored Humvees to the Middle East is expensive, yes, but it’s still cheaper than launching a rocket into space. One of SpaceX’s goals is to drive down the cost of launches by re-using pieces of the rocket, but a single launch is still estimated to cost tens of millions of dollars.

Despite the costs, the dream of shooting guns, food, and gear into space persists. “Once realized, Rocket Cargo will fundamentally alter the rapid logistics landscape, connecting materiel to joint warfighters in a fraction of the time it takes today,” John Raymond, a retired Space Force general, said in a press release about the program in 2021. “In the event of conflict or humanitarian crisis, the Space Force will be able to provide our national leadership with an independent option to achieve strategic objectives from space.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Trump Officials Say Secret Group Chat Wasn’t Classified But Won’t Give Reporter Permission to Publish Info,https://gizmodo.com/trump-officials-say-secret-group-chat-wasnt-classified-but-wont-give-reporter-permission-to-publish-info-2000580439,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:46:03 GMT","Top intelligence officials from the Trump regime, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, appeared before lawmakers on Tuesday where they were asked about a Signal group chat that accidentally included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. The big takeaway: the officials insisted that none of the information they discussed was classified, but refused to share the information that was discussed and when asked whether the Atlantic editor could share it with the public, they wouldn’t give the green light for him to do that either.

Ratcliffe and Gabbard were testifying to the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday for a hearing that had been scheduled long before the story in The Atlantic broke Monday. Ratcliffe and Gabbard were just two officials on a large group chat discussing plans to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen, a chat that included others like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. It appears Waltz was the one who accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat, according to the journalist’s reporting.

The hearing was not planned with the intention of discussing The Atlantic’s bombshell story, but the Democratic members of the committee naturally steered their questions to that topic. One of the main questions at issue was whether there was classified information discussed in the group chat. Ratcliffe kept suggesting the information wasn’t classified, but the more he talked it started to become clear he was wording his answer carefully enough to simply say he hadn’t shared any classified intelligence over the chat. Gabbard attempted to stonewall much more than Ratcliffe, often refusing to answer the most basic questions under the pretext that an investigation was ongoing.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was the first to ask Gabbard if she was involved in the group chat and right off the bat she wouldn’t answer.

“So you refuse to acknowledge whether you are on this group chat?” Warner asked.

“Senator, I’m not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said.

“Why aren’t you going to get into the specifics? Is this… is it because it’s all classified?” Warner shot back.

“Because this is currently under review by the National Security Council,” Gabbard said.

“Because it’s all classified? If it’s not classified, share the text now,” Warner said during the heated exchange.

Democratic Sen. Reed of Rhode Island also asked Gabbard if she was overseas at any point during the group chat discussions. Gabbard said that she was but refused to answer a question from Reed about whether she was using an official government-issued phone or her personal device.

“I won’t speak to this because it’s under review by the National Security Council,” Gabbard said. “Once that review is complete, I’m sure we’ll share the results with the committee.”

That response perplexed Reed, who asked why she couldn’t answer such a simple question.

“National Security Council is reviewing all aspects of how this came to be, how the journalist was inadvertently added to the group chat, and what occurred within that chat across the board,” Gabbard said.

It was also discussed in the hearing that one of the people on the chat, top Trump advisor and unofficial Secretary of State, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin while the chat was taking place.

Democratic senators like Reed, Warner, and Bennet of Colorado all made quite a dramatic show Tuesday in the face of stonewalling by Gabbard. But all three men voted in favor of Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Navy John Phelan on Monday, even after The Atlantic story broke. Phelan has no military experience and donated handsomely to President Trump. But they all voted to confirm him, despite previously talking tough about stopping Trump’s unqualified nominees.

Gabbard was also asked by Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona about what she considers classified information, and Gabbard wouldn’t give a straight answer. “The deliberation as to whether or not we should launch a strike on another country, would you consider that classified information, Ms. Gabbard?” Kelly asked.

“The information was not classified,” Gabbard said. Kelly clarified that he wasn’t even talking about the Signal group chat specifically, but was instead seeking an answer more generally about whether discussion about the decision to bomb another country should be considered classified. Gabbard refused to give a straight answer, saying “There are other factors that would go into determining that classification.”

Later in the hearing, Sen. Warner of Virginia asked why they wouldn’t just share the information at issue since they kept insisting it wasn’t classified.

“The idea, somehow, that none of this is classified but you can’t talk about it here… you can’t have it both ways,” Warner said.

And that desire to have it both ways could present some serious issues if the most sensitive parts of their chat are ultimately released. Goldberg spoke to the news outlet the Bulwark on Tuesday, where he said he was contemplating a release of the texts that got into the war plans. The editor had decided not to include many of those details in his article because he was trying to protect national security. But if the director of national intelligence says nothing in that group chat was classified, there would appear to be no reason to withhold them.

Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said there appeared to be crimes committed and called for the resignation of top officials, “starting with the national security advisor and the secretary of defense.”

But its unclear the secretary of defense will face any real consequences. Hegseth was asked about the scandal on Monday and insisted “nobody was texting war plans,” a claim contradicted by Goldberg’s reporting. The defense secretary referred to Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.”

The “hoaxes” Hegseth claimed Goldberg was peddling included several things that were proved to be accurate, including Trump’s ties to Russia, and the fact that he said there were “fine people on both sides” after the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville in 2017. Goldberg also broke the story about Trump referring to U.S. military veterans as “suckers and losers,” during his first term, something that Trump denied but was heard by Trump’s own chief of staff John Kelly.

“So this is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,” Hegseth said about Goldberg Monday.

For his part, Trump has defended his officials, telling NBC News in a phone interview Tuesday that the job of his national security advisor was safe, at least for now. “Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,” Trump reportedly said,” insisting it was, “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.”

Meanwhile David French, a New York Times Opinion columnist and former Army officer and JAG lawyer published a piece calling for Hegseth’s immediate resignation. “There is not an officer alive whose career would survive a security breach like that,” he wrote. “It would normally result in instant consequences (relief from command, for example) followed by a comprehensive investigation and, potentially, criminal charges.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,The Pentagon Sent Out a Warning Against Using Signal Right Before Yemen Group Chat Fiasco,https://gizmodo.com/the-pentagon-sent-out-a-warning-against-using-signal-right-before-yemen-group-chat-fiasco-2000580537,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:24:36 GMT","The Pentagon warned against using Signal in a memo just last week, according to NPR. It cited threats from Russian hackers.

The memo was delivered department-wide days before The Atlantic published a bombshell revelation that its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg had been erroneously added to a Signal group chat that involved detailed discussions of planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Members in the Signal chat included U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President J.D. Vance, among others.

In its memo warning against using Signal, the Pentagon wrote, “Russian professional hacking groups are employing the ‘linked devices’ features to spy on encrypted conversations.”

As the name implies, linked devices allows Signal users to sign into their account from multiple places, and incoming and outgoing messages appear on all devices. Because Signal is end-to-end encrypted and messages are only stored locally on devices with an encryption key, the company first bundles up all of a user’s communications in an encrypted package. Then using QR codes, users can send an encryption key along to the new device:

A single encryption key sent from the primary device to the new device does the job, bootstrapping a secure connection through which we can send encrypted data. It turns out that even a simple QR code does the trick — the new linked device can display a QR code that includes all of the necessary information to bootstrap the process and send encrypted data through a secure connection. Just scan the code from your primary device to get started.

The Pentagon’s memo states that hackers are able to bypass this hurdle by creating malicious phishing pages or QR codes associated with group chats, which users can send to one another as invites. “After gaining access to the malicious code, the groups add their own device as a linked device. This allows the group to view every message sent by the unwitting user in real time, bypassing the end-to-end encryption.”

Another similar messaging app popular for private communications, Telegram, is used in both Russia and Ukraine, and has been the target of Russian hackers, with a firm that works directly with the Kremlin offering a $5 million bounty for exploits.

Signal has defended its security practices, and outlined the great lengths it has gone to prevent itself from being able to access user data. But at the end of the day, neither Signal nor end-to-end encryption technology is going to protect someone sharing classified war plans in an open group chat. It is a consumer-grade messaging app, operated by one technical organization, now being used for political communications amidst major global conflicts. It was inevitable that Signal would become a target. Governments provide secure physical rooms (commonly known as SCIFs) where classified information is discussed for a reason, and there’s also a reason why personal devices aren’t to be used in a SCIF. Consumer apps are meant to be easy and intuitive to use, and users can be targeted through means like social engineering.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been on the defensive trying to put out this latest fire, posting on X again on Tuesday to say that no war plans or otherwise classified materials were discussed in the chat. An investigation into how a journalist was added to the conversation remains ongoing.

Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin. Here are the facts about his latest story: 1. No “war plans” were discussed. 2. No classified material was sent to the thread. 3. The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different… — Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) March 25, 2025

Some have criticized Goldberg, The Atlantic’s editor, for remaining in the chat as sensitive information was being discussed. It is hard to not argue, however, that Goldberg as a journalist had an obligation to inform the public of gross incompetence at the highest levels of power. Also, if everyone else in the chat had been following the proper protocol for classified materials Goldberg wouldn’t have had a story to begin with, because he probably wouldn’t have been invited to the SCIF.",gizmodo

Key facts are held for just the right time so that when they land, they create the maximum emotional impact. And, obviously, that’ll carry over to season two of The Last of Us TV show. In the case of one key character, though—Abby, played by Kaitlyn Dever—it’ll happen in a very different way.

Keeping things spoiler-light, in the video game, Abby is the main antagonist throughout the first half. It’s not until the second half of the game when you are forced to play as her that you get her full backstory, thereby making her a more complete character. We don’t know exactly how things play out on the TV show but, in a recent press conference io9 participated in, game and show creator Neil Druckmann confirmed that Abby’s backstory will be revealed much earlier in the show, and explained why that is.

“There are two reasons why we change certain context or move certain things up in the story,” Druckmann said. “One of which [is] in the game… you play as Abby. So you immediately form an empathic connection with her because you’re surviving as her. You’re running through the snow, you’re fighting infected, and we can withhold certain things and make it a mystery that will be revealed later in the story. We can’t do that in the show because you’re not playing as her. So we need other tools and that context gave us that shortcut.”

“Another reason is, where that revelation happens in the game, if we were to stick to a very similar timeline, viewers would have to wait a very, very long time to get that context,” he continued. “It would probably get spoiled to them between seasons and we didn’t want that. So it felt appropriate for those reasons to move that up and give viewers that context right off the bat.”

So, “right off the bat,” we learn two things. First, that quote makes it sound like season two splits the events of Part II pretty evenly. Second, it also sounds like we learn Abby’s connection to Joel and Ellie in the first episode of the show, which comes April 13. Which, as Druckmann explains, does make sense narratively. But emotionally, it does change much of what makes the game so special. We’re anxious to see how this new medium changes that. What do you think?",gizmodo

The company will open with a special event at Apple Park on June 9–similar to the in person events held in the last couple of years. The rest of the week, developers can log on to learn what’s new and coming to the well-coifed walled garden. This event is where we learn what’s next for iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and tvOS 19 on Apple TV. And because I know you’re thinking it, there will likely be some kind of update on Apple Intelligence too.

We also expect Apple will use WWDC to reveal the heavily rumored VisionOS-like makeover for iOS 19. Apple has already left breadcrumbs with apps like Invites, hinting at what the interface will look like as it adopts a more photo-centric design. macOS 16 is also expected to get a significant redesign to match its mobile counterparts. Icons should match those of the Vision Pro with design elements like translucent windows and circular iconography.

And what about Apple Intelligence? Are we taking bets on whether the AI portion of the opening event will reference the recent strife the company has gone through? Probably not. I could see Apple explaining how it’s more private than other AI suites—the same thing it’s been sniping at Android for since the dawn of the mobile platform war—and showing off how it’s reworking contextual Siri to function like it teased it could last year. Regardless of how this goes down, it’s likely to be a little awkward as the attendees all side-eye each other over how Apple’s spinning this one.

But between the drama over Apple Intelligence and the major redesigns coming to its biggest OSes it should be a fun WWDC. If you’re a developer and want to join in person, you’ll have to sign up to request to attend the event. Everyone else can peek in and join online through the WWDC online portal and official YouTube channel.",gizmodo

As expected from big TVs, they won’t sell for pennies. The 75-inch goes for $2,500 MSRP while the 85-inch will sell for $4,000 when they launch in late spring this year.

The company already had a 55-inch and 65-inch Canvas TV, and just like those displays the larger Canvas TVs support Art Mode to display a slideshow of “curated artwork” or personal photography. It’s akin to Samsung’s own Art Mode on its pretend Frame TV, though the Korean tech giant also offers a $6-per-month subscription to “Art Store” to display a carousel of your favorite Van Goghs, Courbets, or Monets.

There’s a good reason Hisense is trying to capitalize on these stealth TVs. Samsung has been selling The Frame for close to eight years. In 2021, the company claimed it sold more than 1 million The Frame units in a single year—the most of any single home entertainment product in the company’s history. This year, Samsung started offering its Art Store to owners of its Neo QLED and QLED TV models alongside its Frame. Last year, the Korean tech giant debuted a Music Frame for even more hidden audio in a unit that looks like a typical picture frame.

The competition has had an effect. Samsung has been putting its Frames on steep discounts through the end of 2024. The company currently lists the 85- and 75-inch Frame MSRP at $3,000 and $4,300, respectively. On sale, they’re closer to $1,800 and $2,500. A more-manageable 55-inch Samsung Frame is $1,500 MSRP and on sale for $1,100. Meanwhile, Hisense’s equivalent size Canvas goes for $1,000 on Amazon before any discount.

Customers seem like they can’t get enough of TVs that don’t look like TVs. Last year, TCL debuted its NXTVision and NXTVision Pro frame TVs which also range up to the large 85 inches, though the “Pro” models are still “coming soon.”

Even when big TVs, such as Hisense’s massive micro-LED TVs, often take over headlines, cheaper is still better. Displays from TCL and Hisense’s latest QLEDs are already so good for their price it’s getting harder to argue you should go looking for a more-expensive Samsung or Sony TV. Hell, if more people keep buying picture frame TVs, it may push the cost of traditional flatscreens even further down. Those who would rather fill their walls floor to ceiling with obvious, obnoxious displays won’t need to spend extra for faux-wooden bezels.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"Yes, The Ritual Is Yet Another Exorcism Movie—but This One Stars Dan Stevens and Al Pacino",https://gizmodo.com/the-ritual-trailer-dan-stevens-al-pacino-2000580511,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:30:32 GMT","Hollywood loves a possession story—going back to The Exorcist, of course, the grandaddy of them all and still the gold standard among all demon-infested cinematic tales. In the 50-plus years since Captain Howdy’s arrival, there have been many imitators of varying degrees of quality. At first glance, The Ritual looks pretty standard (it’s based on true events and features the old priest/young priest combo, with a side of “dark past” and “faith crisis” to boot), but then you see who’s starring in it: Dan Stevens and Al Pacino.

The first teaser is here and it features Pacino doing a gruff accent while taking about being part of “the Lord’s army,” and Stevens big-eyed and freaked out while also somehow making a priest collar look kind of dapper. Less inspiring are the expected shots of a woman contorting herself while in the grip of evil, and those exaggerated bone-popping sound effects that always seem to accompany someone who’s in demonic mode.

According to a press release, The Ritual is based on “the most thoroughly documented and widely publicized exorcism in American history,” occurring in a small Iowa town in 1928. The afflicted was 46-year-old Emma Schmidt, who’d been troubled for years; whether or not that was due to medical science not understanding mental health issues at the time, or if something genuinely sinister was afoot, we may never know—but the Catholic Church really did sanction the ceremony, and it grabbed sensational newspaper headlines at the time

In addition to Stevens and Pacino, the cast includes Ashley Greene, Abigail Cowen, Maria Camila Giraldo, Meadow Williams, Patrick Fabian, and Patricia Heaton. The Ritual is directed and co-written by David Midell, and you can learn more about the historical story behind the film at its official website.

https://gizmodo.com,Trump’s Kids Launching Stablecoin After Trump Backs Regulations for Them,https://gizmodo.com/trumps-kids-launching-stablecoin-after-trump-backs-regulations-for-them-2000580428,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:18:52 GMT","World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol that was founded and run primarily by President Donald Trump’s sons, announced Tuesday that it will launch a stablecoin called USD1. That announcement comes less than one week after President Trump threw his support behind a new legal framework that would seek to normalize stablecoins.

According to Reuters, USD1 will be backed by U.S. Treasury bonds, dollars, and other cash equivalents. It’ll launch on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, with plans to expand to other protocols in the future.

Like most stablecoins, USD1 seeks to maintain a fixed value of $1 rather than be a more volatile token. Stablecoins are typically meant for crypto bros to park their cash in. Think of stablecoins like poker chips—you buy in with real cash, use the chips to play the games (in this case, throwing money into some memecoin or whatever), and then cash them out for real money again when you’re done.

But World Liberty Financial certainly seems to have a particular audience in mind with USD1. Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the company alongside the Trumps, said the company is “offering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.” So it sounds like they’re quite interested in overseas money.

That might raise a red flag, you know, with Trump being the president of the United States and whatnot. World Liberty Financial has already been accused of basically being a favor-trading fund—for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused a fraud case against Chinese national Justin Sun after he purchased millions of World Liberty Financial’s token. It seems the company is inviting other overseas interests to trust it to hold onto their money with this stablecoin project. (It’s also worth noting that Zach Witkoff’s dad, Steve Witkoff, is currently serving as the Trump administration’s Special Envoy to the Middle East.)

That is far from the only red flag flying full mast with this announcement, though. Just last week, Trump spoke at the Digital Asset Summit 2025, and called on Congress to “pass landmark legislation creating simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure”—a reference to a the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act that just got approval from the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month. That bill would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins that would effectively normalize their usage in our broader financial system.

A couple things to know about the GENIUS Act: First, the Senators who introduced it want stablecoins to “strengthen the dollar’s supremacy” and drive “demand for U.S. Treasuries” by making sure stablecoins are pegged to the dollar. Wouldn’t you know it, USD1 does exactly that. Second, critics of the bill, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have pointed out that it doesn’t offer sufficient national security protections and could allow money to funnel into stablecoins from foreign countries. World Liberty Financial is positioning its stablecoin as an option for foreign investors. Are those statements related? Who can say for sure.

Lots of money can pass through stablecoins, and it generates big bucks for its operators. Tether reported that it racked up $13 billion in profits in 2024 alone, primarily through transaction fees and interest on its treasury holdings. This, despite the fact that most stablecoins have, at some point, become unpegged from their promised value, potentially causing instability and an inability for investors to get their money out.

Seems like a promising business for the guys at World Liberty Financial, who somehow continue to be ahead of the curve on what the Trump administration plans to do with crypto regulations. Guess it’s nice to have a direct line to the guy signing the laws.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,The Hypocrisy of Pete Hegseth (If Hypocrisy Were Still a Thing),https://gizmodo.com/the-hypocrisy-of-pete-hegseth-if-hypocrisy-were-still-a-thing-2000580030,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 12:20:15 GMT","The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic revealed Monday that he had been in a Signal group chat with top defense officials as they discussed plans for strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. Jeffrey Goldberg writes that he was mistakenly added to the chat, which included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Vice President JD Vance, among others. And all of the pearl-clutching from Republicans for years about the sanctity of protecting classified data really rings hollow right about now.

Whatever you think of Hillary Clinton and the decisions she made in her campaign for president against Trump in 2016, this really does seem like her moment to shine. Clinton shared the Atlantic story on Monday with the words “you have got to be kidding me.”

👀 You have got to be kidding me.https://t.co/IhhvFvw6DG pic.twitter.com/bnNG4dGSpI — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 24, 2025

Trump was asked about the breach during a press conference on Monday and insisted it was the first time he was hearing about it.

Trump asked about his Cabinet officials including Jeffrey Goldberg on a secret war plan Signal exchange: “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business. It’s not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it.” [image or embed] — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona.bsky.social) March 24, 2025 at 11:48 AM

Republicans acted like Clinton’s email server was the most important thing in the world in 2016, including Marco Rubio, the guy who’s now Donald Trump’s Secretary of State.

Last night @seanhannity asked me about the latest news regarding Hillary's emails. This is what I had to say: pic.twitter.com/a8undb7Qkv — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 12, 2016

Hegseth himself was extremely distressed by Clinton’s handling of classified data back in 2016.

“Apparently the standard operating procedure inside the Clinton Secretary of State Office was to send emails that couldn’t otherwise be printed to the maid to print them out of a secure area or from a secure area and then hand them off,” Hegseth told Fox News before the 2016 election.

“Any security professional, military, government or otherwise, would be fired on the spot for this type of conduct and criminally prosecuted for being so reckless with this kind of information,” Hegseth continued. “The fact that she wouldn’t be held accountable for this, I think blows the mind of anyone who’s held our nation’s secrets dear, who’s had a top secret clearance like I have and others who know that even one hiccup causes a problem, let alone a standard procedure.”

What do you think ⁦@petehegseth_DoD⁩ thinks should happen to people who don’t protect our military secrets? Let’s listen, shall we: pic.twitter.com/TJuJqyKqjE — Sarah Longwell (@SarahLongwell25) March 24, 2025

Trump himself said in 2016 that he would prosecute anyone who mishandled classified information, claiming that “no one will be above the law.”

Even elected Democrats got in on the fun, ridiculing the past statements of some members of the group chat like Tulsi Gabbard. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota shared a screenshot of Gabbard from less than two weeks ago.

Unfortunately, hypocrisy doesn’t really seem to matter much during the Trump era. It’s an odd place to be for those of us old enough to remember late 20th and early 21st century politics. Hypocrisy was something that could sink your political career. A Republican hiring an undocumented maid? Devastating in 2010. The Daily Show’s entire premise in the first decade of this century was “look at these politicians being hypocritical.”

But those times are long gone. And it doesn’t matter if Trump or anybody else in his government isn’t adhering to the standards they set in years gone by. All that matter is the exercise of power. And that’s what we’re going to be living with for as long as Trump and his goons get to run this country.",gizmodo

That is according to the Financial Times, which reports that Lutnick “mentioned Musk by name.”

The comments came from Evan Feinman, who ran the rural broadband program until being pushed out last week. “The clear thrust of his directive was to increase the amount of satellite being used regardless of any other considerations,” Feinman told FT. Starlink uses satellites in low-earth orbit, offering faster speeds than older space-based internet services likes HughesNet. But Feinman has been an outspoken critic of using Starlink in place of fiber optic, as satellite-based internet cannot reach the types of speeds expected from ground-based infrastructure. Requests make a round-about trip to space and back, and consequently there is significant ping; synchronous communications like video calls or multiplayer gaming can be slow. Starlink is easy to provide initially, as customers simply need a satellite dish. But Feinman’s argument is that over the long term, rural Americans will be left with a lesser service.

While Feinman could be described as a disgruntled former employee, the allegation he’s made is not at all surprising, and another example of Musk’s influence in the White House benefiting his business empire at the expense of others. President Trump has used his platform to promote Tesla vehicles amid a sales collapse, and other agencies have considered providing contracts to Musk companies. Musk’s nearly $300 million contribution to Trump’s campaign PAC is a quid pro quo out in the open.

His newest bid for being the heart of rural America’s internet isn’t a huge surprise. During the Biden administration, the Federal Communications Commission denied nearly $900 million in subsidies to SpaceX through the Bead program, saying its service did not meet expectations regarding speed. Bead, as the rural internet program is called, is the $42.45 billion initiative launched under the Biden administration to expand high-speed broadband in rural communities. Besides denying Musk nearly a billion dollars in subsidies Bead also received criticism from Republicans as no service has yet to be deployed via the three-year old program. Three states were preparing to hit dirt just as President Trump took office for his second term.

Now Feinman is out, Starlink and SpaceX are back at the subsidies trough, and with no major technological changes to how Starlink works it is hard to see Lutnick’s comments as anything more than a favor.",gizmodo

Sure, audiences first saw some students going to France blow up on a plane. Later, we learned the students died because of coworkers on a bridge. But why did those people die? And the ones before them? The first trailer for Final Destination Bloodlines is here and, besides all manner of terrifying natural disasters, we see where the Final Destination chain of death started.

Directors Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky are at the helm for Bloodlines, which looks like a really good balance of Final Destination lore and chill-inducing incidents where death is coming for an entire family. Here’s the first full trailer.

Having just recently rewatched all the Final Destination films, I was wondering where this one would fit in. And now that we know, I’ve got to say, it’s a very strong idea. The franchise has always been about “coincidences” that aren’t coincidences, so for this installation to trace it back to what looks like 50 or 60 years earlier doesn’t just raise the stakes in this movie, it creates all manner of possible period sequels/prequels that could be made after the fact.

And just that idea that a grandmother was supposed to die, but instead lived and had a big family—and now, after decades, death has finally worked its way back to all of them, is more than a little unsettling.

The cast is largely not that well-known—Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, Richard Harmon, Owen Patrick Joyner, Anna Lore, Brec Bassinger—but yes, the late Tony Todd makes his return in what was likely one of his final roles. And you have to think, if you asked Todd years ago if he’d be okay with Final Destination being, well, one of his final destinations on film, he’d probably like that very much.

It’s the Steam Deck, it’s always the Steam Deck, and that’s mostly thanks to the console-like ease of SteamOS. There’s good news on that front (for everybody but Microsoft). We now have several videos of SteamOS working on an Asus and Lenovo handheld, and they’re running games better than their Windows counterparts, even before the official release.

Valve’s SteamOS offers the most console-like experience for handheld PCs. So after the Steam Deck maker promised that SteamOS 3.8 will support non-Valve handhelds, gamers got excited. First on the list of consoles with SteamOS preinstalled was supposed to be the Lenovo Legion Go S. The version with Valve’s operating system is supposed to arrive later this year. However, handheld-centric YouTuber Phawx posted a video of him running SteamOS on the unsupported Asus ROG Ally, one of Steam Deck’s earliest, most-capable competitors.

This isn’t exactly the full SteamOS 3.8 release, though. Phawx crowbarred SteamOS Holo onto the handheld, which means that the software doesn’t recognize the handheld’s back buttons or other device-specific inputs. It also continues to lock the handheld’s TDP, or thermal design power, at 15 W. This means the OS isn’t taking into account the Ally’s full power draw capabilities, which will necessarily limit game performance.

But here’s where things get exciting. At 15 W TDP, the Ally running SteamOS manages to outperform the Steam Deck. The Ally uses the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, which is notably more powerful than the Steam Deck’s proprietary, less powerful AMD processor. At those base settings, the Ally running SteamOS was outperforming the Steam Deck by 13 average FPS on Batman Arkham Knight. The Steam Deck still managed to outperform the Ally in a game like Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered, so it’s not like you should be gearing up to sell your precious Valve handheld on eBay. But imagine the performance and battery life you could get on the more-powerful Asus ROG Ally X.

Previously, modders have managed to run Bazzite—a Linux-based operating system made to function similarly to Valve’s SteamOS—on non Valve handhelds. YouTuber ETA Prime showed off the SteamOS 3.8 beta running on a Windows-based Lenovo Legion Go S. It supports higher RAM specs than the $550 SteamOS version that is currently up for preorder. Surprisingly, the Legion Go S running SteamOS performs marginally better than the same handheld running Windows.

SteamOS seems to be offering better performance on average compared to similar Windows builds. That could pose a problem for Microsoft, who is reportedly working with Asus on an Xbox-centric handheld. That handheld may run a version of Windows that will actually be usable on smaller screens with thumbsticks and buttons. But that effort won’t matter if SteamOS offers only an easier-to-use interface and more FPS in games. But then Windows handheld owners could upgrade their systems for themselves, which means we’re closer than ever to the perfect gaming handheld.",gizmodo

A partial solar eclipse will take place on Saturday, March 29, and will be visible throughout most of North America, Europe, as well as some parts of North and West Africa, and Northern Asia. Although it won’t be a total solar eclipse like the one that blocked our view of the Sun on April 8, 2024, the partial solar eclipse will grace our skies with a crescent-shaped Sun over the horizon.

During a partial solar eclipse, the Moon passes in front of the Sun as seen from Earth, but the central part of its shadow—known as the umbra—misses the planet, according to NASA. That’s because the Sun, Moon, and Earth are not perfectly lined up.

Instead, the Moon’s larger, fuzzy outer shadow, called the penumbra, falls on Earth, causing the Sun to appear partially obscured. A total solar eclipse is when the Moon’s umbra results in lights out on Earth along the path of totality.

When is the partial solar eclipse?

The partial solar eclipse will begin at 4:50 a.m. ET on Saturday, and will peak at 6:47 a.m. ET, according to timeanddate.com. However, it will begin at different times in different locations.

As noted, the eclipse will be partial for everyone in the Moon’s shadow. Looking at the NASA eclipse map above, the curved yellow lines show the percentage of the Sun that will be covered at peak eclipse in each location, while green lines mark when that maximum coverage happens. The orange loops show where the eclipse coincides with sunrise or sunset (left is sunrise, right is sunset), while blue shows where maximum eclipse will occur right at sunrise or sunset.

In most of North America, the partial solar eclipse will have already begun before the Sun begins to rise. Viewers looking at the eclipse from some parts of North America could be treated to a rare sight of “solar horns,” where the tips of the eclipsed Sun crescent are turned upwards as the star rises above the horizon, appearing as a pair of devil horns. The solar horns can be seen from locations in southeastern Quebec and southwest New Brunswick in Canada and in northern Maine in the U.S., according to Space.com.

In western Europe and northwestern Africa, the eclipse will begin in the mid- to late morning while in eastern Europe and northern Asia, the eclipse will mostly occur in the afternoon or early evening, according to NASA.

As seen in the map, the shadow of the Moon moves from west to east. That’s because the Moon orbits in the same direction as the rotation of Earth, although it travels twice as fast. The chart below shows timings for key U.S. cities and the extent of the eclipse in terms of percentage of the Sun that’ll be obscured. You can refer to this map to find out when the partial solar eclipse will take place at your location.

The partial eclipse will end at 8:43 a.m. ET for viewers at the last location to see it.

How to watch the partial solar eclipse

As with the total solar eclipse, you must protect your eyes while gazing up at the Sun when it is partially blocked. You must use certified eclipse glasses, or solar viewing glasses, when looking directly at the Sun, and you cannot look through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other device while wearing eclipse glasses, NASA warns. Instead, a special solar filter must be attached to the front of any optical device.

The Sun’s next big event will be on August 12, 2026, when a total solar eclipse will take over the skies in Greenland, Iceland, Spain, Russia, and a small area of Portugal, while a partial eclipse will be visible in Europe, Africa, North America, the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,The 5 Most Important Things to Remember About The Handmaid’s Tale Season 5,https://gizmodo.com/handmaids-tale-season-5-recap-hulu-2000579513,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:00:45 GMT","It’s been a long minute since we’ve spent time in the hellscape of Gilead with The Handmaid’s Tale. Season five wrapped up in November 2022, and even fans who remained loyal viewers since that absolutely searing first season might understandably have a hard time remembering where things now stand.

With a sixth season arriving soon, and a sequel series in the works, there’s fresh interest in The Handmaid’s Tale. It feels more politically relevant than ever—and the fact that it’s the final season will surely bring more focus and catharsis to its story, and maybe some real stakes for its main characters, something the show has struggled with in the past.

The story has long since expanded beyond just Gilead; June (Elisabeth Moss) escaped to Canada in episode four, reuniting with her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle), best friend Moira (Samira Wiley), and Nichole, the baby June had in Gilead with Nick (Max Minghella) and managed to smuggle to safety.

But even earlier than that, in season three, Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) was arrested in Canada for his many crimes—after his wife, Serena Waterford (Yvonne Strahovski), turned him in. Later, Fred returns the favor, ratting out Serena, and she’s also detained.

However, we also found out in season four that despite all these betrayals, and the fact that they’d long since given up on the possibility of having their own biological children, Fred has somehow gotten Serena pregnant.

Even with its main characters now living up north, The Handmaid’s Tale still has Gilead-set plotlines swirling around the remaining handmaids (including Madeline Brewer’s eye patch-wearing Janine) and the seemingly indestructible Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd), as well as the Commanders and their wives, most of whom continue to believe they’ve forced the greatest country on Earth into existence.

There are a few Gilead dissidents in the form of Nick, who’s now a married Commander himself, and Commander Lawrence (Bradley Whitford)—the original “architect of Gilead” who’s long been working to subvert his own creation. The much-diminished United States also has a major presence in the story thanks to Mark Tuello (Sam Jaeger), an agent of its government-in-exile, who has ongoing dealings with Serena as well as June and Luke.

With that in mind, here are five big things you need to remember about season five (and some relevant details from earlier installments, too) in order to be ready when season six arrives April 8 on Hulu.

Fred’s dead

There’ll be no going back to being “Offred” ever again for June. In the season four finale, Fred Waterford finally got what he deserved—a spectacularly grisly death at the hands of June and other former handmaids. Later, the victorious group gathers at a diner, and in one of her signature voice-over musings, June realizes “Everything tastes better when Fred’s dead!”

Hannah’s still in Gilead

In “Offred,” the very first episode of the show’s very first season, we saw June and her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) trying to escape Gilead with their young daughter, Hannah. It’s the inciting event of The Handmaid’s Tale, as June is captured and forced into servitude and Hannah is taken to be raised by strangers.

Though we’ve seen brief glimpses of Hannah (or “Agnes,” as she’s called in Gilead) over the years, June and Luke still haven’t been able to get her back, and June’s put herself in danger countless times throughout the seasons trying to mount a rescue. In season five, the mission takes on a new urgency when they realize Hannah, despite still being a child, is being fast-tracked into a Gilead marriage.

By the end of season five, Hannah’s still not safe, so expect her rescue to be a theme again in season six.

Emily’s gone

Sorry, Alexis Bledel fans—in season five, we learned that fan-favorite character Emily left her wife and son and headed back to Gilead, apparently with vengeance on her mind, and she hasn’t been seen since.

Could she pop up on the show’s last season, especially since the trailers suggest June is heading back to Gilead herself? It seems unlikely, since Bledel herself said in 2022 she was leaving the show ahead of season five, but anything’s possible.

Serena’s a mom

Serena finally realized her greatest dream in life when her son Noah was born, but of course the process wasn’t without drama: giving birth in No Man’s Land with the help of her sworn enemy, June, then becoming so ill she enters Canada illegally to get medical care, then being tossed into immigration detention and seeing her newborn handed over to the Gilead-affiliated Toronto family that’d been hosting her. She’s eventually able to snatch him back and escape at the end of season five.

June’s life is still in chaos

With anti-refugee sentiment rising and the pro-Gilead movement gaining a toehold, Canada’s no longer the safe haven it once was. June, Luke, and Nichole plan to flee to Hawaii, one of the few remaining U.S. states, via boat—after a train ride from Toronto to Vancouver. However, Luke ducks out at the last minute and sends June and Nichole along alone after an emotional farewell. He knows they’re safer without him, and he’s right: moments later, he’s arrested for having killed a Gilead supporter after the man tried to murder June.

Also detained at the end of season five, in Gilead: Nick, after punching Commander Lawrence at the latter’s wedding because he blames him for the attack on June; while he’s in lock-up, his pregnant wife leaves him, correctly articulating that he’s still not over June. Meanwhile, Janine is hauled away by the Eyes for her latest episode of “talking out of turn”—to the despair of Aunt Lydia, who has come to view Janine as sort of her troublemaking daughter.

So it’s June and Nichole alone, riding a train to their new life… until we suddenly realize Serena and baby Noah are on the same train. Both women smile, sort of, in a wry moment of surreal camaraderie. “You got a diaper?” Serena asks.

The Handmaid’s Tale returns to Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ April 8 with the first three season six episodes; then there’ll be a weekly rollout until the series finale May 27. A sequel series, The Testaments, is actively in the works at Hulu, though a release date has not yet been set.",gizmodo

And now, all those bits, and then some, are forming the latest massive Lego Lord of the Rings set.

This morning Lego announced that the latest addition to its Lord of the Rings line–after its grand return in 2023 with Rivendell, and last year’s huge Barad-Dûr set–will whisk builders away to the Shire. Clocking in at just over 2,000 pieces, the set includes a brand new replica of Bag End, Bilbo and Frodo’s Hobbit hole, as well as various vignettes to depict the scenes of Bilbo’s 111th birthday party–right down to the flaming magical dragon firework that Merry and Pippin pilfer.

Lego Lord of the Rings: The Shire Gallery

It’s not the first time Bag End has been made in Lego form: back in 2012, a Bag End set released as part of Lego’s sets for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but the latest recreation gives the exterior an upgrade, and its interior now depicts a few key elements from Fellowship, like Bilbo’s writing room and the kitchen where he tells Gandalf of his plans to dramatically exit the Shire. As well as Bag End, some celebration tents, and the party tree that centers Biblo’s birthday bash, the set will come with 9 minifigures: Gandalf the Grey, the only standard-sized minifigure, and then 8 hobbits: Bilbo, Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Farmer Proudfoot and his wife, and Rosie Cotton.

That’s not all the halfling you can get though. Members of Lego’s Insider program who purchase the set any time between April 2 and April 8 will receive a bonus gift build in the form of Smeagol & Deagol, a vignette recreating the opening scenes from Return of the King where Smeagol and his unfortunate brother discover the One Ring after its generations-long slumber.

Lego Lord of the Rings: The Shire will release on April 5 for $260, with early access available to Lego Insiders from April 2.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Studio Ghibli's Atsushi Okui on Princess Mononoke's Enduring Environmental Message,https://gizmodo.com/princess-mononoke-4k-interview-atsushi-okui-2000579990,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:00:26 GMT","Anime fans have long enjoyed the wide array of Studio Ghibli films, each offering unique, whimsical tales and awe-inspiring hand-drawn artwork. To celebrate the studio‘s 40th anniversary, Ghibli and Gkids are bringing back one of their most acclaimed feature films, Princess Mononoke, in IMAX with a stunning new 4k restoration.

Princess Mononoke, written and directed by famed animator Hayao Miyazaki, follows young warrior Ashitaka as he adventures in search of a cure to his life-threatening curse. During his journey, he stumbles into a heated conflict between an industrial village and San, a young girl raised by wolves fighting to stop humans from destroying the forest she calls home. Ahead of the film’s re-release, we spoke with Ghibli vice president Atsushi Okui (via translator Mihoko Imai) about film’s enduring environmental message, inspirations, and its lasting legacy.

Isaiah Colbert, io9: Studio Ghibli has habitually made an annual theatrical pilgrimage, rereleasing its films in the U.S. However, in celebration of Princess Mononoke’s 40th anniversary, this will mark the film’s first release in 4K IMAX. What does this monumental accomplishment mean to Ghibli as it embarks on making even more animated films for a global audience?

Atsushi Okui: Ghibli films have been done on film, and Mononoke is no exception. The DCP (Digital Cinema Package) data for use for the theatrical releases of these films were 2K data, so the reason we embarked on this 4k project for the Mononoke release was because the DCP was made 10 years ago and that was done in 2K because that was the standard. As more theaters, including IMAX theaters, began releasing in 4K, we thought it the opportune time to present something more high quality, which is why we embarked on this 4K project.

io9: Studio Ghibli isn’t shy about crafting stories for all ages while anchoring its tales on mature ideas like Spirited Away’s exploration of the anxieties of growing up, Kiki’s Delivery Service’s focus on creative burnout, and The Boy and the Heron’s heady themes of reconciling the loss of a loved one. Mononoke is no exception–how do you think its message of environmentalism has developed and resonated with audiences over the past 28 years?

Okui: Back in 1997, as with all of our other films, we make our films with a message that resonates with us at the time that we made it. It is a message of the time in 1997. We really never think about how the message will resonate decades hence or decades forth. But, if I were to talk about the specific case of Princess Mononoke, of course, when we made the film, it was about the environment and how we are destroying it.

The environment is personified, and all of the people who work in Iron Town—we have this battle between mankind in Iron Town [and] all of the gods including San. It’s a war between the gods and mankind and Ashitaka is trying to mediate between these two powers and find a way in which these two parties can coexist. I think that message is actually very much more resonant in today’s day and age. It has come to match what’s happening with today.

io9: Creatives are often inspired by the art they experience in their youth. Princess Mononoke has been cited as the inspiration behind many American artists and directors, including James Cameron’s Avatar films and Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko’s Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series. What works—be they other animated films or movies from the past—inspired Studio Ghibli in making Princess Mononoke?

Okui: This is something that has been said in public, but for animators or artists who have been in the very early stages of Japanese animation, the inspirations that Mr. Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have stated in the past

as inspirations, for example, are classics like a Russian animation based on [Hans Christian] Andersen’s The Snow Queen and also a French animation, The King and the Mockingbird. The style of the storytelling [Miyazaki] has drawn from such titles.

io9: Infamously, when Princess Mononoke was first distributed in the U.S., Toshio Suzuki sent Miramax a katana with “no cuts” etched into the blade. Looking back on the film, were there avenues or aspects to Princess Mononoke’s story left on the cutting room floor for the movie’s theatrical release, or was the story folks have come to love always written and animated as planned in its early drafting?

Okui: To offer you an answer to this question, we would have to talk about the way in which Mr. Miyazaki makes his films. First, there’s no script. He starts 100% on the storyboarding. We start from the storyboarding, but we don’t have 100% of the storyboarding. That’s not completed when we go into production. Only about half of the storyboarding is completed as we go into production, and then as we proceed along with the production, then he will arrive at the end of the storyboard. There will be twists and turns and changes along the way. So, that’s a long-winded way of telling you that there is no quote, unquote, first draft or original draft. So yes, that’s basically our process.

io9: Ghibli’s films have resonated around the world for their portrayal of women, especially women in leading roles like San. Do you see this kind of portrayal of strong femininity as an important perspective Ghibli wants to keep focusing on as a studio? How do you feel about the pushback in certain circles against keeping female characters at the forefront of your storytelling?

Okui: We can only say that because we make films that reflect the times as they come, we cannot necessarily promise you that our films will always have a strong female protagonist. It’s hard to say which viewpoint is correct, but I can tell you that in terms of diversity, Japan, in comparison to the rest of the world, is still very much behind. And I suppose that perhaps this recent pushback is a reflection of perhaps diversity becoming a little bit too progressive in the United States, and perhaps what’s happening right now is a reflection of that. But domestically, meaning in Japan, I can say that we’re still very much far behind. So, we have to see where our nation goes in terms of diversity going forward.

https://gizmodo.com,"Lonely People Are Even Sadder After Using Chatbots, Research Finds",https://gizmodo.com/lonely-people-are-even-sadder-after-using-chatbots-research-finds-2000580344,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:39:51 GMT","OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab last week released two new studies aimed at exploring the effect of AI chatbots on loneliness. The results are complicated, but they also line up with what we now know about social media: Chatbots can make people lonely, but the people who reported feeling more alone after heavy use of an AI tended to feel pretty alone before they started.

To do the studies, OpenAI turned over almost 40 million interactions its users had with ChatGPT to researchers at MIT. In the first study, MIT looked at the “aggregate usage” of around 6,000 “heavy users of ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode over 3 months” and surveyed 4,076 specific users to understand how the chatbot made them feel. In the second study, the researchers looked at how 981 participants interacted with ChatGPT over the course of 28 days.

The papers are in-depth and complicated and worth a close read. One of the big takeaways is that people who used the chatbots casually and didn’t engage with them emotionally didn’t report feeling lonelier at the end of the study. Yet, if a user said they were lonely before they started the study, they felt worse after it was over.

“Overall, higher daily usage—across all modalities and conversation types—correlated with higher loneliness, dependence, and problematic use, and lower socialization,” the study said.

Different kinds of interaction produced different results. Lonely users using a voice-based chatbot rather than a text-based one tended to fare worse. “Results showed that while voice-based chatbots initially appeared beneficial in mitigating loneliness and dependence compared with text-based chatbots, these advantages diminished at high usage levels, especially with a neutral-voice chatbot,” the study said.

The researchers were clear eyed about the results and compared the findings to previous studies on social media addiction and problem gaming. “The relationship between loneliness and social media use often becomes cyclical: the lonelier people are, the more time they spend on these platforms where they compare themselves with others and experience the fear of missing out, leading to more loneliness and subsequent usage,” the MIT team wrote in their paper. “Loneliness is both a cause and effect of problematic internet use.”

The researchers stressed that this first study, which looked at a large sample and relied on a lot of self-reported data, lacked a control group. It also didn’t take into account external factors like the weather and seasonal changes, two things that can have a massive impact on mood. Research into human emotional dependence on chatbots and its consequences is in its early days.

The researchers said that companies working on AI needed to study the guardrails in their services that would help mitigate the risks of exacerbating loneliness. They also said that the more a person understood about how AI systems work, the less likely they were to become dependent on it. “From a broader perspective, there is a need for a more holistic approach to AI literacy,” the study said. “Current AI literacy efforts predominantly focus on technical concepts, whereas they should also incorporate psychosocial dimensions.”

The final sentence of the first study’s “impact” section cut to the heart of the problem. “Excessive use of AI chatbots is not merely a technological issue but a societal problem, necessitating efforts to reduce loneliness and promote healthier human connections.”

The loneliness epidemic is real and complex. People are lonely for a lot of different reasons. Third places like malls, bars, and coffee shops are vanishing or becoming too expensive to use. People have migrated a lot of social interaction to the internet. Living in vast suburbs and driving on a highway to get everywhere cuts people off from each other. AI didn’t do any of this, but it could make it worse.

OpenAI partnered with MIT to conduct these studies, and that’s a willingness to engage in the problem. What worries me is that every business invariably pursues its bottom line. In these studies I see not just an open-hearted discussion about the dangers of a new technology but also a report that will tell people with a financial interest in getting new users that its product can be addictive to a certain kind of person.

This is already happening. In 2023, a Belgian man committed suicide after he had a long “relationship” with a chatbot based on GPT-4. The man had a history of depression, and his wife blamed the bot. Last year, a mother launched a lawsuit against Character.AI after her son took his life while chatting with the bot. Her 93-page court filing is a harrowing look into how Character.AI draws users in and attempts to establish an emotional connection with them.

There is a market for AI companions. They can provide an ersatz connection to the lonely. But they can also induce that feeling of loneliness. The bots are also programmed by the people selling their services. They are complex machines, but they’re still machines, and they reflect the will of their programmer, not the user.

Many of these companies, such as Replika, Character.AI, and ChatGPT, charge a recurring fee for monthly access to their best features. If, as these studies suggest, lonely people can become addicted to using the chatbots, then there’s a financial incentive to keep people lonely.

“While improving AI policy and establishing guardrails remain crucial, the broader issue lies in ensuring people have strong social support systems in real life. The increasing prevalence of loneliness suggests that focusing solely on technical solutions is insufficient, as human needs are inherently complex,” the first study said in its conclusion. “Addressing the psychosocial dimensions of AI use requires a holistic approach that integrates technological safeguards with broader societal interventions aimed at fostering meaningful human connections.”",gizmodo
https://wired.com,Trump Admin Plans to Cut Team Responsible for Critical Atomic Measurement Data,https://wired.com/story/nist-doge-layoffs-atomic-spectroscopy/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:34:53 GMT","The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is discussing plans to eliminate an entire team responsible for publishing and maintaining critical atomic measurement data in the coming weeks, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to reduce the US federal workforce, according to a March 18 email sent to dozens of outside scientists. The data in question underpins advanced scientific research around the world in areas like semiconductor manufacturing and nuclear fusion.

“We were recently informed that unless there is a major change in the Federal Government reorganization plans, the whole Atomic Spectroscopy Group will be laid off in a few weeks, in particular, since our work is not considered to be statutorily essential for the NIST mission,” Yuri Ralchenko, the group's leader, wrote in the email, which was seen by WIRED.

Ralchenko noted that atomic spectroscopy has been used to discover many new exoplanets and develop powerful new diagnostic techniques, among other applications. “Unfortunately, the story of atomic spectroscopy at NIST is coming to an end,” he wrote.

In response to a request for comment from WIRED, Ralchenko said he wasn’t permitted to speak about budget and management issues and referred questions to NIST’s public affairs department. NIST and its parent agency, the Department of Commerce, did not respond to requests for comment.

The Atomic Spectroscopy Group studies how atoms absorb or emit light, allowing researchers to identify the elements present in a given sample. It then collects and updates those calculations in the Atomic Spectra Database, a catalog of industry-leading spectroscopy information and measurements that plays a crucial role in fields like astronomy, astrophysics, and medicine. In a blog post published last week highlighting the importance of the database, NIST said it receives an average of 70,000 search requests worldwide each month.

It is “really difficult to overestimate” the importance of this data, says Evgeny Stambulchik, a senior staff research scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who started a petition to gather signatures from other researchers and members of the public who oppose the cuts to the atomic spectroscopy team. The petition currently has over 1,700 signatures.

Stambulchik, whose speciality is plasma spectroscopy, says that atomic spectroscopy is essentially the only tool that can be used to interpret remote objects in space, like those observed by the powerful James Webb telescope. It’s also basically the only tool for investigating “matter at temperatures reaching tens of million degrees,” he adds, such as inside a nuclear fusion reactor.

Another plasma physicist at a US institution who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak to the media said they use this data daily to build reliable models for designing future fusion reactors. “Losing this trusted data source would hinder private fusion companies,"" they explain.

The US scientist says the data provided by NIST’s Atomic Spectroscopy Group is useful to researchers and engineers across multiple fields. “The kind of carefully curated data this group provided underpins reliable systems like GPS and lithography,” they say. “It is this kind of rigorous science and engineering that keeps our bridges up and our power on. This is not ‘move fast and break things.’”",wired
https://wired.com,Databricks Has a Trick That Lets AI Models Improve Themselves,https://wired.com/story/databricks-has-a-trick-that-lets-ai-models-improve-themselves/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:00:11 GMT","Databricks, a company that helps big businesses build custom artificial intelligence models, has developed a machine learning trick that can boost the performance of an AI model without the need for clean labelled data.

Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, spent the past year talking to customers about the key challenges they face in getting AI to work reliably.

The problem, Frankle says, is dirty data.

”Everybody has some data, and has an idea of what they want to do,” Frankle says. But the lack of clean data makes it challenging to fine-tune a model to perform a specific task.. “Nobody shows up with nice, clean fine-tuning data that you can stick into a prompt or an [application programming interface],” for a model.

Databricks' model could allow companies to eventually deploy their own agents to perform tasks, without data quality standing in the way.

The technique offers a rare look at some of the key tricks that engineers are now using to improve the abilities of advanced AI models, especially when good data is hard to come by. The method leverages ideas that have helped produce advanced reasoning models by combining reinforcement learning, a way for AI models to improve through practice, with “synthetic,” or AI-generated training data.

The latest models from OpenAI, Google, and DeepSeek all rely heavily on reinforcement learning as well as synthetic training data. WIRED revealed that Nvidia plans to acquire Gretel, a company that specializes in synthetic data. “We're all navigating this space,” Frankle says.

The Databricks method exploits the fact that, given enough tries, even a weak model can score well on a given task or benchmark. Researchers call this method of boosting a model’s performance “best-of-N”. Databricks trained a model to predict which best-of-N result human testers would prefer, based on examples. The Databricks reward model, or DBRM, can then be used to improve the performance of other models without the need for further labelled data.

DBRM is then used to select the best outputs from a given model. This creates synthetic training data for further fine-tuning the model so that it produces a better output first time. Databricks calls its new approach Test-time Adaptive Optimization or TAO. “This method we're talking about uses some relatively lightweight reinforcement learning to basically bake the benefits of best-of-N into the model itself,” Frankle says.

He adds that the research done by Databricks shows that the TAO method improves as it is scaled up to larger, more capable models. Reinforcement learning and synthetic data are already widely used but combining them in order to improve language models is a relatively new and technically challenging technique.

Databricks is unusually open about how it develops AI because it wants to show customers that it has the skills needed to create powerful custom models for them. The company previously revealed to WIRED how it developed DBX, a cutting-edge open source large language model (LLM) from scratch.",wired
https://wired.com,Inside Silicon Valley’s Invite-Only IRL Dating Scene,https://wired.com/story/silicon-valley-invitation-only-irl-dating/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","“Greetings, Lovers, Legends, and Gods of Desire!” read the Partiful invite for the pre-Valentine’s Day gathering. “Eros, the god of love, drives us all with his mischievous arrows. On this night, we will surrender to his playful whims.” Then, sternly and in all caps: “YOU MUST BE PRE-APPROVED TO GET IN.”

A couple of days later, a text blast came in; the planners of this in-person dating meetup for singles were budgeting for 200 attendees, but more than 1,000 people applied, so there'd be a venue change. RSVPs closed at 3 pm sharp the day of the event. Then, at night, Barbarossa Lounge in San Francisco’s Financial District welcomed the lucky guests who managed to get their names on the list. The event, Love in the Stars, was hosted by local event promoter Spice King and the online platform Paloma, which describes itself as a dating-oriented members club.

Per the invitation’s instructions, attendees dressed to signal their status; the singles wore a dash of red to make themselves identifiable as the ones looking for love. Their non-single supporters wore a splash of white or gold to signal they were already spoken for. Within an hour, there was no room to move. Small talk and awkward flirting filled every inch of the dark bar, with the question “So, do you like working in tech?” bouncing around at the same tempo as the clubby beats.

Welcome to Silicon Valley’s in-person dating scene. These regular events are only accessible to those already in the know. They feature pre-vetted guest lists; invite-only gatherings at villas in Hillsborough, one of the wealthiest towns in California; WhatsApp groups that gather monthly in apartments around town; and private parties with secret locations promising Stanford alumni and “creatives” in attendance. In an area that’s notoriously tough on daters, at a time when dating app fatigue is at an all-time high, the appetite for ways to find love face-to-face is growing into a frenzy.

“We have all collectively realized that dating apps are the worst,” says Allie Hoffman, the founder of the two-year-old organization The Feels, a nationwide in-person dating event series with a strong presence in San Francisco. “There is no intention around how depleting, bot-y, ghosty, breadcrumb-y, gaslight-y and fishy they are. Nobody’s feeling seen or nourished.”

In October 2024, The Feels had hosted an exclusive event at the city’s new spa, Alchemy Springs, and another one is planned for the last week in March at The Center, a yoga and sound bath space.

“Swiping culture doesn't really work for our generation anymore,” says Spice King, a local event organizer and well-connected private investor who asked to be identified only by his internet handle to protect his career. “Online dating also tends to make you kind of miss a lot of the important things when you are actually searching for a partner.”

While the local market might be flooded with run-of-the-mill ticketed speed-dating events, the trendy gatherings of the moment—like the one hosted by Spice King and Paloma back in February—offer a buffer of curation and certainty.",wired
https://wired.com,‘Over 1 Million’ People Wanted a Cybertruck. Where Are They?,https://wired.com/story/where-did-the-one-million-people-who-wanted-a-cybertruck-go/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT","“The Cybertruck generated significant buzz with its unique design and ambitious specifications,” says Cox’s Streaty. “However, sales have fallen short of expectations due to higher-than-promised prices, lower driving range and payload capacity, and production issues. The unconventional design hasn’t resonated with traditional truck buyers, and strong competition from Rivian and Ford has intensified the market.”

The Cybertruck, she adds, is a “niche product with a unique design and high price point, which may not resonate with mainstream consumers. Additionally, recalls and quality concerns can significantly undermine customer confidence and sales, posing a substantial challenge for the Cybertruck’s market success.”

When unveiled in 2019, Musk promised the production vehicle would launch within two years, starting with a $39,900 model. At the actual launch in 2023, the base model cost $21,000 more than that. The Foundation Series model—an early-doors special—cost an additional $20,000 despite offering no physical differences other than a look-at-me logo. Nonphysical perks included lifetime cellular connectivity and “free” access to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system.

Forbes spoke with experts who estimate that Tesla sank at least $2 billion into the development of the Cybertruck. A traditional car might need 200,000 units per year to cover the research and development costs, Olav Sorenson, professor of strategy and sociology at UCLA and faculty director of its Price Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, has estimated.

Sorenson calculates that the Cybertruck, with its stainless steel body panels and unconventional construction, might require as many as 300,000 sales per year.

At current levels of Cybertruck sales Tesla “probably loses money on every one,” claims Sorenson. “It’s an innovative vehicle, but whether such an unusual design would appeal to consumers has always been a gamble. The DeLorean, the original stainless steel car, sold only about 9,000 units. Even more mainstream cars with unusual designs, such as the PT Cruiser, have struggled to reach profitable sales levels.”

Sadly for Tesla, Musk’s wedge wagon went from a million or more reservations—which many thought would take some years to work through—to walk-up availability at dealerships within months.

This swifter-than-expected softening of demand might have been partly due to the Cybertruck’s now notorious quality-control issues. “When we launched reservations for the Valkyrie, we knew that this would be a highly desirable car due to its limited production and the personnel involved in the car’s development,” says former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer. “People could rely on Aston and knew [the new car] was something we’d deliver. For the Cybertruck, we’ve seen a string of delays and a moving of the goalposts, which conveys a lack of reliability, and if the OEM isn’t reliable, why should customers be?”

A reservationist from northern Maryland, who says he was sold early on Musk’s promise of an electric pickup, spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity. “I was planning on buying a truck and wanted my next vehicle to be electric,” he says. “At the time, the Cybertruck was the only EV pickup that seemed like it would be available soon. I placed an order with $100 refundable for the mid-tier one, but then the Cybertruck took much longer than originally promised, so I canceled my reservation.” He didn’t regret this decision. “With the events of the last couple of years, and especially the last couple of months, I would never now consider buying a Tesla vehicle.”",wired
https://wired.com,Trump Officials in Signal Fiasco Attended Secret Mar-a-Lago Dinner Shortly After Celebrating Bombing,https://wired.com/story/trump-officials-signal-chat-candlelight-dinner-mar-a-lago-yemen/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:12:29 GMT","Shortly after senior Trump administration officials discussed and celebrated the bombing of Yemen in an encrypted group chat that, unbeknownst to them, included the editor in chief of The Atlantic, a subset of the group feasted at an opulent, secret dinner featuring the president where guests were asked to pay $1 million apiece to snag a seat.

The date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate attending a “candlelight” dinner that wasn’t on his public calendar. On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles. Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targeting Houthi leadership. At least 53 people, including children, were killed.

Trump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Musk’s 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED. Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the president’s brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared. Experts say the conversation appears to have violated government protocols on information sharing.

The candlelight dinner attendees included national security adviser Michael Waltz and the White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, according to a source familiar with the events. US secretary of state Marco Rubio was also present at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, according to a photograph from the following day viewed by WIRED and confirmed by a source familiar with the events.

Details of the Signal group fiasco emerged because, in the days prior to the bombing, a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled “Houthi PC small group.” (He likely meant to add US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials.) In a bombshell story, The Atlantic reported on the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing. Some of the group members appeared only by their initials.

The day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike. The Atlantic reported that Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in the Signal chat, told the group that he thought the air strikes were a “mistake.”

According to The Atlantic's reporting, Miller—who WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as “PM,” short for prime minister—effectively shut down Vance’s concern. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light,” an account with Miller’s initials wrote in the chat, according to The Atlantic. On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. “Amazing job,” wrote Waltz. “A good start,” wrote an account with the name John Ratcliffe, who is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A person who went by “MAR” in the chat, identified by The Atlantic as likely “Marco Antonio Rubio,” wrote “Good Job Pete and your team!!” referring to Pete Hegseth, secretary of defense. Waltz replied afterward: “The team in MAL did a great job too,” referring to the team positioned at Mar-a-Lago, which included Miller, Waltz, and Rubio. Trump’s team has long used the shorthand MAL to refer to Mar-a-Lago.",wired
https://wired.com,Scientists Observe Carbon Dioxide on Planets Outside the Solar System for the First Time,https://wired.com/story/scientists-observe-for-the-first-time-carbon-dioxide-on-other-planets-outside-the-solar-system/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:00:00 GMT","Carbon dioxide has been detected on a planet outside our solar system for the first time. The gas has been observed directly by the James Webb Space Telescope on four exoplanets, all belonging to the HR 8799 system, located 130 light-years from Earth. The detection of CO 2 offers clues as to how distant planets form, with the observations providing strong evidence that these four giant planets formed in much the same way as Jupiter and Saturn, through the slow formation of solid cores. The findings were published in the most recent issue of The Astronomical Journal.

“By detecting these strong formations of carbon dioxide, we have shown that there is a considerable fraction of heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, in the atmospheres of these planets,” William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “Given what we know about the star they orbit, this probably indicates that they formed by core accretion, which, for planets we can see directly, is an exciting conclusion.”

HR 8799 is a system that was born 30 million years ago, and so is young compared to our solar system, which has existed for 4.6 billion years. Still hot from their violent formation, the planets of HR 8799 emit large amounts of infrared light. This provides scientists with valuable data on how their formation compares to that of a star or brown dwarf, the term given to large gaseous planets that fail to develop into stars.

“Our hope with this type of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,” Balmer said. “We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they are similar to or different from ours. From there, we can try to understand how strange our solar system really is, or how normal it is.”

Carbon dioxide has been an essential ingredient for development of life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere in outer space.

Plus, because CO 2 condenses into tiny ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation. Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through a process in which a bunch of tiny icy particles coalesced to form a solid core, which then absorbed gas to grow into the gas giants we know today.

“We have other lines of evidence that point to the formation of these four planets in HR 8799 by this bottom-up approach,” Laurent Pueyo, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and coauthor of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “How common is this in long-period planets that we can directly image? We don’t know yet, but we propose further observations through Webb, inspired by our carbon dioxide diagnostics, to answer this question.”

Unlocking the James Webb Space Telescope’s Potential

The James Webb Space Telescope should also be given its flowers, as it has shown that it is capable of doing more than inferring the atmospheric composition of exoplanets from measurements of starlight; in fact, it has demonstrated its ability to directly analyze the chemical composition of atmospheres as far away as these.

Normally, the JWST can barely detect an exoplanet as it crosses in front of its host star, due to the great distance that separates us. But on this occasion, direct observation was made possible by the JWST’s coronagraphs—instruments that block starlight to reveal otherwise hidden worlds.

“It’s like putting your thumb in front of the sun when you look at the sky,” Balmer said. This setting, similar to a solar eclipse, allowed the team to look for infrared light at wavelengths coming from the planet that reveal specific gases and other atmospheric details.

“These giant planets have very important implications,” Balmer said. “If these huge planets act like bowling balls cruising through our solar system, they can disrupt, protect or, in a sense, do both to planets like ours.

https://wired.com,"A future has emerged where ozone holes will completely ""disappear"" from the Antarctic",https://wired.jp/article/the-antarctic-ozone-hole-is-healing/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","The stratosphere of the Earth has an ozone layer that plays a role like a sunscreen that protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays. However, when ozone holes were observed in the 1980s, where ozone concentrations in the sky were locally reduced, there has been concern that ultraviolet rays that reached the surface could cause health damage such as skin cancer.

Research at the time revealed that chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were used in refrigerants, foaming agents, and aerosol propellants in refrigerators and air conditioners, reached the stratosphere and were decomposed by ultraviolet rays under certain conditions, resulting in the product of which depletes ozone.

In response to this issue, the Montreal Protocol was adopted in 1987, with the aim of regulating the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs, halons, and carbon tetrachloride worldwide. This reduces the concentration of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere year by year, and certain results have been seen in suppressing the expansion of ozone holes. In addition, the greenhouse effect of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which had a rapid increase in production and consumption as a replacement for ozone-depleting substances, has been raised concerns, and was added to the 2016 Kigali revision to the 2016 edition of the Kigali group.

A direct result of these global efforts is the fact that the ozone layer over Antarctica is gradually recovering, a recent study has revealed. According to the report, statistical data proved that the signs of this recovery were not a coincidence product caused by natural fluctuations or an increase in greenhouse gases, but undoubtedly reduced ozone-depleting substances.

""We've seen many signs of antarctic ozone holes shrinking, but this is the first time we've ever seen that we've shown reliable quantitative data,"" explains Susan Solomon, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and specializing in environmental chemistry.

Observed data shows ""Human Fingerprints""

Researchers from Solomon and others adopted a technique called ""fingerprinting,"" which refers to fingerprint collection, to identify factors that cause the ozone layer over Antarctica to recover. This is a method of identifying artificial causes by precisely analyzing multiple factors contained in observed data and separating the effects of each of them. It was originally conceived by meteorologist Klaus Hasselman, a 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, for research into climate change.

Researchers now compared the simulations of the atmosphere created under different initial conditions and analyzed the changes that occur in the ozone layer above Antarctica in each scenario. Specifically, we examined changes in the ozone layer due to natural fluctuations, assuming that greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances do not increase, and similarly tested when only greenhouse gases increase or when only ozone depleting substances decrease. In short, by comparing these simulation results, we identified ""fingerprints"" that appear only in situations where ozone depletion substances are assumed to be reduced.

Next, when we analyzed observation data of ozone holes obtained from satellites from 2005 to the present, this unique fingerprint gradually became clearer over time, and was most prominent in 2018. The analysis results are based on observation data over 15 years, and the research team concluded that reducing ozone-depleting substances is effective with a 95% reliability. This has statistically proven that the ozone layer can be artificially protected.

If this trend continues, Solomon predicts that in the near future, the day may come when Antarctic ozone holes will completely disappear. Research using advanced analytical techniques such as fingerprinting will continue to be a powerful tool for accurately assessing countermeasures against environmental issues. As the current study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol, it seems that it is necessary for countries to work together to take measures against global environmental issues and continue to scientifically examine them.",wired
https://wired.com,What are the effective tips for taking a nap? Sleep experts explain,https://wired.jp/article/the-art-of-the-perfect-nap-sleep-science/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:00:00 GMT","*This article was originally published in The Conversation under the license of Creative Commons.

After a while, my eyelids became heavy and my concentration became less frequent. After sleeping with my eyes closed for about 30 minutes, I feel like I've recharged it. However, at night, he turns over in bed. I wonder why I can't sleep. That daytime nap made me feel very refreshed, and maybe that's the reason.

Naps are effective in improving arousal, improving mood and memory, and improving productivity. For a long time, I've been told this. However, naps can also interfere with sleep at night.

A nap is a double-edged sword. Taking a nap in the right way will refresh your brain, improve your focus, and support your mental and physical health. If you make a mistake, you will feel awkward, disorient, and have trouble falling asleep later. The key is to understand how the body regulates sleep and wakefulness.

Most people naturally lose their arousal levels in the early afternoon, usually between 1pm and 4pm. This is not just a heavy lunch. Our internal clock, or circadian rhythm, creates a cycle of awakening and fatigue throughout the day. The early afternoon slowdown is part of this rhythm, which is why many people feel sleepy at that time.

Studies have shown that short naps during this time period (ideally after being exposed to bright light) can help combat fatigue and increase alertness and improve cognitive function without interfering with nighttime sleep. These ""power naps"" allow the brain to rest without getting into deep sleep, make it easier to wake up with a refreshed mood, and are said to have less impact on night sleep.

However, there is actually a pitfall here. A nap that is too long can cause you to wake up feeling worse than before. This is caused by ""sleep inertia,"" the vague sensations and disorientation (decreased cognitive ability) that occur when you wake up from a deeper stage of sleep.

Once your nap is over 30 minutes, your brain transitions to slow wave sleep, making it much more difficult to wake up. Research shows that when awakening from deep sleep, a person can remain dull for up to an hour. These conditions can have serious consequences when safety is important, critical decisions, or machine operation. Also, if you take a nap late in the day, it reduces the body's natural sleep desire, the accumulation of sleep pressure, making it difficult to sleep at night.

If naps are essential

For some, naps are essential. For example, shift workers who work on irregular schedules often suffer from only getting fragmentary sleep. Therefore, taking a nap at a moderate timing before a night shift will increase your level of alertness and reduce the risk of mistakes and accidents. Even people who are unable to get enough sleep at night regularly due to other jobs, childcare, or other circumstances may be able to compensate for their lack of sleep by taking a nap.

Still, relying on naps instead of improving nighttime sleep is a temporary solution rather than a sustainable solution. Daytime sleep weakens the desire to sleep at night, so in cases of chronic insomnia, it is often recommended not to take a nap.

Some people use strategic naps to improve their performance. Athletes incorporate naps into their training schedules. This is to speed up muscle recovery and improve sports-related indicators such as reaction time and endurance. Some studies have shown that short, planned naps are useful for people who work in highly concentrated jobs, such as healthcare workers and aircraft crew members, to maintain concentration and reduce fatigue-related mistakes. NASA researchers report that a 26-minute nap improves long-distance flight staff performance by 34% and alertness by 54%.

How to take a good nap

Timing and environment are important for an effective nap. Keeping your nap time between 10 and 20 minutes prevents you from feeling dazed. The ideal timing is before 2pm. A nap too late can delay your body's natural sleep schedule.",wired

table of contents 量子論のパラドックス解決に挑む 「重ね合わせ」「もつれ」の捉え直し 量子重力理論へ続く重要な踏み石 まだ誰も突き止めていない

駅のホームに立って、トロッコが通過していくのを見ているとしよう。トロッコに乗った女の子が、真っ赤なボールを落とす。女の子から見ると、ボールはまっすぐ下に落ちる。だが、ホームに立つあなたからは、ボールは弧を描いてからトロッコの床に落ちるように見える。このとき、女の子はトロッコに固定され、あなたは駅のホームに固定されて、同じ事象を異なる基準系で観測しているのだ。

基準系という概念は、古典物理学の世界で長い歴史をもつ。アイザック・ニュートンからガリレオ、アルバート・アインシュタインまで、みなそれを土台にして運動の研究を進めた。基準系とは、それ自体が動く可能性のある座標系（「原点」となるゼロ点を基準にして、位置と時間を特定する方法）と考えればよい。アインシュタインは、基準系を利用して相対性理論を展開し、時間と空間は宇宙に対して固定されているのではなく、伸びたり縮んだり歪んだりする可塑性をもつ存在であることを明らかにした。

だが、量子物理学はこれまで、基準系をほぼ視野に入れてこなかった。量子物理学の実験の解説には、架空の観測者、アリスとボブがたびたび登場するが、このふたりは物理的に異なる場所にいるのが普通で、それでも共通の基準系に固定されていると想定される。

それがいま、変わりつつある。アリスがいる基準系（上の例で言うとトロッコやホームに当たる）が同時に複数の位置である可能性があることに、あるいはボブが時間の測定に使っている時計は量子論的な不確定性の影響を受ける可能性があることに、量子物理学者は気づき始めたのだ。

量子論のパラドックス解決に挑む

「量子の世界では、量子論の形式で基準系を記述する必要があります」。そう語るのは、スイス連邦工科大学チューリッヒ校の理論物理学者、レナート・レンナーだ。

2024年の論文で、チャスラヴ・ブルクナーなど、ウィーン大学および量子光学・量子情報研究所（Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information、IQOQI）の物理学者が、長年にわたって研究されてきた量子現象、つまり重ね合わせや量子もつれなどに関して、量子基準系が新しい展望を開くということを示した。その知見を受けてレンナーは、量子論の思考実験で発生する奇妙なパラドックスの一部についても、量子基準系が解決の糸口になるのではないかと考えている。

ブルクナーらは、量子基準系のロジックを通して考えれば、量子重力理論をめぐる新たな洞察につながる可能性があると期待する。量子重力理論とは、重力をほかの基本的な相互作用と同じ理論の枠に収めようとする研究である。

量子基準系というこの新しい試みについて、レンナーは「何かとてつもなく大きなことの端緒についたばかりです」と話している。

「重ね合わせ」「もつれ」の捉え直し

量子基準系という概念が初めて提唱されたのは1984年だが、2019年ごろに複数のグループがその概念を再評価したことが、近年の研究の隆盛につながった。この量子基準系をめぐる活発な議論は、わたしたちにふたつの典型的な量子の特性の捉え方の見直しを迫っている。その特性とは、ひとつは重ね合わせ、すなわち物体が同時に複数の状態を取る可能性があること、もうひとつは量子もつれ、すなわち別個の粒子が単一の量子状態を共有し、その一方を観測すると他方の状態が瞬時に決まることである。

（左から）ウィーン大学および量子光学・量子情報研究所のルカ・アパドゥラ、アン=カトリーヌ・デ・ラ・ハメット、ヴィクトリア・カベル。どの量子系がもつれ状態や重ね合わせ状態になるように見えるかは、基準系の選択によって影響を受けるということを共同研究で示した。 Photograph: Andrea Di Biagio

この議論を理解するために、ふたつの基準系を想定し、それぞれをA、Bとする。仮に、Aの基準となる原点が複数の位置に存在する可能性がある量子物体に固定されているとしよう。Bの視点から見ると、Aの位置は一定の領域にぼんやり拡がって見える。しかし、Aの視点から見ると、Bまでの距離のほうがぼやけて拡がっている。あたかも、Bが重ね合わせ状態にあるように見えるということだ。",wired

The Usff is ""starting to see our equal concentrating on the exercises of air fights between satellites in space"", said General Michael Guetlein, deputy director of the organization's space operations, using the term dogfighting, which in the context of traditional military aviation indicates a close air duel between combat aircraft.

A new threat?

""We have observed five different objects in the space to make maneuvers in a synchronized and controlled way. This is what we call Dogfighting in space. They are trying tactics, techniques and procedures for conducting space operations in orbit from one satellite to another,"" added Guetlein.

Usff confirmed to the military news site Defendesse One Che Guetlein referred to a series of satellite maneuvers detected in 2024 in the low orbit of the earth. These exercises have seen several experimental satellites as protagonists, specifically three shiyan-24c and two shijian-6 05 a/b. The Shijian-6 system is believed to have ""electronic intelligence"" skills, that is, that it can intercept communications from space.

Guetlein's observations arrived on the occasion of an annual conference dedicated to the defense sector, which recently held in Arlington, Virginia. The US General accused the opponents of the United States of being willing to ""go against international behavior rules"" generally adopted in the space sector and to do so ""in a non -secure and not very professional way"".

The race to the domain of space

The United States have reason to be nervous. This month China confirmed the existence of two satellites with advanced monitoring capacity: the first equips a camera capable of seeing human faces in very high resolution with a low terrestrial orbit, while the second has a radar system that allows you to trace what happens in the Asia-Pacific region from the high orbit of our planet.

This is just an example of the latest steps forward that Russia and above all China are doing in the spatial armaments race. ""The gap in terms of capacity was enormous, but it was significantly reduced,"" said Guetlein, who, among other threats, also mentioned satellites capable of hooking other systems and dragging them into a different orbit.

To extend the advantage over the opponents again and consolidate the ""spatial superiority"" of the United States, Guetlein asked to increase the USSF budgets and a revision of strategies to defend US satellites. ""We no longer control the technology. Commercial companies and our allies control it. Together we are better than the sum of the parties,"" commented the general.

Even the secretary of state Marco Rubio was in Mar-a-lago in the same weekend, as demonstrated by a photo of the next day viewed by Wired and confirmed by a source aware of the events.

The details of the Signal group Fiasco emerged because in the days preceding the US attack, a user with the name ""Michael Waltz"" accidentally added the director of Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg to a chat entitled ""Houthi PC Small Group"" (probably thinking he had inserted the representative for the United States Commerce Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials).

The company has been included in the manufacture project, the Trentino Development Hub with focus on the Green Technology, and now arrives on the market with zero consumption devices.

Capture energy from the earth

How do they manage to generate and retain energy? For example with the use of MFC microbial fuel cells, made thanks also to the collaboration with researchers from the University of Trento and the Biology Department of the Federico II University of Naples. ""In the ground there are colonies of microbes that by digesting nutrients generate electricity that we exploit through an electronic device - explains Carlo Sam, one of the founders - with a cubic decimeter of earth we can feed a sensor capable of measuring various parameters of the soil and air, then transmitting data every minute. They are all operations that are usually very energetic.

This technology allows with a cubic meter of soil to generate a watt of energy with which today you turn on a light. Thanks to these devices, for example, the perimeter lamps of the gardens could work even with the energy generated by the ground "". However, the applications are manifold and touch sectors such as the agricultural one, where preventive actions can make the difference between a saved and one jammed harvest:"" Insects on cultures can be monitored - continues Sam - action that normally requires a very heavy online cloud and cloud traffic.

Our sensors, on the other hand, have an instructed artificial intelligence on board that instead of the raw data package, directly processes the information we need. The camera in the object identifies targets, like some specific types of insects, matters how many there are, transmitting only the required data, reducing traffic and storage costs "".

However, the experiments do not stop at agriculture. In a morphologically complex country such as Italy, through these technologies you can also field a monitoring of the environment to prevent avalanches, forest fires or counteract hydrogeological instability, with a maintenance reduced to the bone.

Starting from March 25, parents can apply to obtain the contribution destined to bear the costs for the frequency of nursery schools and for the forms of home assistance. The subsidy, enhanced with the last maneuver, reaches up to 3,600 euros per year for children born from 2024. Already in the early hours of mass online the system showed some slowness and difficulties probably for the high number of access.

Introduced in 2017 and strengthened with the recent Budget Law, the nursery bonus aims to reduce the economic impact of the straight kindergartens, which can cost families between 300 and 600 euros per month, with even higher tips in large urban centers. The INPS has communicated that the processing of applications will begin from April 2, 2025, according to the provisions of the circular published on 20 March.

Nurse bonus, the news and the amounts scheduled for 2025

The latest financial has changed the bonus structure, updating the amounts for families with small children. The system was remodeled: until last year the maximum contribution was 3,000 euros for families with lower Isee, while now the amounts vary according to the year of birth of the child, with a differentiation between born before and after 2024 The delivery takes place in eleven monthly installments of about 327 euros each. For children born until December 2023, the contribution follows three bands: 3,000 euros for families with ISEE up to 25,000 euros; 2,500 euros per core with ISEE between 25,001 and 40,000 euros; 1,500 euros for those who have an economic indicator of more than 40,000 euros or in the case of ISEE not present or not valid. The same amount of 1,500 euros also applies to families with children born from 2024 but with ISEE over 40,000 euros.

Another novelty introduced by the Budget Law 2025 concerns the calculation of the ISEE: the contributions received from the single and universal allowance are no longer counted (the monthly contribution that families receive for children). This means that many families could find themselves with a lower ISEE and therefore get a greater contribution. For example, going from an ISEE above 25,000 euros to a lower one, the nursery bonus increases from 2,500 to 3,000 euros. If the ISEE presents irregularities, however, the nest bonus is reduced to 1,500 euros.

Requirements and methods for submitting the application

To access the nursery bonus, the main requirements are the citizenship (Italian, of an EU country or valid residence permit), the residence in Italy and a child under the age of three. Applications can only be submitted online through the INPS portal or through the patronage, until 31 December 2025. It is important that the request is sent by the parent who actually pays the straight line fees, while for home support it is necessary that the applicant alive with his son in the same home.

The applications are accepted in order of arrival, until the 937.8 million euros allocated for 2025 are exhausted. There are no income -based rankings or other criteria: only the rapidity in the presentation counts. For this, it is better not to wait for the last months of the year, because the funds could end before. The INPS specifies that the timing of the applications are normally 30 days, as established by the law. Payments will follow after verifying the documentation presented and based on the availability of funds.

Similar to a bizarre light cloud that remained visible for several minutes before vanishing, many wondered what it was and what had caused it. Let's say right away that it was not planes, birds or even aliens, but rather of a phenomenon attributable to the Falcon 9 rocket of Space X.

The spiral in the sky

After receiving many reports of the spiral in the sky, the Met Office, the National Meteorological Service of the United Kingdom, thus provided an explanation in a post on x. The spiral in the sky, the experts tell, would be a phenomenon that was probably caused by the frozen drain smoke of the Space X Falcon 9 rocket as soon as they launched. ""The frozen exhaust plume of the rocket seems to rotate in the atmosphere and reflect the light of the sun, making it appear like a spiral in the sky,"" said the Met Office. In other words, these spirals are formed when the fuel expelled from the upper stadiums of Falcon 9 freezes instantly in space due to the altitude. The frozen vortices therefore reflect the light of the sun towards the earth, making them visible in the night sky.

The Falcon path

The Falcon 9, remember, is a reusable rocket that, immediately after the launch, releases what is called its useful load, such as a satellite, which continues its journey into the terrestrial orbit. The rocket, on the other hand, turns to return home and while descending, releases the remaining fuel. At this point, as the BBC tells, the fuel freezes quickly because it is very high in the atmosphere, while it forms a spiral due to the rotary movement of the rocket. When sunlight affects frozen fuel, it is reflected showing the spiral in the sky that we observed yesterday from the earth.

The launch of the Falcon 9

Spacex's Falcon 9 rocket was launched in Florida around 18:48 (Italian time) last Monday for a mission of the United States government, known as Nrol-69 and whose purpose should be to leave satellites in orbit. As Spacex reports, in fact, the NROL-69 mission was successfully launched by the Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 6:48 pm (Italian time).",wired

iPadの上位モデルはプロフェッショナルな用途も十分にこなせるが、実際にはそこまで求めていない人も多い。もし派手な機能を求めないなら、いまだに「無印iPad」と呼ばれるAppleのベーシックモデルを買えばいい。大多数の人が欲しいのは、おそらくそういうiPadだろう。

今回登場した第11世代「iPad」（A16）もまさにそうしたモデルだ。日本では5万8800円で買える本機は、128GBストレージとA16チップを備え、まさにちょうどよい仕様に仕上がっている。

第11世代「iPad」A16（Amazonで価格をチェック）



ただし、iPadをノートPCライクに使うつもりなら話は別だ。キーボードをつけたり、Apple Pencilで本格的なイラストやデザインをしたいなら、最初からM3搭載の新しい「iPad Air」を検討しておいたほうが賢明だ。ディスプレイの表示品質も格段にきれいだし、周辺機器を揃えるとすぐに金額がかさむからだ。

M3搭載の「iPad Air」（Amazonで価格をチェック）



筆者の場合、iPadはボードゲームの「Balatro」や「カタン」「Retro Bowl Plus」を延々とプレイしたり、テレビがふさがっているときに動画を観たり、資料を読んだりしている。たまにキーボードケースをつけて文章を書くことはあるが、写真を眺めたり、SNSをだらだら見たり、友人や家族とビデオチャットしたりがメインだ。マルチタスクでクリエイティブなことをする機会はほとんどない。そんな私には無印のiPadで十分だ。

●ストレージ容量は前モデルから倍増

無印のiPadは昔からストレージ容量が不足しており不満だった。先代の第10世代iPadは64GBしかなく、記事を書くときは「ストレージは上げておいたほうがいい」とおすすめしてきた。

一方、今回の11世代iPadは同じ価格帯で128GBとストレージ容量が倍増した。もちろんパワーユーザーには物足りないかもしれないが、ストレージの増量を検討する人なら、最初からM3チップを積んだiPad Airを選んだほうがいい。ただし値段は9万8800円する。

●A16チップで少しだけ高速。でも爆速ではない

iPad（A16）はA16チップを搭載している。これは「iPhone 14 Pro」や「iPhone 15」にも使われているチップで、第10世代iPadのA14よりは速くなっているが、ぶっちぎりの性能というわけではない。

Geekbench 6のマルチコアスコアは6186で、M3搭載のiPad Air（約1万1643）のおよそ半分だ。シングルコアは2589で、これはM2世代のiPad Proと同等だ。ただ、おそらく大半の人は、このiPadでマルチタスクはしないだろう。

普段使いのアプリ、例えば動画ストリーミングや軽めのゲーム、記事を読むくらいなら、この程度の性能差はわからないはずだ。

筆者はハイスペックなiPadももちろん好きだ。プロセッサが速いほうが長く使えるし、画面も格段に美しいし、性能に余裕があるに越したことはない。

ただ、Mシリーズのチップを搭載するiPadだからといって日常的に大きく得するかというと、個人的にはそうでもない。MシリーズiPad AirやiPad Proに搭載されている追加のマルチタスク機能も、同時に4つのアプリを開ける程度で、正直そこまで活用していない。

Apple Intelligence？ 今はまだ全然実用レベルではないし、自分の生活にはあまり役立たない。今後のiPadOSではAI機能が強化されるかもしれないが、A16チップ搭載のこの第11世代iPadはそのアップデートから外れている。

今は正直、Apple Intelligenceがなくても困らない。でも1年後にはどう感じるかわからない。今は問題なくても、将来変わるかもしれない。そのあたりは自分の使い方とアップデートの方向性を見ながら判断すればいいと思う。

カメラにも変化はない。でもそれで問題ない。第10世代のアップデートですでにカメラまわり（とiPad本体のデザイン全体）が刷新されているからだ。要するに今回のモデルは、第10世代にストレージ容量とチップの性能を上げただけの変化だ。だが、横向きフロントカメラが正面に配置されているおかげで、ケースに立てて家族みんなでビデオ通話しても、画面の中央にきれいに映ってくれる。

●不満点

少し不満なのは、2024年秋に発売された最新「iPad mini」よりも仕様が劣るという点だ。

最新の8インチ「iPad mini」はA17チップを搭載しており、Apple Intelligenceを使える。それにApple Pencil Proにも対応していて、本体側面にマグネットでピタッとくっつく。

一方、今回のiPadはApple Intelligenceの対応ラインからぎりぎり外れている。それに、使えるペンはシンプルなUSB-CのApple Pencilか、Lightningアダプタが必要な初代Apple Pencilだけだ。どちらもiPad本体にマグネット装着する機能はなく、持ち歩くときは別の方法を考えるか、ペン収納ループ付きのケースでも使うしかない。

USB-CのApple Pencilはアート系アプリで使えるが、筆圧感知やホバーモード、新しいタップ操作などの機能は一切ない。本格的にアートをやるならやはり「iPad Air」や「iPad Pro」を買うべきだ。

ただ、Appleが手頃なモデルをラインナップしてくれているのはありがたい。子ども用にもいいし、シンプルに使いたいだけの人には十分だ。余計な機能を削っている分、価格が上がらなかったのは評価したい。とはいえ、次のモデルでは、もう少し上のチップを積んで、Apple Pencil Proに対応して欲しいとは思う。

The company explained to CNET that it was a temporary technical issue, but did not go into detail. The problem has already been resolved, and the new move history is now displayed in the timeline.

""Temporarily there was a technical issue that deleted some users' timeline data,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""Most users with encrypted backups on the Timeline can restore data, but users who have not enabled backups can unfortunately not recover lost data.""

According to Google, in order to restore data from a backup, you need to use the latest version of Google Maps. To import data, open the Timeline section, tap the cloud icon at the top of the screen and select Backup. The Android Authority, a technology media outlet, was the first to report on this issue.

Google Maps Timeline is a feature that allows you to record locations and routes visited, and is disabled by default.

It's not just a problem with Google

Eric Abbruzzese, director of market research firm ABI Research, said the impact was relatively minor as this time it was not a major Google service and only a small portion of the users affected.

However, if similar issues had occurred with other Google services such as Gmail and YouTube, it could have been a more serious situation.

""Google literally stores exabytes of data. If data from one service could disappear like this, the same could happen elsewhere,"" Abbruzzese notes.

Furthermore, these issues are not limited to Google, but can occur anywhere that handles large-scale data.

""This case shows that this type of issue could increase as more companies change their storage and data jurisdiction policies to keep up to date,"" he said.

https://cnet.com,"Driving with only a Myna license and smartphone is ""not portable"" and will be subject to enforcement",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230914/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:29:00 GMT","The Myna License, which began on March 24th, is a mechanism that integrates the My Number card and the driver's license. This has the advantages of not only having to carry your driver's license with you as long as you carry your My Number card while driving, but you can take courses online for renewing your license, and you can complete one-stop procedures when your address, last name, etc. have changed.

On the other hand, there are also misconceptions on social media such as, ""If you obtain a Myna license, you can drive with just your smartphone without a physical card.""

This is not a mistake in the government's future policy, but it has not yet been realized at this point.

What's confusing is that even today, ""only compatible Android smartphones can have some functions (digital certificates) of the My Number Card."" This may be one of the reasons why people misunderstood that ""My smartphone has a My Number card, so there's no need to carry an actual card with you."" In reality, it only has some features, and of course no Myna license is included.

In addition, starting from spring 2025, smartphones will be able to include ""functions equivalent to My Number cards"" such as name, address, date of birth, gender, My Number, and face photo. This will allow the smartphone itself to function as an ID card.

However, according to the National Police Agency's website, even at that time, it is not possible to install a driver's license on a smartphone, and before you can actually drive on a smartphone alone, you will need to wait for further changes.

At the 4th Digital Society Promotion Conference, the government has stated that the mobile driver's license, which allows smartphones to become driver's licenses, will ""aim to realize it as soon as possible"" after installing a My Number card on smartphones (scheduled this spring).

https://cnet.com,Will Google's new Pixel 9a be the best solution for a cheaper smartphone?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230829/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","In the mobile industry, every time new models appear, it appears to be ""finding mistakes."" Whether it's Apple's iPhone, Samsung Electronics' Galaxy, or Google's Pixel, you'll have to figure out what's actually new.

This also applies to the new Pixel 9a. The price is $499, the same as the previous model, the Pixel 8a, released in 2024, but the display has been made larger and the battery has been increased in capacity.

At the very least, the moderate expression is that Google is making a safe choice for 2025 for the A-series Pixel devices. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Like its predecessor, the Pixel 9a is easy to hold and has been generally welcomed with a welcome improvement.

The Pixel 9a's 6.3-inch OLED display is slightly larger than the Pixel 8a's 6.1-inch, but is comparable to the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Pixel 9a has a peak brightness of 2,700 nits (the Pixel 8a is 2,000), making it a little easier to read even in direct sunlight.

The Pixel 9a comes in four colors: Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris. The beauty with a unified look in wallpaper, icons and devices is unique to Google, not found in other Android manufacturers such as Samsung and OnePlus.

The processor is enhanced to the Tensor G4, which improves overall performance, power efficiency and AI workflow. The new chip and 8GB of RAM make it compatible with image processing tools such as ""Add Me"" (shown together), ""Astrophotography"" and ""Pixel Studio.""

These photo editing tools should go well with the 48 megapixel main camera. It appears to be inferior to the Pixel 8a's 64 megapixel, but the F-value ranged from 1.89 to 1.7. This is the same camera performance as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and is combined with the same 13 megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens as the Pixel 8a.

It has IP68 grade waterproof and dustproof performance, and has been increased from 4492mAh of the Pixel 8a battery capacity to 5100mAh. What's particularly noteworthy is that the battery capacity is larger than any other model in the series, such as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Other parts include wired/wireless charging speed, a 7-year software update warranty, storage options, and price, and the Pixel 8a. Overall, it is a device that is cheaper than Apple's iPhone 16e ($599), yet has more competitive features and performance. It is scheduled to be released in April.",cnet
https://cnet.com,"The possibility of ""burning out satellites in the Earth's atmosphere"" destroying the global environment -- Starlink has increased dramatically",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230890/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:08:00 GMT","According to a new study funded by NASA, communications satellites like Starlink could reduce the Earth's ozone layer as they reach their lifespan and re-enter the atmosphere. The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters.

When satellites such as Starlink reach their lifespan, they enter the atmosphere and burn out, leaving small particles of aluminum oxide at that time. This drops to the ozone layer, which absorbs ultraviolet rays. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that these oxides increased eight times between 2016 and 2022.

Not all of this increase comes from Starlink. This is because Starlink launched its first satellite in May 2019. However, the Starlink satellite is currently the overwhelming majority in low orbit.

There are approximately 8,100 artefacts in low orbit, of which more than 6,000 are Starlinks. There are plans to launch an additional 12,000 units, with the possibility of up to 42,000 in the future, Space.com reports.

These satellites reach their lifespan in about five years. For example, a satellite weighing approximately 250 kg will release approximately 30 kg of aluminum oxide fine particles upon re-entry in the atmosphere. Starlink's satellites are gradually getting heavier, with the latest model reaching approximately 1,250 kg.

Aluminum is mainly released at about 50 to 80 km above, but it takes 30 years for it to descend to the ozone layer. As of 2022, data shows that the amount of aluminum in the atmosphere has increased by 29.5% from natural values ​​due to burned-out satellites. But researchers warn that things will get worse if things continue like this.

""I'm particularly worried about the large number of satellites coming up in the future,"" Joseph Wang, one of the research authors, told CNET. ""We expect this will be an excess of 640% or more than natural value per year. That would be pretty bad.""

Unlike other ozone depleting substances, aluminum oxides are not consumed during the reaction and remain in the atmosphere for a long time. It could take 30 years for the ozone layer to be continuously damaged and eventually drop to altitude.

If Starlink scales as planned, more than 8,000 satellites will enter the atmosphere and burn out every year. If researchers fit this predictive model that expects an increase in the number of satellites, the amount of aluminum released could be 360 ​​tons, or 640% of the natural value.

●Scale-satellite proliferation brought about by Starlink

What is particularly noteworthy about this new study is that there are still many unclear parts. ""The environmental impact of satellite reentry is currently unknown,"" the study states.

Four years after the launch, Starlink accounts for 40% of all satellites launched so far in human history, and plans to increase it by seven times more in the future. Project Kuiper, a rival Amazon, is also planning to launch 3,232 satellites.

One article published in Nature pointed out that ""it's not a ""realistic possibility"" that 100,000 satellites are ""a very likely"" to happen."" Most of the reason is that private companies like SpaceX, Amazon and OneWeb are launching satellites one after another to provide high-speed internet.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), excessive ultraviolet rays can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and weakened immune systems, leading to lower crop yields and disruption in the marine food chain.

Researchers say, ""If the number of re-entries increases further, it is essential to explore more deeply the problems revealed in this study.""

Starlink did not respond to CNET's request for comment.

https://cnet.com,"""NVIDIA"", ""Claude"", ""X Æ A-12"" -- Can you pronounce it correctly?",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230918/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:43:00 GMT","The word ""NVIDIA"" is so popular that it is featured in everyday economic news, but how exactly do these tech industry terms pronounce? Here we have roughly summarized the pronunciations of 10 tech terms.

●iOS

This would be the easiest. Simply line up and pronounce ""Eye"", ""Oh"", and ""Ess"". This is what Tim Cook and Apple officials say. However, in reality, there are quite a few people who pronounce it as ""Eye-Ohs"" or ""Eye-Oss"" (read S all at once).

●NVIDIA

This is easy to make mistakes. It's easy to wonder whether it's ""EN-vi-dee-uh"" or ""IN-vid-ee-uh."" When CEO Jenson Hwang said in his keynote that he ""loves NVIDIA,"" he pronounced ""IN-vid-ee-uh,"" which is the correct answer.

(Domestic Editorial Department Note: In Japan, NVIDIA)

●Jeff Bezos

Jeff Bezos is the well-known founder of Amazon. In 2013, the Washington Post introduced the pronunciation he himself spoke in a video, and according to it it is ""BAY-zos."" ""Jeff"" is just ""Jeff.""

●Claude

The name of the Anthropic AI model. Is this ""clod"" or ""cloud""? When the CEO appeared on CNBC, he pronounced ""Clawed.""

(Domestic Editorial Department Note: ""Claude"" is common in Japan)

●HUAWEI

A Chinese tech company. Normally, it is pronounced ""WAH-way,"" but if you're going to imitate CEO Ren Zhengfei's pronunciation, it's ""HWAH-way,"" which is initially a little more H-oriented.

(Domestic Editorial Department Note: ""Huawei"" in Japan)

●SQL

Abbreviation for ""Structured Query Language"" that is often found in database-related areas. To be precise, it's better to read the words ""Ess,"" ""Cue,"" and ""Ell,"" one by one, but many people call them ""sequel.""

●Sundar Pichai

CEO of Google parent company Alphabet. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kemlani pronounced the reading of him on TikTok as ""SOON-dir PITCH-eye.""

(Domestic Editorial Department Note) In Japan, there was a time when it was once written as katakana, but Google Japan now uses the notation ""Sunda Pichai.""

●Ubisoft

If CEO Yves Guillemot is pronounced correctly, it's not ""Oo-bee-soft"" but ""YOO-bee-soft.""

(Domestic Editorial Department Note: UBISSOFT in Japan) (correction) There was an error when it first appeared

●X Æ A-12

The names of the children of Elon Musk and singer Grimes. Musk called it ""EX-ash-ay-twelve"" on the show. There are also other two children, and Musk apparently has more than 12 children in total.

●GIF

Abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. Inventor Steve Wilhite calls it ""Jif"", but many people call it ""Gif"". Both are correct, and it's a matter of preference.

2022年11月にOpenAIの「ChatGPT」が発表された以降、世界中が生成AIをいかに活用するかに注目が集まっている。生成AIを活用したクラウドサービスが次々と誕生し、ビジネスだけでなく、クリエイティブな作業やプライベートでの活用が進んでいる。 そうしたなか、AIを専用に処理するNPU（Neural Processing Unit）を内蔵したCPUが登場。AIを処理するには、CPUよりGPUのほうが得意で、これまではもっぱらGPUに頼ってきた。それが、GPUより効率よく処理するNPUの登場で、より身近にAI処理が可能となり、クラウド一辺倒だった生成AIの世界もローカルで処理するという流れになりつつある。 ローカルで処理することのメリットとしては、タイムラグの少ないリアルタイムな処理を可能にしたり、生成AIを利用するために必要な情報をクラウドへアップロードせずに済むため、データの情報漏洩や生成AIへ活用されるリスクを軽減できることだ。 NPUを内蔵したCPUは、インテルが一昨年前にインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ1）を発表。昨秋には最新CPUであるインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ2）を搭載したマシンが続々と登場している。 今回紹介する「Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition , imagined with Intel」もその1つで、大画面でありながら薄くて軽く、インテルの最新CPUであるインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー 258Vを搭載。マイクロソフトが提唱する「Copilot+ PC」に準拠し、ローカルでのAI処理をいちはやく体験ができる。そんな本製品をレビューしていこう。

グラボなしでも高い画像処理能力でクリエイティブ作業も快適

まずは外観から見ていこう。15.3型という大画面液晶を採用しながら、最薄部は約13.9mmと非常に薄く、重さは1.53kgを実現している。このサイズとしては軽く、薄くて持ち運びやすいので、モバイルワークもこなせるモデルと言える。

「Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition , imagined with Intel」のボディカラーはルナグレー。フラットなデザインでシンプルだ。 「Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition , imagined with Intel」のボディカラーはルナグレー。フラットなデザインでシンプルだ。

現像作業はタッチパッドでもできるが、画面にタッチして操作するほうが遥かに楽 現像作業はタッチパッドでもできるが、画面にタッチして操作するほうが遥かに楽 さらに、画面のリフレッシュレートは120Hzなので、スクロールが滑らか。拡大した写真をスクロールしてもヌルヌル動くので、見やすいし目も疲れにくい。ちなみに、TÜV Low Blue LightおよびEyesafe認証も取得しているので、ハードウェア的にも目の疲れを軽減する仕様になっている。

高性能でありながら、AIにより長時間駆動が可能

CPUは冒頭でも述べたように、インテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー 258Vを搭載。4つのP-coreと4つのLPE-coreの合計8コア/8スレッドで最大動作周波数は4.8GHz、NPUは最大47Topsの処理が可能となっている。 CPUとしても高性能でありながら、NPUを使ったAIによるパフォーマンスの最適化により消費電力を抑えられ、最大22.4時間（公称値）のバッテリー駆動が可能。これだけもてばモバイルワークでも電源いらずで持ち運べる。 しかも32GBのLPDDR5x 対応メモリーを搭載するのでアプリ動作も余裕。ストレージも1TBのNVMe SSDなので、すぐに逼迫する心配はない。 実際に1日持ち歩いて使ってみたが、撮影した写真を現地で取り込んだり、Lightroom Classic CSで多少写真現像したり、Wi-Fiのあるところでネットを徘徊しつつ原稿を書くなどしてみたが、朝100%のバッテリー容量で外出し、晩に戻った際は40%弱のバッテリー残量だった。 作業する際にキーボードを触ってみたが、フルサイズでキーストロークが1.4mm確保されており、しっかりと打鍵感があり、それでいて静音だ。キー配列もクセがなく、筆者のような「かな入力」ユーザーでもすんなりタイピングできるだろう。キーボードバックライトの明るさは消灯を含め3段階調整できるので、バッテリーの状態に合わせて調整できるのも嬉しい。

キーボードはクセもなく、タイピングしやすい配列。キーボードの両端にはスピーカーを搭載している キーボードはクセもなく、タイピングしやすい配列。キーボードの両端にはスピーカーを搭載している タッチパッドは80mm×135mmと非常に大きく、指触りはとても滑らか。キーボードのホームポジションに指を置いたまま、親指でクイクイっと操作できるのもいい。画面タッチのほうが操作は楽なときもあるが、極力手の動きを少ない状態で作業を進めたいときは、タッチパッドで楽に作業を進められた。

キーボードに手を置いたままタッチパッド操作も余裕 キーボードに手を置いたままタッチパッド操作も余裕 また、インターフェースがUSB-CだけでなくUSB-Aも備えているのがありがたい。最近はUSB-Cだけに絞っている製品も少なくないが、USB-A端子のアクセサリーをまだまだ使用しているので、変換アダプターを介さずに使えるのがいい。HDMI端子も備えているので、会議室のディスプレイに投影する際も手間を掛けずに接続できる。

同社は「統合オブザーバビリティSaaSプラットフォーム」を提供する企業としてグローバルでも右肩上がりの成長を継続しているといい、正井氏はその理由として積極的な研究開発投資を挙げた。年間で売上比28％を研究開発に投資しているとのことで、同氏が紹介したグローバルでのデータでは2021年以降オブザーバビリティベンダー各社の中でもDatadogの投資額が突出しており、競合に大差を付けている状況が示された。同社の市場シェアは2022年から首位を維持しているそうで、積極的な研究開発投資に支えられた製品力が市場の支持を得ているといえるだろう。

2025年の事業戦略を話した正井氏は、重点製品として「クラウドセキュリティ」「オンコール」「AI」の3つを挙げた。オンコールは2024年発表の新機能で、単純に言えばスマートフォンなどに通知を発信する機能といえる。従来はこの機能が提供されていなかったため、ユーザー企業は別途オンコール製品を用意して組み合わせて実現していたが、モニタリングから通知の発信、さらにリモートからのインシデント対応などを単一プラットフォームで実現したことで、既に多くの引き合いが来ているという。

AIに関しては、AIを活用して従来のモニタリングの機能を強化するとともに、ユーザー企業のAI環境に対する監視／管理を強化していくという2つの方向性で取り組まれる。具体的には、監視データを分析し、迅速な問題解決を支援する「Watchdog」、AIチャットボット「Bits AI」、AIスタック全体を可視化する「AI Integration」、大規模言語モデル（LLM）の可視性やパフォーマンス、セキュリティなどを総合的に支援する「LLM Observability」などが提供される（図1）。

チャネル＆アライアンス戦略に関しては、「Oracle Cloud Infrastructure」（OCI）の正式サポートが2024年に発表され、これによって「4大クラウド（Amazon Web Services、Google Cloud Platform、Microsoft Azure、OCI）全てをオブザーバビリティの観点でカバー」した。また、国内パートナーとの協業体制も強化しており、最上位となるゴールドティアパートナーが伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ（CTC）、アイレット、キンドリルジャパン、京セラコミュニケーションシステムの4社体制になったことに加え、新たなパートナー企業として東京エレクトロン デバイスとNTTデータとの契約締結が同日付で発表されている。

正井氏は、2025年の国内事業戦略として「日本市場への積極投資は今後も継続する」「日本法人の組織を拡大し、より強力に顧客、パートナーを支援可能な体制を作る」「市場カバレッジ強化については、オブザーバビリティ市場拡大を確実に捉えるため、2024年のミッドマーケット組織に続いて、2025年は関西地域担当のチームを新たに立ち上げる」「パートナーエコシステムの一層の拡大と、特にデリバリーの強化を図り、パートナービジネスの比重を高める」「新規顧客の獲得に加え、既存顧客における導入製品の拡大によってさらなる売上増を図る」「マーケティング活動では、オブザーバビリティ領域でのトッププレゼンスを獲得する」といった方針を語った。

最後に同氏は、「2024年2月の就任時には、名実ともにナンバーワンのオブザーバビリティベンダーになることを目標に掲げたが、おかげさまで2024年は多くのお客さまに恵まれ、実りの多い1年とすることができたと考えている。2025年はその成果を基に、日本企業のクラウドシフトと共に大きく成長している日本のオブザーバビリティ市場全体をけん引するリーディングカンパニーとして、パートナー企業様と共に日本企業のシステム／サービス変革に貢献できるベンダーになれるよう一層尽力する」とまとめた。",cnet

This will promote various joint developments, including the construction of software development methods and tools using the AI ​​agents of ABEJA Platform.

ABEJA Platform is an AI platform that provides a comprehensive pipeline needed for continuous AI integration. The operational cycles for utilizing deep learning can be used in each process of ""acquisition"", ""accumulation"", ""learning"", ""deployment"", and ""inference/relearning"", and the necessary infrastructure and peripheral systems can be used, making it possible to save labor and automate the implementation and operation of deep learning in particular.

According to Fujisoft, while the movement to utilize generation AI in software development is progressing, many of the development tools related to generation AI are produced overseas, and some companies cannot easily adopt them due to differences in development culture, and others cannot actively utilize them even if they are introduced because they are not effective.

In order to solve this problem, the two companies will jointly develop AI-first software development methods and tools using ABEJA Platform, an AI platform based in Japan. By combining ABEJA Platform with Fujisoft's software development technology and knowledge on generation AI, this will lead to labor savings in advanced software development tasks that engineers have traditionally been responsible for.

In the future, we will promote joint development in a wide range of fields, including development methods that utilize the generation AI and AI agent functions, and construction of tools, and modernize the development process. Additionally, the company aims to utilize the know-how gained through joint development in related fields such as test code development and test automation.",cnet

https://techcrunch.com,Google unveils a next-gen family of AI reasoning models,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/google-unveils-a-next-gen-ai-reasoning-model/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","On Tuesday, Google unveiled Gemini 2.5, a new family of AI reasoning models that pauses to “think” before answering a question.

To kick off the new family of models, Google is launching Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, a multimodal, reasoning AI model that the company claims is its most intelligent model yet. This model will be available on Tuesday in the company’s developer platform, Google AI Studio, as well as in the Gemini app for subscribers to the company’s $20-a-month AI plan, Gemini Advanced.

Moving forward, Google says all of its new AI models will have reasoning capabilities baked in.

Since OpenAI launched the first AI reasoning model in September 2024, o1, the tech industry has raced to match or exceed that model’s capabilities with their own. Today, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, and xAI all have AI reasoning models, which use extra computing power and time to fact-check and reason through problems before delivering an answer.

Reasoning techniques have helped AI models achieve new heights in math and coding tasks. Many in the tech world believe reasoning models will be a key component of AI agents, autonomous systems that can perform tasks largely sans human intervention. However, these models are also more expensive.

Google has experimented with AI reasoning models before, previously releasing a “thinking” version of Gemini in December. But Gemini 2.5 represents the company’s most serious attempt yet at besting OpenAI’s “o” series of models.

Google claims that Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforms its previous frontier AI models, and some of the leading competing AI models, on several benchmarks. Specifically, Google says it designed Gemini 2.5 to excel at creating visually compelling web apps and agentic coding applications.

On an evaluation measuring code editing, called Aider Polyglot, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 68.6%, outperforming top AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek.

However, on another test measuring software dev abilities, SWE-bench Verified, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 63.8%, outperforming OpenAI’s o3-mini and DeepSeek’s R1, but underperforming Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which scored 70.3%.

On Humanity’s Last Exam, a multimodal test consisting of thousands of crowdsourced questions relating to mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 18.8%, performing better than most rival flagship models.

To start, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro is shipping with a 1 million token context window, which means the AI model can take in roughly 750,000 words in a single go. That’s longer than the entire “Lord of The Rings” book series. And soon, Gemini 2.5 Pro will support double the input length (2 million tokens).

Google didn’t publish API pricing for Gemini 2.5 Pro. The company says it’ll share more in the coming weeks.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,A world without Caesars: How the ATProto community is rebuilding the web to return power to the people,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/a-world-without-caesars-how-the-atproto-community-is-rebuilding-the-web-to-return-power-to-the-people/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Don’t call it a Bluesky conference.

Over the weekend, the first in-person gathering devoted to those building with the AT Protocol, or ATProto — the technology that powers Bluesky’s growing social network of 33 million-plus users — was held in Seattle. At the event, developers, engineers, founders, and even members of the Bluesky team, including CEO Jay Graber, were in attendance. Many in the community were meeting each other for the first time after having only ever communicated online.

But although Bluesky is the largest app built on ATProto at this time, the social network itself was not the ATmosphere Conference’s focus. Here, Bluesky was just another developer — albeit a prominent one, given its stewardship of ATProto, the social networking protocol that offers a framework for building a decentralized social network.

Image Credits:TechCrunch

Instead, the conference was dedicated to the protocol itself and its many possibilities, which include building not only other types of social apps, but also communities and giving people a way to sign in across apps and web services with an open social identity via the authentication standard OAuth, and more.

The conference was about putting users back in control over their data, as well as their algorithms and their overall online experience.

In short, the 150+ people in attendance, alongside others in the community who attended virtually, are working to rebuild the web by putting the power back in the hands of the people who actually use the web.

That also means, to some extent, taking the power away from the billionaire tech oligarchs — the “Caesars,” as Graber’s viral T-shirt mocking Mark Zuckerberg recently alluded to; these tech CEOs now control the majority of our online experience, from search to social connection, to communication to productivity, and beyond.

It’s no surprise, then, that self-described anarchists, mutual aid devotees, and open source advocates could be found among the ATProto conference’s attendees.

But for some in attendance, longtime idealism has been tempered by the reality of what they’ve already built and watched fail, including public products like Twitter and earlier efforts at decentralized apps.

This time around, they aim to learn from those mistakes.

Kicking off the event, Blaine Cook, the co-author of the OAuth standard and protocol WebFinger, and former lead developer at Twitter, spoke of his time at the social network that’s now called X. While there, he coined the word “tweet” and designed replies before watching Twitter become “corrupted by capital and a lack of imagination,” he said. Yet he still thinks of Twitter as the “most visceral representation of public human communication and ideas that anyone has ever created.”

Cook, who was pushed out of Twitter for trying to decentralize it, compared today’s decentralized social web, which includes Bluesky, as more akin to a jungle — something that makes sense for the individual creatures within it but is seemingly chaotic to outside observers.

That’s especially true in these early days where multiple protocols are in use, including not only ATProto, but also ActivityPub (which underpins apps like Mastodon and Threads), Nostr, Farcaster, and others. Even the web’s inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, is working on decentralized technologies designed to give the power back to the users.

“I’ve known in my bones for almost decades now that a more free social system was both possible and inevitable,” Cook told the audience, “and it’s always a revolution that’s really stuck with me.”

Cook’s speech set the tone for the event: one that acknowledges the missteps of the past but also holds hope for the future.

Later, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber spoke of the promise that the web once held, and how she later grew pessimistic as it turned into a tool to surveil and control instead of liberate and create.

“We have built a civilization of the mind in cyberspace, but we’ve ended up giving over our lives to large, centralized platforms whose CEOs have styled themselves as self-made monarchs of the kingdoms that we’ve built for them with our data and our time,” said Graber.

“We have to remember where the power really lies because we gave them that power and we can take it back.”

At her speech’s conclusion, the audience erupted with applause and hoots that lasted a good half a minute. This was no mere developers’ conference. This was a movement.

Other presenters showed off their projects, detailed various aspects of the ATProto technology, and spoke about what’s ahead. Some proposed solutions to current issues.

Speakers at the event contributed their specific expertise, whether that was addressing the challenges around online communication, finding pathways to funding, or even experimenting with wild ideas, like running Bluesky on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer.

BlackSky founder Rudy Fraser hit an emotional note on Saturday when talking about using ATProto to build communities. His project today offers moderation and support that makes social media a safer place for Black users, including those migrating from the online community known as Black Twitter. Eventually, BlackSky may run on all of its own ATProto-based infrastructure and offer its own consumer-facing client.

However, conference attendees were reminded that new technologies alone aren’t the answer — there’s a need for a whole ecosystem of support and funding for these efforts, too.

For instance, technologist and feed builder Ændra Rininsland spoke up on Sunday about the struggles the trans community has faced — and continues to face — even on open social platforms.

One part of the challenge is that the people who run moderation services like Bluesky labelers (who flag or auto-hide posts you don’t want to see) are often personally and financially burdened by their efforts. They can burn out and break down, as Rininsland said she had — twice.

But despite this, she still expressed optimism, pointing to projects like Northsky Social, which is building on the ideas put forth by BlackSky to use ATProto to create a safer social media experience for the LGBTQIA+ community.

“They’re ambitious goals, but we’re trying,” Rininsland said. “Trans people won’t be silenced by this or any other administration. And if it means we have set up an entire parallel infrastructure, our entire damn social network, then you bet your asses we’ll do that.”

Unlike the “Careless People” who built Facebook, the ATProto community aims to mitigate the harm that introducing new technologies can bring, and they’re looking to experts who can help guide them as they build.

On Sunday, Erin Kissane, a content and editorial strategist who once wrote a 40,000-word essay on how Facebook contributed to the genocide in Myanmar, joined remotely (while under the weather, no less!) to share with attendees her deep understanding of how to build safer online communities.

Image Credits:TechCrunch

At a time when much of tech is unwinding its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the interest of catering to the Trump administration’s policies, Kissane’s advice went in the opposite direction. She advised builders to actively seek out “the intelligent and informed perspectives of the most vulnerable people in groups that you’re building for before and during rollouts and changes.”

“If you can keep the most vulnerable people safe, you can keep everyone safe,” said Kissane.

These are not radical ideas but have become politically charged issues.

As the event concluded, some attendees left to immediately begin hacking on projects with connections they formed over the weekend. Promises to continue talking and connecting were made, and an active Discord chat filled with people who have now met in person.

“I go to a lot of events in [San Franscico],” Tessa Brown, the co-founder of secure chat app Germ Network, told TechCrunch. “And it’s like … everything started today, and everything is just the future. There’s no lessons from the past.”

By comparison, Brown added, “Everyone here is just so thoughtful about how we got to this moment … It feels very different.”

https://techcrunch.com,"Once a target of Musk’s ire, Gen Z creator Kat Abughazaleh is running for Congress",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/once-a-target-of-musks-ire-gen-z-creator-kat-abughazaleh-is-running-for-congress/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When Kat Abughazaleh got laid off from her job as an extremism researcher and video producer at Media Matters last year, Elon Musk personally chimed in on X to celebrate her misfortune.

“Karma is real,” Musk said.

But as Abughazaleh said in a video on Monday announcing her campaign for Congress, she’s not afraid of standing up to Musk, especially as his influence on the federal government escalates.

Instead, the 26-year-old has her eye on Illinois’ Ninth District. The current representative, the 80-year-old Democrat Jan Schakowsky, was first elected to Congress before Abughazaleh was even born.

“I have ideas that I want to push, and I have a big [social media] platform,” Abughazaleh told TechCrunch on Monday. “I felt I didn’t want to wait around for someone to do something when I could do something right now.”

Abughazaleh built her online audience through her work at Media Matters, where she became known for making videos decoding the rhetoric and inaccuracies of Fox News. But when Musk sued Media Matters over an article about how X placed advertisements alongside pro-Nazi content, the mounting legal costs led the nonprofit to lay off Abughazaleh and 12 others.

Now an independent social media creator, she has amassed over half a million followers across platforms for her progressive political content, with her biggest audience (222,000 followers) on TikTok.

“There is absolutely no reason you shouldn’t be able to afford housing, groceries, and healthcare with some money leftover,” she said in her campaign announcement. “Families should have free childcare, Social Security should be expanded, and our inalienable rights shouldn’t be dependent on who’s in power.”

Abughazaleh didn’t expect her run-ins with Musk to be relatable to the broader public. But over 10 months after Musk celebrated her layoff, more than 30,000 federal employees now know the feeling of losing their jobs due to the billionaire’s machinations.

“A lot of people in journalism, especially on this disinformation beat, have been going through kind of a trial period, or a practice run, a dry run of what Trump and Musk have been doing to the rest of the country,” she told TechCrunch.

“We knew what was going to happen… We are upset that we’re right, but that also means that we have tools to fight back and know what’s happening and know how to handle it.”

While young people have historically leaned liberal, Gen Z voters shifted more conservative in last year’s election. Abughazaleh thinks this a product of poor outreach from Democrats.

“I think the big problem Democrats have is their digital strategy, and people like me and people that are younger have a better understanding [of the internet],” she said. “It’s something that we grew up with.”

Some critics may think her age is a double-edged sword since she’s young enough to have a lengthy online footprint. But Abughazaleh isn’t worried. As she wrote to one skeptic on X, “I hope you enjoy my middle school One Direction fan blog and pictures of my cat.”

In the era of Trump — the president literally owns a social media platform where he posts constantly — it’s not so taboo anymore to show personality online.

“We have a president that posts whatever comes to his mind at any time,” she said. “I think that we’re fine with just like, having a presence from age 13.”

Given her history with Musk, she isn’t planning to center X in her digital strategy. Above all other social media platforms, Abughazaleh is prioritizing Bluesky, where she has around 154,000 followers.

On Monday, for example, she posted her campaign announcement exclusively on Bluesky for an hour and a half before moving to other platforms.

“I really like Bluesky’s policies on a lot of of things,” she said. “They’re hiring more moderators, and a lot of other places aren’t moderating, or are firing moderators.”

Meta, for instance, overhauled its content moderation policies in January, ending its third-party fact-checking program.

Bluesky has grown to over 33 million users, and even former president Barack Obama joined the platform over the weekend. But its population is still relatively small compared to longstanding social giants like Instagram or X.

Regardless, Abughazaleh’s strategy has proven successful thus far. In the first seven hours of her campaign, she raised $100,000, with an average contribution of $45.

“We’ve gotten the most donations on social media from Bluesky so far out of any other platform,” Abughazaleh told TechCrunch.

Abughazaleh is also enthusiastic about the open source nature of Bluesky. She’s trying to echo that transparency on her YouTube channel, where she plans to share videos documenting her campaign experience.

“I’m tying to be really transparent about how to run for office, because I feel like it’s kind of this black hole that seems a lot more difficult than it should be,” she said.

Even if she doesn’t win a seat in Congress, she hopes that her openness about this process will inspire other Gen Z candidates to run.

“If this campaign goes as planned, I would be the youngest woman elected to Congress,” she said. “But I think it would be cool if we had another candidate that came in and was even younger than me.”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Outreach founder Manny Medina has a new startup that helps AI agents get paid,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/outreach-founder-manny-medina-has-a-new-startup-that-helps-ai-agents-get-paid/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","As the year of the AI agent takes shape, a new trend is emerging: startups offering the picks and shovels that help employers build a workforce of bots.

Manny Medina, best known as the founder and former CEO of the $4.4 billion valued sales automation company Outreach, just launched one such startup called Paid, he told TechCrunch exclusively.



Paid doesn’t make AI agents. It offers a platform that makes sure they get paid, profitably. Paid announced Monday that it raised €10 million (about $11 million) in a pre-seed investment from European powerhouse EQT Ventures, Sequoia, and GTMFund.

Medina came up with the idea for Paid after spending months talking to dozens of agentic platform startups. In these conversations, a common complaint emerged. “They didn’t really know what to charge,” Medina told TechCrunch.

The premise of Paid is that the old ways of charging for software won’t work with AI agents. Agentic companies can’t charge per user or per seat, meaning based on how many people are using the software (like old-school Microsoft Office). The whole point is that one employee could run lots of agents. Or agents will run by themselves with no human overseer at all.

Companies developing AI agents also can’t charge like the last big generational change in software, SaaS, charging by usage because, if agents work properly, they “are taking over a whole role,” Medina says.

An agent’s customer doesn’t want to pay for all the discrete tasks an agent does — if it even knows them all, he says. They want to pay for its results, like an employee. So if an agent is hired in insurance and the role’s success is measured in completed policy renewals, a company doesn’t want to pay for each email the agent sent.

At the same time, the costs associated with providing agents are variable, depending on how many LLM tokens it needs to execute its training and its tasks.

“So how do you help them price for the job that they’re delivering?” Medina said of the startups offering agents. “They needed the ability to try new things with different customers. They needed the ability to measure their margins.”

Billing meets HR management

Agents are so new that startups haven’t had to deal with processes that provide profitable billing, let alone renewals. Paid allows agentic startups to create pricing — fixed or variable — with an eye to profitable margins.

In doing so, it also tracks agents’ output, which also lets startups validate the return on investment.

It’s the AI agent era version of Zuora (SaaS renewal billing software) meets SuccessFactors (SaaS HR management software).

The Paid platform is being marketed to startups, rather than enterprises like Salesforce and Microsoft, which are also offering agentic platforms. Paid has three such companies as beta customers, it says: Logic.app, 11x, VidLab7, Artisan, and HappyRobot.

“Agents are replacing roles, human roles, not the entire job, but entire roles,” Medina says.

He’s also practicing what he preaches, using AI to build this new startup. Paid engineers vibe coded the initial product demos with tools like v0, Replit, and Lovable.

“This is what is so much fun about building a company right now. We have two engineers, and we have built the entirety of the building platform in a month. Why? Because we build everything on AI,” he said.

Medina has experience building companies from nothing. The former Microsoftie, who has been a well known part of the Seattle tech scene for decades, took Outreach from $0 when he founded it in 2011 to 800 employees and $250 million in annual recurring revenue by the time he left the CEO role in September.

Medina left the executive chairman role in March, though he remains on the board. He, and Paid, are now based in London.",techcrunch

Apple said that since launching streaming for DJ Mix sets in 2021, the company has added thousands of sets on the platform.

Different music streaming platforms have been looking into providing more tooling for song creation and remixing. In 2024, SoundCloud announced integration with six tools for editing, remixing, and custom sample creation. Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Spotify is thinking about introducing tools and subscriptions that will allow users to remix songs. Startups like Point72 Ventures-backed Hook are also trying to create a market for legal remixes through their apps.",techcrunch

Before it can launch commercially, the company will have to up its lobbying game in the capital, where autonomous vehicle permits still require a human behind the wheel.

The news from Waymo comes as the Alphabet-owned company aggressively expands its robotaxi coverage to cement its lead ahead of potential competitors like Amazon’s Zoox and Elon Musk’s Tesla. Musk said Tesla will launch a robotaxi service in Austin this summer and California at some point this year.

Waymo already operates a commercial service in Phoenix, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and more recently Austin, in partnership with ride-hail firm Uber. Waymo also intends to launch a robotaxi service via Uber in Atlanta this year and has already begun ferrying employees in fully autonomous vehicles in the city. Miami is next on Waymo’s public launch list for 2026, alongside Washington, D.C.

To raise even more enthusiasm and awareness, Waymo has said it plans to begin mapping in 10 cities this year, including Las Vegas, San Diego, and, as of Monday, Nashville.

Waymo’s Washington, D.C., announcement comes two months after the company launched a small test fleet of its Jaguar I-Pace robotaxis in the city, where it’s been driving manually and testing autonomously with a safety driver behind the wheel.

Waymo’s business model is contingent upon removing the human driver from the vehicle. The company said it will work with policymakers to update the district’s permitting rules to allow for fully autonomous vehicles to drive on public roads.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Earth AI’s algorithms found critical minerals in places everyone else ignored,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/earth-ais-algorithms-found-critical-minerals-in-places-everyone-else-ignored/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Last summer, mining startup KoBold made a splash when it said it had discovered in Zambia one of the world’s largest copper deposits in more than a decade.

Now, another startup, Earth AI, exclusively told TechCrunch about its own discovery: promising deposits of critical minerals in parts of Australia that other mining outfits had ignored for decades. While it’s still not known whether they are as large as KoBold’s, the news suggests that future supplies of critical minerals are likely to emerge from a combination of field data parsed by artificial intelligence.

“The actual, real frontier [in mining] is not so much geographical as it is technological,” Roman Teslyuk, founder and CEO of Earth AI, told TechCrunch.

Earth AI has identified deposits of copper, cobalt, and gold in the Northern Territory and silver, molybdenum, and tin at another site in New South Wales, 310 miles (500 kilometers) northwest of Sydney.

Earth AI discovered promising deposits of critical minerals in two regions of Australia that had been previously overlooked. Image Credits:Earth AI

Earth AI emerged from Teslyuk’s graduate studies. Teslyuk, a native of Ukraine, was working toward a doctorate at the University of Sydney, where he became familiar with the mining industry in Australia. There, the government owns the rights to mineral deposits, and it leases them in six-year terms. Since the 1970s, he said, exploration companies are required to submit their data to a national archive.

“For some reason, nobody’s using them,” he said. “If I could build an algorithm that can absorb all that knowledge and learn from the failures and successes of millions of geologists in the past, I can make much better predictions about where to find minerals in the future.”

Teslyuk started Earth AI as a software company focused on making predictions about potential deposits, then approaching customers who might be interested in exploring sites further. But the customers were hesitant to invest, in part because they didn’t want to bet millions on the predictions of an unproven technology.

“Mining is a very conservative industry,” Teslyuk said. “Everything outside of the approved dogma is considered heresy.”

So Earth AI decided to develop its own drilling equipment to prove that the sites it identified were as promising as its software suggested. The company was accepted to Y Combinator’s spring 2019 cohort, and it spent the next few years refining its hardware and software. In January, Earth AI raised a $20 million Series B.

Though the company uses AI to search for minerals like KoBold, Teslyuk says it takes a different tack. Earth AI’s algorithms, he said, are trained to scan wide areas quickly and efficiently to find deposits that might otherwise have been overlooked.

“The way we used to explore for metals in the past, the 20th century, it just takes very, very long. It takes decades to find something,” Teslyuk said. “With the modern pace of the world, you just can’t wait for that long.”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Instagram partners with schools to prioritize reports of online bullying and student safety,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/instagram-helps-schools-quickly-report-and-remove-posts-made-by-students/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Instagram on Tuesday announced a new school partnership program aimed at expediting the handling of moderation reports submitted by verified school accounts.

The program is currently available to all middle and high schools in the U.S. It allows schools to report posts or student accounts that may violate the app’s guidelines directly to Instagram. These reports are then automatically prioritized for review, and schools are alerted to actions taken.

The company says the goal is to help educators report potential teen safety issues, including bullying, more directly.

Participating schools will feature a “school partner” banner on their profiles, indicating their involvement in the program. Additionally, Instagram will offer educational resources with tips for safely using the app to educators, parents, guardians, and students.

For the past year, Instagram has tested its new program with 60 schools and collaborated with the International Society for Technology in Education and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ISTE+ASCD) to create the program.

Other U.S. middle and high schools can sign up to join the program’s waitlist.

The new program comes as senators advance the Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA), which seeks to ban social media access for kids under 13. In February, the Senate Committee on Commerce approved the bill. The U.S. Senate has passed two related bills: the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Instagram has taken other steps focused on online safety. For instance, it launched teen accounts for users under the age of 16, which are set to private by default and have restrictions on messaging, alongside parental controls and other limitations.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,ChatGPT’s image-generation feature gets an upgrade,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/chatgpts-image-generation-feature-gets-an-upgrade/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","During a livestream on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the first major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities in over a year.

ChatGPT can now leverage the company’s GPT-4o model to natively create and modify images and photos. GPT-4o has long underpinned the AI-powered chatbot platform, but until now, the model has been able to generate and edit only text — not images.

Altman said GPT-4o native image generation is live today in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation product, for subscribers to the company’s $200-a-month Pro plan. OpenAI says the feature is rolling out soon to Plus and free users of ChatGPT, as well as developers using the company’s API service.

GPT-4o with image output “thinks” a bit longer than the image-generation model it effectively replaces, DALL-E 3, to make what OpenAI describes as more accurate and detailed images. GPT-4o can edit existing images, including images with people in them — transforming them or “inpainting” details like foreground and background objects.

To power the new image feature, OpenAI told the Wall Street Journal it trained GPT-4o on “publicly available data,” as well as proprietary data from its partnerships with companies like Shutterstock.

Many generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage, so they keep it and any information related to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive for companies to reveal much.

“We’re respecting of the artists’ rights in terms of how we do the output, and we have policies in place that prevent us from generating images that directly mimic any living artists’ work,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, in a statement to the Journal.

OpenAI offers an opt-out form that allows creators to request that their works be removed from its training datasets. The company also says that it respects requests to disallow its web-scraping bots from collecting training data, including images, from websites.

ChatGPT’s upgraded image-generation feature follows on the heels of Google’s experimental native image output for Gemini 2.0 Flash, one of the company’s flagship models. The powerful feature went viral on social media — but not necessarily for the best reasons. Gemini 2.0 Flash’s image component turned out to have few guardrails, allowing people to remove watermarks and create images depicting copyrighted characters.

The company has said that “data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.” However, security experts and lawmakers have cautioned customers to take action to protect their data, considering that a new owner could change how the company’s data is managed and used.

If you’re one of the 15 million people who shared their DNA with 23andMe, we’ve outlined the steps you can take to protect yourself. While you can’t delete all your 23andMe data, there are some things you can control.

It’s worth noting that the data-removal process may take some time, as users have reported that 23andMe’s website is functioning slower than usual, likely due to people flocking to the site to delete their data.

How to delete your 23andMe data

To delete your data from 23andMe, you need to log in to your account and then follow these steps:

Navigate to the Settings section of your profile.

section of your profile. Scroll down to the selection labeled 23andMe Data .

. Click the View option and scroll to the Delete Data section.

option and scroll to the section. Select the Permanently Delete Data button.

You will then receive an email from 23andMe with a link that will allow you to confirm your deletion request.

You can choose to download a copy of your data before deleting it.

There is an important caveat, as 23andMe’s privacy policy states that the company and its labs “will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations.”

The policy continues: “23andMe will also retain limited information related to your account and data deletion request, including but not limited to, your email address, account deletion request identifier, communications related to inquiries or complaints and legal agreements for a limited period of time as required by law, contractual obligations, and/or as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and for audit and compliance purposes.”

This essentially means that 23andMe may keep some of your information for an unspecified amount of time.

How to destroy your 23andMe test sample and revoke permission for your data to be used for research

If you previously opted to have your saliva sample and DNA stored by 23andMe, you can change this setting.

To revoke your permission, go into your 23andMe account settings page and then navigate to Preferences.

In addition, if you previously agreed to 23andMe and third-party researchers using your genetic data and sample for research, you can withdraw consent from the Research and Product Consents section in your account settings.

While you can reverse that consent, there’s no way for you to delete that information.

Check in with your family members

Once you have requested the deletion of your data, it’s important to check in with your family members and encourage them to do the same because it’s not just their DNA that’s at risk of sale — it also affects people they are related to.

And while you’re at it, it’s worth checking in with your friends to ensure that all of your loved ones are taking steps to protect their data.",techcrunch

https://techcrunch.com,Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems hits key reactor construction milestone,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/bill-gates-backed-commonwealth-fusion-systems-hits-key-reactor-construction-milestone/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) marked a major milestone Tuesday morning, announcing the installation of a key component of its SPARC demonstration reactor.

The new part is a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle that forms the foundation of the tokamak, the doughnut-shaped heart of a fusion reactor that CFS hopes will be the first of its kind to generate more power than it consumes. Called the cryostat base, it was made in Italy and shipped halfway around the world to CFS’s site in Devens, Massachusetts.

“It is the first piece of the actual fusion machine,” Alex Creely, director of tokamak operations at CFS, told TechCrunch. Work at the site has been underway now for more than three years as the company constructs the buildings and machinery that will support the reactor’s core.

“It’s a big deal for us, because it means we’re transitioning into a new stage of the project where we’re not building an industrial facility — we’re still doing that a bit — but we’re also now building the actual tokamak itself,” he said.

CFS is one of many startups that have emerged in recent years to pursue fusion power, which promises to deliver gigawatts of pollution-free electricity from a hydrogen fuel derived from seawater. Investors have been counting on the technology to meet future power needs, which are skyrocketing as heavy users like electric vehicles and data centers proliferate.

The company, which is backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, among other investors, is widely considered to be one of the best prospects to prove whether fusion power is commercially feasible. The company announced in December that its first commercial-scale reactor will be located outside Richmond, Virginia.

Sparc is expected to come online in 2027, and if it works as CFS anticipates, it could be the first tokamak to produce more power than it takes to run. So far, only the Department of Energy’s National Ignition Facility has been able to hit so-called scientific break-even in a string of successful experiments, the first of which occurred in December 2022.

But the NIF’s reactor differs significantly from CFS’s, using lasers to compress a fuel pellet to fusion conditions. CFS’s tokamak uses magnets to herd 100 million degree C plasma into a tight doughnut shape, confining and compressing it until fusion occurs.

Tokamaks use superconducting magnets to generate the powerful magnetic fields required to coral the plasma. Those magnets need to be cooled to –253 degrees C using liquid helium. The cryostat helps maintain those frigid conditions, acting like a thermos by insulating it from ambient temperatures. “The cryostat base is basically like the bottom of the thermos,” Creely said.

Just like someone receiving an Amazon package, CFS had to unbox and inspect the cryostat base before installing it. But unlike an e-commerce package that takes a few seconds to open, it took the CFS team a few days to remove the shipping material and another week “just to make sure that nothing got damaged in shipping,” Creely said.

The CFS team then moved the cryostat base to the tokamak hall, where precisely placed bolts protruded from the concrete foundation awaiting the stainless steel disk. “Then you grout it in,” he said.

Alongside the cryostat base, work continues on the other three major pieces of the tokamak, which will be assembled simultaneously into their final configuration either late this year or early next year. After that, CFS will ensure all the pieces are working together as planned, a process known as commissioning, which will take months.

“This is the first of a kind,” Creely said. “There’s not just like an on button and it turns on.”",techcrunch

In a stunning shift, automaker after automaker — from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes — followed suit. By the end of 2023, nearly every major automaker had agreed to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and promised EV owners that adapters would soon be on their way.

Many non-Tesla customers are still waiting. However, recent announcements from automakers may provide an electric lining of optimism.

TechCrunch is tracking which brands have access to the Tesla Supercharging Network and will be updating this list.

The shift to the Tesla EV charging standard

In November 2022, Tesla shared its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America. At the time, every other automaker was using the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) in North America.

Mass adoption seemed unlikely at the time even though Tesla’s charging network was considered far superior thanks to its robust and user-friendly design and the ease of paying for the EV juice.

Six months later, Ford became the first to announce it would work with Tesla in a deal that would give its customers access to more than 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. But it wasn’t just about giving Ford EV owners access to a special adapter. Ford also committed to integrating its future EVs with NACS ports instead of CCS.

Rivian, GM, BMW, Honda, Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, and Stellantis followed.

Tesla charging FAQs

In the U.S. today, there are 36,499 NACS ports available publicly (although some of those might be from other EV charging companies that have adapted Tesla’s standard), compared to around 16,925 CCS ports. That’s despite federal dollars that have gone explicitly to the buildout of CCS chargers.

For EV owners stuck with a CCS port, they’ll have to hold out for manufacturer-approved adapters. While there are some third-party adapters that claim to be compliant with certain safety and performance standards, like Lectron’s Vortex Plug for $199, Tesla’s website says such adapters are prohibited.

A GM spokesperson told TechCrunch its adapters have been specifically designed to protect GM EV batteries while charging and that its vehicle warranty doesn’t cover damage to vehicle parts resulting from the use of non-GM approved adapters.

In late August, Tesla posted on X that it had ramped up production of adapters. That statement, combined with GM’s announcement, could mean that even more non-Tesla EVs will be pulling up to Supercharger stations soon. They’ll all have to download the Tesla app so they can pay for charging.

Tesla supercharging access checklist

Ford

Certain Ford customers officially gained access to Tesla Superchargers in February 2024, but ongoing supply constraints have delayed the delivery of free fast-charging adapters for most customers (although Ford says the delays have affected “some” customers).

In early 2025, more customers began to receive their adapters.

General Motors

As of September 2024, GM has finally updated the software on its Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC EVs so customers can use Tesla’s Superchargers. If they want access soon, they need to purchase a “GM approved” adapter through their app for $225.

From 2025 onward, GM’s EVs will be built with the NACS charge port.

Honda and Acura

Honda announced in March 2025 that North American owners of the Honda Prologue and the Acura ZDX EVs would get NACS access in June. The automaker said it would make adapters available for purchase from dealerships closer to the date of launch.

In 2026, Honda plans to release the Acura RSX as its first EV built with a NACS charge port, followed by the Honda 0 series models.

Hyundai Motor Group

The South Korean automaker has made several moves to give EV owners access to NACS chargers in the coming year.

Hyundai’s brand Kia announced in September its plans to give EV owners access to NACS chargers starting January 15, 2025. They used the announcement as something of a promotion, offering customers who buy a new 2024 EV6 or 2024 or 2025 EV9 SUV from September 4, 2024 a free adapter mailed to them in early 2025, if there’s enough supply. Existing Kia EV6, EV9, and Niro EV customers who took delivery before September 4 will have to buy an adapter from a dealer “at a later date.”

But for those who don’t want to bother with an adapter, Kia shared some news at the LA Auto Show in November. Both the 2025 EV6 and 2026 EV9 GT will be manufactured with a NACS plug. The EV6 is expected to go on sale in the first half of 2025, and the EV9 GT in the latter half of next year.

The 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9 and the 2026 Genesis Electrified GV70 were also both presented with NACS plugs at the LA Auto Show and promise drivers access to Tesla’s Supercharger network. But for customers who want a Hyundai EV sooner than that, the automaker said in December that it would send customers who bought or leased an EV before January 31, 2025 a free NACS adapter.

In March, Hyundai provided some updates on those free adapters. The automaker said that owners who purchased the following Hyundai models on or before January 31, 2025 are now eligible for a free CCS-to-NACS adapter: Kona Electric, Ioniq Electric (hatchback), Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6, and 2025 Ioniq 5 N.

Hyundai owners will receive instructions on how to redeem their adapters the week of April 7.

Lucid

Owners of the Lucid Gravity SUV got access to Tesla’s Supercharger network on January 31, 2025. The Gravity is built standard with the NACS charge port.

People who have already purchased the Lucid Air sedan, built with a CCS port, will get access via adapters to the Supercharger network in the second quarter.

Mercedes-Benz

Mercedes-Benz said in January that its EVs would be able to access Tesla’s network starting in February 2025. Mercedes offers existing EV customers the ability to purchase an adapter made by Lectron for $185 through authorized dealerships. The automaker plans to roll out its first vehicles with factory-installed NACS ports later this year. Mercedes has not yet shared which models will come first.

Mercedes has added Tesla Supercharger locations to its charger map in the app, and the system will integrate with the automaker’s Plug & Charge feature, which initiates charging as soon as the customer plugs in.

Nissan

Beginning in late 2024, Nissan began to give Ariya drivers access to Tesla’s network through a NACS adapter. The automaker also said that in 2025, it will start offering EVs for the U.S. and Canadian markets with a NACS port.

Rivian

EV startup Rivian officially got access to 15,000 Superchargers across North America on March 18, 2024. At the time, Rivian promised to begin sending adapters to customers starting in April. A Rivian spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker began delivery this spring and continues to ship adapters as quickly as it receives them.

As of September 2024, Rivian said that customers who order a new vehicle will have an adapter shipped to them automatically when they take delivery. Customers will receive the adapter within seven to 10 business days. The EV-maker also promised that those who already own a Rivian and are still awaiting an adapter would receive one at no cost by the end of January 2025.

Volvo (and Polestar)

The two Swedish car brands owned by China’s Geely began offering their EV customers access to Tesla’s Supercharger network at the end of October 2024.

Volvo said at the time it would include a free NACS adapter for any customer who buys a 2025 EX90, EX40, or EC40. Existing Volvo EV owners have to shell out $230 for an adapter, which they can buy from a dealership or service center.

Polestar is also selling the adapter through its service centers. Both brands began shipping adapters at the end of 2024. Volvo and Polestar are also updating their Android-powered infotainment software so drivers can search for Tesla Superchargers in the vehicle’s navigation.

https://techcrunch.com,Discord made its streaming overlay a lot more user-friendly,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/discord-made-its-streaming-overlay-a-lot-more-user-friendly/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Discord announced on Tuesday that it rebuilt its Overlay feature from the ground up.

The new Overlay makes streaming games on Discord more user-friendly on the streamer’s end.

In its legacy form, streamers could toggle the Overlay display to use Discord while playing games, but this would bring up the entire Discord client in the center of the screen, blocking the stream and making for a clunky user experience.

In the new version of Overlay, users can add specific Discord widgets that will appear around the screen for easy access, making it possible to see messages and adjust sound and video settings without pulling up the entire Discord client. These widgets can be customized for opacity, sizing, and placement on the screen.

If another friend is streaming at the same time, the picture-in-picture widget lets you watch their feed from your own Overlay, which could be helpful for people playing online games collaboratively. Users can also see other users’ webcam videos if they’re in a live chat.

Discord says that the Overlay feature will be compatible with more games and will operate with smoother performance.

Discord is also unveiling some updates to its Desktop app. Dark mode enthusiasts will be pleased to learn that the platform is getting more free dark themes, so you can toggle between slightly different shades of black and grey (Ash, Dark, and Onyx to be specific). The new UI density options will also let users customize word spacing.

These updates are geared more toward power users, especially creators who may use in-server livestreams as ways to make money. But even for casual users playing games with some friends, these quality-of-life upgrades should be welcomed.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Plural’s platform allows enterprises to manage their Kubernetes clusters in one place,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/plurals-platform-allows-enterprises-to-manage-their-kubernetes-clusters-in-one-place/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","When Sam Weaver was vice president of product management at Unqork, he realized that the company needed a better way to manage its sprawling network of Kubernetes clusters — which are groups of computing nodes. When Unqork couldn’t find anything off the shelf, it assembled a 15-person team to build a Kubernetes management product. Despite the multimillion-dollar expense, Weaver said the resulting platform was just okay.

“I’m thinking to myself, there’s got to be a better way of doing this,” Weaver told TechCrunch. “I mean, what we had built was sufficient, but it was not by any means complete, and it took us about two years to do the build.”

Weaver (pictured above right) sat on the idea until he met Michael Guarino, an engineer with notable stints at companies including Amazon and Twitter — back when it was still called that. When Weaver explained the problem to Guarino, he was surprised by his response: Guarino thought the issue was relatively straightforward to solve. Guarino then built a better system by himself in a few weeks.

That platform became the basis for Plural. The company’s platform consolidates an enterprise’s Kubernetes clusters onto one dashboard to make it easier for enterprises to streamline operations, manage these clusters, and deploy upgrades from one central spot.

Plural’s AI can also offer suggestions about optimizing cluster efficiency or diagnosing scaling issues, Weaver said. Plural is cloud and LLM agnostic.

Weaver said that the hope is that Plural frees up time for developers because they don’t need to search for information or bugs in their Kubernetes clusters. He added that the company can help teams run updates in hours as opposed to weeks.

“It reduces the operational overhead by about 90% is what we’ve seen with our users and customers,” Weaver said. “People are really excited for that because they’re actually able to go and get productive work done.”

Weaver said the timing for this solution is right. Over the past few years, enterprises went from managing one Kubernetes cluster to multiple — a trend accelerated by the rise of AI.

“You have a lot of cattle running around that you can no longer just treat as individual clusters,” Weaver said. “So up until now, people have been taking a lot of open source tooling from the ecosystem. There’s 2,000 projects in the Kubernetes ecosystem.”

Plural was founded in 2021 and launched the original version of its platform shortly after. The company now works with multiple enterprise customers, in markets like financial services and other regulated industries, according to Weaver, though he declined to disclose specific customer names or numbers.

The startup also recently raised a $6 million seed round led by Primary Venture Partners with participation from Capital One Ventures and Company Ventures. Weaver said the team set out to raise $3 million but ended up doubling its round after seeing strong demand. The company wants to put the money toward deepening its product capabilities and eventually exploring areas outside of Kubernetes.

Plural isn’t alone in tackling Kubernetes cluster sprawl. Competitors include Loft Labs, a startup that has raised $28.6 million in venture funding, and Rancher Labs, a startup that raised $95 million before being acquired by Suse in 2020 for $600 million.

Weaver thinks Plural’s biggest differentiator is its architecture. He mentioned specifically the fact that Plural runs on a GitOps model, its product is self-hosted by each customer, and that each Kubernetes cluster has its own AI agent that runs on top of it.

“The enterprise basically has full control over how and where they deploy this thing,” Weaver said. “No data is sent home. It’s not a SaaS service. We’re heads down, we’re focused on continuing to add to the Kubernetes management platform that we have, and there’s tons still to do that we’re excited about.”",techcrunch

Character AI will now give guardians and parents a summary of their teens’ activity on the app via a weekly email. The email will supposedly show the average time a child spends on the app and on the web, the time they spend talking to each character, and the top characters they interacted with during the week.

The startup says this data is aimed to give parents insights into their teens’ engagement habits on the platform. It specified that parents don’t get direct access to chats themselves.

Following the lawsuits, the startup last year added safety measures like a dedicated model for users under 18, time-spent notifications, and disclaimers to remind users that they are chatting with AI-powered characters.

https://tomshardware.com,Producing wafers at TSMC Arizona is only 10% more expensive than in Taiwan: TechInsights,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/producing-wafers-at-tsmc-arizona-is-only-10-percent-more-expensive-than-in-taiwan-techinsights,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 11:16:35 GMT","Comments made by TSMC founder Morris Chang about high fab building costs in Arizona and higher operating costs in the U.S. created the impression that producing chips in America is way too expensive to be financially viable. However, analysts from TechInsights believe that this is not the case. According to the firm's recent study, the costs of wafers at TSMC's Fab 21 near Phoenix, Arizona, are only about 10% higher than those of similar wafers processed in Taiwan.

""It costs TSMC less than 10% more to process a 300mm wafer in Arizona than the same wafer made in Taiwan,"" wrote G. Dan Hutcheson from TechInsights.

While it definitely costs more to build a fab in the U.S. than in Taiwan, TSMC's cost was significantly higher because it built its first overseas fab in decades at a brand-new site with a new, sometimes unskilled workforce, according to Hutcheson. According to other people familiar with the fab-building process, it does not cost twice as much to build a fab in the USA than in Taiwan.

The dominant factor of semiconductor production cost is the cost of equipment, which contributes well over two-thirds of overall wafer expenses. Tools made by leading companies like ASML, Applied Materials, KLA, Lam Research, or Tokyo Electron cost the same amount of money in Taiwan and the U.S.; they effectively neutralize location-based cost differences.

A major source of confusion about wafer prices comes from labor costs. Wages in the U.S. are roughly triple those in Taiwan, which many mistakenly take as a significant factor in chip production. However, with the advanced automation of today's wafer fabrication facilities, labor accounts for less than 2% of the total cost, according to TechInsights's wafer cost model. Based on this model, the overall expense gap between operating costs of a fab in Arizona and Taiwan is minimal despite big differences in salaries and other local costs.

It should be noted that wafers that TSMC currently produces at Fab 21 travel back to Taiwan to get diced, tested, and packaged. Some of them then go to China or elsewhere to be put into actual devices; some will travel back to the U.S., though. Therefore, their logistics are somewhat more complicated than those of typical wafers processed in Taiwan. However, this hardly dramatically adds to costs, and TSMC now plans to build packaging capacity in the U.S. Nonetheless, TSMC is rumored to charge a 30% premium for chips made in the U.S.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Real-world GPU prices cost up to twice the MSRP. These are the best dollar-to-fps values.,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/real-world-graphics-card-prices-cost-up-to-twice-the-msrp,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 19:09:28 GMT","Buying any of the best graphics cards right now feels like an exercise in futility. For that matter, buying virtually any graphics card at present tends to be a bad idea. We've scoured a variety of online markets to see what sort of prices we could find, and MSRPs are effectively non-existent — laughably so. Everything worth buying sells almost immediately, likely more often than not to scalper bots. What you can find ""in stock"" tends to be from recently established third-party marketplace sellers, with prices that can at times reach to double the official MSRPs.



Does that make the MSRPs meaningless? At present, it's hard to think otherwise. Even Nvidia itself was only selling limited numbers of RTX 5090 Founders Edition and RTX 5080 Founders Edition cards at GTC 2025 — from a mobile 'food truck.' And you had to be a conference attendee ($1,145 minimum) plus get in line early enough to even grab one.



A better question: When if ever will we see the latest generation GPUs selling at MSRPs? In light of recent tariffs, plus the ongoing graphics card shortages, it could be a very long waiting game. Even looking to places like eBay, the number of latest generation GPUs trading hands doesn't look promising.

At the height of the cryptocurrency GPU mining crazy in mid-2021, we often saw well over 10,000 GPUs 'sold' via eBay every month. Right now, the last 30 days show less than 9,000 GPUs sold on eBay — and that's looking at the past three generations of AMD and Nvidia graphics cards.

* Price at time of writing, may not be a legitimate seller!



Here's the best data we can come up with for the starting retail prices on the current and previous generation graphics cards from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. You'll note a bunch of asterisks in the price column; those are for resellers where we're not at all confident of the pricing or availability. Most of these are from Amazon listings that are, in our mind at least, questionable. (Truthfully, all of the prices feel questionable... some are just more so.)



It probably goes without saying, but prices are in a rapid state of flux as well. If you find a price that's $40 lower than other places, it's not going to last long. Either the particular card and reseller will exhaust the inventory, or prices will get updated. And again, that's assuming these prices are even legitimate in the first place. Some cards will show ""typically ships in two weeks"" or similar notes — not exactly confidence-inducing.



A safer look at prices right now might be eBay, as we've gathered data for the past 30 days of ""sold"" listings. Not all of those are guaranteed to be legitimate, but at least we can see solid numbers for how many of each card were sold as well as the average price. It doesn't look good.

On the whole, outside of the RTX 50-series, eBay prices tended to be better on average compared to retail — which isn't too surprising, since most prior generation GPUs are no longer readily available at retail. There are a few GPUs that averaged pricing below MSRP, but they're all previous generation cards, and often models that weren't exactly enticing originally.



Take the RTX 4070 Ti (aka, the rebranded unlaunched RTX 4080 12GB). People were outraged at its original $800 MSRP, but in the past month it averaged $777 for a used card on eBay. Intel's Arc A-series GPUs are also selling below the original MSRPs, as is the RX 7600.

Everything else cost anywhere from 3% (RTX 4060) to 111% (RTX 5090) more than MSRP. On average, GPUs on eBay for the past two generations are averaging 24% above MSRP.

(Image credit: Newegg)

Newegg also warrants some close examination. It has a quite a few prior generation graphics cards ""available,"" but the fine print indicates most of these will ship from China, Hong Kong, or some other place besides the U.S. Tick the ""in stock"" and ""sold by Newegg"" options and you'll find just 16 options in total, five of which are combos — a good way to offload extra inventory with a high-demand item like a GPU. Even then, the prices aren't exactly enticing.



$200 for an Arc A750 is the same price we saw most of last year, and even then the cards weren't exactly selling well. $300 for an RX 7600 is about $40 more than the going rate last year, for a rather lackluster GPU. The same goes for the RTX 4060, starting at $340, and things only get worse from there. RX 7600 XT for $425? Thanks, we'll pass. The lowest cost RX 7700 XT comes with a CPU cooler for $660, a bundle you likely weren't looking to purchase.



There are (currently) a few RTX 5070 cards showing up at Newegg, starting at $700. That's 'only' $150 more than the official $550 MSRP, a 27% increase, and it's about the best you'll be able to do in the present market situations. We anticipate all of those will be sold out soon enough. RTX 5080 cards meanwhile start at over 50% above MSRP.



But what if you really want a graphics card for your PC. Maybe it's a new build and you were holding out for an Nvidia Blackwell RTX 50-series GPU, or an AMD RDNA 4 RX 9000-series GPU, only to discover upon launch that prices were not at all what you were hoping to see. If you can't wait for prices to drop, what are the best options in terms of value right now for a new GPU?

We've sorted the above table by eBay FPS/$, using the average eBay prices for the past 30 days — which will be less than 30 days for GPUs like the RTX 5070 and RX 9070 XT and 9070, which launched on March 5 and 6, respectively. We've included the MSRP FPS/$ as a second point of reference, showing just how far online pricing has diverged from what was supposedly expected.



Intel claims the top three slots, with it's prior generation A580 and A750 taking the top two slots, followed by the newer B570. None of these are powerhouse GPUs, but they're some of the few relatively affordable GPUs at present (assuming you're willing to deal with eBay). The RTX 4060, RX 7700 XT, and RX 7600 come next, again promising relatively modest performance for not-too-dire a price.



Intel shows up again with its newer Arc B580, the only other new GPU from the past three months. It's selling at just under $350 on eBay, about $100 more than its suggested price, though it tends to beat the RTX 4060 on performance. Below the B580, prices tend to increase much faster than performance



It's important to factor in unit numbers as well. None of the Intel Arc GPUs had more than 62 units sold on eBay, with the B570 only showing four sales compared to 62 B580 sales. AMD's 7700 XT, 7600 XT, and 7600 combined for only 88 total sold listings, while the 7800 XT alone accounted for 153 sales. Nvidia's 40-series and 50-series GPUs all showed over 100 sales, except for the 4060 Ti 16GB (65 sales) and RTX 5070 (80 sales). The most popular GPU on eBay for the past month was the RTX 4090 with 708 sales.

Thoughts on Current GPU Prices

What does it all mean? Right now is a lousy time to buy a new graphics card. Unfortunately, determining when things will actually get better is difficult. Given the prioritization of manufacturing more lucrative data center GPUs and AI processors, plus the recent tariffs, prices could actually get worse before they get better.



We did hear from at least one person (who works for Nvidia, so grains of salt...) who said they ""thought"" that the supply of consumer graphics cards would catch up to demand by May or June. Obviously, that's not remotely a binding statement. We'd be shocked to see any of the new generation of GPUs selling at MSRP any time in the next six months, frankly, because all signs indicate there's no reason to massively boost production.



The fundamental issue is that there are only so many silicon wafers processed by TSMC each month. The numbers we've seen suggest 150K~175K wafer starts per month (WSPM) for 5nm-class nodes, and that needs to be shared between a variety of customers including AI chips, GPUs, CPUs, smartphones, and more.

At the same time, the latest GPU market share numbers suggest all desktop GPUs combined account for over eight million graphics cards sold per quarter. So how many wafers would be needed to satisfy that demand?



Using the relatively small BMG-G21 die of Intel's Battlemage cards (272 sqmm), die per wafer calculators suggest Intel would only get about 210 chips at most from a single wafer. AMD's Navi 48 (356.5 sqmm) would get a maximum of 157 chips per wafer, while Nvidia's GB205 die (263 sqmm) could get up to 220 GPUs per wafer — or 150 GB203, or only 70 of the significantly larger GB202 die.



If Nvidia focused solely on GB205, it would need to devote about 12,000 wafers per month to production, just to reach that eight million GPUs figure. But why 'waste' that many wafers on a $550 consumer GPU (maybe $200 per GPU sold), when it could instead work on cranking out Blackwell B200 and Blackwell Ultra B300 GPUs that sell for perhaps 100X as much per chip? Put simply: The economics aren't in favor of gamers getting a lot more GPUs any time soon.



Anyone in need of a new graphics card right now looks to be in for a tough decision. The faster GPUs are all incredibly overpriced now, typically selling for 50% more than what they cost last October/November. Your best bet might be to opt for an older and slower GPU and bide your time until graphics card prices come down — with the understanding that we might be looking at GPU shortages that continue beyond the end of the year if things don't improve.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Lisa Su says Radeon RX 9070-series GPU sales are 10X higher than its predecessors — for the first week of availability,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/lisa-su-says-radeon-rx-9070-series-gpu-sales-are-10x-higher-than-its-predecessors-for-the-first-week-of-availability,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:58:58 GMT","Demand for AMD’s latest Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards is so high that it is close to impossible to get a Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT add-in board (AIB) at its recommended price in the U.S., Europe, or just about anywhere else. In fact, AMD claims that its latest Radeon RX 9070 XT discrete GPU for desktop PCs is its most successful standalone AMD Radeon graphics card ever in terms of first-week sales. Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, said in an interview that the Radeon RX 9070 XT outsold its predecessors by a factor of 10 in the first week.



""Radeon RX 9070 XT has been a fantastic success, actually, it is the number one selling [graphics card] of all of the AMD Radeon generations for first week sales by far. 10X higher than previous generations,"" Lisa Su said in an interview with Asus Tony. ""We like to see people happy, and people are very happy with the Radeon RX 9070 XT.""



First-week sales are, of course, a very interesting metric that reflects how many products were stockpiled for early birds and how many early birds were willing to buy them in the first week of sales. However, it does not reflect how many GPUs per launch quarter AMD sells, and this is perhaps a more traditional metric. That metric, in the case of AMD, did not exactly impress in recent years. Perhaps AMD has managed to sell significantly more halo products in Q1 2025 than it did with its previous generations? Let's try to analyze this.

(Image credit: Data by Jon Peddie Research/Compiled by Tom's Hardware)

Pictures of AMD's Navi 48 GPUs — which power AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT AIBs — that we have seen so far indicate that the parts were assembled in late October, 2024, so the company has been stockpiling Navi 48 graphics processing units for months before formally introducing them on March 6, 2025. We have no idea how many chips and cards AMD and its partners stockpiled before March, but AMD shipped about 1.43 million discrete desktop GPUs to its partners in Q4 2024, according to Jon Peddie Research, and it is unlikely that these were outgoing RDNA 3-based processors. It is reasonable to assume that AMD had plenty of Navi 48 GPUs on hand as of Q1 2025, though the exact number is unknown.



With its family of GPUs based on the RDNA 4 microarchitecture, AMD decided not to pursue the high-end segment of the market, leaving them entirely for Nvidia with its products like the GeForce RTX 5080 ($999) and GeForce RTX 5090 ($1,999). Instead, the company focused on the performance-mainstream segment and currently offers Radeon RX 9070 at a $549 MSRP and Radeon RX 9070 XT at a $599 MSRP. At these prices, these are some of the best graphics cards on the market.



Without a doubt, AMD could easily sell more Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards at $549–$599 (even with a 15%–20% markup in retail) in the first week than it did with the prior generation. Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX launched at $899–$999 in mid-December, 2022, and supplies weren't particularly large. When it comes to Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT ($579–$649, launched mid-November, 2020) and Radeon RX 6900 XT ($999, early December, 2020), those products were launched amid the COVID-19 pandemic and are known for their low stock availability at launch; they sold out the first day.



As for AMD's 2019 products — the Radeon VII (Vega 20, early 2019) for $699, Radeon Vega Frontier Edition for $999–$1,499 (Vega 10, June, 2019), and Radeon RX 5700 XT and RX 5700 XT AE for $399–$499 (July, 2019) were also aimed at different market segments, but the company ramped them up (mostly the RDNA-based RX 5000-series) in a timely fashion in the subsequent quarters, so 2019 was quite a good year for AMD.

(Image credit: Data by Jon Peddie Research/Compiled by Tom's Hardware)

We can dig a little deeper into the past to observe the launches of AMD’s Vega (GCN 5), Polaris (GCN 4), Fiji (GCN 4), and other iterations of the GCN architecture originally introduced in 2011. But the graph based on data from JPR clearly indicates that AMD has consistently sold fewer graphics cards in their ‘halo GPU’ launch quarters (we did not include all GPUs in the graph) than in their previous cycles.



There were exceptions in 2016–2017, but mainly because AMD’s Radeon R9 Fury and Radeon 300-series GPUs failed to gain any significant popularity in 2015. The overall trend is that sales of AMD’s desktop GPUs are declining — a trend that reflects not only industry dynamics but also the company’s market share losses to Nvidia.



Could AMD reverse the trend and outsell not only the more expensive Radeon RX 6800/6900 and Radeon RX 7900-series graphics cards, but also its cheaper Radeon RX 400/500 and RX 5000-series with its Radeon RX 9070-series products in Q1 2025? To do so, AMD would need to sell over 4 million desktop discrete GPUs in the first quarter — something it has not done for years.

Once you include all the other components -- the CPU, the RAM, the storage and peripherals like a monitor -- you're going to pay well over $1,000. Even RTX 4060-powered laptops are hovering in the $1,000 range.

However, today, Newegg (see Newegg promo codes) has an MSI Thin A15 laptop with RTX 4060, Ryzen 9 CPU and a 1TB SSD for just $729 after rebate.

MSI Thin A15 w/ RTX 4060, Ryzen 9 8945HS: was $929, now $729 at Newegg

This RTX 4060-powered laptop has 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD and a 144 HZ, 1080p display. It's $729 after a $200 rebate.

The Thin A15 is powered by a Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD. It also has a 144 Hz, 1920 x 1080 screen.

As you might expect from its name, the Thin A15 is just 0.85 inches thick (14.13 x 9.999 x 0.85 inches) and weighs a modest 4.10 pounds. It features HDMI 2.1 out, 3x USB 3.2 Type-A ports and 1 USB 3.2 Type-C port.

What kind of gaming can you expect with a mobile RTX 4060 chip inside? While we haven't tested the Thin A15, we have tested other RTX 4060-enabled laptops.

We found that the Dell G16 laptop with Core i7-13650HX CPU and RTX 4060 returned a rate of 98 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080p resolution and the highest settings. On Far Cry 6 at Ultra settings, it went to 85 fps. Borderlands 3 ran at 82 fps in ""Badass settings"" at 1080p. Red Dead Redemption 2, a more demanding game, reache 64 fps at Medium settings.

So we expect the Thin A15 to offer strong 1080p gaming with frame rates in the 60 to 90 fps range on demanding titles. Ray tracing may prove a challenge, but we wouldn't expect to get good ray tracing performance out of a sub-$1000 laptop. Overall, this is a fantastic price on a capable mobile gaming rig.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,ASRock claims to fix 'burned out' AM5 motherboard by cleaning the socket,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/asrock-fixes-burned-out-am5-motherboard-by-cleaning-the-socket,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:24:08 GMT","ASRock has issued a second update addressing boot-up and CPU damage issues on its AM5 motherboards. This time in a blog post, the board maker went the extra mile to prove its BIOS updates are not causing motherboard and CPU damage by fixing a customer's AM5 motherboard that showed signs of CPU socket burn damage.



ASRock achieved this by restoring the motherboard above without actually ""fixing"" it. ASRock cleaned and removed debris from the motherboard's CPU socket and fired up the board with its original BIOS. Despite not actually repairing the socket, the board booted successfully and ""passed long-term stress testing"" according to ASRock.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: AMD) (Image credit: AMD)

Efforts to repair this specific board appear to be in direct response to a previous report of one Ryzen 7 9800X3D burning out on an ASRock motherboard. In fact, the ""socket damage"" on the board ASRock fixed looks identical to the damaged motherboard in the aforementioned report.



If so, the board maker's findings suggest that the aforementioned 9800X3D burnout was in fact a case of user error of some kind — meaning, the debris shouldn't have been in the socket pins. What's not clear is whether the debris in this case came during the PC build process, or if it came via ASRock.



It's also unclear if the original CPU shown on Reddit still works, or if it's dead even while a 'cleaned' board lives another day with a different CPU. Modern CPU sockets typically have a lot of pins dedicated to power and ground, so missing a few of these might not result in a dead platform. The Reddit image certainly looks bad, particularly on the CPU itself, but perhaps the affected pins were not vital for proper operation.



In the same update, ASRock also announced the full non-beta release of BIOS version 3.20 to its AM5 motherboards, featuring memory compatibility improvements. This update addresses widespread reports of boot-up issues occurring on many ASRock AM5 motherboards.



Alarms about CPU burnout and boot-up issues started to ring when the aforementioned 9800X3D burnout case was reported. Afterward, ASRock moderators on Reddit created a megathread highlighting over 40 Reddit posts complaining about allegedly ""dead"" Ryzen 9000 series CPUs (mostly 9800X3D chips), the vast majority of which were coming from ASRock customers. The primary issue was an inability to POST (or boot up) with Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs.



ASRock first responded to these issues in February, revealing the issues were related to memory incompatibility issues affecting all Ryzen 9000 series parts, preventing customers' motherboards from booting up. At the time, the board maker also released beta BIOS 3.20 to rectify this problem.



Now, it appears ASRock has finally brought those changes into an official format for everyone to download in the form of BIOS 3.20. Hopefully, this will mark the end of any issues related to ASRock AM5 motherboards and Ryzen 9000 series CPUs.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Our alternate pick for the best gaming CPU is $190 cheaper than the 9800X3D right now - pick up the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X for just $289,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/our-alternate-pick-for-the-best-gaming-cpu-is-usd190-cheaper-than-the-9800x3d-right-now-pick-up-the-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-for-just-usd289,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:14:37 GMT","If you're after the very best gaming desktop CPU, then the good news is the Ryzen 7 9800X3D from AMD is back in stock at most retailers for around the $479 MSRP list price. However, for $190 less than our top pick, you can still bag an AM5 9000-series processor with the same 8-cores and 16-threads, just a lot less cache.

Head to Amazon, where in the Big Spring Sale, AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X is only $289. Although it's not a great time to build a new PC due to the GPU shortages, if you already have a pre-existing AM5 system and are looking for a CPU upgrade, the 9700X will slot straight in. If you're upgrading from an AM4 system, then the gains will obviously be much larger, but you will need a new motherboard and RAM to go with it.

Although the Ryzen 7 9700X didn't set the PC world alight when it first launched, optimizations to Windows and firmware updates have much improved this processor's performance in applications and gaming. AMD's 9700X is an 8-core, 16-thread CPU, which has a base clock of 3.8 GHz and the ability to boost up to 5.5 GHz. There is plenty of headroom for overclocking on this CPU, and it even has a low TDP of just 65W, though you can push this higher if you want to get more out of the chip.

AMD Ryzen 7 9700X CPU: now $289 at Amazon (was $359)

Our second pick for the best overall CPU for gaming, the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X stands tall in the enthusiast CPU market. With 8 cores and 16 threads clocked at 3.8 GHz, boost clocks reaching 5.5 GHz, and a TDP of only 65 W, the 9700X is one of the most attractive picks for Zen 5 gaming.



You can also pick up a copy of Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds with a qualifying purchase of an AMD CPU.

Our review of the Ryzen 7 9700X gave it 3.5 stars out of 5. We weren't initially impressed by this CPU, but since its release, the performance has improved and now we can easily recommend this processor as a great alternative pick for the best gaming CPU.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Zotac raises RTX 5090 prices by 20% and seemingly eliminates MSRP models,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/zotac-raises-rtx-5090-prices-by-20-percent-and-seemingly-eliminates-msrp-models,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:04:51 GMT","The GeForce RTX 5090 is one of the best graphics cards — and the hardest to find in stock, especially if you want a card at something close to MSRP. To add some salt to the wound, Zotac (via Reddit) has evidently raised the price of the brand's custom GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards by up to 20%. The new pricing is reflected on Zotac's U.S. online store, which is conveniently under construction at the time of writing.



The Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 5090 AMP Extreme Infinity is the company's flagship SKU, tailored for consumers seeking all the premium features of an RTX 5090. The graphics card initially entered the market at $2,499.99 but reached as high as $2,599.99 during its last stock availability. Zotac has now raised the price to $2,999.99, reflecting a substantial 20% increase from the original price.



The more affordable Zotac Gaming RTX 5090 Solid OC arrived with a $2,261.69 price tag, although it didn't take long for the graphics card to jump to $2,381.13. Zotac has set the new price at $2,699.99, a 19% increase.



The standard Zotac Gaming RTX 5090 was one of the few MSRP models on the market. While the graphics card is still listed on Zotac's website, it has reportedly been absent from the e-store. The non-OC version is still visible at some U.S. retailers, such as Newegg, but it's obviously out of stock — just like any other 5090 priced below $4,000. We can't verify if Zotac still offers this SKU, and if so whether it has also seen a price hike.

Zotac may not be a household name, but it's been around in the U.S. graphics card market for over a decade. The brand earned some respect from enthusiasts for attempting to sell GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards directly to consumers through its Discord group. This effort seems to have failed, or rather, it appears to have been deceptive, as Redditors claim that Zotac only has a handful of units available each week. Moreover, the brand was reportedly spamming notifications to Discord users to boost engagement for a Twitch stream. To top it off, some later discovered a separate, private Discord group that provided more exclusive access for a select few.



A few months ago, major graphics card manufacturers, including Asus and MSI, raised their prices on Nvidia's RTX 50-series graphics cards. It was only a matter of time before Zotac followed suit, and Zotac's price hike somewhat aligns with those of Asus and MSI. Many attribute the recent price increases to the latest U.S. tariffs; even Newegg pointed this out at one point, though it later retracted the statement. Rather than absorb the extra cost, vendors and retailers are passing it along to consumers.



While we don't have any indication of MSRP changes for other Zotac GPUs, given the current market conditions it's a safe bet that lesser GPUs like the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 will also see higher prices. MSRPs for Nvidia's latest generation GPUs seem to be disconnected from retail supply and demand, unfortunately.



Some companies, including ASRock and Asus, are relocating their production from China to other countries due to the U.S. tariffs. However, this process takes time, and establishing operations in a new country is costly. It's reasonable to anticipate further price increases from brands that have chosen to make this transition. Asus has said this is a factor in its current pricing.



We don't expect Zotac to encounter the same challenges since its parent company is PC Partner, making it unlikely that they will move out of China. If there are additional price increases on Zotac graphics cards, it wouldn't be due to a production shift. Rather, it would be due to tariffs and high demand for the products — demand that doesn't appear to be going away any time soon, considering the lack of supply.",tomshardware

But that doesn't mean you can't substantially improve your tech life (or the lives of your tech-focused friends and family) while spending a comparatively small amount of money.

I own all of the affordable tech gifts in this list below, and all are on sale for less than $50. In fact, many are under $25! Each of these products has made my nerdy world a little nicer in its own way. If you're looking for a small tech splurge for yourself during this Spring Sale week, or an affordable gift for that techie friend or family member, one of these 50-or-under options might be just what you're after.

My favorite sub-$50 deals:

HOTO Wireless Screwdriver: was $60, now $39

Lenovo Go Qi Charging Mouse: was $70, now $45

Anker PowerConf C200 2K Webcam: was $60, now $48

I've used the HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set to build dozens of PCs

(Image credit: Hoto)

I build a lot of PCs, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a nice thing to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found HOTO's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (and variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also good for assembling furniture.



The HOTO won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set: now $39 at Amazon (was $60)

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

USB cheap media control box puts volume and track control a touch away

(Image credit: Amazon)

For those of us of a certain age, few things beat a chunky tactile volume knob and physical buttons for controlling media, and Vaydeer's USB device provides that and then some. I own the previous version of this device and love it for controlling and muting music at my treadmill desk while I work.

I can also use the buttons on it to play / pause audio and video, move forward to the next track or backward to the previous one. It's totally plug and play as no drivers are needed.





Vaydeer Volume Control Knob + Media Buttons: now $29 at Amazon (was $32)

Just plug this simple USB device into a USB port and you can control the volume and select tracks without reaching for your keyboard or mouse.

Wireless retro controller takes me back to the 80s, removes the cord

(Image credit: Amazon)

What's not to love about a $40 SNES-inspired wireless gaming controller that's compatible with Windows, Mac, Android and the Nintendo Switch? Not much, but I own the original Pro model and not one of these newer models with translucent plastic shells. That's peak late-90s nostalgia and I really don't want to love it as much as I do.



As you might expect given this controller's small size and many more buttons than the SNES controller it was based on, its Rumble motors aren't the strongest, and the layout can feel kind of cramped for some modern games. But for any kind of retro game and especially platformers (I'm looking at you, Super Mario Bros. Wonder), this is my go-to controller. At this price, maybe I should pick up another one.

8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller: now $40 at Amazon

With its SNES-inspired design and translucent shell, this controller will appeal to gamers of a certain age. But its appeal goes beyond its looks.

Lenovo's Go Qi Charging Wireless Mouse never needs to be plugged in

(Image credit: Lenovo)

I have wireless charging pads at my desk and three other places around my apartment, as well as my desk at the office, for keeping my phone and watch juiced up, and I take one with me when I travel. So when I saw Lenovo had a Go Wireless Multi-Device Mouse that charges wirelessly using the Qi standard, I was intrigued. And now that I've owned one for more than a year, it's my go-to travel rodent. In fact, I just retrieved this mouse from my suitcase after a trip to Scotland.



There's not much remarkable about this compact mouse in terms of its design. It houses a USB-C dongle under its magnetic top, and it also works over Bluetooth for pairing it with up to three devices. Lenovo claims 2-3 months of use if you use it a couple of hours a day, which is probably fairly accurate.

I've never been able to tell because whenever I'm done using it, I just drop it on the Qi charging stand on my desk and it's fully charged whenever I pick it up again. Plugging things in is so 2019. However, it does have a USB-C port in the front if you want to pry off the rubber door and charge it the old-school way.



Lenovo Go Wireless Mouse: now $45 at Lenovo (was $60)

This unassuming compact mouse hides Qi wireless charging abilities in its base. Just drop it on a charging pad when you're doing and never worry about running out of pointer power again.

Anker's PowerConf C200 2K Webcam delivers good performance and good-enough resolution for under $50

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

I experimented with a 4K webcam during the worst of the Covid pandemic. But the truth is, almost no one needs that level of image quality for office and family chats. And many chat programs will just down-res you to 1080p (or less), anyway. So unless you're a serious streamer or have some other niche case, I recommend something more affordable.



I've been using Anker's PowerConf C200 2K Webcam for the past two years and I couldn't be happier with it. Its somewhat nebulous ""2K"" resolution looks sharper than 1080p webcams I've used in the past, and its low-light performance is great. It has an easy-to-see red privacy shutter for when you're not using it, and it's compact enough to easily clip onto a laptop screen and toss into a bag if you want to travel with it. It also has a screw mount on the bottom for mounting to an arm or stand, which is how I use it with the 55-inch OLED TV I use as a monitor. My old 4K webcam is in a corner gathering dust. But I use Anker's PowerConf C200 2K almost every day.

Anker PowerConf C200 2K Webcam: now $48 at Amazon (was $60)

With its ""2K"" sensor that works well in bright or low light, compact frame, and easy-to-see privacy shutter, Anker's PowerConf C200 2K is all the webcam most of us will ever need.

Add recessed power and USB ports to your desk for just $21

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

OK, this one's only for the DIY-inclined, because it involves cutting a hole in your desk (or anywhere else you might want some flush-mount power ports, like a nightstand). Jgstkcity's recessed power strip lets you drop a couple of AC outlets and two USB charging ports (one 30W USB-C) anywhere you need them – again, once you've cut a hole for it.



While it's always smart to be wary of no-name power strips, I've owned the older non-PD version of this strip for over two years and it's been functioning just fine. I have it installed in the narrow stand I built right behind my couch. It's a super-convenient place for power outlets, especially when friends or family stop by. I just warn people not to put drinks there. Thankfully, the coffee table is even more convenient for that and it's right in front of the couch.

Jgstkcity Recessed Power Strip: now $21 at Amazon

You'll likely need a drill and a saw to install it, but having a couple of power plugs and USB-C PD power right on the surface of your desk or nightstand is super convenient.

Powerowl's rechargeable batteries are good and surprisingly cheap

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

When I first started using rechargeable batteries with my Walkman in the early 90s, they were kind of awful (but still better than spending all my money feeding my music addiction). They couldn't hold a charge and didn't last nearly as long as name-brand disposable batteries. But here in the mid-2020s, rechargeables are surprisingly good.



Panasonic's Eneloops arguably ushered in the rechargeable AA and AAA renaissance, but PowerOwl's batteries are a lot more affordable and I haven't had a single one fail in over three years of using them in my various remotes, smart door locks, and other devices.

PowerOwl 8 AA Rechargeable Batteries With Charger: now $24 at Amazon , was $28

These PowerOwl Pro AA batteries are rated to 2800mAh (though I wouldn't put stock in that spec) and are rated to keep 60% of their power for two years. The included USB-powered charger isn't the fastest (10 hours rated), but it gets the job done. Clip the coupon to get it at this price.

Baseus 65W Flat GaN wall charger is great for travel and commuting

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

If there's one thing everyone with modern tech could probably use at this point, it's an extra high-speed and compact charger. The Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger is my new-found favorite. It's especially great for travel, because it outputs 45W over USB-C for my laptop and up to 20W over USB-A for my phone or other devices, all while folding to a slim 0.66 inches thick. It's smaller than a deck of cards and easily fits in pretty much any bag pocket.



Its slim shape should also help keep the device fully inserted in loose hotel room power sockets, and while the outer shell is plastic, the build quality feels solid, and it includes a 3.3-foot USB-C charging cable for those of us who aren't already drowning in cables from other devices. You'll have to provide your own USB-A cable to charge a second device, but at its current sale price, there's hardly a reason to complain about that. And who doesn't have an extra USB-A charging cable at this point?

Hang your headphones on some under-desk charging ports for $13

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Do-it-all devices that pull together disparate features often turn out to be junk. But it’s hard to discount a $16 device that combines an under-the-desk headset hanger / cable holder and a three-port USB charging hub is hard to discount. Depending on where you place the device, the ports are great for charging phones and tablets. PD charging is supported, but only up to 20W, so don't expect to be plugging your laptop here. Cozoo's device ships with both 3M tape and screws for mounting under your desk, as well as cable tie-downs to help make the setup as tidy as possible.



Given the price (and the fact that I've never heard of the brand outside of these devices), I generally wouldn't want this to be my only charging option. But I've had this hanger under my standing desk for nearly a year now and it's always worked for me as expected.

COZOO Headphone Stand with USB Charger was $20, now $13 at Amazon

This under-desk headphone hanger is also a charging hub, with two USB-A ports and a USB-C port with up to 20W of output. It also has notches for hanging cables that you want to keep handy.

TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter delivers Wi-Fi 6 to older devices over USB

(Image credit: TP-Link)

Have you upgraded your router to Wi-Fi 6 or later, but your desktop or laptop doesn't have the requisite hardware to take advantage of your recent network tech? TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter is here to solve that problem for you. It's quite large by USB Wi-Fi dongle standards, but I've found it works quite well with the Wi-Fi 6 router I bought in 2020.

I have the router running downstairs from my office. And it instantly fixed an issue I was having with very poor reception from the SFF PC I built in the Fractal Terra case .

TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter: now $31 at Amazon (was $49)

Sure, it's big and bulky with two antennas, but this Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter can deliver some serious speed to your desktop or laptop when paired with a Wi-Fi 6 or later router.

Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub is easy to mount on many desks

(Image credit: Orico)

This is a four-port USB hub that's designed to clamp onto your desk and give you extra convenient connectivity. Orico's device delivers USB 3.0 speeds, which is good enough for most modern devices.

It comes in black or silver and has a nice sturdy metal frame. Just note that its clamp section is pretty shallow and its adjustable screw can only open between 10 and 32 mm, so it won't fit on all desks.

Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub: now $19 at Newegg

An otherwise standard four-port USB 3.0 hub, this Orico model stands out for its metal frame and clamp design.

Clean up the cables under your desk with a tray

(Image credit: Delamu)

If you to get a handle on the PC cables in your home or office, some cheap cable management trays will do the job. This two-pack comes with tape, though heavier loads will ultimately require some screws.



Besides the trays, this kit also comes with cable ties and a few cable clips you can place along the bottom or sides of your desk. One of these has been holding up the PC cable clutter in my living room for the past year. But I had to screw it into my desk because it's holding one of the above Anker power strips, plus the large external power brick from my LG OLED TV/Monitor.",tomshardware

Originally priced at $1,599, the Odyssey OLED G9 is now available for just $949. This is the lowest price we’ve seen on the monitor in recent months.

The OLED G9 was good enough to earn our coveted Editor’s Choice award and is a perfect option for gamers who don’t want to deal with multiple monitors for a true ultrawide gaming experience. You can enjoy the unbroken breadth of the 49-inch display -- just make sure you have one of the best graphics cards for gaming if you want to take advantage of the full DQHD resolution at 240 Hz.

That makes this a great time to purchase a 4TB SSD, with prices as low as 5 cents per GB. Given the precarious state of the market, many of the drives are not at all-time low prices, but because of tariffs and fluctuating NAND prices, they may never be cheaper.

Below, we've listed the lowest current price on half a dozen popular models of 4TB NVMe SSD, starting with the Silicon Power UD90 and going up to the WD Black SN850X and Samsung 990 Pro.

Not all of these are currently sale prices, just the lowest price you can get them for right now. Prices may have been lower in the recent past, but again, we don't know if they will go down anytime soon.

The Samsung 990 Pro, however, is on a huge sale this week as it now goes for $279, reduced from $319 just a few days ago. The 990 Pro is one of the best SSDs you can buy, with read and write speeds of 7,450 and 6,900 MBps. It's one of the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives you can buy (PCIe 5.0 drives are faster but too pricey and not worth it for most users).

Samsung 990 Pro 4TB SSD: now $279 at Amazon (was $319)

The Samsung 990 Pro 4TB is among the fastest SSDs currently available on the market, with read and write speeds of up to 7450/6900 MB/s, maxing out the Gen 4 bandwidth.

As you can see in the chart below, the 990 Pro does more than just deliver high transfer rates. It also incredibly low latency, which is great for gaming.

The WD Black SN850X is another high-performer and is also $279.

However, if you want a cheap drive that's capable of solid, but not impressive performance, you should definitely consider the TeamGroup MP44, which still uses speedy TLC NAND and is $239 or the Silicon Power US75, which uses QLC but promises 7,500 MBps reads and is $205.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Nvidia releases public G-Assist in latest App to provide in-game AI assistance — also introduces DLSS custom scaling factors,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-releases-public-g-assist-in-latest-app-to-provide-in-game-ai-assistance-also-introduces-dlss-custom-scaling-factors,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:49:46 GMT","An idea that started as an April Fools' joke eight years back is now a reality, thanks to recent strides in the field of AI. Meet Project G-Assist, finally available with the latest Nvidia App version 11.0.3.218. Nvidia also introduced custom DLSS Super Resolution scaling factors, allowing users to override the default options with granularity ranging from 33% to 100%. Several settings from the original Nvidia Control Panel also appear in the App, aiming to transform it into a complete replacement.

G-Assist still isn't as robust and sophisticated as its originally teased version that was advertised with the ability to single-handedly take down the Nameless King from Dark Souls. AI simply isn't that capable yet, nor would most people want that. Instead, Nvidia says G-Assist is an AI focused on providing in-game tuning, advice, and help.



Under the hood, it uses a third-party SLM (Small Language Model) that's trained to carry out a specific set of tasks. These tasks are generally associated with optimizing performance, answering questions related to your PC's hardware, and controlling lighting and fan speeds on select peripherals. Certain games will also have integrated custom support that can provide specific help (i.e. the above Ark: Survival Evolved image).



You can get G-Assist up and running as long as you have an Nvidia RTX 30/40/50 series GPU that features 12GB of VRAM or higher. Unfortunately, that leaves behind many entry-level and mid-range GPUs like the RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, RTX 4060 Ti 8GB, and possibly even the upcoming RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti. You'll also need around 6.5GB and 3GB of free space for G-Assist's System Assistant and Voice Command modules, respectively.

Following the Nvidia Blackwell RTX 50-series GPU launch, Nvidia rolled out an update to the Nvidia App that added a new DLSS Override section. The DLSS Override Super Resolution setting allowed users to enable scaling from DLAA (100% input resolution) to DLSS Ultra Performance (33% input resolution) presets at the driver level, when Super Resolution is turned on in-game.

Today, with the new update, instead of the hardcoded presets, you can adjust the input resolution to your liking between 33% and 100%. This can be particularly helpful in cases where you need additional tuning. For example, you might want to use 60% scaling, because the quality preset (67%) might be too demanding, while the performance preset (50%) is too blurry.



Lastly, two important features once only found in the Nvidia Control Panel have made their way to the Nvidia App: Display Scaling and Display Color. The former allows you to override scaling in games/apps, using hardware-accelerated integer scaling, while the latter is used to tweak your display's color settings. You can download the latest version of the Nvidia App from the official website or update it directly from within the Nvidai App if you're already using it.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,"Some ChatGPT users are addicted and will suffer withdrawal symptoms if cut off, say researchers",https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/some-chatgpt-users-are-addicted-and-will-suffer-withdrawal-symptoms-if-cut-off-say-researchers,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:31:36 GMT","According to the first large-scale study, chatbots like ChatGPT can be addictive, and those who become dependent can suffer from withdrawal symptoms if disconnected from the service. OpenAI worked with MIT on this research (both links are PDFs), which examines the emotional effects of chatbot use. The researchers looked at four million ChatGPT interactions and surveyed 4,000 people to gauge changes in the emotional well-being of the user base.

The new study seems to have been precipitated by prior research (2024) that noted that some chatbot users had begun to personify and anthropomorphize AI agents. That's over a decade after Hollywood surfaced this idea in the 2013 movie Her.

Chatbots often have a pet name, and their ""conversational style, first-person language, and ability to simulate human-like interactions"" can be both personal and personable, notes the OpenAI research paper. This leads to some humans using chatbots for support and companionship. Intensifying these human-machine relationships, chatbot makers may be inclined to indulge in social reward hacking, using techniques such as sycophancy and/or mirroring to increase user preference ratings. Business is business.

(Image credit: MIT)

With the above in mind and the inevitable race for the best engagement figures, it comes as little surprise that chatbots are booming. For example, the MIT paper highlights that a major Reddit community discussing AI companions has become one of the largest on the platform, with 2.3 million members.

While online tech communities may concentrate on the positive aspects of these increasingly natural and realistic AI companions – with adept multimodal and voice interaction - others are starting to become alarmed at the negative consequences of chatbot use. This draws parallels with (mis)use of the internet in general, social media usage, and gaming, notes the MIT study. In short, dabbling or light use of these things isn't usually an issue and can even be beneficial.

However, things can get out of hand in all these examples, and the MIT paper says that the ""increasingly human-like behavior and engagement of chatbots"" works to increase addictive qualities and behavior in users. In addition to the addiction and dependency issues, suspected chatbot usage problems, such as unrealistic expectations in real life and social withdrawal, were investigated by the teams.

If you or anyone you know has indicators of addiction to chatbots, it might be a good idea to talk with them or consult a professional. Warning signs include ""preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, and mood modification,"" says OpenAI.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,AMD's Gorgon Point APU line-up breaks cover — Allegedly aiming for a 2026 launch,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amds-gorgon-point-apu-line-up-breaks-cover-allegedly-aiming-for-a-2026-launch,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 12:30:00 GMT","AMD is allegedly planning a successor to its Strix Point lineup of APUs for laptops, codenamed Gorgon Point per JNtechreview (via Harukaze). The reviewer shared several slides on their Naver Cafe channel from the LG Gram X Ryzen launch event that seems to be under embargo, revealing a previously unannounced APU family from AMD that reportedly targets a 2026 launch. There are also talks of a new AI Max series succeeding Strix Halo under the ""Medusa"" lineup. Even if the slides seem real, it's best to approach them with caution, as AMD has not officially confirmed these products.

Gorgon Point allegedly serves as a drop-in replacement for existing Strix Point designs, supporting the same FP8 package. There aren't many architectural changes, as Gorgon Point seemingly sticks with the same Zen 5/5c CPU cores, an RDNA 3.5-based integrated GPU, and an NPU based on XDNA 2. The entire lineup screams Strix Point Refresh, apart from a new Ryzen AI 3 addition, likely to be reserved for entry-level laptops.

Per the slides, AMD's mobile offerings will continue with Hawk Point (Ryzen 200) for mainstream devices, while on the premium end, Gorgon Point is expected to supersede Strix Point next year. Following a two-year cadence, we anticipate Zen 6 to launch sometime later in 2025. However, the slides mention no Zen 6-based APU (likely to be named Medusa Point) for 2025 or 2026, although we could be reading too much into what's essentially leaked information. As a side note, Intel's competing Panther Lake is slated for release later in 2025 and is expected to feature Cougar Cove and Darkmont cores alongside an integrated GPU based on Xe3 (Celestial).

LG Gram X Ryzen new product launch event- Link is limited accessible- Ryzen AI series is now ""Gorgon Point""- Gorgon Point is refresh, 55 TOPS, higher clock- AI Max series will be available in ""Medusa"" series.- There is no RDNA 4 laptophttps://t.co/RrvOPTbgfE pic.twitter.com/4cWXzL0n2WMarch 25, 2025

Moving over to performance, and AMD's internal projections depict single-digit performance increments versus incumbent Strix Point APUs, if these slides are genuine. With the respective Ryzen AI 300 (Strix Point) APU at 15W as the baseline (100%), we've found that the most impressive wins land at just 5-6%, largely due to the faster clock speeds and improved binning.

It was expected for AMD to target Gorgon Point (Strix Point Refresh) for the mainstream market and a potential Medusa Point for premium notebooks next year, similar to how Ryzen 200 (Hawk Point Refresh) chips recently launched as an entry-level option. However, that doesn't seem to be the case, at least according to this leak.

Furthermore, the source also mentions that the successor to the beastly Strix Halo will be available under the Medusa series. AMD will probably incorporate its then-latest architectures, such as Zen 6 and RDNA 4 or the first iteration of UDNA, if we're lucky, with these chips. Sadly, an expected release window has not been specified, although we could be looking as far off as late 2026 or early 2027.

During a Q&A session with LG and AMD, it was supposedly mentioned that there are no plans to bring RDNA 4 discrete GPUs to laptops. This much was already said by AMD in broad terms previously, where it indicated RDNA 4 desktop GPUs are their first priority. All in all, there are still some gaps in AMD's next-generation mobile portfolio, though we're hopeful that time will bring more clarity.",tomshardware

He was ousted in late 2024 before the job was done, but he remains strongly supportive of the company's mission, so he wants to see the new CEO — Lip-Bu Tan — to finish what he started, he said in an interview with CNBC.

""I was committed to and wanting to finish that story on the revitalization of Intel and with the board, the company, and now with Lip-Bu's leadership, you are really cheering them on to finish, because the role that Intel plays in the semiconductor industry is critical and one that's important not just for the industry but for the U.S., so I could not be more supportive of the team and Lip-Bu to finishing their journey,"" said Pat Gelsinger.

The challenges Intel faced, particularly around funding and market expectations, made the transformation extremely difficult. Gelsinger pointed out that one of the biggest obstacles was the financial burden of building a next-generation fabrication network. He noted that his IDM 2.0 strategy — under which Intel remains a vertically integrated maker of its own chips and a contract chipmaker with third party clients — was still the correct one, but acknowledged how capital-intensive and demanding it is for any company.

As Intel's core business declined faster than expected, it became clear that external capital was needed to fund the initiative.

""It is a heavy assignment, and for any company to carry the financial requirements of building next-generation technology fab network, it is very heavy in terms of capital returns required and the investments required to go accomplish that,"" Gelsinger acknowledged. ""As Intel's core business was challenged and deteriorated more quickly than many people expected, there was just such a need for capital to come from elsewhere.""

The former CEO of Intel also criticized the short-term focus of financial markets, which he said clashed with the long-term nature of the transformation Intel was undergoing. He described the tension of trying to execute a multi-year strategic shift while meeting quarterly financial expectations, emphasizing that such balancing was extremely difficult. He noted that this is exactly what Lip-Bu Tan will face in the coming quarters.



""As I have spoken about, the short-termism of Wall Street makes that very challenging and why, yet again, I would say my very best to Intel and Lip-Bu in finishing that seminally important journey,"" said Gelsinger. ""Being a CEO for a transforming public company I truly think is one of the hardest jobs available, because you are trying to do a five-plus-year transformation on a 90-day shot clock, with heavy financial expectation — that is hard.""

In summary, Pat Gelsinger made it clear that despite leaving, he wants Intel — the company that he spent decades in — to succeed and believes in the path the company is on. He reiterated his full support for both the board and Lip-Bu Tan as they continue forward with the IDM 2.0 vision.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,MagStor unveils tape storage drive with Thunderbolt 5 interface for Macs,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/magstor-unveils-tape-drive-with-thunderbolt-5-interface-for-macs,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","MagStor, one of a few companies that develop LTO tape readers for client computers, has introduced the industry's first (and currently only) LTO tape drive with a Thunderbolt 5 interface. The device is aimed at enterprises that need ultimate security, media professionals, and IT specialists who need vast cold storage capacities.

As the name suggests, the MagStor Thunderbolt 5 LTO drive comes with a Thunderbolt 5 interface and is compatible with PCs running Apple MacOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. MagStor does not disclose the exact specifications of the device for now, perhaps because it is still pending certification with Apple and Intel. While it is reasonable to expect it to be able to read LTO-9 tapes (18TB native capacity, 45TB compressed capacity), we do not know whether it will read next-generation LTO-10 tapes (up to 36TB native capacity, up to 90TB compressed capacity).

Read speeds of LTO-8 and LTO-9 tapes are 360 MB/s and 400 MB/s, respectively, and while LTO-10 promises to increase read speed to around 472 MB/s, it will still will not begin to saturate a Thunderbolt 5 interface that supports up to 80 Gbps (10 GB/s) bi-directional (standard mode) and up to 120 Gbps one-directional (in Bandwidth Boost mode) data transfer rates. Nonetheless, if one needs an LTO drive that they will use for years to come, it makes sense to buy one with the latest interface for compatibility with future PCs.

(Image credit: LTO.org)

LTO tapes are widely used as cold storage by enterprises, media and entertainment industries, research institutions, and government agencies. However, LTO tapes are not exactly a popular storage technology for client computers due to a number of limitations, such as prohibitively high prices (MagStor's LTO-9 Thunderbolt 3 drive costs $6,299), lack of plug-and-play support, and usage of specialized management software. However, there are enthusiasts, professionals, and researchers with deep pockets who are willing to invest massive amounts of money to store plenty of data reliably. To that end, MagStor seems to have enough customers for years to come as the LTO technology has a roadmap that spans all the way to 576TB native and 1,440TB compressed capacity.

""At MagStor, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in data storage,"" said Tim Gerhard, VP of Product at MagStor. ""After revolutionizing the market with the first-ever Thunderbolt 3 LTO drive, we’re excited to raise the bar again with Thunderbolt 5, ensuring our customers have access to the most powerful and flexible storage solutions available.""",tomshardware
https://zdnet.com,Anticipated changes in cybersecurity trends over 2030-NRI Secure explains,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230881/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","The cybersecurity situation continues to change, but six major changes are expected to occur over 2030. At a media seminar held by Nomura Research Institute (NRI), NRI Secure Technologies, a cybersecurity business at its group company, explained the ""security roadmap"" that shows six cybersecurity-related changes that could occur by 2030.

Since 2005, NRI has been publishing an IT Roadmap that explains the latest IT trends every year. NRI Secure Technologies is said to be in charge of the latest trends in security technology from the 2017 IT Roadmap, and the 2025 edition covers the security landscape in Japanese society in 2030 with the theme of ""creating a secure future."" Takumi Kimura, a senior security consultant who explained at the seminar, said about the security roadmap, ""It is difficult for companies and organizations to formulate policies and countermeasures based on changes in future security trends, and we are presenting predictions based on the expected threats and future social visions.""



Major changes in cybersecurity expected by 2030 (Source: NRI Secure Technologies) Major changes in cybersecurity expected by 2030 (Source: NRI Secure Technologies)

With this security roadmap, the company shows six changes: (1) the growing need for greater transparency regarding security measures, (2) the integration of cybersecurity and security, (3) the expansion of data security, (4) the guardrails of security accelerating innovation, (5) the expansion of security into space and the ocean fields, and (6) the expansion of socio-technical approaches to security.

First, (1) is said to be the rise in awareness of security risks in the supply chain, and the spread of the concept of ""secure-by-design,"" which incorporates security from the concept, planning, and construction stages of things. This could lead to companies and organizations being responsible for selecting products with a security level that suits their environment, such as through procurement, or for selecting organizations with a certain level of security even when outsourced.

According to Kimura, security ratings are the key to determining the level of security. In fact, from March, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) will begin operating a security conformance assessment system for IoT products, and it is expected that a security countermeasure assessment system will be introduced to strengthen the supply chain from 2026 onwards. There was concern that responding to these issues would be particularly time-consuming and burdensome, especially for larger organizations, so Kimura recommended preparations such as risk assessment and prioritizing responses using tools such as the IPA's ""information security benchmark.""

(2) is expected to strengthen cybersecurity information sharing between the public and private sectors, especially considering that it is natural to view national security and cybersecurity in an integrated way overseas, and the establishment of a ""security clearance system"" (certified access to government-designated information), and the introduction of active cyber defense. Although these have been ahead of the list in some areas, such as critical infrastructure organizations, it is likely that a wider range of companies and organizations will need to respond.

For this reason, when sharing security information, the focus will be on how to implement information sharing between the public and private sectors, and active cyber defense will require monitoring and construction of countermeasures for cyber attack organizations using threat intelligence and other factors. Security clearance should consider a balance between the cost of obtaining certification and the benefits of obtaining it.",zdnet

左から、みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ デジタルコンサルティング部の山下智也氏、同部 コンサルタントの髙橋幸大氏、同部 マネージャーの伊澤俊氏、NTTPCコミュニケーションズ サービスクリエーション本部 第二サービスクリエーション部 サービスクリエーション担当の近藤直人氏、同部 担当課長の中田一郎氏 左から、みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ デジタルコンサルティング部の山下智也氏、同部 コンサルタントの髙橋幸大氏、同部 マネージャーの伊澤俊氏、NTTPCコミュニケーションズ サービスクリエーション本部 第二サービスクリエーション部 サービスクリエーション担当の近藤直人氏、同部 担当課長の中田一郎氏

同実証では、幸手市内の小学校6校の教員100～150人程度を対象に、貸与したウェアラブルデバイスからバイタルデータを収集し、働きがいとの関連性を分析する。実証期間は2024年12月～2025年3月末を予定しており、バイタルデータによる働きがい（エンゲージメント）測定の有効性の検証とデータ分析に基づく支援策を検討するとしている。



実証で利用するウェアラブルデバイス（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ） 実証で利用するウェアラブルデバイス（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ）

NTTPCはもともと企業向けに「健康経営支援サービス」を提供しており、従業員自身のセルフケアと企業の働く環境の改善をサポートしてきた。同サービスは、リストバンド型／リング型デバイスから従業員の業務中のバイタルを計測し、スマートフォンで自身の自律神経バランスや疲れの蓄積状況などの分析結果を見ることができる。

今回の実証実験では、教員を対象に同サービスを活用する。みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ デジタルコンサルティング部 マネージャーの伊澤俊氏は、教育領域のDX推進で中心になるのは児童・生徒だとしつつ、「子どもたちを支える教員がキーワードとして挙がりながらも、なかなかタッチしきれていないと感じている」と話す。

教員の働きがいの低下や離職が課題として挙がる中、労働時間の削減や校務DXなどが進んでいる。一方で教員は、高い専門性が求められる職種であり、持続可能な学校経営を構築するには、単に労働時間を短くするだけでなく、教員の“働きがい”に着目したアプローチが必要になるという。みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズでは自治体・教育現場における教育データ利活用推進を中心とした、教育DXに関わる調査・コンサルティングに複数年携わっていることから、そこでの知見を活用することを構想していた。同氏は、教員にとって真の働き方改革を推進するに当たり、「教員の働き方の指標やデータが少ないのではないかと感じ、2024年の夏ごろにNTTPCに協業の相談を持ちかけた」と実証の背景を語る。

また、NTTPC側も同社が提供するサービスはバイタルデータから現場の状態を可視化することに特化しており、セルフケアを促す通知機能がありつつも、組織に対する施策の提案までできていなかったという。同社 サービスクリエーション本部 第二サービスクリエーション部 サービスクリエーション担当の近藤直人氏は、「みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズの強みであるコンサルティングと掛け合わせて、現場を可視化するだけでなく、そこに対して具体的な施策や効果を実感してもらえるところを幸手市にもご評価いただき、今回の実証実験につながった」と説明する。

実証の企画・管理および教育現場へのコンサルティングはみずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズが行い、ウェアラブルデバイスやシステムの提供、機材トラブルのサポートなどはNTTPCが行う。

ウェアラブルデバイスで収集する脈拍などのバイタルデータを基に分析したものは、「個人標準偏差（いつもの状態）」を基準に、「ワークエンゲージメント（集中状態）」「ストレスフル（疲労・不安）」「バーンアウト（燃え尽き）」「リラックス（安定・寛容）」に分類する。利用者本人はアプリを通じて、自身の状態や変化を確認できる。



バイタルデータの分析イメージ（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ） バイタルデータの分析イメージ（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ）

一方、収集したデータは個人が特定されない学校ごとのデータとして、学校の管理者およびNTTPCやみずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ側からも見ることができる。伊澤氏は「このサービスは、（教員を）管理するためのものではない」と強調し、「学校ごとのデータでは個人が特定されないため、不明瞭な部分も残ってしまうが、あえて余地を残したデータでどこまでできるかを挑戦している。そのため、管理する目的ではないということをユーザーには伝えたい」と話す。

また、同氏は「働き方はチームで考えていかなければ改革にはつながらない」と指摘。管理者や両社から見られる学校全体のデータは、「パフォーマンススコア」として学校全体のモチベーションやメンタル不調などが可視化される。パフォーマンススコアは、一般的に業務や物事に集中できる状態がパフォーマンスが高いとされ、パフォーマンス状態を100点満点でスコア化できる。

このデータを基に、みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズが課題を抱えている学校に対して改善施策を提案し、実施する。パフォーマンススコアは「良い」「中程度」「悪い」で分けられ、この推移が激しい学校が課題を抱えていると想定し、改善策の実施を考えている。

既にある程度のデータが収集・分析されており、各学校の違いが明らかになりつつあるという。残業時間だけを見ると問題がないような学校でも、バイタルデータを見ると改善の余地があることが分かった。従来の指標だけではアプローチができなかった学校に対して今回の実証をきっかけにアプローチできるのではないかとしている。

バイタルデータとは別に教員に対してアンケートを実施しており、調査結果とパフォーマンススコアがある程度対応していることも見えてきている。具体的な改善施策の提案としては、バイタルデータとアンケート調査の結果を照らし合わせるとともに、幸手市教育委員会の意見を取り入れながら進める。特にアンケート結果から、「同僚などとチームとして取り組んでいける機運を醸成したい」という声が多く寄せられたことから、一つの施策として学校管理職に対する外部有識者の講演を予定している。チームとしての学校経営の在り方や同僚間でのサポートがしやすい環境づくりなど、管理職が抱えている課題を基に他自治体の事例や有識者の知見を提供するという。



実証の概要（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ） 実証の概要（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ）

この実証を行うに当たり、「学校現場の負担にならないようにいかに手軽にやっていくかを大事にしていた」と伊澤氏は言う。そのため、バイタルデータという手軽にとれる範囲のデータを活用し、これまで教育委員会や管理職の目が届きづらい教員一人一人の兆しを見ることができるようにした。「もちろん、バイタルデータの有用性はあるものの、それだけでは分からないこともあるのだという感覚は持っていなければならない」と語る。

幸手市教育委員会からは、勤怠データだけでは分からない部分に対してバイタルデータがどこまで有用なのか、またデータを踏まえた支援策の有効性について期待されているという。

今後の展開について、近藤氏は「健康経営支援サービスは可視化が強みで、打ち手の部分は打ち手の部分はパートナー商材を組み合わせることで完成するビジネスモデルとなっている。みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズによるコンサルティングならではの人のぬくもりがあってこそ、コミュニケーションの改善や現場での実践ができると思う。可視化だけでなく結果まで出して、横展開できたらと思っている」と明かす。

伊澤氏は、「このプロジェクトはいろいろな展開の仕方があると思っている。例えば、幸手市教育委員会に限らず、ご関心ある自治体と継続して協力しながら、バイタルデータの有用性を検証するとともに、バイタルデータを通じ得られた気づきも一助に教育現場へのより良い打ち手を検討することが重要と考える。また、教員に関するケアをより重要にしていくフェーズに入った時に、インプットとなる情報や教員に関するデータが不足しているという課題がある。この課題を解消することで、働き方だけでなく、個別最適・協働的な学びの実現において、教員のよりよい指導にもつながると考えている」と述べた。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Will Google's new Pixel 9a be the best solution for a cheaper smartphone?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230829/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","In the mobile industry, every time new models appear, it appears to be ""finding mistakes."" Whether it's Apple's iPhone, Samsung Electronics' Galaxy, or Google's Pixel, you'll have to figure out what's actually new.

This also applies to the new Pixel 9a. The price is $499, the same as the previous model, the Pixel 8a, released in 2024, but the display has been made larger and the battery has been increased in capacity.

At the very least, the moderate expression is that Google is making a safe choice for 2025 for the A-series Pixel devices. But this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Like its predecessor, the Pixel 9a is easy to hold and has been generally welcomed with a welcome improvement.

The Pixel 9a's 6.3-inch OLED display is slightly larger than the Pixel 8a's 6.1-inch, but is comparable to the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Pixel 9a has a peak brightness of 2,700 nits (the Pixel 8a is 2,000), making it a little easier to read even in direct sunlight.

The Pixel 9a comes in four colors: Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris. The beauty with a unified look in wallpaper, icons and devices is unique to Google, not found in other Android manufacturers such as Samsung and OnePlus.

The processor is enhanced to the Tensor G4, which improves overall performance, power efficiency and AI workflow. The new chip and 8GB of RAM make it compatible with image processing tools such as ""Add Me"" (shown together), ""Astrophotography"" and ""Pixel Studio.""

These photo editing tools should go well with the 48 megapixel main camera. It appears to be inferior to the Pixel 8a's 64 megapixel, but the F-value ranged from 1.89 to 1.7. This is the same camera performance as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and is combined with the same 13 megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens as the Pixel 8a.

It has IP68 grade waterproof and dustproof performance, and has been increased from 4492mAh of the Pixel 8a battery capacity to 5100mAh. What's particularly noteworthy is that the battery capacity is larger than any other model in the series, such as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Other parts include wired/wireless charging speed, a 7-year software update warranty, storage options, and price, and the Pixel 8a. Overall, it is a device that is cheaper than Apple's iPhone 16e ($599), yet has more competitive features and performance. It is scheduled to be released in April.",zdnet

同社は「統合オブザーバビリティSaaSプラットフォーム」を提供する企業としてグローバルでも右肩上がりの成長を継続しているといい、正井氏はその理由として積極的な研究開発投資を挙げた。年間で売上比28％を研究開発に投資しているとのことで、同氏が紹介したグローバルでのデータでは2021年以降オブザーバビリティベンダー各社の中でもDatadogの投資額が突出しており、競合に大差を付けている状況が示された。同社の市場シェアは2022年から首位を維持しているそうで、積極的な研究開発投資に支えられた製品力が市場の支持を得ているといえるだろう。

2025年の事業戦略を話した正井氏は、重点製品として「クラウドセキュリティ」「オンコール」「AI」の3つを挙げた。オンコールは2024年発表の新機能で、単純に言えばスマートフォンなどに通知を発信する機能といえる。従来はこの機能が提供されていなかったため、ユーザー企業は別途オンコール製品を用意して組み合わせて実現していたが、モニタリングから通知の発信、さらにリモートからのインシデント対応などを単一プラットフォームで実現したことで、既に多くの引き合いが来ているという。

AIに関しては、AIを活用して従来のモニタリングの機能を強化するとともに、ユーザー企業のAI環境に対する監視／管理を強化していくという2つの方向性で取り組まれる。具体的には、監視データを分析し、迅速な問題解決を支援する「Watchdog」、AIチャットボット「Bits AI」、AIスタック全体を可視化する「AI Integration」、大規模言語モデル（LLM）の可視性やパフォーマンス、セキュリティなどを総合的に支援する「LLM Observability」などが提供される（図1）。

チャネル＆アライアンス戦略に関しては、「Oracle Cloud Infrastructure」（OCI）の正式サポートが2024年に発表され、これによって「4大クラウド（Amazon Web Services、Google Cloud Platform、Microsoft Azure、OCI）全てをオブザーバビリティの観点でカバー」した。また、国内パートナーとの協業体制も強化しており、最上位となるゴールドティアパートナーが伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ（CTC）、アイレット、キンドリルジャパン、京セラコミュニケーションシステムの4社体制になったことに加え、新たなパートナー企業として東京エレクトロン デバイスとNTTデータとの契約締結が同日付で発表されている。

正井氏は、2025年の国内事業戦略として「日本市場への積極投資は今後も継続する」「日本法人の組織を拡大し、より強力に顧客、パートナーを支援可能な体制を作る」「市場カバレッジ強化については、オブザーバビリティ市場拡大を確実に捉えるため、2024年のミッドマーケット組織に続いて、2025年は関西地域担当のチームを新たに立ち上げる」「パートナーエコシステムの一層の拡大と、特にデリバリーの強化を図り、パートナービジネスの比重を高める」「新規顧客の獲得に加え、既存顧客における導入製品の拡大によってさらなる売上増を図る」「マーケティング活動では、オブザーバビリティ領域でのトッププレゼンスを獲得する」といった方針を語った。

最後に同氏は、「2024年2月の就任時には、名実ともにナンバーワンのオブザーバビリティベンダーになることを目標に掲げたが、おかげさまで2024年は多くのお客さまに恵まれ、実りの多い1年とすることができたと考えている。2025年はその成果を基に、日本企業のクラウドシフトと共に大きく成長している日本のオブザーバビリティ市場全体をけん引するリーディングカンパニーとして、パートナー企業様と共に日本企業のシステム／サービス変革に貢献できるベンダーになれるよう一層尽力する」とまとめた。",zdnet

https://zdnet.com,"The latest iPad review for around 50,000 yen What is the 11th generation (A16) model?",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230891/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:03:00 GMT","あなたにとってiPadとは何か？──。これは意地悪な質問ではない。ある人にとってはクリエイティブな端末で、ある人にとってはゲーム、あるいは「単に画面の大きいiPhone」だったりする。

iPadの上位モデルはプロフェッショナルな用途も十分にこなせるが、実際にはそこまで求めていない人も多い。もし派手な機能を求めないなら、いまだに「無印iPad」と呼ばれるAppleのベーシックモデルを買えばいい。大多数の人が欲しいのは、おそらくそういうiPadだろう。

今回登場した第11世代「iPad」（A16）もまさにそうしたモデルだ。日本では5万8800円で買える本機は、128GBストレージとA16チップを備え、まさにちょうどよい仕様に仕上がっている。

第11世代「iPad」A16（Amazonで価格をチェック）



ただし、iPadをノートPCライクに使うつもりなら話は別だ。キーボードをつけたり、Apple Pencilで本格的なイラストやデザインをしたいなら、最初からM3搭載の新しい「iPad Air」を検討しておいたほうが賢明だ。ディスプレイの表示品質も格段にきれいだし、周辺機器を揃えるとすぐに金額がかさむからだ。

M3搭載の「iPad Air」（Amazonで価格をチェック）



筆者の場合、iPadはボードゲームの「Balatro」や「カタン」「Retro Bowl Plus」を延々とプレイしたり、テレビがふさがっているときに動画を観たり、資料を読んだりしている。たまにキーボードケースをつけて文章を書くことはあるが、写真を眺めたり、SNSをだらだら見たり、友人や家族とビデオチャットしたりがメインだ。マルチタスクでクリエイティブなことをする機会はほとんどない。そんな私には無印のiPadで十分だ。

●ストレージ容量は前モデルから倍増

無印のiPadは昔からストレージ容量が不足しており不満だった。先代の第10世代iPadは64GBしかなく、記事を書くときは「ストレージは上げておいたほうがいい」とおすすめしてきた。

一方、今回の11世代iPadは同じ価格帯で128GBとストレージ容量が倍増した。もちろんパワーユーザーには物足りないかもしれないが、ストレージの増量を検討する人なら、最初からM3チップを積んだiPad Airを選んだほうがいい。ただし値段は9万8800円する。

●A16チップで少しだけ高速。でも爆速ではない

iPad（A16）はA16チップを搭載している。これは「iPhone 14 Pro」や「iPhone 15」にも使われているチップで、第10世代iPadのA14よりは速くなっているが、ぶっちぎりの性能というわけではない。

Geekbench 6のマルチコアスコアは6186で、M3搭載のiPad Air（約1万1643）のおよそ半分だ。シングルコアは2589で、これはM2世代のiPad Proと同等だ。ただ、おそらく大半の人は、このiPadでマルチタスクはしないだろう。

普段使いのアプリ、例えば動画ストリーミングや軽めのゲーム、記事を読むくらいなら、この程度の性能差はわからないはずだ。

筆者はハイスペックなiPadももちろん好きだ。プロセッサが速いほうが長く使えるし、画面も格段に美しいし、性能に余裕があるに越したことはない。

ただ、Mシリーズのチップを搭載するiPadだからといって日常的に大きく得するかというと、個人的にはそうでもない。MシリーズiPad AirやiPad Proに搭載されている追加のマルチタスク機能も、同時に4つのアプリを開ける程度で、正直そこまで活用していない。

Apple Intelligence？ 今はまだ全然実用レベルではないし、自分の生活にはあまり役立たない。今後のiPadOSではAI機能が強化されるかもしれないが、A16チップ搭載のこの第11世代iPadはそのアップデートから外れている。

今は正直、Apple Intelligenceがなくても困らない。でも1年後にはどう感じるかわからない。今は問題なくても、将来変わるかもしれない。そのあたりは自分の使い方とアップデートの方向性を見ながら判断すればいいと思う。

カメラにも変化はない。でもそれで問題ない。第10世代のアップデートですでにカメラまわり（とiPad本体のデザイン全体）が刷新されているからだ。要するに今回のモデルは、第10世代にストレージ容量とチップの性能を上げただけの変化だ。だが、横向きフロントカメラが正面に配置されているおかげで、ケースに立てて家族みんなでビデオ通話しても、画面の中央にきれいに映ってくれる。

●不満点

少し不満なのは、2024年秋に発売された最新「iPad mini」よりも仕様が劣るという点だ。

最新の8インチ「iPad mini」はA17チップを搭載しており、Apple Intelligenceを使える。それにApple Pencil Proにも対応していて、本体側面にマグネットでピタッとくっつく。

一方、今回のiPadはApple Intelligenceの対応ラインからぎりぎり外れている。それに、使えるペンはシンプルなUSB-CのApple Pencilか、Lightningアダプタが必要な初代Apple Pencilだけだ。どちらもiPad本体にマグネット装着する機能はなく、持ち歩くときは別の方法を考えるか、ペン収納ループ付きのケースでも使うしかない。

USB-CのApple Pencilはアート系アプリで使えるが、筆圧感知やホバーモード、新しいタップ操作などの機能は一切ない。本格的にアートをやるならやはり「iPad Air」や「iPad Pro」を買うべきだ。

ただ、Appleが手頃なモデルをラインナップしてくれているのはありがたい。子ども用にもいいし、シンプルに使いたいだけの人には十分だ。余計な機能を削っている分、価格が上がらなかったのは評価したい。とはいえ、次のモデルでは、もう少し上のチップを積んで、Apple Pencil Proに対応して欲しいとは思う。

The company explained to CNET that it was a temporary technical issue, but did not go into detail. The problem has already been resolved, and the new move history is now displayed in the timeline.

""Temporarily there was a technical issue that deleted some users' timeline data,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""Most users with encrypted backups on the Timeline can restore data, but users who have not enabled backups can unfortunately not recover lost data.""

According to Google, in order to restore data from a backup, you need to use the latest version of Google Maps. To import data, open the Timeline section, tap the cloud icon at the top of the screen and select Backup. The Android Authority, a technology media outlet, was the first to report on this issue.

Google Maps Timeline is a feature that allows you to record locations and routes visited, and is disabled by default.

It's not just a problem with Google

Eric Abbruzzese, director of market research firm ABI Research, said the impact was relatively minor as this time it was not a major Google service and only a small portion of the users affected.

However, if similar issues had occurred with other Google services such as Gmail and YouTube, it could have been a more serious situation.

""Google literally stores exabytes of data. If data from one service could disappear like this, the same could happen elsewhere,"" Abbruzzese notes.

Furthermore, these issues are not limited to Google, but can occur anywhere that handles large-scale data.

""This case shows that this type of issue could increase as more companies change their storage and data jurisdiction policies to keep up to date,"" he said.

This has the advantages of not only having to carry your driver's license with you as long as you carry your My Number card while driving, but you can take courses online for renewing your license, and you can complete one-stop procedures when your address, last name, etc. have changed.

On the other hand, there are also misconceptions on social media such as, ""If you obtain a Myna license, you can drive with just your smartphone without a physical card.""

This is not a mistake in the government's future policy, but it has not yet been realized at this point.

What's confusing is that even today, ""only compatible Android smartphones can have some functions (digital certificates) of the My Number Card."" This may be one of the reasons why people misunderstood that ""My smartphone has a My Number card, so there's no need to carry an actual card with you."" In reality, it only has some features, and of course no Myna license is included.

In addition, starting from spring 2025, smartphones will be able to include ""functions equivalent to My Number cards"" such as name, address, date of birth, gender, My Number, and face photo. This will allow the smartphone itself to function as an ID card.

However, according to the National Police Agency's website, even at that time, it is not possible to install a driver's license on a smartphone, and before you can actually drive on a smartphone alone, you will need to wait for further changes.

At the 4th Digital Society Promotion Conference, the government has stated that the mobile driver's license, which allows smartphones to become driver's licenses, will ""aim to realize it as soon as possible"" after installing a My Number card on smartphones (scheduled this spring).

https://zdnet.com,"The possibility of ""burning out satellites in the Earth's atmosphere"" destroying the global environment -- Starlink has increased dramatically",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230890/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:08:00 GMT","According to a new study funded by NASA, communications satellites like Starlink could reduce the Earth's ozone layer as they reach their lifespan and re-enter the atmosphere. The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters.

When satellites such as Starlink reach their lifespan, they enter the atmosphere and burn out, leaving small particles of aluminum oxide at that time. This drops to the ozone layer, which absorbs ultraviolet rays. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that these oxides increased eight times between 2016 and 2022.

Not all of this increase comes from Starlink. This is because Starlink launched its first satellite in May 2019. However, the Starlink satellite is currently the overwhelming majority in low orbit.

There are approximately 8,100 artefacts in low orbit, of which more than 6,000 are Starlinks. There are plans to launch an additional 12,000 units, with the possibility of up to 42,000 in the future, Space.com reports.

These satellites reach their lifespan in about five years. For example, a satellite weighing approximately 250 kg will release approximately 30 kg of aluminum oxide fine particles upon re-entry in the atmosphere. Starlink's satellites are gradually getting heavier, with the latest model reaching approximately 1,250 kg.

Aluminum is mainly released at about 50 to 80 km above, but it takes 30 years for it to descend to the ozone layer. As of 2022, data shows that the amount of aluminum in the atmosphere has increased by 29.5% from natural values ​​due to burned-out satellites. But researchers warn that things will get worse if things continue like this.

""I'm particularly worried about the large number of satellites coming up in the future,"" Joseph Wang, one of the research authors, told CNET. ""We expect this will be an excess of 640% or more than natural value per year. That would be pretty bad.""

Unlike other ozone depleting substances, aluminum oxides are not consumed during the reaction and remain in the atmosphere for a long time. It could take 30 years for the ozone layer to be continuously damaged and eventually drop to altitude.

If Starlink scales as planned, more than 8,000 satellites will enter the atmosphere and burn out every year. If researchers fit this predictive model that expects an increase in the number of satellites, the amount of aluminum released could be 360 ​​tons, or 640% of the natural value.

●Scale-satellite proliferation brought about by Starlink

What is particularly noteworthy about this new study is that there are still many unclear parts. ""The environmental impact of satellite reentry is currently unknown,"" the study states.

Four years after the launch, Starlink accounts for 40% of all satellites launched so far in human history, and plans to increase it by seven times more in the future. Project Kuiper, a rival Amazon, is also planning to launch 3,232 satellites.

One article published in Nature pointed out that ""it's not a ""realistic possibility"" that 100,000 satellites are ""a very likely"" to happen."" Most of the reason is that private companies like SpaceX, Amazon and OneWeb are launching satellites one after another to provide high-speed internet.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), excessive ultraviolet rays can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and weakened immune systems, leading to lower crop yields and disruption in the marine food chain.

Researchers say, ""If the number of re-entries increases further, it is essential to explore more deeply the problems revealed in this study.""

Starlink did not respond to CNET's request for comment.

The current half -year report of the Advanced Threat Operations Team from Ontinue also shows a positive development: the ransom payments fell by 35 percent in 2024. While in 2023 $ 1.25 billion in the pockets of cybercriminals to buy encrypted data again, it was only around $ 814 million last year.

According to Ontinue, the reason for this lies in better backup strategies and incident response plans, but also in new regulations that are increasingly prohibiting payments. All of this leads to a rethink in Hacker groups that now adapted their tactics: Instead of just encrypting the data, they steal them and threaten to make them publicly to force companies to pay.

Overall, ransomware attacks are still one of the most popular means of hacker collectives and cybercriminals. According to the security experts, a worrying trend is that the hacker groups are less and less relying on pure programming knowledge, but has recently become increasingly on general IT skills. Potential hackers would increasingly be recruited after their skills with regard to navigating in corporate networks, the evaluation and deactivation of backups as well as hacking databases and virtualized environments.

The Threat Intelligence Report by Ontinue also reveals an increasing sophistication in voice phishing. The so-called Vishing had achieved a new threat level through the increasingly more powerful Genai models that can clone deceptively. Hackers used the AI ​​models to create realistic, but fake deeps of voices of trustworthy people. With this equipped, they called out selected victims, asked about registration data and would bring them to approve fraudulent transactions or to grant unauthorized access to systems.

In the first quarter of 2024 alone, D ONTINUE recorded an increase in incidents related to Vishing, around 1,633 Proezt compared to the previous quarter. ""Many of these attacks led the victims to fake Microsoft support sites that were often hosted.

The current Vishing campaigns illustrate how social engineering, in combination with AI-based Deepfakes, becomes an increasingly effective method for cybercriminals in order to get sensitive data or to receive access to protected systems, continues. The security provider predicts that Vishing will also be an increasing threat in 2025 and beyond.",zdnet

In the immediate future, the initial effect of this attack was the paralysis of several programs and services offered by Harvest with its customers, mainly banks and wealth management advisers.

But the company recently communicated to its partners. And it warns possible leaks of personal data. What lead banks to contact their customers to warn them of the risk. As the AGEFI reports, the MAIF subsidiary of MAIF financial solution as well as the Banque Populaire-Caisse d'Alivé (BPCE) began to contact their customers concerned by the data leak. According to Citywire, Banque Palatine has also undertaken to report to its concerned customers the leak of data.

Complicated communication

For BPCE customers, the data in question relates to their identity, but also, for a limited number of them, their outstanding and securities numbers.

For MAIF, these are data relating to civil status, the matrimonial and professional situation. In all cases, the dissemination of these data facilitates the implementation of phishing, scam or identity theft attacks. Banks therefore call their customers to the greatest vigilance.

The fact remains that the exact number of people affected by this data leak is difficult to estimate. In the communication of March 19 addressed to its customers, Harvest evokes ""a compromise of some internal files, and accounts of messaging of employees"" as reported by the specialized magazine Managementdefortune.com. The fairly vague description does not give much information on the extent of the leak. Harvest assures that the ""contained in Harvest software has not been the subject of any extraction"".

Domino effect

The computer attack that targeted Harvest took place on February 27. It led to blocking several services offered by the company. This publishes software operating in SaaS mode for wealth management advisers. These are services to simulate certain financial operations, carry out fund scoring, the aggregation of accounts etc.

In his initial communication, Harvest had assured that no data leak had been noted.

And that the restart of the services would gradually be done during the month of March.",zdnet

A new report by Writer, specializing in generative AI, examines the gap between what companies are capable of doing with AI and what employees want them to do.

The survey made it possible to collect the responses of 1,600 employees (in the United States), including 800 executives and 800 employees, concerning the AI ​​at the workplace.

Professionals want AI at their workplace

Many professionals are now looking for jobs that allow them to work with generative AI. Among those questioned, 59 % of executives and 35 % of employees said they were actively looking for a new job in a more innovative generative AI company than their current employer. In addition, 59 % of executives and 45 % of employees said they would not even plan to work for a company that does not use generative AI.

Additional proof of the attraction of AI, 97 % of executives and 81 % of employees said that if they were looking for a new job, they would like one in an innovative company in the field of generative AI. Some 96 % of executives and 84 % of employees also said they expected an employer to offer them training in the field of generative AI.

Companies that adopt AI should therefore not have so much difficulty in retaining employees wishing to use it.

About 93 % of executives and 90 % of employees declared themselves optimistic about the approach of their company in terms of generative AI. The survey respondents also indicated several reasons for which their employer adopted AI. The income opportunity is the first reason, followed by the interest of employees, then in competitive pressure. Customer demand, resolution of a problem and management ultimatum also appear on the list.

Decision -making

Some 97 % of managers and 88 % of employees said they had benefited from generative AI tools. Many of them said it gave them more time to focus on the strategy. Others said they allowed them to make data -based decisions more quickly. Some said they had more time to explore new commercial opportunities.

A smaller number said that Gen gives them more time to manage or collaborate with their colleagues. Others still allow them to spend less time writing reports and emails or performing administrative tasks.

Why do companies find it difficult to integrate AI?

This brings us back to companies that are struggling to integrate AI. What are the challenges and obstacles to which companies have faced?

Many people interviewed said that the adoption of AI has led to power in their business.

More specifically, this development has created tensions between CIOs and other sectors of activity, as well as between managers and employees. Some say that IT managers do not collaborate with employees to adopt AI, that IT does not provide real added value to the generative AI, or that employees have been left to themselves to find how to use generative AI.

A serious strategy problem

Other difficulties appeared. Some employees do not even know if their business has an AI strategy. Many executives and employees believe that their employer has not obtained a high return on investment thanks to AI, despite its promises. In some companies, employees pay their pockets their AI tools because their business does not provide those they want to use.

In some companies too, the situation has led to a serious disconnection. While many professionals want to use AI, others are reluctant, fearing that it would replace them. A small number of employees even admitted to having sabotaged their company's strategy in terms of AI by making believe that the tools were not efficient enough or that they generated poor quality.
