Oops, something went wrong

Investors are betting on new Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan to turn around the troubled chipmaker.

While it's unclear whether Intel's financial problems can be fixed quickly, Wall Street analysts — and current and former employees — generally agree on what steps Tan needs to take, short of a breakup. Those steps include everything from cutting jobs to turbocharging Intel's young foundry business.

A semiconductor industry veteran, Tan was appointed to his new role on March 12. Investors applauded the news: Intel stock rose more than 15% the next day. Analysts liked Tan's experience as former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a semiconductor design software company, and his experience on boards of some 14 semiconductor companies, including Intel.

Now the hard part.

Tan is inheriting a company whose financial losses have made it a takeover target in recent months. Many Wall Street analysts and investors believe Intel — which is the only American leading-edge chip manufacturer — would be better off splitting up and selling its struggling manufacturing business. Case in point: The stock has risen on various reports in recent months of potential deals, some of which were allegedly being worked on with the support of the Trump administration.

Reuters reported last week that Tan plans to keep Intel's manufacturing business running for now and is looking to bolster Intel's faltering AI chip efforts to catch up to Nvidia (NVDA). He said as much in a letter to employees on March 12: "Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before."

Yahoo Finance interviewed four Wall Street analysts and nine current and former Intel employees — including high-level executives. The employees were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance.

And Intel's product business, which designs the chips, can't outsource to rival manufacturers so easily — Intel semiconductors are specifically made in accordance with its own internal manufacturing processes. Not to mention, Intel's billions in CHIPS Act funding requires it to retain majority ownership of its foundry.

Intel declined to make Lip-Bu Tan available for an interview but told Yahoo Finance: "Lip-Bu is spending a lot of time listening to customers and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success."

Here's what company sources and Wall Street analysts said he has to do to to avoid a break up.

Intel is one of the few remaining chipmakers that both designs and makes its own chips.

On the design side, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as AMD (AMD) and, of course, Nvidia in an increasingly AI-dominated industry. On the manufacturing side, Intel has repeatedly faced delays.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger attempted to grow Intel's revenue by opening its in-house manufacturing business — a "foundry" — to outside customers on a large scale. Foundries such as Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) produce chips for other companies. Intel historically produced chips for its internal product business before Gelsinger launched Intel Foundry Services (IFS) in 2021.

The foundry strategy had mixed results. Intel is set to achieve a big feat by launching a new advanced chip manufacturing process called 18A this year, and IFS has deals with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). But analysts debate whether Intel can sustain the foundry, which lost $13.4 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue in 2024.

Bottom line: Intel needs to attract more big outside customers. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success.

In order for Intel's manufacturing business to survive, the company must succeed in launching 18A. While Intel manufacturing employees had previously suggested that the new technology was having trouble, those same employees said this week that 18A is progressing — and Intel manufacturing staff is feeling "positive" about its success.

As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said: "[I]f the results are good and companies are happy, they'll increase their capacity at" the foundry.

Per Reuters, Tan is looking to boost Intel's AI chip efforts to rival Nvidia and others.

Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, Intel scrapped a multiyear project, Larrabee, to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD's graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU, which ultimately failed. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores.

"Intel has a very good finance organization, but the company does sometimes make these decisions that are overly led by the early years' financial outcome," said a former high-level executive. "You only learn from deploying. If you intend to be in that market long term, you might as well have access to the market, even if it costs you through the first generation."

Former and current Intel employees describe the company, whose staffers refer to themselves as "Team Blue," as slow and bureaucratic. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management.

It's a tough balancing act. The two current employees said any layoffs could depress morale and risk slowing the progress of 18A. Tan already has said Intel has "hard decisions" ahead. One of the employees said their colleagues are bracing for a potentially "huge amount” of layoffs in the second or third quarter.

They said their teams are already understaffed, and cuts to middle management would result in those teams being moved around, creating chaos.

One of the high-level former executives said, "The depth of talent at Intel is immense, and the loyalty that people have is astounding," later adding, "The answer lies in inspiring the people you have."

Business owners have welcomed Liverpool City Council's decision to suspend controversial parking restrictions near Everton's new stadium.

An Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (Etro), including heavy restrictions on street parking, was introduced earlier this year within a half-hour walking radius of the Bramley-Moore Dock stadium.

On Monday, the council agreed to pause the restrictions until August in areas where businesses have been most heavily impacted.

Paul Blair, who owns the Hot Water Comedy Club, led a petition against the restrictions. He said that while businesses welcomed the council's decision, they were still feeling the impact of the seven weeks the rules have been in place.

"They've obviously seen an impact in sales and customers," said Mr Blair, who also owns Blackstock Market.

"There's been loads of concern about it moving forward, especially if they started to implement it every day in August, which is a huge concern.

"Hopefully there will be a proper economic impact assessment done and we're listened to before changes are made."

The council said it had received more than 5,000 responses as part of a public consultation.

Business owners in the streets around the stadium said they were very worried about the council's initial plans to enforce traffic restrictions all year round, rather than only on matchdays. 

Some even claimed the rules could force them out of business.

Mr Blair said more than 200 companies had been affected by the restrictions and complained about what he regarded as a lack of communication. 

"Nobody knew about it," he said.

"These businesses operate every day. We have staff every day. We have about 5,000 customers a week and they were literally impacted straight away.

"It's just lack of foresight, lack of any economic impact assessment."

Fraser Smith, managing director of the Downland bedding company which is based about 30 minutes from the stadium, said the council's concessions were "fantastic news on face value".

But he sounded a note of caution.

"It is only a temporary measure - we'll have to see what happens in August. But for now it's good news for all the businesses that are affected by this."

Mr Blair said he was pleased with the way the local community had come together over the last few weeks.

He said he was hopeful that now there is an open line of communication with the council, any future changes will be discussed and agreed with residents and businesses before they introduced.

The council's cabinet member for transport and connectivity, Dan Barrington, said the restrictions were part of an "experimental traffic order" so changes could be made once it was live.

"It's given us this space to be able to listen to concerns from people, particularly as it went live, and we've taken that into consideration," he said.

"We really want to get the best situation for everyone in the area," added Barrington.

"It's complex and complicated - the whole reason we did this as an experimental traffic order was because we knew ultimately there would need to be tweaks and changes."

Everton will leave Goodison Park at the end of the season in May before kicking off life at Bramley-Moore Dock in August.

The Ladies European Tour has launched further statistical analysis in partnership with Upgame, the market leading golf analytics app, for both the LET and LET Access Series.

Starting today [March 25] and available on LET's website and app, Upgame will have a dedicated page to show strokes gained from each tournament. The new feature is the first time that Upgame has provided a bespoke webpage for a major golf tour, showcasing strokes gained insights. This will allow for improved performance analytics, data-driven decision making, and customisation of training for LET members, in addition to more digital content for engaged fans. 

Since 2023, players have been able to record shots and view how they have performed in relation to intended targets. In turn, both players and fans have been able to access enhanced data points like shot patterns, benchmarks, and strokes gained analytics, all helping to enhance performance while digitally enriching the LET product around the world.

Some interesting strokes gained data captured by Upgame in 2024 has given some good benchmarks for players to target. To finish in the top 10 of the LET Order of Merit, the top 10 players outperformed the rest of the LET players by 1.87 strokes overall, excelling on approach shots with a gain of 0.85 strokes, and showcasing strengths off the tee (0.47 strokes), short game (0.20 strokes), and putting (0.34 strokes).For players competing on the LET Access Series in 2025 and looking to achieve full LET status they should look to the top seven average of the 2024 season which had a raw strokes gained of -0.99. 

Alexandra Armas, CEO of the LET, said: “This is a great addition to what already seems to have been a hugely beneficial tool for our golfers and fans across the globe. These advanced statistics allow our elite women athletes to benchmark their performance on a specific course against others in the field, giving a clear picture of how they compare and where they need to focus. Through this enhanced digital output, it's a further step towards developing the women's game to be played at the highest level.” 

Sameer Sawhney, founder of Upgame, commented: “We are delighted to be working with the LET as the first global golf tour to have a bespoke Upgame performance insights page which displays enhanced Strokes Gained statistics for all players, media and fans. We look forward to developing the platform further to showcase even more of the unique metrics captured, such as dispersions to targets and target lines.”

Upgame is used globally by 40 national federations and more than 100 collegiate organisations, with thousands of players and coaches utilising the app to their advantage.

COVINGTON, Ky. — Incentive programs in the city of Covington are set up to attract small businesses and help support them as they get up and running.

The city say it's been successful in giving Covington a small business-friendly reputation.

The owner of a chocolate shop is taking advantage, saying he couldn't find something like this anywhere else.

Paul Picton has taken an interesting career path, going from selling jet engines for years to now, to selling chocolate.

“I was always traveling around, and I would bring chocolate home. And when I left the corporate world, after a few weeks I ran out of chocolate, and so I started making it at home. And the more I made it, the more people were encouraging me to bring it to a bigger audience,” said Picton, owner and co-founder of the Maverick Chocolate Company.

Maverick Chocolate has been in Cincinnati's Findlay Market for 11 years. It also had a store in Norwood, but Picton said the business was recently “essentially kicked out” of that space. He knew he wanted a small business-friendly community to be the new home for his sweet treats.

“Covington is one of the few communities around that offers any kind of incentives for small business,” Picton said.

He's taking advantage of two Covington small business incentive programs. The first helps with up to $6,000 in rent during the first year.

Patrick Duffy, business retention and expansion manager for Covington's Economic Development Department, explained.

“We want them to focus more on growing their business and expanding their business, and less about the rent, making their rent every month,” Duffy said.

The second program aims to help prop up one of Covington's best assets: its historic buildings, by also offering up to $6,000 to help fix them up. This one is for building owners, who are often but not always business owners as well. 

In Maverick Chocolate's case, it applies, because besides the chocolate shop, Picton bought a building that will become a chocolate factory. He said the 60-year-old building was an eyesore, and he's looking forward to using the funds to “pretty it up.” 

“We have a really rich history here in Covington, so it helps us preserve that, and honestly, these old buildings need some work. They're great, they're really strong bones, but sometimes they just need a little love to make them more inviting,” Duffy said. “What we want to do is help them pay for their project, up to 50% of the project, up to $6,000, to help them revitalize their storefront, and do it in a historically appropriate manner.”

There's been four rounds a year of these incentives since 2017. The latest featured the West Sixth Brewery, a CPA and Maverick Chocolate.

“When you transition into a new space, there's always some growing pains. It takes time for people to know where you are, and so a rent subsidy really helps in the first year as you're trying to reestablish or establish in the first place,” Picton said.

Duffy said it's helping with the overall revitalization of the city.

“It's bringing a lot of diversity of businesses, and it really makes Covington a place where people want to not only work, but enjoy their leisure time,” he said. “The small business owners are what make up our identity as a city. And they really give us a lot of our character.”

The programs are all reimbursement-based. Once a business signs a lease, they can submit their invoice for rent and Covington will reimburse half the rent up to $500 per month for the first year, totaling $6,000. The facade grant will also reimburse up to half the cost of a project up to $6,000.

A month ago, City Council approved an ordinance allowing cars with expired tags to be towed. Monday night, the sponsors of that earlier plan pitched another proposal, this time aimed at cracking down business owners that don't pay pay their property taxes. After a contentious debate, council opted to take a different route, referring the proposal to a committee to review, delaying a vote on implementing the plan.

The proposal was another piece of public safety legislation authored by Mayor Ken McClure, who is less than a month away from leaving the post he's held for the past eight years, and Councilman Craig Hosmer. The pair co-sponsored the ordinance, which would require applicants seeking occupational licenses to be up to date on their personal property taxes.

The amendments to the current ordinance would require that an applicant include paid receipts for "all personal property taxes due Greene County for property held in the name of the applicant for the previous calendar year." For those who might not owe taxes that year, a statement of non-assessment would have to be included.

City Attorney Jordan Paul said such a requirement has been found to be allowable under state and federal laws and that a similar requirement is already in place in St. Louis and Kansas City.

Greene County Assessor Brent Johnson addressed council and noted that while the city has issued roughly 11,000 business licenses, he has only received a little more than 4,000 business assessment lists from within city limits for the year. He said business assessment lists are similar to personal property assessment — owners list their assets, which for businesses include any equipment, furniture, vehicles, and any other tangible property that is used for the business.

If that list is never filled out and returned, taxes cannot be billed. Johnson also noted it is a matter of education — some business owners do not know that they are required to fill out assessments or what assets would have to be assessed.

Unlike the requirement of an individual property tax receipt for vehicle registration, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said the county has no effective mechanism to crack down on businesses that are not declaring the property they own nor paying their taxes. While collections from property taxes do not make up a large portion of the city's budget, these tax revenues do fund Springfield Public Schools, Springfield-Greene County Library District, and other tax entities.

Hosmer and McClure's proposed change would require those who want to renew or receive a new business license to show they have paid their business' property taxes. Hosmer said this would be a similar process to what the state already uses for vehicle registration, ensuring all business owners are held to the same standards. He highlighted SPS' need for the revenue, particularly as discussions of job cuts have surfaced more recently.

Councilman Abe McGull was the one to suggest referring the proposal to the Plans and Policies Committee prior to voting on it. He emphasized that he was not against the goal of the ordinance and ensuring everyone pays their fair share but rather wanted the details to be more fleshed out and allow time for public feedback.

"When you send things through committee, all those things are hashed out, everybody in the community is aware of it," he said. "But you're asking us, in two weeks, to pass this major piece of legislation that's going to affect a lot of people, the small businesses and stuff like that, and they may not even know about it. Not everybody watches the city council meetings."

The towing ordinance passed by council Feb. 24 in a 5-3 vote also had not gone through committees prior to being presented to council for a vote. Hosmer questioned why committee work was brought up for an ordinance specifically dealing with businesses and not for the general public.

"It's a privilege to do business in the city of Springfield, and we should make people pay their fair share, businesses and individuals both," Hosmer said. "So, I think it's imperative that we go ahead and do this, and I don't think it should be sent to committee, because the last time my bills got sent to committee, they never seem to come back."

Councilwoman Monica Horton and Councilman Brandon Jenson, both of whom voted against the towing ordinance, noted that the discussion was not about showing favoritism to businesses but ensuring all questions are answered prior to making legislative decisions. Horton noted there is no rush to put the issue to a vote.

"We might have had a unanimous vote on the towing amendment, if it had went to committee and we had fleshed out some of the issues that came before us to the public," she said. "I think that, you know, because we're having this type of tug of war here, I think that there is some value-add and some benefit to flesh this out a little bit better, instead of doing this sloppily."

Jenson said that when he was onboarded, he was told that there should be no ordinance that comes before council without going to committee prior. He recently referred Right to Counsel to committee. While there is nothing that requires ordinances to go before committee, City Code does state that it is council policy "to encourage the referral of council bills involving policy issues and substantive changes to the appropriate city council committee." Likewise, there is no legislation or strict rules about how long an ordinance, program or topic can remain in committee or what must come out of the process.

"I am surprised that the sponsors of this bill, who gave me that instruction, now have brought two ordinances forward that have a substantial impact on people in our community without following the process that I was told is critically important to good policy," he said.

Ultimately, the referral passed 7-2 with McClure and Hosmer opposed. Hosmer said he does not have another future ordinance planned regarding property tax enforcement. With upcoming April 8 election, the issue will be taken up by a new mayor and possibly new council members.

When the towing ordinance was passed last month, Springfield Police Department declared there would be an educational period before enforcement began. With that period over, SPD may begin towing vehicles with inadequate registration starting Wednesday, March 26. Police Chief Paul Williams had previously said initially officers will go after cars that are a year or more expired.

Both Johnson and Icet said they have noticed effects already since the ordinance passed. Johnson said the assessment office is seeing large lines, which are not typical for this time of year, particularly with individuals getting their assessments for the past several past years.

Icet said over the few weeks that the new towing ordinance has been in place but not yet enforced, the collector's office has seen roughly a 30% increase in the taxes collected from the same period last year, totaling roughly $230,000 more. He said this increase is more than what he would anticipate in a normal year and attributed the change to council's action.

The Big Four giants—EY PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG—have all launched legal arms to compete against the traditional legal sector, but recent cracks show that their vision is not playing out.

The Legal Services Act 2007 introduced Alternative Business Structure (ABS) licenses, which allowed the Big Four to compete in the UK legal market.

It wasn't the firms' first time in the market, having had legal practices since the 1990s, but the ABS saw the Big Four aggressively reshape their legal businesses.

PwC was the first Big Four to launch a dedicated legal services arm, PwC Legal, in 2014, followed shortly by EY and KPMG.

Deloitte completed the group with the launch of Deloitte Legal in 2018.

The push into the legal market was starting to look positive. In 2023, data by Saïd Business School revealed the Big Four generated $1.5bn (£1.25bn) in revenues from their legal segments.

The figures increased from $900m in 2015 to $1.2bn in 2017.

However, the cracks have started to show.

Last week, news broke that EY was making more cuts, this time for around 30 staff in its legal department, EY Law.

In a statement EY said: “These proposals would continue to strengthen EY's existing legal capabilities in corporate law, company secretarial, tax litigation and immigration but would, regrettably, result in a reduction of roles across other areas of the UK Law business.”

This isn't the first time EY has taken the shears to its legal arm. In December 2023, news broke it was shutting EY Riverview Law, the Manchester-based legal services business it acquired in 2018.

On top of that its headcount has fallen to around 160 after a series of high-profile departures, including nearly a dozen lawyers leaving for the City office of Hunton Andrews Kurth in December.

According to Scott Gibson, director of Edwards Gibson: “If we exclude Deloitte's ill-fated lock-stock and barrel acquisition of 27-partner TMT boutique Kemp Little in 2021, between 2019 and 2024, the Big Four's legal divisions combined hired 35 partners in London.”

“Against this, the quartet lost 40 serving partners (including two-thirds of the laterals who joined during that time) to rival law firms,” he added.

So, why are the Big Four not storming the legal market?

Christopher Clark, director at Definitum Search, says: “One challenge lies in the conflicts with the audit businesses, preventing a large number of legal instructions from getting off the ground.”

The Big Four's bread and butter is their accountancy departments, which are tightly regulated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

Plainly put, if the firm is auditing a business's financials, the rest of its business can't touch any work for that client.

Another issue is the structure of the Big Four firms. Nick Woolf, partner at Woolf&Co, highlighted that “however big their legal practice, they are always going to pale into insignificance compared to other parts of the firm.”

He noted the culture this creates explaining lawyers “who take pride in their own book of business, winning work themselves and seeing their own name in lights, are likely to be very disappointed by seeing none of these traits rewarded or even applauded in a Big Four firm.”

Woolf added that the Big Four had recruited the wrong partners for their needs.

Out of the Big Four, it seems KPMG is keeping its head above the water.

Gibson noted that the firm hired eight partners for KPMG Law UK in London versus just one for the rest of the Big Four.

“In 2024, whilst KPMG only managed to hire one partner in London, this was still 100 per cent more than the rest of the quartet combined,” he noted.

Speaking to City AM last July, the head of KPMG Law UK, Stuart Bedford, explained that the firm is not looking to challenge traditional Big Law on the likes of big corporate M&A deals. However, as he points out, there is a Venn diagram that overlaps with these firms and those deals.

“What we do is slightly different and tends to be the sorts of projects that actually those firms don't really focus on,” he added. 

This comes after KPMG revealed last month it launched KPMG Law US, the first law firm owned by a Big Four firm serving the US market.

A spokesperson for KPMG told City AM: “Whilst there is a lot of market uncertainty, we continue to grow and there are opportunities to help clients to not only remain compliant but optimise their businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory environment all while finding cost-effective ways of meeting their regulatory needs.”

An overview of the Big Four market, Gibson noted that firms “were able to sell themselves to lawyers with their ready made global networks, blue-chip client base, legendary organisational abilities, and gargantuan turnover.”

“In their numerous set-piece growth plans, the Big Four have themselves often conflated the volume of partner hiring from other law firms with success.”

He stated, “on that basis, with the possible exception of KPMG, the Big Four are failing.”

“If this was not already clear enough, unfortunately, EY's latest retreat from Big Law in the UK is likely to make it even harder for the rest of the quartet to attract and retain quality lawyers – let alone rainmaker partners,” Gibson added.

A spokesperson for Deloitte Legal told City AM: “Deloitte Legal's approach is blending legal expertise with our ability to deliver scale and leverage technology, alongside the broader range of Deloitte capabilities.”

“Our focus is on business solutions to the chief legal officer and becoming their business partner – a strategy that continues to resonate strongly with our clients and also with our people,” they added. 

This comes as the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

After two years of redundancies after redundancies, recent news showed the situation has escalated to the senior partnership. City AM has a long read on what is next for the Big Four.

Emanuel will become executive chairman of the newly-named WME Group, Mark Shapiro will lead it as president and managing director, while Whitesell exits to launch a new Silver Lake-backed venture.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


Endeavor is private once more, as the $25 billion deal by Silver Lake closed Monday morning.


	With the take-private complete, a slew of changes are in order. For starters, the newly-private businesses will go by WME Group, retiring the Endeavor name for public-facing purposes.




	Ari Emanuel, who founded Endeavor in 1995 and most recently served as CEO of the public venture, will shift to a new role as executive chairman.


	Mark Shapiro, who had been president and COO of Endeavor, will become president and managing partner, working in conjunction with Christian Muirhead and Richard Weitz, the WME co-chairs who will be co-chairmen of WME Group.

	And as widely expected, former Endeavor executive chairman Patrick Whitesell will exit to launch a new venture backed by Silver Lake that will “invest in and scale properties and IP across sports, media, and entertainment.” When the take-private was announced a year ago, it was noted that Whitesell's employment agreement included a provision for a new company backed by $250 million from Silver Lake.


	Emanuel will continue as chairman and CEO of TKO Group Holdings, the public company that owns UFC and WWE, and Shapiro will continue as president and COO of TKO.


	WME Group will include the WME agency, marketing firm 160over90, IMG licensing, and the unscripted studio Pantheon Media Group (formerly named Asylum Entertainment).


	“This remarkable moment— and the even more exciting future it launches—is thanks first and foremost to Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, and to the relentless and ambitious strategic vision they have shared for more than twenty years to build Endeavor into a global powerhouse across talent, brands, and IP spanning entertainment, media, and sports,” Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban said in a statement, adding that his firm has never sold a share in the company. “Silver Lake is proud and honored to be their partners since 2012 as they have continued to build the company. Over this period, revenue has grown by twentyfold. Silver Lake has previously invested on six separate occasions to support Endeavor and now, with this latest investment, it is the single largest position in our global portfolio.”


	“Mark Shapiro is an impressive, hard charging, creative, and determined leader who is driving and orchestrating massive value creation,” he added. “We look forward to continuing our work and partnership with him and the rest of the management team — including Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead at WME Group and Dana White, Andrew Schleimer, and the collective TKO leadership — all of whom are industry best.”

	











	“Our ability to deliver landmark partnerships, career-defining business opportunities, and enduring cultural moments is amplified by this transaction and the formation of WME Group,” Shapiro added. “The Silver Lake team has proven time and again that they are all-in on representation and content, and our clients, partners, and employees will thrive under our new structure.”


	“I am grateful to Egon and the team at Silver Lake for the trust they have placed in me as a founder and entrepreneur,” Emanuel added. “Together, we have created and enhanced a foundation unlike any other to accelerate value creation for clients and partners across WME Group and TKO, which I am excited to continue to build and grow.”


	“Everything we built at Endeavor would not have been possible without the partnership of Egon and the entire Silver Lake team,” Whitesell said. “Our industry is in the very early stages of generational transformation. I have never seen a more promising time for bold and ambitious entrepreneurs, creatives, and athletes.”


	“Silver Lake is enormously pleased and energized to partner and invest with Patrick in support of his new platform,” Durban added of the Whitesell venture.

Right out of high school, Kevin McAllister began working at the Webster Hall Deli in 1987. The owner, William R. Lee, taught McAllister “everything he [knows].”

“[He] taught me how to do cooking, and we used to make egg salad, tuna salad and all those things,” McAllister said. “Cooking is easy. You just gotta pay attention. That's all cooking is — paying attention to what you're making and just loving what you do.”

McAllister worked at the deli for 17 years before taking over. In 2004, he renamed it Kevin's Deli. A framed photo of McAllister and Lee still hangs on the wall of the deli today.

McAllister is now the owner and sole worker at Kevin's Deli. Students voted Kevin's Deli the best Black-owned business in The Pitt News' annual “Best Of” survey. Located inside Webster Hall, he serves classics like buffalo chicken salad and Reubens, as well as breakfast options. According to McAllister, his steak hoagie is “the best in the city.”

“No one's touching my steak hoagie,” McAllister said. “Everything I make is good. You're going to like everything, because it's not just a worker working here, it's the owner, and when it's the owner, he makes everything good because he don't want no bad remarks on them.”

McAllister has formed relationships with a number of customers. During a typical day, he sits and talks with an 89-year-old woman who comes in for coffee each day as they wait for the lunch rush. Another customer recently started running McAllister's Clash Royale for him in exchange for a free coffee maker.

“I don't want just a customer, I want friends,” McAllister said. “That's the way I look at business.”

On the deli counter, McAllister has a number of trinkets — a Pikachu figurine, Hot Wheels and a Rubik's cube.

“People do my Rubik's cube for me,” McAllister said. “Every time the one customer comes in, he does it in seconds. I'm like, ‘Wow. You know, customers are cool.'”

McAllister decorated the walls of the deli with tokens from customers — paintings of the Pittsburgh skyline from former residents of Webster Hall, a bulletin board filled with foreign currencies, and posters signed by Pitt sports teams. McAllister said he loves people, and that for him, interaction is “everything.” The deli is even where McAllister met his wife of 34 years.

Working in a college neighborhood, McAllister's customers are constantly coming and going. Every year, McAllister receives Christmas cards from one past regular and his family. They even bring him cookies sometimes. Another former customer and his family send letters yearly updating him on the family's doings. Both the Christmas cards and letters are taped up on the wall behind the deli counter. 

“Every four years, I get new customers because a lot of college kids work and live around here and go to school around here, so I meet them and become good friends with them, and then they're off to life, and I gotta find new ones,” McAllister said.

Jessica Stanislaw, a property manager with Webster Hall, has worked around the corner from Kevin's Deli for 11 years and enjoys the “fantastic breakfast sandwiches.”

“We have a great relationship,” Stanislaw said. “We are proud to have Kevin as part of our Webster Hall community. We make sure to include him in our leasing tours.”

Stanislaw believes Kevin's Deli was voted “Best Of” because McAllister's personality “can't be beat.”

“He is friendly to everyone and brings a nice vibe to Webster Hall and the surrounding community,” Stanislaw said.

Manny Basnet, a senior media and professional communications major, first heard about Kevin's Deli from a friend who frequented the place. His first impression of the deli was centered around McAllister's personality.

“He was really nice, and just made me feel really welcomed,” Basnet said. “And I thought that it was pretty odd for just someone making food to be that hospitable towards me, and it was a really pleasant experience.”
Now, Basnet goes semi-regularly, and his favorite menu item is the steak hoagie with fries. He said he thinks Kevin's Deli won “Best Of” because of McAllister's welcoming personality.

“When it comes to what separates food places, whether it's a restaurant or just a grab-and-go place, I think there's a lot of places that have really good food, but my favorite places are always ones that give me a good experience, not just good food.”

To McAllister, winning “Best Of” meant he was “not a prick or a-hole,” as he tries to do good things and be kind.

“I lead with kindness always,” McAllister said. “If you don't have enough money, you can eat here. I don't say that to everybody, but if someone comes in and says they only have $5, I'm not going to turn them away. Not going to do it every day, but I'm not going to turn them away the first day.”

            Spinning bright red handkerchiefs and dancing in step to folk music, more than a dozen human-like robots took to China's biggest stage in January, making a splashy debut at the annual Lunar New Year gala.
    


            The remarkable performance, watched by more than a billion people, is a high-profile reminder of how far Chinese humanoid robots have come. Over the past two months, videos of the country's humanoid robots pulling off moves such as bike rides, roundhouse kicks and side flips have blown up the internet, often amplified by state media as a key potential driver of economic growth.
    


            Even though very few of the humanoids are in mass production, competition with Elon Musk's Tesla, one of the acknowledged frontrunners in the field, is heating up. The promise of an “I, Robot” future, where machines handle household chores and serve as caregivers, has drawn nearly every major tech company in both the United States and China to bet on humanoids or robotics.
    


            Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have invested in American humanoid maker Figure AI. Meanwhile, Meta is planning major investments in humanoids, according to a Bloomberg report last month.
    


            Musk, whose Optimus humanoid has sparked global interest since its debut in 2022, predicted last month that the project alone could generate more than $10 trillion in revenue.
    


            While it may take another five to 10 years for humanoid robots to make a real societal impact, they could eventually become the next widely adopted consumer electronics, according to Xi Ning, chair professor of robotics and automation at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            “Everybody will need them, like automobiles, like cellphones, and the potential market volume will be huge,” he told CNN.
    


Goldman Sachs projected last year that the global humanoid robot market will be worth $38 billion by 2035. In five years, they estimate that 250,000 humanoid units, mainly for industrial use, will be shipped, while consumers will be buying about one million units a year in about a decade.
    


            Beijing, which is looking to replicate China's success in the electric vehicle (EV) market, wants to be at the forefront of that growth.
    


            It's eager to position the country as a global tech powerhouse and build on the momentum of recent Chinese achievements in the field - such as AI startup DeepSeek's reasoning model that stunned the world in January - especially as the US tightens tech restrictions on Beijing.
    


            Despite entering the race later than American rivals including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Figure AI, experts say Chinese firms are rapidly closing the gap. With their preternatural ability to optimize supply chains and cut costs, Chinese firms are also accelerating the mass production of humanoids.
    


            China already dominates the space for industrial robots, deploying more of them every year since 2021 than all other countries combined, according to the International Federation of Robotics, a Germany-based non-governmental organization.
    


            Compared to humanoids, industrial robots typically feature less advanced technology and perform less sophisticated tasks. They're widely used in industrial settings for manufacturing or transportation.
    


            As with EVs, Tesla was one of the few big-name frontrunners for humanoids when Musk introduced the project in 2021 and showcased an Optimus prototype a year later. Since then, Beijing has publicly thrown its weight behind the humanoid robotics industry with increasing funding drives and government support.
    


            In a 2023 policy document, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology identified the humanoid robotics industry as a “new frontier in technological competition,” setting a 2025 target for mass production and secure supply chains for core components.
    


            “China started relatively late, but it has its own advantages like a huge market and a relatively complete supply chain for the technology, which enables them to easily develop similar kind of robots at lower price,” said Xi at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            Over the past three years, various local governments – including major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen – have announced plans to establish or have launched investment funds dedicated to developing robotics, totaling at least 73 billion yuan ($10 billion), according to a tally by CNN.
    


            Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping chaired a high-profile meeting with the country's top business executives. Among those seated in the front row was Wang Xingxing, CEO of Unitree, the company behind the viral dancing robots, an indication of Beijing's growing focus on this emerging sector.
    


            Aside from Unitree, other major domestic players include Shenzhen-based UBTech, Chinese EV giant BYD-backed Agibot, Beijing-based Robotera and Shanghai-headquartered Fourier Intelligence, as well as EV maker XPeng.
    


            Experts say China still trails the West in certain key technologies, even as it dominates the supply chain.  About 56% of the humanoid robot supply chain companies are based in China, according to a Morgan Stanley research report last month.

            But China still needs to achieve a breakthrough in “core technologies,” such as processor chips, high-precision sensor and robot operating systems, to reduce its reliance on foreign technology, said Zhang Dan, chair professor of intelligent robotics and automation at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
    


            Artificial intelligence chips underpin humanoids' operating systems, guiding their thinking, perception and motion. Many humanoid developers depend on AI chip giant Nvidia's products. At its annual developer conference last week, the company unveiled a new AI foundation model for humanoid robots.
    


            Citing national security concerns, the former Biden administration steadily tightened export restrictions on advanced chips that could power China's military. Beijing has sought to develop its domestic chip supply chain as part of its self-sufficiency drive.
    


            Additionally, European, American and Japanese companies continue to dominate higher-end components such as sensors, as well as motors and screws that power robotic motions with higher precision and stability, according to a Morgan Stanley report last month.
    


            To overcome those shortcomings, Chinese suppliers are actively trying to do business with Tesla. Many of them have sent component samples for Tesla's review, according to P.K. Tseng, a senior research manager at TrendForce, a market analysis firm.
    


            “After Chinese supply chain manufacturers supply components to Tesla, they refine them based on testing feedback and then offer the improved versions to domestic manufacturers,” he said.
    


            Over time, this creates a cycle of continuous technological advancements, enhancing the quality of the whole domestic humanoid robotics industry, he explained.
    


            While technological gaps remain, China has emerged as a price disrupter in the nascent industry.
    


            Shenzhen-based Engine AI released its PM01 model late last year for just 88,000 yuan ($12,175), while Unitree's G1, capable of executing a roundhouse kick, followed at 99,000 yuan ($13,697).

            At an event last year, Musk estimated Tesla's Optimus to be priced between $20,000 to $30,000. Lowering prices for humanoids would mark a major step to their eventual commercialization and wider adoption.
    


            Beyond startups, established EV players like BYD and XPeng have also ventured into the humanoids space. Experts said years of cutthroat competition and a price war in China have honed their ability to scale production rapidly while driving cost down.
    


            Since the manufacturing complexity of humanoid robots shares similarities to those of electric vehicles, particularly in components like sensors and batteries, EV makers have an advantage in this space, according to Brady Helwig, associate director for economy at Special Competitive Studies Project, a US thinktank.
    


            Late last year, XPeng unveiled its humanoid robot, Iron, with plans for mass production by the end of 2025. Around the same time, BYD launched a recruitment drive to develop its own version, having invested in other domestic humanoids makers.
    


            As the country's demographic crisis worsens, the Chinese leadership sees humanoid robots as a potential solution to offset the shrinking working force, Helwig said. China's population has shrunk for three consecutive years.
    


            “If humanoid robots were able to be scaled and deployed widely across the economy, this is the kind of wild card that could really help alleviate that gap,” he said.
