Rugby world champions South Africa will unveil First National Bank (FNB) as its new front-of-shirt sponsor after ditching MTN, City AM understands.

Rugby world champions South Africa will unveil First National Bank (FNB) as its new front-of-shirt sponsor after ditching MTN, City AM understands.

The Springboks announced on Tuesday that an eight-year partnership between the team and the mobile telecommunications provider had concluded following a spell that saw the senior men’s team win back-to-back Rugby World Cups in Tokyo and Paris.

FNB is currently on the back of the iconic green and gold jerseys but will move into prime position ahead of South Africa’s next men’s international.

South African Rugby has recently announced major partnerships with Coca-Cola – who could be re-partnering with the Premier League from next season – and Rhino Rugby, the equipment provider.

South Africa are one of world rugby’s global brands, with their four franchise clubs playing in the European-based United Rugby Championship.

There have been calls for the side to enter the Guinness Six Nations, while they’re set to explore selling off a stake of their commercial arm to US private equity to continue to invest in their domestic and international rugby offering.

The Springboks were approached for comment.

Springboks make replacement

First National Bank is the oldest bank in South Africa, with its roots dating back to 1838. It was part of Barclays Bank until 1986.

Speaking at the conclusion of their deal with MTN, SA Rugby president Mark Alexander said: “I’d like to thank MTN most sincerely for their support over the past eight years.

“If you remember, we put out a call to corporate South Africa to partner with us at a challenging time for rugby in this country, and MTN answered that call, loud and clearly. Together, we have enjoyed what will, in time, I’m sure, be regarded as a golden age for the sport in this country.

“The Springboks have twice visited MTN’s offices as newly crowned world champions, marking the pinnacle moments in our partnership. MTN has supported us every step of the way—not only in our efforts to win rugby matches and bring joy to the country but also in showcasing the power of South Africa’s diversity when we stand united.

“MTN’s faith was truly inspiring when they first came on board during those dark days. Of course, rugby would grind to a halt without the unwavering support of our partners. MTN led the way in this regard, and we wish them every success in the future.”",cityam

We appear to be falling out of love with sports cars. Registrations are down across Europe, with some models seeing a major slump in sales. Blame the popularity of SUVs or soaring household bills, but it isn’t down to a lack of choice.

Indeed, our list of the best sports cars shows a segment in rude health, with buyers able to choose from a range of hardcore and soft-focus options.

Here are the best sports cars to buy in 2025, with our choices presented in alphabetical order.

Alpine A110

The Alpine A110 proves you don’t need the default Porsche 718 Boxster or Cayman to experience the joys of a relatively affordable, daily-driver sports car. This pretty French coupe was designed to deliver one thing: unadulterated fun. Prices start from a whisker under £55,000.



All versions are powered by a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine, which in R flavour (pictured) produces 300hp. While this is the same as the A110 S, the R is 34kg lighter and rides 10mm lower on manually adjustable coilovers, with stiffer anti-roll bars and Michelin Cup 2 tyres.



We said: ‘The R will appeal to collectors and those who want the ultimate A110 regardless of cost (you can imagine Alpine F1 drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon each having one as their company car). Ultimately, though, this version serves to underline the unadorned brilliance of the standard A110.’

Caterham Seven 360R

Caterham has been playing the role of wasp at the supercar picnic since 1973. That’s when the company acquired the rights to build and develop the Lotus Seven, one of Britain’s most driver-focused sports cars. Today, prices range from £29,500 to £80,000, or you can have the chassis, boxed components, engine and gearbox delivered to your garage, along with an assembly guide.



The Seven 360R (pictured) uses a 2.0-litre Ford Duratec engine and will hit 60mph in just 4.8 seconds. To go even faster, check out the Seven 620, which adds a supercharger to the Ford engine for a 0-60mph time of 2.79 seconds and a top speed of 149mph.



We said: ‘It’s totally impractical, and downright masochistic on longer journeys, but a Caterham Seven offers a raw and visceral driving experience like little else. Once you find an ideal road, in the perfect weather and surroundings, the sensations are addictive and will leave you wanting more.’

Ford Mustang

The Ford Mustang is a hugely successful sports car. It’s an automotive icon, and as American as baseball or mom’s apple pie. You can now buy an electric Mustang – the Mach-E SUV – but we’re talking about the old-school V8 here. Available as a GT coupe, GT convertible or Dark Horse edition, it costs from £56,000.

Even in entry-level guise, the 446hp Mustang will hit 62mph in just 5.3 seconds, but if you choose the 453hp Dark Horse edition, the sprint time drops to 5.2 seconds in the six-speed manual version – or an impressive 4.4 seconds if the 10-speed automatic is your thing.



Driving the Mustang Mach 1 (pictured), we said: ‘If you want to go sideways, you can, but the Mach 1 is too polished to play the all-out hooligan. That doesn’t mean it has morphed into a flighty sports car, though. It remains quite a physical experience, with a heavy six-speed manual shift and a sense of weight shifting that betrays its 1,851kg heft.’

Lotus Emira

A list of the best sports cars must include a Lotus, even if Norfolk’s finest is now mostly building SUVs and EVs. With a starting price of £89,500, the Emira feels a long way from the Elise, but this is every inch a Lotus for the modern era. Indeed, thanks to a top speed of 182mph, the entry-level Emira is the world’s fastest four-cylinder car.



It shares its engine with the Mercedes-AMG A45 S and we reckon it’s a better sports car than the V6 version. That said, thanks to the 406hp Toyota V6 engine, the flagship Emira (pictured) can hit 62mph in just 4.3 seconds, before maxing out at 180mph.



We said: ‘In the long Lotus tradition, the Emira remains a ‘chassis’ car, with the engine as a supporting act. The Toyota V6 is certainly effective, but its gruff, rather workmanlike voice isn’t as exotic as a howling Porsche flat-six. I’m not wholly convinced by the notchy and slightly ponderous manual gearshift either. Nonetheless, this is the most complete Lotus ever, and a reassuring reminder that, even with the electric revolution already underway, Hethel hasn’t forgotten its past.’

Mazda MX-5

Why spend £60,000 on a sports car when half that amount could get you behind the wheel of the world’s favourite roadster? Over four generations and 35 years, the Mazda MX-5 has cemented a reputation for being the benchmark affordable sports car.

For a while, the brilliant 132hp 1.5-litre Skyactiv-G was our engine of choice in the MX-5. With just enough power to entertain, a sublime six-speed gearbox and superb rear-wheel-drive handling, it was the perfect MX-5. Perfect, that is, until Mazda tweaked the 2.0-litre engine. Now with 184hp, it injects the MX-5 with added excitement. It’s genuinely thrilling.



We said: ‘It is delicate, adjustable and floods you with feel and feedback. Compared to a hot hatch, it almost feels over-soft, as the body rolls in corners and the suspension is supple over bumps. This, however, is because it’s so light, meaning Mazda hasn’t had to battle with managing excess weight.

‘Best driven with fingertips, it’s nimble and flows beautifully, feeling exactly like the 1960s throwback Mazda intended since day one.’

Morgan Plus Four

First launched in 2020, the Morgan Plus Four boasts a bonded aluminium platform, double wishbone suspension and a twin-turbocharged BMW engine. Updates for 2024 included LED headlights with integrated indicators, new puddle lights, a redesigned rear diffuser and an optional Dynamic Handling Pack.



At £1,995, the latter is an essential upgrade, giving the Plus Four a newfound sense of poise and accuracy. Developed with suspension specialist Nitron, it consists of stiffer springs, adjustable dampers and a rear anti-roll bar. It’s the best upgrade you can make to a Morgan.



We said: ‘The Morgan Plus Four is a trad British sports car with modern manners – if you opt for the new Dynamic Handling Pack. Most people will buy a Boxster instead, but a Morgan isn’t for most people. It’s a car that keen drivers can enjoy without qualms, blending exciting performance with lucid steering, deft damping and real exuberance when its limits are tested. Appearances, it seems, can be deceptive.’

Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman

When the Porsche 718 is this good, you have to wonder whether it’s worth spending nearly £100,000 on a Porsche 911. Granted, it’s not quite as simple as that, but in the context of the rest of the Porsche range, the 718 Boxster and Cayman seem good value for money.

The GTS 4.0 versions are our pick of the range. A return to the flat-six engine might sound like a U-turn following the company’s switch to four-cylinder power, but it was music to the ears of Porsche purists. Alternatively, if your budget stretches that far, the flagship Cayman GT4 RS blurs the boundaries between sports car and supercar. It’s outrageously exciting – and a guaranteed future classic.



Driving the Cayman GT4 RS, we said: ‘The air intakes that replace the rear side windows are located just behind your ears, and the effect is like hugging the speakers at a Motorhead gig. As the revs soar, the voracious gasp of induction is overwhelmed by the bandsaw blare of six wide-open throttle bodies. The piercing top notes are pure racing car.’

Porsche 911

To many people, the Porsche 911 is the definitive sports car, bridging the gap between affordable two-seaters and six-figure supercars. Sure, prices start from around £100,000, but the beauty of the 911 is that you don’t have to progress far beyond the ‘entry-level’ model for the pure Porsche experience.



Indeed, we think the 911 Carrera, updated for 2025, is all the 911 you could ever need. Granted, a total of 394hp from a 3.0-litre twin-turbo flat-six looks a bit ‘meh’ in a world of 400hp+ hot hatches and 1,000hp EVs, but they don’t offer the poise and purity of a 911. The new 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid is good, but the ‘basic’ Carerra gets our vote.



We said: ‘If you have £100,000 to splash on something sporty, it remains the default choice. Does ‘default’ also mean ‘dull’? Absolutely not. I’ve been lucky enough to test many exotic 911s, from classic RS models to a tuned Turbo. I always enjoyed the experience, but after a few hours I usually felt ready to return the keys. That isn’t the case here. Indeed, I could have happily carried on driving the Carrera, taken it home and lived out my days with it. The only sports car you need? Yes, something like that.’

Radical SR10 XXR

Meet the Radical SR10 XXR, a purpose-built race car with Bugatti-baiting performance and no electronic driver aids. It’s not the kind of car you’d climb into for a commute to the office, unless your office happens to be a racetrack.



Power is sourced from a 2.3-litre four-cylinder engine from the Ford Focus ST, which, thanks to a custom Garrett turbocharger, forged pistons, a high-flow exhaust and a Life Racing ECU, produces 425hp. That’s in a car weighing just 725kg. No surprise, then, that it’ll hit 62mph in just 2.4 seconds.



We said: ‘Forget track-focused road cars: this is the real deal. The Radical SR10 XXR will teach you to be a better driver, and make you grin in the process. Its real USP, though, is the Radical Cup race series: a relatively affordable route into national-level motorsport.’



Read our Radical SR10 XXR review

Toyota GR86

The Toyota GR86 is the successor to the much-loved GT86, with a 234hp 2.4-litre ‘boxer’ engine and a similar surfeit of power over grip. It’s a pure sports car of the sort that will soon be extinct, serving up constant feedback and fun. Sadly, buyers are all too aware of time running out, and the entire UK allocation for the GR86 has already been sold. If you want one now, you’ll have to buy used – and probably pay a hefty premium over the £30,000 list price.

Aside from its propensity to oversteer, the GR86 offers a practical hatchback boot, two child-sized rear seats and typical Toyota build quality. Yes, the interior is a bit plasticky and fuel economy could be better. But trust us, you really won’t care. This car makes even a mundane journey feel special.



We said: ‘The added torque transforms how the GR86 drives, answering the main criticism of its predecessor. Its growly flat-four no longer relies solely on high revs, pulling strongly through the mid-range to its 7,400rpm limiter. The control weights feel carefully calibrated, too, with endlessly chatty steering, perfectly spaced pedals, a snappier manual gearbox (an automatic is optional – don’t even think about it) and a proper handbrake.’

Annual retail sales volumes fell markedly in March and are expected to continue declining (Photographer: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

Retail sales dropped in March and are expected to fall further as low confidence worsens a decade-long decline in retail.

Sales volumes in the UK dropped “markedly” in the year to March, according to the CBI’s latest trading survey.

It was the sharpest drop since last July and marks the sixth consecutive months of decline, as well as the fifth consecutive month of double-digit drops.

“Firms across the retail and wholesale sectors reported that global trade tensions and the Autumn Budget are weighing on consumer and business confidence, which is leading to reduced demand,” principal economist at the CBI, Martin Sartorius, said.

The weak results are bad news for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who will unveil the Government’s Spring Statement tomorrow, March 26.

“Tomorrow’s Spring Statement is likely to focus on the persistent challenges facing the UK economy, reinforcing the need for policies that boost businesses’ confidence to invest.

“Reforming business rates, supporting the British Business Bank’s Growth Guarantee Scheme, and properly resourcing the Growth and Skills Levy could support businesses’ investment plans and drive the government’s growth ambitions,” Sartorius added.

The CBI’s findings support a survey from KPMG, which found Brits are planning to cut back spending on everyday items.

The survey of 3,000 consumers also showed that a growing number of people said they felt financially insecure.

AJ Bell analysts have highlighted the twelve-month low for FTSE350 retailers, which have been “bogged down by worries over whether weak consumer confidence and dodgy weather will hit the top line and that increased costs from national insurance contributions, wages, utilities and raw materials could further dent the bottom line.”

The latest challenges for retail are compounding a problem that began with the financial crisis in 2008, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR).

The CRR expects 200,000 retail jobs to disappear next year, along with over 17,000 stores.",cityam

Small businesses are battling rising employment costs ahead of the Spring Statement.

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) have taken steps to combat the Chancellor’s tax hikes as they brace for further changes in Reeves’ Spring Statement.

Fresh research from Grant Thornton showed 71 per cent of SMEs have formed plans to offload rising employment costs onto consumers – a 15 per cent increase from December.

Almost seven in ten businesses said they planned to reduce or freeze hiring in the next six months as they battled costs.

SMEs have suffered mounting pressure since the Autumn Budget, with the government’s flurry of tax increases and employment reforms hitting business confidence.

Rachel Reeves announced in the Budget that employers’ national insurance contributions would rise by 1.2 per cent, and upped the national minimum wage across all age rates.

Labour’s Employment Bill has created a headache for SMEs, with the radical overhaul of worker’s rights sparking fears for employers that they will be more easily subjected to lawsuits.

However, as SMEs prepare to battle the fallout of the budget, optimism in the mid-market has experienced an uptick, with 85 per cent of firms optimistic about their revenue growth over the next six months.

Giles Mullins, head of core advisory at Grant Thornton UK, said: “How long this confidence will last though remains to be seen.

“As we head towards the Spring Statement, the majority of mid-sized businesses are also expecting the Chancellor to increase taxes on businesses again this year.”

This marks a stark difference from larger firms, who had a ten point decrease in their optimism on the UK economy.

Mullins said larger businesses’ exposure to the “increasingly turbulent international geopolitical environment” is likely weighing upon their future outlook.

“After years of high inflation, interest rate increases and economic and political turmoil, businesses of all sizes are used to adapting to changing cost environments, putting plans in place to protect their operations and reduce the impact to their bottom line and profit growth.

“But mid-sized businesses may be able to adapt more quickly to the shifting economic realities and more easily make changes to mitigate the impact of these employment costs on their operations than larger businesses, who may be faced with a larger wage bill,” he added.",cityam

John O’Brien founded Anthropy – an annual gathering of corporate and political luminaries dubbed ‘Britain’s Davos’ – to help the UK ‘build back better’ from the pandemic. On the eve of its third instalment in the Eden Project’s greenery, Ali Lyon asks the ex-army captain, “Has it failed?”

It is October 2022, and a group of Britain’s leading corporate and political minds have decided to decamp from the attention-span-sapping capital and make their way west to the Cornish town of St Austell.

With much of the world still reeling from the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic, Cornwall’s inbound guests were an incongruous group, spanning pugnacious captains of industry, white-trainer-clad media execs, and caffeine infused party politicians.

The destination for the group, whose number included Cobra founder Baron Bilimoria, Iceland Foods’ Richard Walker, ex-editorial director of the BBC Kamal Ahmed and then-Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, was ‘Anthropy’, a new corporate summit being held in the biomes of the Eden Project.

And their mission was simple: help the UK ‘build back better’ from the epoch-shattering pandemic that had defined the previous two years.

In hindsight, even the most charitable of observers would struggle to say the attendees succeeded. Since Anthropy’s inaugural gathering we’ve seen the outbreak of two separate hot wars, double-digit inflation, and next to no economic growth.

But this week, over 2,000 high-flying execs will return to the south coast for the gathering’s third instalment. And while they may not have single-handedly delivered Britain an improved post-COVID settlement, the event itself has gone from strength to strength.

Every year since 2022, an ever-larger number of delegates have reconvened in Anthropy’s idyllic, biophillic setting. They have covered subjects as highfalutin as ‘Exploring Human-Centred Leadership’, ‘Building equity in Society: Positive Pathways’ or the regular ‘State of our Nation’ panel. The summit-cum-festival has even come to be branded the UK’s answer to Davos.

Anthropy in a changed world

This year, guests will be treated to talks and panels across 18 stages from the likes of Baronness Lane Fox, Rupert Soames, and London Stock Exchange chief Dame Julia Hoggett. All with the aim, founder John O’Brien tells City AM, of encouraging leaders from different sectors and professions, “to have conversations they don’t normally have”.

But with Trump’s intoxicating brand of populism ascendant in the White House, and the ‘international rules-based order’ hanging by a thread, the mood among its largely progressive, ‘small L-liberal’ crowd is likely to be markedly more sober than its idealistic 2022 origins.

“We grew out of the COVID pandemic,” says O’Brien, who as well as his storied career in the army was also an executive at the advertising holding company Omnicom. “But when you think back to [that time],” he adds, “you could almost look back there and think it was easier then than it is now in terms of the uncertainty around tariffs, trade wars et cetera.”

It’s a change that is reflected in the agenda. Where economic sessions once covered fanciful themes like ‘Selling Degrowth’, they are now on coarser, more calcified topics like ‘How industrial strategies can help London’s economy’, and whether gentle density can fix the UK’s housing crisis.

The politically-oriented subject matter has metamorphosed, too. This year, O’Brien and his guest speakers will ask how we fix a fractured Britain after the 2024 riots. A stark contrast from previous gatherings, which looked at how ‘climate politics obstructed climate action’ and then hosted a sustainable fashion show at which models held aloft signs saying ‘smash the silo’ and ‘green is the new black’.

Purpose-less event

But nowhere is the passage of the last two years – a period which saw an end to over a decade of cheap money and an even longer peace dividend – more evident than in the discussions on corporate affairs.

Anthropy was the product of an age when the ‘purpose‘ and ‘stakeholder capitalism‘ movements were at their zenith. When the prevailing wisdom dictated that – unless a company burnished its environmental and social credentials in every advertising campaign or annual report – it would lose custom from consumers and cash from investors.

In the early gatherings, visitors could hardly move for events discussing how businesses could take advantage of this new corporate order. And in 2023, even Severn Trent Water – a company that little more than a year on would find itself fined £2m by the Environment Agency for ‘reckless’ pollution – sponsored a panel titled, ‘The sceptical Business leader’s guide to getting nature positive’.

But delegates at this year’s gathering would be hard pressed to root out even one session informing them how to embrace ‘purpose’, which have given way to talks like the more hard-headed – and fully-booked – talk on the influence of non-executives.

And that shift comes despite the fact that O’Brien is, himself, one of the doyennes of purposeful business. He has written no fewer than three books on the merits and nature of purpose, one of which was number three at WH Smith, and a Forbes top 15 leaders read.

But is its absence from proceedings at Anthropy a tacit acknowledgement from O’Brien that the movement was a fad?

“If you’re looking at a business that has an understanding… of the wider impact it has on society… that should just be good business in every definition,” he says. “But labels like CSR, purpose have now got in the way of that.”

O’Brien has little truck with firms that sought to shoehorn purpose into individual products in search of quick buck. He sympathises with star stockpicker Terry Smith, who let off an excoriating attack on Unilever when it declared the raison d’etre of Helmann’s mayonnaise to be ‘fighting food waste’. Smith famously said that Unilever – then run by Alan Jope – had “lost the plot”. O’Brien prefers to brand it “nonsense”.

But Anthropy’s host is adamant that even if the purpose is less prominent in brands’ adverts, or at this year’s Anthropy, firms should still have a reason to exist beyond their fiduciary duty to shareholders.

“The vast majority of people leading serious, significant businesses know that if they’re going to create good, serious shareholder value, they’ve got to be alert to the wider way in which their business operates – that’s all this is about,” he says.

‘Purpose’ was also conspicuous by its absence at this year’s instalment of Davos, which Anthropy has started to be compared. The annual c-suite pilgrimage to the Swiss Alpine town took place just days after Trump’s inauguration. And his promise to ‘drill baby drill’, and go after firms’ proactive diversity policies in the courts set the tenor for much of the 2025 gathering.

As an event with a reputation as an elitist talking shop, it divides opinion. But O’Brien, who was encouraged to establish Anthropy by World Economic Forum boss Klaus Schwabb, believes the comparisons between his event and Davos are mostly helpful.

“I think there’s some negativity around being described as a Davos,” he says. “It doesn’t suit everybody, and it can be seen as elitist… but for many others it conjures up a certain idea of what the event is.”

But Swiss homage to capitalism isn’t the only gathering to which Anthropy has been compared. An equal number – O’Brien says – have called it a “Glastonbury for good”, while others have said it is redolent of “a national TED talk”.

And what Anthropy lacks in the private jets of Davos or the Class A drugs of Glastonbury, it makes up for in the remarkably cult following it has accrued in just a few years.

For many flocking down to Cornwall this week, this will be their third gathering. And just as Taylor Swift-loving Glastonbury goers might refer to themselves as ‘Swifties’, some die hard fans have even taken to adding ‘Anthropist’ to their Linkedin job title; though O’Brien concedes there “are not quite as many Anthropists as there are Swifties”.

And who can blame them? Three days listening to talks from the likes of Sir Trevor Phillips and Angela Rippon surrounded by the sun-draped flora of the Eden Project is an alluring sell. Whether or not they can single-handedly help the UK build back better from COVID, or solve some of Britain’s most intractable issues while they’re there, is another question entirely.",cityam
https://cityam.com,UK consumer confidence is plummeting warns KPMG,https://www.cityam.com/uk-consumer-confidence-is-plummeting-warns-kpmg/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:50:30 GMT","UK consumer confidence is tanking warns KPMG

The Chancellor was urged to lift consumer confidence after a new survey showed people’s poor expectations about the economy.

Three in five Brits believe the UK economy is worsening, a new survey by KPMG has shown, as Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ Spring Statement risks failing to lift people’s spirits.

Reeves is set to announce policies aimed at economic business confidence at her Spring Statement on Wednesday but a new survey suggests consumers are increasingly downbeat about the economy.

Just under half of respondents told One Poll, which was commissioned by KPMG, that they are planning to cut back spending on everyday items, as some 36 per cent of people said they are saving more as a contingency.

The survey of 3,000 consumers also showed that a growing number of people said they felt financially insecure.

One in 50 people said they are now incurring debt to pay their bills.

The latest data showing a slump in consumer confidence sends a final warning to the Chancellor ahead of her Spring Statement.

The Chancellor is not expected to provide relief to consumers, or make changes to taxes.

Meanwhile, her tax hikes, announced in the Autumn Budget, are set to bite businesses in April.

Those taxes include increases to national insurance contributions (NICs) and changes to inheritance tax bands.

It means more people will have to pay taxes on assets from next month as the government seeks to take in an extra £40bn in tax receipts.

Businesses are also likely to pass on costs to consumers, according to various surveys, with the Bank of England predicting inflation to hit a peak of 3.75 per cent this year.

Consumers are already responding to high inflation of around three per cent in January as Brits have eaten out less and bought fewer clothes, according to the survey.

Linda Ellet, KPMG’s head of consumer and detail, said the research shows that most people think the economy is “heading in the wrong direction”.

“This nervousness about the economy is leading many, including some of those who are secure in their current personal financial circumstances, to cut everyday spend, defer big ticket buying, and save more.

“Cautious consumers are certainly preparing for the potential impact on them from what they believe to be a worsening economy.

Ellet also said the Chancellor should try to rectify consumer confidence.

“This week’s Spring Statement needs to give people confidence in the longer-term UK economic outlook,” she added.",cityam
https://cityam.com,Labour’s National Wealth Fund slammed for ‘completely misleading’ rebrand,https://www.cityam.com/labours-national-wealth-fund-slammed-for-completely-misleading-rebrand/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","Labour’s National Wealth Fund slammed for ‘completely misleading’ rebrand

The Chancellor’s National Wealth Fund is facing criticism for ‘misleading’ the public.

The government has been accused of “gaslighting the British public” over its National Wealth Fund as the Treasury committee announced on Monday it had launched an inquiry into the new body.

Originally a fixture of Labour’s 2024 manifesto – the National Wealth Fund was to consolidate the British Business Bank and the UK Infrastructure Bank, which launched under Rishi Sunak’s Chancellorship in 2021.

However in October, Rachel Reeves announced the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) would “become” the National Wealth Fund (NWF).

Shadow Financial Secretary Gareth Davies told City AM the transformation was “completely misleading” and “didn’t need to happen”.

Davies, who worked closely with the UKIB during his tenure as Exchequer Secretary at the Treasury, supported the initial proposal of one consolidated institution, but has since criticised the Treasury for changing course.

He blasted: “The UKIB didn’t need a rebrand just to satisfy the need for Labour to say they’ve done something.”

The UK Infrastructure Bank’s executive summary in 2022 outlined its five key sectors of investment as clean energy, transport, digital, water and waste.

In the Chancellor’s strategic steer published on March 19, the priority sectors for the National Wealth fund were listed as clean energy, digital and technologies, advanced manufacturing and transport.

Additionally, the third and fourth principle of each institution focused on “positive financial returns” and “crowding in significant private capital”.

Davies said: “We’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not a National Wealth Fund or a sovereign wealth fund, it is a bank – a UK Infrastructure Bank.”

‘It is a complete and utter waste’

Figures obtained under a Freedom of Information Request by City AM reveal the rebrand of the UKIB cost £87,212.

The National Wealth Fund said £5,500 of the costs came from ‘re-branding’ which included the design of a new logo, updating brand guidelines to reflect the logo and the creation of a new digital suite.

The changes to IT infrastructure, including changing domain names, contributed to a lump of the fees, totalling £68,000.

The location of the National Wealth Fund’s headquarters remains in Leeds in the same space originally used by the UKIB, with £1,632 listed for new signage.

Labour pledged an additional £5.8bn to the £22bn inherited from the UKIB, which Davies questioned amidst the backdrop of the ‘£22bn blackhole’.

Treasury Committee: Can NWF ‘drive meaningful growth?’

This fresh row comes as the Treasury Committee announced on Monday that it had launched an inquiry into the National Wealth Fund.

The committee said it aimed “to understand whether it has the tools and backing to drive meaningful growth in the UK economy.”

Dame Meg Hillier, Chair of the Committee, said: “A sovereign wealth fund which can encourage private investors to back projects and funnel capital into emerging sectors is a logical way of trying to move the dial on economic growth.

“However, if the National Wealth Fund veers off course by choosing the wrong sectors for investment, making operational errors or misjudging the appetite of the private sector, it can also end up being an extremely poor use of taxpayer money at a time when the public purse is incredibly stretched.

“We must get this right and our committee will be pressing the government to make sure they are on firm footing.”

The terms of reference the committee will be observing include the distinctions between the National Wealth Fund and the UKIB and what lessons the new institution can learn from its predecessor.

A spokesperson for the Treasury told City AM they “rejected” the characterisation of the National Wealth Fund as “misleading”.

“The National Wealth Fund is the UK’s new flagship public investor that is unlocking over £70bn in private investment to kickstart economic growth across the country.

“Building on the strengths of the UK Infrastructure Bank, it more flexibly deploys its support beyond infrastructure projects, investing in sectors of national importance like clean energy and defence, and takes on more risk to boost projects with an undersupply of private finance.”

The Treasury cited key differences between the two institutions as the National Wealth Fund’s higher risk appetite, after increasing economic capital limit from £4.5bn to £7bn and its investment beyond infrastructure into areas of “national importance”.

It added secondary legislation had been brought forward to introduce performance guarantees, which would include protection against risks like performance of construction companies on infrastructure.

A spokesperson for the National Wealth Fund told City AM: “We welcome the Chancellor’s recent strategic steer which clearly sets out the changes that have been made to our organisation.

“This includes the scope to move beyond infrastructure to support the industrial strategy, and increasing our capacity for risk, all while crowding in private capital to drive growth and the clean energy transition.”",cityam

Shell has vowed to reward its shareholders even further after the FTSE 100 giant handed almost £19bn to its investors in 2024 while also revealing plans to cut spending and reduce costs

Ahead of its capital market day event today, the oil giant told investors it also plans to ramp up cost savings and cut spending as it promised to “deliver more value with less emissions”.

That comes despite having last year controversially dropping a plan to reduce net carbon intensity by 45 per cent by 2035.

Shell said it would now look to strip out a cumulative £3.9bn to £5.4bn a year by the end of 2028.

This is up from the previous aim for £1.5bn to £2.3bn by the end of 2025.

It will also lower its spending to £15.5bn to £17bn a year over the next three years.

The FTSE 100 firm told shareholders it would look to boost investor returns through share buybacks and dividends payouts.

Other targets outlined included aims to grow its top-line production across the group’s upstream and integrated gas business by one per cent a year over the next five years.

It added it would seek to grow sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by four per cent to five per cent a year through to 2030.

It cautioned over plans to shut some chemicals operations across Europe, saying it wants to “unlock more value from our strong portfolio of chemicals assets by exploring strategic and partnership opportunities in the US and both high-grading and selective closures in Europe”.

Chief executive Wael Sawan said: “Today we are raising the bar across our key financial targets, investing where we have competitive strengths and delivering more for our shareholders.”

Last year Shell also revealed plans to reduce the “net carbon intensity” of the energy it sells by 15 per cent to 20 per cent by 2030 compared with 2016, having previously targeted a 20 per cent reduction.

CEO gets bumper pay boost

According to its latest annual report, pay of Shell’s chief executive swelled to more than £8m in 2024.

Wael Sawan’s pay packet increased to £8.6m for 2024, up from the £7.9m he received in 2023.

Sawan’s total pay increased by nine per cent as he landed a £2.9m annual bonus and £3.9m in long-term share awards.

Shell added that Sawan’s base salary would rise by 5.5 per cent for 2025 to £1.5m.

In January, City AM reported that Shell had paid out more than £18.7bn to shareholders in 2024 while cutting spending on renewable energy.

The FTSE 100 giant reported a dip in earnings from £23bn in 2023 to £19.1bn in 2024 amid weaker oil prices and lower demand for fossil fuels.

Despite the drop-off in earnings, Shell said it had hiked dividends by four per cent in the fourth quarter and announced a £2.8bn share buyback programme.

CEO of Shell rival BP takes huge pay cut

The news comes after City AM reported earlier this month that the chief executive of BP had taken a £2.3m pay cut as profit was slashed at the FTSE 100 giant.

Murray Auchincloss received a pay packet of £5.4m for 2024, down from the £7.7m he received in 2023.

The drop came amid a more than £1.1m cut to his bonus to £734,000, and a £1.6m fall in share-related payments to £2.8m.

His base salary rose by about £450,000 to £1.5m.

In February, it was revealed that BP’s net income fell to $8.9bn (£7.2bn) in 2024, down from $13.8bn the previous year.

The giant said lower oil and gas prices, as well as reduced profit from its refineries, had impacted its earnings.",cityam

PwC was the first Big Four to launch a dedicated legal services arm, PwC Legal, in 2014, followed shortly by EY and KPMG.

The Big Four giants—EY PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG—have all launched legal arms to compete against the traditional legal sector, but recent cracks show that their vision is not playing out.

The Legal Services Act 2007 introduced Alternative Business Structure (ABS) licenses, which allowed the Big Four to compete in the UK legal market.

It wasn’t the firms’ first time in the market, having had legal practices since the 1990s, but the ABS saw the Big Four aggressively reshape their legal businesses.

PwC was the first Big Four to launch a dedicated legal services arm, PwC Legal, in 2014, followed shortly by EY and KPMG.

Deloitte completed the group with the launch of Deloitte Legal in 2018.

The push into the legal market was starting to look positive. In 2023, data by Saïd Business School revealed the Big Four generated $1.5bn (£1.25bn) in revenues from their legal segments.

The figures increased from $900m in 2015 to $1.2bn in 2017.

However, the cracks have started to show.

Cuts at EY Law

Last week, news broke that EY was making more cuts, this time for around 30 staff in its legal department, EY Law.

In a statement EY said: “These proposals would continue to strengthen EY’s existing legal capabilities in corporate law, company secretarial, tax litigation and immigration but would, regrettably, result in a reduction of roles across other areas of the UK Law business.”

This isn’t the first time EY has taken the shears to its legal arm. In December 2023, news broke it was shutting EY Riverview Law, the Manchester-based legal services business it acquired in 2018.

On top of that its headcount has fallen to around 160 after a series of high-profile departures, including nearly a dozen lawyers leaving for the City office of Hunton Andrews Kurth in December.

According to Scott Gibson, director of Edwards Gibson: “If we exclude Deloitte’s ill-fated lock-stock and barrel acquisition of 27-partner TMT boutique Kemp Little in 2021, between 2019 and 2024, the Big Four’s legal divisions combined hired 35 partners in London.”

“Against this, the quartet lost 40 serving partners (including two-thirds of the laterals who joined during that time) to rival law firms,” he added.

Big Four conflicts of interest

So, why are the Big Four not storming the legal market?

Christopher Clark, director at Definitum Search, says: “One challenge lies in the conflicts with the audit businesses, preventing a large number of legal instructions from getting off the ground.”

The Big Four’s bread and butter is their accountancy departments, which are tightly regulated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

Plainly put, if the firm is auditing a business’s financials, the rest of its business can’t touch any work for that client.

Another issue is the structure of the Big Four firms. Nick Woolf, partner at Woolf&Co, highlighted that “however big their legal practice, they are always going to pale into insignificance compared to other parts of the firm.”

He noted the culture this creates explaining lawyers “who take pride in their own book of business, winning work themselves and seeing their own name in lights, are likely to be very disappointed by seeing none of these traits rewarded or even applauded in a Big Four firm.”

Woolf added that the Big Four had recruited the wrong partners for their needs.

KPMG is the outlier

Out of the Big Four, it seems KPMG is keeping its head above the water.

Gibson noted that the firm hired eight partners for KPMG Law UK in London versus just one for the rest of the Big Four.

“In 2024, whilst KPMG only managed to hire one partner in London, this was still 100 per cent more than the rest of the quartet combined,” he noted.

Speaking to City AM last July, the head of KPMG Law UK, Stuart Bedford, explained that the firm is not looking to challenge traditional Big Law on the likes of big corporate M&A deals. However, as he points out, there is a Venn diagram that overlaps with these firms and those deals.

“What we do is slightly different and tends to be the sorts of projects that actually those firms don’t really focus on,” he added.

This comes after KPMG revealed last month it launched KPMG Law US, the first law firm owned by a Big Four firm serving the US market.

A spokesperson for KPMG told City AM: “Whilst there is a lot of market uncertainty, we continue to grow and there are opportunities to help clients to not only remain compliant but optimise their businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory environment all while finding cost-effective ways of meeting their regulatory needs.”

An overview of the Big Four market, Gibson noted that firms “were able to sell themselves to lawyers with their ready made global networks, blue-chip client base, legendary organisational abilities, and gargantuan turnover.”

“In their numerous set-piece growth plans, the Big Four have themselves often conflated the volume of partner hiring from other law firms with success.”

He stated, “on that basis, with the possible exception of KPMG, the Big Four are failing.”

“If this was not already clear enough, unfortunately, EY’s latest retreat from Big Law in the UK is likely to make it even harder for the rest of the quartet to attract and retain quality lawyers – let alone rainmaker partners,” Gibson added.

A spokesperson for Deloitte Legal told City AM: “Deloitte Legal’s approach is blending legal expertise with our ability to deliver scale and leverage technology, alongside the broader range of Deloitte capabilities.”

“Our focus is on business solutions to the chief legal officer and becoming their business partner – a strategy that continues to resonate strongly with our clients and also with our people,” they added.

This comes as the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

After two years of redundancies after redundancies, recent news showed the situation has escalated to the senior partnership. City AM has a long read on what is next for the Big Four.",cityam

An olive linen suit from Savile Row tailor Richard James (image courtesy of Richard James)

On a Wednesday morning earlier this month, there was plenty of activity on the shop floor at the Georgian townhouse that plays home to Richard James’ bespoke suit-making. One staff member is on the phone discussing colours and time frames, another getting a glass of water for a customer in the changing room, and smartly dressed men in for appointments say hello to one of the co-founders of the Mayfair-based brand. Sean Dixon is sitting in a lounge area where fashion books and neatly folded shirts are displayed near a bar stocked with spirits, ice buckets and plenty of glassware.

Dixon, wearing a ‘Prince of Wales’ brown check blazer and trousers, one of Richard James’ ready-to-wear suits, says the company, whose clothes have been spotted on actors such as Jason Isaacs and Andrew Garfield, is seeing revenues grow around 5 per cent year-on-year. The firm is encouraged by the level of interest in bespoke wear, and Dixon adds: “We are pleased with this growth. It is welcome and comes from a low base following a challenging few years for businesses like ours.”

The company is among a group of specialist retailers based in an iconic area of London known for bespoke tailoring, particularly menswear, for more than two centuries. Firms on Savile Row and the surrounding streets are famous for dressing royalty, prime ministers, bankers and rock stars, and the sector is passionate about training the next generation of cutters and tailors.

Businesses here have more in common than an iconic address; they share a similar tale of enjoying good sales momentum as loyal and new customers seek outfits for social events and alterations to pre-loved suits. Work wear is also popular and comes at a time when London firms are luring – or requiring – staff back to the office. Fresh figures from Remit Consultancy show office occupancy in the West End for the week ended March 14 was 62.1 per cent, the highest so far this year, while the City recorded 38.6 per cent, the best seen since mid-February.

All of this is pleasing for bosses after much turbulence. From changing styles to climbing rents, and more recently the loss of VAT-free shopping for international tourists hitting trade – and Covid lockdowns suddenly hurting demand in 2020 for formal wear – Savile Row has weathered plenty of storms.

Now further challenges loom, including a potential bumper 144 per cent leap in business rates bills in the soon-to-start financial year (more on that later), and an increase in employers’ national insurance contributions that comes in next month. Fashion experts will also eagerly wait to hear if US President Donald Trump’s tariffs plans could affect them.

Closer to home, suitmakers are not anticipating any big announcements that will drastically impact them when the Chancellor delivers her Spring Statement. But here members of the industry explain what some of the new and ongoing headwinds they face are, and what measures would be helpful in the longer term to ensure their specialist skills and services can remain in vogue.

Helen Brocklebank, who leads luxury goods trade body Walpole, says: “Savile Row tailoring is more than a symbol of luxury; it sustains a network of skilled artisans across the UK, from wool producers to expert weavers. While it attracts high-spending customers, it faces the same retail challenges as other sectors.”

Looking at business rates, the government wants to create a fairer more sustainable system around this property tax, and at the Autumn Budget in 2024 it was announced retail, hospitality and leisure firms will have lower multipliers on properties with a ratable value under £500,000. However this won’t come into effect until April next year when a new revaluation takes place.

For the financial year that begins next month the average business rates bill will rise to £76,934, up from £31,536 per retail property on Savile Row. That estimate, calculated for City AM by global tax and software firm Ryan, is based on the consumer prices index measure of inflation increase to the standard multiplier, coupled with the cutting of the retail discount from 75 per cent to 40 per cent, which comes into effect on April 1 for eligible properties.

Dominic Sebag-Montefiore is creative director of Edward Sexton, a brand whose creations have been worn by musicians such as Jarvis Cocker and Paul McCartney. The retailer has enjoyed revenue growth with good demand, but is not immune from rising bills. Sebag-Montefiore would welcome more rates reform, and comments: “It would be good to reduce the cost of trading in bricks and mortar to encourage vibrancy in the high street.”

For Anda Rowland, a director at Royal Warrant holder Anderson & Sheppard, turnover has been growing, with a standout success this year being a blazer made from off-cut tweed. The tailor is not only in demand with customers, but also budding designers: it receives eight requests on average a week for apprenticeships.

But like for rivals, overheads continue to rise. Rowland says Brexit pushed up costs for the company, with extra time and money needed around paperwork for exports and imports, that could include mainland European customers needing alterations sent back and forth for example. She adds another challenge has been the loss of the tax-free shopping perk which had made UK purchases cheaper for international visitors. “We are aware of people spending less time on leisure in London to head to other European cities for their shopping trips.” On Rowland’s wish-list would be for the government to bring back VAT-free shopping.

James Sleater is among those who also want to see the return of tax-free shopping. The managing director of 204-year-old Norton & Sons says the tailor has expanded, increasing its global trunk shows to include ten cities worldwide, as well as broadening its product range to help keep turnover moving in the right direction. But he thinks the ‘tourist tax’ is hurting revenue “that supports not just tailoring houses like ours, but also the wider retail and hospitality sectors”.

Sleater adds: “The changes to business rates relief compounds the problem of no-VAT free shopping for the traditional houses that haven’t diversified.”

Walpole’s Brocklebank says: “With the luxury industry contributing £81 billion to the economy and supporting nearly half a million jobs, the Chancellor should incentivise spending – such as reinstating tax-free shopping for international visitors – to drive growth especially among Americans keen to avoid higher prices that could result from looming tariffs at home.”

A HM Treasury spokesman says “we are a pro-business government …We delivered a once-in-a-Parliament budget to wipe the slate clean and without our action, business rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure would have ended completely in April this year”.

The spokesman adds that the government is focused on creating opportunities for businesses to compete and access the finance they need to scale, export and break into new markets. The well-dressed entrepreneurs carving out a living on Savile Row will be waiting to see whether these promised benefits will materialise.",cityam

Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA

The chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said the watchdog is “going so much further” on its mission to boost growth in the UK, amid pressure from the government for regulators to cut red tape.

Writing in City AM this morning, Nikhil Rathi said the FCA had presented the Prime Minister with almost 50 measures designed to support long term growth and he vowed to “deliver at a pace that matches the urgency of the UK’s economic challenges.”

Supporting economic growth is now set to be one of the four priorities identified in the FCA’s newly launched five-year strategy, alongside helping consumers, fighting crime, and becoming a smarter regulator.

Rathi also said the FCA would shortly be announcing ways it will simplify its rules to remove burdens on firms “while maintaining high standards”.

“Becoming a more efficient and effective regulator helps us fight crime. That builds people’s trust, giving them the confidence to take informed risks so they can better withstand a financial shock or save for retirement,” he said.

Yesterday, FCA chair Ashley Alder said the watchdog would push for retail investors to increase their level of risk through a greater emphasis on tackling fraud.

Through making “a heavy emphasis on financial crime and fraud across the sector,” the watchdog can increase confidence in investing and therefore allow consumers to up their risk, Alder explained.

The comments come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer continue to press regulators to prioritise growth amid concerns that red tape is hamstringing the economy.

Reeves has had numerous talks with watchdogs over how to slim down regulation and cut red tape to promote growth in the UK economy, including the FCA.

Read more The FCA will boost growth by being a smarter regulator

The FCA was assigned a secondary growth and competitiveness mandate in 2023, while maintaining its primary objective of protecting consumers.

FCA chief writes ahead of Spring Statement

In his City AM article, Rathi addressed a variety of regulations that the watchdog has rolled out in recent years.

“Our ground-breaking consumer duty, which sets a higher standard of consumer protection, already means that firms have to act to deliver good outcomes for their customers,” he said.

However, the process of implementing consumer duty has proven to be complex and time-consuming for many businesses, with debate still raging as to the effectiveness of the new rules.

A year on from the introduction of the new regulation, 84 per cent of Brits reported no improvement in how financial providers treated them, data from Smart Money People found.

The watchdog chief also made a nod to the FCA’s ongoing advice guidance boundary review, which is expected to loosen the definition of financial advice and make it easier for consumers to access targeted support.

“We will enable more people to benefit from financial guidance, so they can make the most of their pensions and invest with greater confidence,” Rathi said.

Writing ahead of the chancellor’s Spring Statement tomorrow, the FCA boss said “growth

matters,” adding that “without it, there is less money for public services and less in people’s

pockets” and that “living standards won’t rise.”",cityam
https://cityam.com,Who’s afraid of the Liberal Democrats?,https://www.cityam.com/whos-afraid-of-the-liberal-democrats/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:01:14 GMT","Who’s afraid of the Liberal Democrats?

(Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)

With Labour sinking in the polls, there’s an increasing likelihood that whoever forms the next government will need the Liberal Democrats’ help to do it. So what kind of impact might the Lib Dems have on national politics? If a visit to their spring conference is anything to go by, very little, says Emma Revell

Unusually, while I started last week thinking about how the Conservatives could get Britain back on track, I ended it thinking about the Liberal Democrats instead.

Last Monday, my employer, the Centre for Policy Studies, had gathered the great and the good on centre right for our annual Margaret Thatcher Conference. Aside from when a couple of ranty protestors ineffectually interrupted Kemi Badenoch’s keynote address, the calibre of the discussion was excellent.

The meat of the conference was dedicated to the theme of ‘remaking conservatism’ – how to apply sound, free-market policy solutions to the problems of today while navigating damage to the Conservative brand. There was also a heavy focus on learning lessons from the global centre right – Spain, Argentina, Germany, Canada, the USA and so on.

But George Osborne – someone who knows what it’s like to take a party from opposition back into government – drew our attention to something else: the Lib Dem question.

What, Osborne asked, is the Tories’ Lib Dem strategy? How are they planning to recapture the seats lost to Ed Davey? Are they completely ruling out the possibility of a post-election deal? He pointed out that he and David Cameron put an awful lot of effort, between 2005-10, into wooing Lib Dem voters – but gained very little ground.

But it’s not just a question for the Tories. With Labour continuing to sink, there’s a high likelihood that – if Keir Starmer does remain as Prime Minister in 2029 – he’ll need the Lib Dems to do it. So what sort of impact would that have on the nation’s future?

There’s no reason the Lib Dems shouldn’t be as devoutly pro free trade as the Conservatives

By coincidence, I was invited to speak a few days later on a panel on free trade at the Lib Dems’ spring conference in Harrogate. I dutifully agreed, partly because I believe there’s no reason the Lib Dems shouldn’t be as devoutly pro free trade as the Conservatives, but also out of morbid curiosity about whether a party I’d last been a member of over a decade ago had got any more liberal and any less navel-gazing since then.

The short answer, sadly, is no.

I’ve written previously on these pages about my constant disappointment at the Lib Dems’ failure to be actually liberal and my belief that a strong liberal voice in British politics would do us all the world of good. Free trade is, I believe, an innately liberal goal, but in Lib Dem minds its merits are almost completely overshadowed by their zealous commitment to the EU. Of course, the EU is a free trade area – but one which defines itself by its tariff borders with others (and hasn’t made much progress on many aspects of the free trade agenda, such as trade in services).

I wasn’t naive enough to expect the strength of feeling among grassroots members to have changed much since 2016. Still, I made the case that the personal distaste many members clearly have for Donald Trump shouldn’t blind us to the enormous benefits of improved trade relations with the US and that being outside of the EU had strengthened our hand when it came to avoiding or minimising the impact of Trump’s tariff wars. While the discussion didn’t give me overwhelming cause for optimism, there were enough heads in the audience nodding along to my comments that I felt not all was lost.

Lib Dems are obsessed with process

What made me think Osborne shouldn’t be quite so worried, though, was the conference at large.

Most people don’t know that the Lib Dems are a party obsessed with process. And I do mean obsessed. They use their party conferences to propose, debate and vote on the party’s policies and constitution. Line by line. Fairly democratic, sure. But conducive to being taken seriously as a potential party of government again? Absolutely not.

And it was striking that the most controversial motion in Harrogate by far did not concern how the UK should deal with Trump, restoring international aid, animal welfare in the food supply, or even the one on gender which skirted around the Cass Review (although it came close). It was on small changes to the party’s process for selecting general election candidates, updating arrangements which date from the merger between the Liberals and the SDP.

If you combine this obsession with niche constitutional arrangements, a blinding obsession with the EU, and a comms strategy which – while incredibly effective during the general election – cements your leader in the public’s mind as a bit of a clown, you don’t get a devastating political force.

Osborne may be right to caution that CCHQ can’t afford to forget about the Liberal Democrats.But from what I’ve seen, I wouldn’t be having any sleepless nights – save for the prospect of their getting back into power without doing far more hard thinking about the problems Britain faces.

RE: Why top law firms are betting big on virtual reality training, 4 Mar

Technology is changing workplace training, but many businesses find it daunting, especially when it comes to innovations like virtual reality. Yet embracing it is key to engaging the workforce – especially Gen Z, who have high expectations when it comes to innovation and technology in the workplace.

The irony is that many businesses attempt to engage Gen Z without truly involving or understanding them. By bringing them into the process, you ensure that learning and development are relevant and effective by inherently understanding their skill sets.

Gen Z are natural early adopters, eager to experiment with new tech. Businesses must be forward thinking, going beyond making content shorter, faster, “mobile-friendly” (the bare minimum) and start leveraging XR, and VR. While VR may seem intimidating, its adoption is growing rapidly, AR/VR job listings have increased by 154 per cent since 2019, proving its expanding role in the workplace.

VR is becoming more than just a powerful training tool – thanks to AI advancements it’s allowing organizations to scale, personalize and therefore democratize career coaching, mentoring, and realistic role-playing practice sessions that create ‘safe to fail’ environments. Companies serious about attracting and then engaging Gen Z should consider this modality offering which not only makes its business stand out, but signals a commitment to innovation and investment in the future.

The instalment of permanent facial recognition cameras in Croydon should worry us all, writes Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent

Croydon, Big Brother is watching you

It’s been a busy month at Big Brother Watch. Amidst a number of worrying bills being rushed through parliament at breakneck speed and the Home Office’s relentless battle to break encryption, we’ve also seen alarming escalations in the roll-out of live facial recognition (LFR) technology that should have everyone worried.

Things were bad enough when South Wales Police trialled the use of a network of LFR cameras across an entire city centre in Cardiff – a UK first – for two of the Six Nations games earlier this month. In the LFR zone were places of worship, a family court, abortion and health clinics, and other sites where anyone would want their right to privacy respected. This represented a gross violation of privacy of anyone who had reason to be in Cardiff on a busy Saturday.

The grand total of arrests during the Wales vs England rugby match on 15 March, when police scanned 162,680 faces? Zero – evidencing a shameful waste of police resources, on top of serious rights-based concerns.

Now the situation has reached an even more disturbing new low, with reports emerging over the weekend that the London Metropolitan Police Service is installing the UK’s first permanent network of fixed LFR cameras in Croydon town centre. Previously, the Met has only used CCTV cameras mounted on police vans, which are clearly marked and used only during time-limited deployments.

The move represents an alarming expansion of the surveillance state, and a further slide towards a dystopian nightmare that could quickly take hold across the UK. It also underscores the urgent need for legislative safeguards on LFR, which to date has not been addressed in any parliamentary legislation. Police forces have been left to write their own policies on how they plan to use LFR, and can choose how and when to employ it. For its part, the Met’s “LFR watchlist” expands beyond those suspected of criminal activity, including vulnerable persons and even victims of crimes.

Enough is enough: it’s time to halt all use of LFR technology and ensure full parliamentary scrutiny and oversight. This Orwellian technology should never be installed in or used in conjunction with live CCTV networks. Legislation must be developed without delay to ensure proper oversight and safeguards for any permissible use of LFR, before it rolls out any further.

France protects encryption… but the UK?

Last week the French National Assembly voted down a dangerous legislative proposal that would have forced all secure messaging services to create an encryption backdoor, in the name of fighting drug trafficking. But embarrassingly, the UK Home Office is still seeking to do precisely that, through its encryption-breaching order to Apple.

The matter is currently under consideration by the secretive Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which convened behind closed doors on 14 March, ignoring the dozen or so journalists and campaigners – myself included – lining the corridor outside the courtroom, hoping our submissions urging the Tribunal to open the hearing to the public would be considered and we might be allowed in. But so far, not a word about what happened that day or what will come next. What’s at stake is overwhelmingly in the public interest, as once encryption is broken for anyone, it’s broken for everyone – and this will not stop with Apple. The Home Office should revoke this draconian proposal and ensure encryption and our privacy rights remain intact.

The Bill turning banks into spies

As we await tomorrow’s spring statement by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, there’s been widespread attention to the Labour government’s expected welfare cuts. But a related threat continues to loom in the background, in the form of dangerous proposals in the Public Authorities (Fraud, Error, and Recovery) Bill, which will soon come to the report stage in the House of Commons. Alarmingly, in the name of rooting out welfare fraud, this bill would give the government unprecedented powers to force banks to spy on everyone’s bank accounts, regardless of whether they’ve ever received benefits. It also takes a disproportionately punitive approach to those who are suspected of fraud, as well as those who may have received erroneous payments due to the Department for Work and Pensions’ own mistakes. This flawed bill is in dire need of amendments before it progresses further.

A recommendation:

All eyes seem to be on Netflix’s four-part miniseries Adolescence, which has triggered a divisive public discourse about the harms children face online. My take? The series is worth a watch, and it’s a jarring reminder to parents of the need to be fully involved in our children’s lives, both online and offline. But beware the calls this has triggered for a further clampdown on everyone’s rights under the pretext of online safety. We must educate our children about online harms and ensure they are fully supported at home, in schools, and in local communities, but the popularity of this fictionalised programme does not justify calls for mass censorship or surveillance.",cityam

Ahead of last October’s Budget, ministers allowed months of speculation as to what would be unveiled, and the never-ending drumbeat of doom and gloom talked the economy to a standstill. Largely as a result of the contents and consequences of that Budget, economic growth has since evaporated and now all eyes are on this week’s Spring Statement.

The Treasury is adamant that it isn’t a Budget and officials are keen to downplay the significance of the Chancellor’s speech to the Commons on Wednesday, but economic (and political) conditions mean that it’s taken on the status of a major event and there’s little point in ministers complaining about that.

The spin coming out of Whitehall so far is that there will be no new tax measures announced, no borrowing binge and absolutely no return to austerity. The Chancellor’s team are also desperately hammering the message that “the world has changed” – in other words, don’t blame us for how bad things are, blame Trump.

As I’ve noted before, global economic uncertainty is having an impact, of course, but it’s a case of insult to injury – with the government’s policies weakening the economy long before Trump launched his tariff war. As for the Spring Statement, we know that there will be substantial cuts to public spending (call it austerity if you want) and a modest reduction in the number of civil servants, plus the contentious welfare reforms designed to save a few billion, but if Reeves isn’t planning any major announcements then the risk is that her approach is reduced to crossing her fingers and hoping that is growth is on its way.

Unfortunately, economic forecasters are currently slashing their expectations for 2025, and the OBR is almost certainly going to do the same this week. Some City analysts are now starting to ring the alarm bells ahead of the actual Budget, due in the autumn, with banking giant ING warning that “barring a surprise boost to UK growth this summer, we think further tax hikes look inevitable in the autumn.”

More worryingly, investment bank Citi has just revised up its expectations as to how much debt the government is going to issue over the coming year to £321bn which, as Harry Robertson at Reuters noted last night, would be the second largest amount on record – dwarfed only by the government’s response to the pandemic in 2020/21.

All in all, it’s not a pretty backdrop ahead of the Chancellor’s speech tomorrow.",cityam

AI and deepfakes mean the world we see through our screens is already fiction. The next step is removing screens altogether, says Paul Armstrong

Reality used to be something you could trust. What you saw, heard and experienced was, for the most part, real. But as AI-driven filters, deepfake augmented reality (AR), and immersive environments creep further into everyday life, the line between real and synthetic is dissolving. The question is no longer whether AI will distort perception, because it already has, instead the real concern is whether we’ll ever be able to switch it off, or know that we need to.

There was a time when photo filters were just playful tweaks. Now, AI-enhanced reality is so pervasive that entire digital personas are crafted out of thin air. Instagram faces, AI-generated influencers and deepfake avatars are standard fare. News images are algorithmically “enhanced”, videos are subtly altered and AI-powered beauty filters don’t just soften wrinkles, they shift bone structures, erase ethnic markers and rewire self-image at a fundamental level. The world we see through our screens is already fiction. The next step is removing screens altogether.

Augmented reality was supposed to add layers to our experience of the world. What it’s doing instead is replacing reality itself. With deepfake AR, AI doesn’t just modify digital content, it overlays a version of reality that is entirely customisable. Real-time face-swapping, AI-powered speech modulation and personalised content feeds mean that two people can stand in the same physical location and experience completely different digital realities.

Take AI-powered video calls. It’s already possible to subtly tweak your real-time appearance with smoother skin, brighter eyes and better lighting. Now push that further. Your voice can be modulated, your body language adjusted, your facial expressions rewritten in real-time. The person on the other end has no idea they’re interacting with an altered version of you. There are already examples of AR masks being donned by people taking interviews for others already. And why stop at video calls? AR glasses will soon let us redesign the world as we see fit. The people around us can be digitally “enhanced” to look more attractive. Ads can be erased from view. AI can edit live interactions in real time, filtering out undesirable speech patterns or emotional responses.

If perception is dictated by algorithms, then what happens to truth? More importantly, what happens to trust? The internet fractured collective experience. AI-mediated reality seems destined to shatter it completely. Two people standing next to each other in Times Square might not see the same billboards, the same news headlines, or even the same people. One might be living in a hyper-commercialised, ad-saturated version of the world, while the other has paid to strip it all away. The advertising poor-tax will never feel so real. Are we about to see a trillion-dollar reality-as-a-service blossom?

Dystopia?

Sadly, this isn’t hyperbole or a distant dystopia, it’s already happening. Google and co’s generative search is delivering AI-rewritten versions of the internet, personalising not just the results but the actual content users see. TikTok’s For You Page is so finely tuned that people exist in entirely different algorithmic bubbles without realising it. Now apply that logic to everything. Shopping streets where brands bid to be visible to you. Conversations where AI filters out speech patterns it deems offensive before they even reach your ears. A reality curated entirely by algorithms that never reveal what they’ve removed.

The more dangerous part? AI doesn’t just distort how we see reality, it changes how we remember it. A recent study found that AI-generated memories can be so convincing that people genuinely recall events that never happened. When AI edits real-time perception, it’s not just shaping what we experience, it’s rewriting history on the fly.

So who controls all these filters? Give you three guesses. AI-driven reality isn’t inherently bad. There are benefits to being able to customise how we interact with the world. Imagine a person with PTSD using AR glasses to filter out distressing triggers or an AI overlay that enhances accessibility for the visually impaired. But these tools will not remain personal choices for long.

Big Tech will control the filters, deciding which versions of reality are profitable, permissible and politically acceptable. An AR cityscape could block out independent businesses in favour of sponsored content. AI-driven news feeds could erase inconvenient narratives entirely. And once AI controls real-time perception, dissent becomes harder to prove. If the news story you saw yesterday doesn’t exist today, did it ever happen?

Can we opt out? Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. AI-mediated reality will become the default because opting out will mean exclusion. If job interviews, dating, and even casual conversation rely on AI-enhanced presentation, then refusing to engage with it becomes a disadvantage. People who choose to live in unfiltered reality might soon be seen as socially or professionally unpolished, less competitive in a world where perfection is automated.

People who choose to live in unfiltered reality might soon be seen as socially or professionally unpolished, less competitive in a world where perfection is automated

There’s also the issue of compulsory augmentation. Employers may require AR interfaces for efficiency. Governments could mandate AI-filtered content for “safety.” Businesses will design physical spaces assuming that visitors are using AR overlays. A world without AI mediation might cease to function altogether.

Businesses need to start planning for an AI-mediated future now, both to protect their own interests and to shape how these technologies evolve. In the short term, companies must audit their reliance on AI-enhanced content, ensure transparency in how they present reality to consumers, and establish ethical guidelines for AI-generated interactions. Customer trust will hinge on authenticity; businesses that are upfront about their use of AI will hold an advantage over those that quietly manipulate perception. In the long term, organisations should push for industry-wide standards on AI transparency, advocate for user control over AI filters and invest in technologies that give consumers the option to toggle between mediated and unmediated experiences. The businesses that take a proactive stance now will be the ones defining what “real” means in the decades to come.

We are at the point where reality is being rewritten in real-time, often without our explicit consent. AI-mediated experiences are so subtle, so integrated into our daily lives, that most people don’t even realise they are engaging with a version of reality rather than reality itself. The question isn’t whether AI will reshape perception, it’s whether we’ll ever be able to turn it off.

The fight (back?) for an unfiltered world starts now. If businesses, regulators, and individuals don’t challenge the creeping normalisation of AI-curated reality, opting out won’t be an option. The world you see will be whatever the algorithm decides. And if you never see the alternative, you won’t even know what’s missing.

The London Property Alliance said ministers “must be bold” on Wednesday if they want to get ahead on vital transport projects in the capital.

Despite frantic denials, the debt burden means Rachel Reeves will soon have to revisit promises she made on tax in the care-free days of opposition, says Vince Cable

The Chancellor has many competing priorities on Wednesday: a big rise in defence spending; keeping the NHS afloat; honouring promises not to raise taxes on income and spending; bailing out bankrupt councils and universities; and, not least, managing the welfare budget without imposing hardship on the disabled or raiding on pensioners’ pockets. But the number one priority is keeping our money-lenders sweet.

Like other countries, the UK – rightly – borrowed heavily to cope with the financial crisis in 2008, Covid and latterly the ‘cost of living’ crisis. The current net public sector debt to GDP of just under 100 per cent is four times the level in 1989/90, before the golden era when Blair and Brown were able to surf the waves of global and national non-inflationary growth.

The debt burden is much less than we ‘enjoyed’ after the Napoleonic and World Wars. It also looks good compared to Japan – where debt is 220 per cent of GDP – though Japan has patriotic savers happy to lend their government the money cheaply. Britain also looks better than Italy – 135 per cent – or even France at 111 per cent, though they both have the backing of the Eurozone. And we seem better than the USA, with debt on 124 per cent of GDP and rapidly rising. Crucially, however, the Americans have the ‘exorbitant privilege’ of borrowing in their own currency: a perk which Trump will not give up and, if necessary, impose on reluctant lenders. By contrast, Britain is more exposed and cannot take liberties.

The debt burden

The overhang of debt becomes a burden on the budget when interest rates rise, as they are now. Interest on government debt averaged around twp per cent in the first two decades of the century but was almost four per cent in 2023/24, taking up almost nine per cent of government spending. Debt costs in this financial year have been around £105bn – that’s almost double what we’ve spent on defence in the same period. The OBR predicts future interest rates on government debt of 3.5 per cent which is consistent with a stable level of debt. This occurs when interest rates are no higher than nominal GDP growth (currently three per cent inflation plus real economic growth of around one per cent per anum).

But there isn’t much room for manoeuvre. One big uncertainty is Trump, whose economic policy is becoming less and less rational. Continued moronic behaviour around tariff warfare and unfunded tax cuts will slow growth, raise inflation, and raise risk premiums everywhere. There is nothing Rachel Reeves can do about Trump beyond keeping our own house in order. And our money lenders happy.

That is becoming increasingly difficult. She must not sacrifice her one big achievement as Chancellor which is to have accepted the need for borrowing to invest – something that previous governments, including mine, failed to do. Such investment is key to growth and growth is necessary to achieve debt sustainability. So current public spending must carry the weight of budgetary discipline. After the ‘easy’ – if damaging – cuts in programmes like foreign aid and disability benefits for the mentally ill, she is left with deeper cuts in budgets which have already been cut to the bone. Ask a policeman. Or a teacher.

She must not sacrifice her one big achievement as Chancellor which is to have accepted the need for borrowing to invest – something that previous governments, including mine, failed to do

No doubt the numbers will be made to add up for Wednesday’s Spring Statement. Beyond that, spending targets enter the supernatural world. Inane announcements about ‘cutting waste’ and quango culls don’t cut it. Believe me, I have been there. Now, to superimpose a big new slab of spending on defence is literally incredible.

So what is to be done? Despite frantic denials, the Chancellor will soon have to revisit the commitments made on tax in the innocent, care-free days in opposition. So far, the pledge not to raise the main taxes on income and spending has been met by dodgy swerves like the NICs rise. But more will be needed. Despite self-piteous claims that Britain is over-taxed, European welfare states operate at much higher tax levels and the Scandinavians are more economically dynamic than we are. Guns plus butter plus debt service equals higher tax. Let us get real.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ small cuts are unlikely to deliver growth and make big savings.

Emergency Budgets are a bad idea, but with the economic changing fast Reeves may not have the luxury of waiting until Autumn to raise taxes, says Tim Sarson

Last autumn, after a long, long summer of speculation and rumour, our newly installed Chancellor of the exchequer Rachel Reeves delivered what she promised would be the first in a new annual series of Budgets. One autumn event each year, with the spring forecast seemingly relegated to more of a progress update than a Budget with a capital B.

It’s not the first time a Chancellor has promised this. The Treasury has longed to get back to a once-a-year cycle for ages. But it’s easier said than done. A year is a long time in economics. Indeed, since 20 January when the new US President was sworn in, a day can seem like a long time. So, it was a brave call.

But what happens when you promise no event at a time when people are used to an event? Especially just before the fiscal year end, when tax rates and thresholds traditionally get adjusted? You get speculation, and while we are not expecting one, the spectre of the famous “emergency Budget” looms.

Spoiled with fiscal events

We’ve been rather spoiled with fiscal events and emergency Budgets recently. This peaked back in 2022 when, lest we forget, we endured three fiscal events in three months. It’s been more sedate since then, but we still had two Budgets in 2023 and 2024.

Objectively speaking, emergency Budgets are a bad idea for many reasons.

Constant tinkering with the rules increases volatility in tax policy and adds complexity to the system. That makes it harder for businesses to look ahead and plan, which they regularly tell us puts them off from committing to large investments. This is because businesses like stability.

Emergency Budgets also betray a lack of government confidence. How credible is any long-term economic plan if you keep changing it on a whim? They make the government ever more beholden to switches in wind direction on fiscal forecasts and GDP, which are, by their nature, unpredictable.

So, the logical course of action would be for the government to see through its promise and not touch tax this time, except for a few procedural measures like HMRC consultations. By all accounts they seem more focused on spending restraint rather than tax changes.

But hang on. For several reasons, might some surprise measures this time be a temptation that’s hard to resist? A recognition that some rabbits out of the hat are needed but not a full emergency Budget.

I wouldn’t bet the house against a couple of surprises on the day

Let’s face it: the new American administration has handed Reeves several layers of pretext for a tax raid. A radically new US approach to NATO and the defence of Europe has seen European countries rush to commit to greater defence expenditures. In Germany’s case, they’re even attempting the impossible: to raise their constitutional debt ceiling. What better moment than now to do something ex-manifesto in the name of defence of the realm?

That same US administration has been busy creating new economic facts on the ground, too, as tariff barriers go up and stock markets go down. When the facts change so profoundly and so rapidly, a government has the perfect excuse to change its mind. Indeed, Britain may not have the luxury of waiting until this autumn to respond to several of the recent US retaliation threats over discriminatory tax measures. So perhaps Reeves can’t ignore tax this week after all?

Let’s see. My money is still on Wednesday being a quiet fiscal non-event. We’d surely have heard rumours and spotted a few flying kites by now. But I wouldn’t bet the house against a couple of surprises on the day.

The Financial Conduct Authority is prioritising growth and fighting financial crime as chief executive Nikhil Rathi unveils a new five-year strategy

Tomorrow the Chancellor will deliver her Spring Statement. Among the blizzard of figures, it’s likely we will hear one word more than any other: growth.

The government has made growth their number one mission. And growth matters. Without it, there is less money for public services and less in people’s pockets. Living standards won’t rise.

At the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), our work has long contributed to growth by enabling trusted, liquid markets, boosting competition, reducing financial crime and ensuring consumers can confidently engage with products they need. In the last year alone, we have delivered reforms to strengthen the UK’s wholesale markets and make it easier for businesses to attract investment.

And we are going much further. We recently set out to the Prime Minister almost 50 measures we will take forward to support long-term, sustained growth. Initiatives to unlock more capital for businesses, accelerate innovation, reduce regulatory burdens, enable more firms to start-up and grow, boost exports of financial services and provide greater certainty and predictability to support business confidence and secure overseas investment.

Today, we have confirmed that supporting growth will be one of four priorities in our new five-year strategy, along with helping consumers, fighting crime and becoming a smarter regulator.

Consumers must make often complex financial decisions. We will help them navigate their financial lives by ensuring they get the right information and support. Our ground-breaking consumer duty, which sets a higher standard of consumer protection, already means firms have to act to deliver good outcomes for their customers. We will enable more people to benefit from financial guidance, so they can make the most of their pensions and invest with greater confidence. And we will drive better value for money in workplace pensions, encouraging schemes to invest for longer-term returns, boosting individual nest eggs and economic growth.

Fighting financial crime

We have made good progress in the collective fight against financial crime which is a drain on growth and damages consumer confidence. Over the last two years, we’ve charged more people with criminal offences than ever before and reduced our investigation times. We are harnessing technology to better identify scams and stop them sooner. We are tackling misleading financial promotions at scale. With partners, we’ve slowed the growth in investment fraud and we will go further to disrupt crime. We will better support the firms we regulate to be an effective line of defence. And our new Firm Checker tool will help consumers easily check they are using an authorised firm and avoid scams.

The way we operate can clear the way to greater innovation and investment. We’re more quickly authorising firms that meet our high standards. And we’ll continue to work smarter, investing in our technology, people and systems.

Success on one priority spurs success on the others. Becoming a more efficient and effective regulator helps us fight crime. That builds people’s trust, giving them the confidence to take informed risks so they can better withstand a financial shock or save for retirement.

Those savings can be turned into capital for businesses to invest and expand which then supports growth.

We will deliver at a pace that matches the urgency of the UK’s economic challenges. Since I wrote to the Prime Minister in January, we’ve already taken steps to help get more people on the housing ladder and opened a debate on whether we should remove the £100 contactless limit to make payments easier and spur innovation. And today we’re announcing ways we will simplify our rules to remove burdens on firms, while maintaining high standards.

By embracing the push for growth, we aren’t walking away from our primary objectives of protecting consumers, safeguarding market integrity and promoting competition. We can and will fulfil each, and by continually challenging ourselves on whether we are getting the balance right, go even further to improve lives.

Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid moved a step closer on Tuesday with talks progressing between the club and the Brit.

The 26-year-old, who has made over 300 appearances for the Anfield club, will be without a club should he reach the end of his contract this summer. He has reportedly not pursued a new deal with the Reds, who are top of the Premier League.

There is no guarantee that Alexander-Arnold will be gracing the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium pitch next season but talks have progressed.

The so-called “Mbappe tax law” – in which new residents to Spain who establish their tax residence in Madrid can see a reduction in their owed monies to the government’s treasury – will be part of the process and could slow down any deal.

Alexander-Arnold one of three?

But an official contract proposal has reportedly been sent by Real Madrid to both Alexander-Arnold and his team, after a year of rumours surrounding the potential transfer.

The loss of Alexander-Arnold could be the first in a series of three major departures for Liverpool.

Arne Slot could see Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk leave the club despite his Reds being on course to win the Premier League under his first season in charge.

The future of Salah remains uncertain with his deal set to expire in the summer. The 31-year-old Egyptian is one of the favourites for the Ballon d’Or.

Van Dijk, 33, joined the reds from Southampton in 2018 and has played over 200 games for the Anfield club.

The trio all leaving in one summer would leave Liverpool looking for a major rebuild, with all three players having seen the club win both the Premier League and the Champions League during their time on Merseyside.

It has meant Liverpool have made Newcastle United and Sweden international striker Alexander Isak their top signing priority for the summer transfer window.",cityam

Sponsored Content by Intel

AIに代表されるテクノロジーの進化と、それに伴う市場環境の変化が起きている。真っ先に大きな影響を受けるのがPC市場だ。AIの需要が高まるにつれて、これまでとは比較にならないほど高性能なPCの需要が増しているのである。

そんな中、いち早くAIに対応した高性能PC「AI PC」を打ち出し、インテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサーを市場に投入したのがインテルだ。

2025年はAI PCが本格的に登場して2年目となる年であり、インテルにとっても今後を占う重要な一年になることは間違いない。ラインナップが充実しつつあるAI PCを、同社はどのように成長させていくのか。他社製品への優位性や販売戦略はどのようなものがあるのか。

2025年3月5日に開催されたインテルのパートナー企業向けイベント「Intel Commercial Client内覧会」で語られた内容をもとに、AI PC 2年目の販売戦略について解説する。

AI PCはコモディティ化による市場の頭打ちを打破する存在

「Intel Commercial Client内覧会」は企業のPC買い替え需要に備え、最新のAI PCやIntel vPro® プラットフォームといった企業向けソリューション情報を共有し、パートナー各社のアップセルにつなげることを目的としたイベントである。インテルのほか、パートナー企業からは、カタオカ、NSW、アクセル、マイクロソフト、ブラックマジックデザインから担当者が登壇した。

上野晶子（うえの・しょうこ）氏／インテル 執行役員 マーケティング本部 本部長。外資系ホテル、モバイル通信や医療機器メーカーでマーケティングを経験後、2002年にインテルに入社。その後エネルギーマネジメント企業でストラテジック・マーケティング担当を経て2018年にインテルに復帰。自社のマーケティング戦略にとどまらず、エコシステム・パートナーとの共同マーケティングを推進。

同イベントではまず、インテル 執行役員マーケティング本部長・上野晶子氏が登壇。開会挨拶として、インテルにおける最新の販売戦略について語った。

上野氏はまず、2025年という年がパートナー各社にとって「法人向けのPCにおける特需の年になる」と切り出した。逆にいえば、これまでのPC市場は販売する側にとって決して楽ではなかったということになる。

その背景にあるのは、PCのコモディティ化だ。何十年もの間、PCは進化を続け、そのたびに新たな顧客を開拓し、市場を拡大させてきた。しかし、多くの人がPCを所有し、企業にも行き渡った昨今はついに市場が頭打ちに。上野氏は「PCはいまや鉛筆と同じような存在になった」と話す。「文字を書く」ことが目的の鉛筆に今以上の機能を求める人がいないのと同じく、PCの性能向上による恩恵が多くの人にとってピンとこないものになってしまったのだ。

そうした状況は、PCを販売する側にとっては大きな課題だった。人口増加が見込めない国内ではこれ以上の販売数の増加は難しく、売上を上げるには単価を上げるしかないからだ。単価を上げるには何らかの付加価値が必要だが、前述のようにコモディティ化した状況ではそれも難しい。PC業界は、これまでのPC市場を一変させるようなイノベーションを待ち望んでいたわけだ。

そんな現状を打破する契機になったのが、AIのムーブメントである。AIを端末内で動作させるには、これまで以上に強力なプロセッサが必要になる。そこでインテルが提案したのが、AIの処理を専門に行うプロセッサ「NPU（Neural Processing Unit）」を搭載したAI PCという新たなカテゴリーだったのだ。

「AI PCという新しいカテゴリーが生まれたことで、PCの単価を上げていけるのではないか。そして、より多くのお客様にサービスを提供していくことで、PC業界全体が大きく成長できるのではないかと考えています」（上野氏）

では、AI PCは市場にどれほどのインパクトをもたらせるのか。キーワードとなるのが「データセントリックトランスフォーメーション（DCX）」だ。これは「データを中心にした変革」のこと。AIを使いこなす肝となるのはデータであり、今後はデータの利活用でAIを使いこなせる企業が大きく成長すると上野氏は言う。

「現在、インターネット業界においてグローバルで活躍している日本企業は残念ながら多くありません。AIにしても今はまだデータをクラウドに上げないといけない場合がほとんどなので、クラウドプラットフォームを提供するインフラ企業など特定の企業だけが成長する構造になっているのです。 しかし、AIをクラウドではなく、ローカルで処理できるようになれば、日本企業もグローバルで活躍できる成長企業になれるかもしれません。そのために必要なのが、AI PCです。AI PCの到来は、日本のビジネス構造を大きく変えていけるのではないかと思っています」（上野氏）

3年前のPCと比べて飛躍的に性能が向上

では、具体的にAI PCの特長や優位性はどこにあるのか。

一言でいえば「AI PCとは、今この世の中にある中で最も優れたPC」だと上野氏は胸を張る。そもそも、AI PCにはユーザーがPCに望む基本的な性能がすべて入っている。高い省電力性や互換性、そして生産性。AI PCはこうした基本性能の高さを備えた上で、さらにプラスアルファとしてAIを活用するための機能を搭載した存在なのだ。

では、具体的にどれほどの性能向上が実感できるのか。イベントでは、インテル 技術本部部長・太田仁彦氏が登壇。実際に3年前に発売された「第8世代インテル® Core™プロセッサー」搭載PCと、最新のインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ2）を搭載したAI PCとの比較が行われた。

デモンストレーションでは、100ページのPowerPointファイルをPDFに変換。その結果、あっという間に作業を終えた最新のAI PCに対して、3年前のPCは数十秒の遅れが出た。

「たった数十秒と思われるかもしれませんが、日々の業務の積み重ねでは、この差が大きな違いとして表れます。一日のうちに何回アプリケーションを起動するのか、そこからデータを持ってきて、どれくらい加工したり編集したりするのか。そうした作業の一つひとつを考えれば、PCの性能差が生産性に大きく影響することは明らかでしょう」（太田氏）

3年前のPCも決して低性能というわけではない。しかし、AIの盛り上がりにより後押しされたAI PCの性能向上には目を見張るものがある。太田氏によると、両者には生産性において最大20％、バッテリー駆動時間において約2倍の差があるという。

AI PCは比較的新しい概念であるが、実際にはAI PCはさらに進化し、性能的にも円熟しつつある。

折しも、Windows10のサポート終了が2025年10月に迫っており、多くの企業がPCのリプレイスに取り掛かっている。AI PCが本格的に普及し始める時期と、企業のPCリプレイスの時期が重なったことで、今まさに起きているのが上野氏の言う「特需」なのだ。

「グローバルではすでに20％がAI PCに置き換わっています。日本は少し遅れて17％といったところ。今年は、この数字が41％までいくと予測しています」（上野氏）

Intel vPro® プラットフォームがもたらした中小企業のDX

AI PCの販売戦略において重要となるのは性能だけではない。具体的にどういうユースケースがあるのかを提示することが有効だ。

この点についても、すでにいくつもの事例が生まれている。

たとえば、イベントにも登壇したカタオカの事例だ。同社は広島県尾道市で水産塩干物・海産物の製造卸売事業を営む中小企業。同社が恩恵を受けていると話すのが、ハードウェアベースで高いセキュリティ機能とリモート管理機能を提供するIntel vPro® プラットフォームである。

同社ではイベントに登壇した大﨑一樹氏が“一人情シス”のような形でシステムを担当している。本社や工場、倉庫でシステム関係のトラブルが起きた場合、以前は大﨑氏が現場に直接足を運んで対応していたという。というのも、現場担当者はPCに詳しいわけではないため、電話等では状況を正確に伝えられないからだ。

さらに工場に入るには、衛生面からクリーンルーム並みの身支度が必要となる。そのため、本社のそばにあるにもかかわらず工場に入るのに最短で20分もの時間がかかっていた。

「そんな日常を変えてくれたのが、Intel vPro® プラットフォームでした。本社にいながら遠隔操作でPCに入って、PCの内部を把握してトラブルに対応できるようになりましたし、リモート操作で業務時間外にWindows Updateもできます。工場のラインの停止時間短縮にも貢献できたし、スピード感が上がりました」（大﨑氏）

OSのアップデートはセキュリティ対策の面からも重要だ。リモートによる一斉アップデートが可能なIntel vPro® プラットフォームなら、これまでのように工場や倉庫を訪れ、一台一台アップデート作業する必要もなくなるのだ。

また、AI PCはその他のあらゆる作業を快適にしてくれたと大﨑氏は言う。

「プログラミングや生成AIの活用、Officeソフトなど、私が業務で行うさまざまな作業において、AI PCの処理能力は非常に高くストレスなく使えています。 たとえばオンライン会議でも（背景のぼかし処理などに）AIが活用されており、そこに対する電力消費は非常に大きいわけですが、NPUを搭載したAI PCならレスポンスも早く快適です。AI PCのバッテリー駆動時間はとても長く、電源ケーブルを持ち歩くストレスからも解放されました」（大﨑氏）

トレンドマイクロとの協業でセキュリティも万全に

大﨑氏のセッションでも語られたセキュリティの重要性だが、Windows Update以外に日々の対策も大切である。

この点についても、AI PCそしてIntel vPro® プラットフォームは力を発揮する。イベントに登壇したトレンドマイクロ プラットフォームイネーブルメント部プラットフォームマーケティンググループ シニアマネージャーの塩田行宏氏は、サイバー攻撃の現状を次のように説明する。

「ランサムウェアの活動は残念ながら右肩上がりに増えており、大きな被害が出ています。日本は言語のバリアがありますが、近年はランサムウェア上陸のスピードが早まる傾向です」（塩田氏）

ランサムウェアを検知し、対策するソフトウェアをトレンドマイクロでは提供している。だが、ソフトが快適に動作するにはPCのプロセッサ性能が重要だ。

そこで効いてくるのがAI PCの高い処理性能である。塩田氏によると、AI PCで動作させることで検知能力は従来よりも24％向上。スキャン性能についても7〜10倍ものスピードが出るようになったという。いずれも、従来よりも軽快な動作で高い効果が出ているところがポイントで、業務に支障をきたすことなくセキュリティの確保が可能になるのだ。

会場内には最新のAI PCも展示されていた

都市部だけでなく地方にも注力

IT関連の動きは多くの場合、首都圏をはじめとする大都市圏に集中しがちだ。また、中小企業はどうしても大企業よりも動きが遅れる傾向にある。その結果、地方の中小企業は最も対応が遅くなり、後手に回ってしまうことも少なくない。

インテルはこの点を問題視しており、地場に根ざした中堅企業向けにPCメーカー／販売パートナープログラムを設けている。具体的にはセミナーの開催やオンライン広告を活用した広報活動を通して、地方におけるAI PCの普及を図っていく構えだ。

2025年を迎えて、いよいよ本格化するAI PCの拡大。都市圏だけでなく地方も含め、取りこぼしなく最新テクノロジーを広めていこうとする動向からも、インテルの熱意が伝わってくる。

This article is published in part by excerpts and edits based on the interview with Laura Flick, creator of ""You are Loved Templates.""

I have been trying and error about how to maintain productivity. After that, I devised the spreadsheet ""Habit Tracker"" that helps me stay focused and put tasks down, no matter how small.

My starting point for my career is camera technicians who work from 9am to 6pm. I continued the job for about a year and a half, but then burned out and quit. I had no time for my private life, I didn't want to wake up in the morning and go to work, I had a lot of overtime, and the work was tough. It wasn't the job I was really looking for.

Habit Trackers that can be used to reflect

After resigning, he tried new things such as dropshipping and cryptocurrency in order to become independent and self-employed. I've been using spreadsheets a lot since I was in high school, so I decided to use my skills in that area to sell spreadsheet templates online.

I started using spreadsheets in my personal life only after understanding the characteristics of my brain. Until then, I had been struggling with the question of how to stay productive. I was always frustrated by my lack of productivity, feeling helpless and miserable.

However, rather than fighting your own brain, you made sure you understand and act on your brain's traits, and the first spreadsheet was born. That's the Habit Tracker.

I've always thought I was stupid. My grades were poor in school, I hardly did my homework, and I couldn't concentrate on my classes. However, using a Habit Tracker allows you to look back at yourself, no matter how small, and even adjust your course.",businessinsider

Oishii Farm, which produces and sells high-quality strawberries in a completely closed ""plant factory,"" has launched its first M&A (mergers and acquisitions) in an attempt to significantly reduce labor costs.

On March 25th, it announced that it had made a strategic acquisition of Tortuga AgTech, the largest American startup company that is the auto-harvesting robot. Specifically, the company has transferred some of its major intellectual property and related assets, and welcomed employees of the company, mainly engineers. The acquisition price is not disclosed.

Oishii Farm CEO Koga Daiki said on the effectiveness of this strategic acquisition.

""By the end of 2025, we aim to reduce labor costs associated with harvests by more than 50%. Labor costs are the largest production costs for strawberry plant factories. The fact that the harvest costs, which account for the majority, will be reduced by more than 50%, will have a huge impact on the whole.""

He said.

Oishii Farm is the only one in the world that has successfully mass-produced fruit plants through its plant factory. The company's cumulative funding amounts to approximately 28.5 billion yen. By staying one step further in terms of cost, we will further accelerate our solo career.

Acquire industry-leading technical capabilities and talent

Tortuga Agtech's automatic harvesting robot. Image: Oishii Farm

Since its founding in 2016, Tortuga Agtech has raised more than $55 million (approximately 8.2 billion yen) from leading VCs and has developed automatic strawberry and grape harvesting technology.

""Tortuga Agtech is the number one in the industry in terms of the number of robots we own and the track record of harvesting strawberries. We also have our own unique automatic harvesting technology, but the company's technology and data, which has been specialized in this area, is overwhelming, and there are a lot of things we can get,"" Koga said.

The acquisition will not only allow Tortuga Agtech to acquire the data accumulated by the company, but it will also allow for further advances in the entire automated harvesting technology, including a more accurate judgment on harvesting times and delicate techniques to harvest the surrounding strawberries without damaging them.

Not only technology, but also acquiring talent was a major factor.

""The engineering team that supports the company's technology is extremely talented, and many people have doctoral programs at top graduate schools such as MIT and Harvard. It is extremely difficult to recruit such level personnel from scratch on this scale. This was also a major purpose for the acquisition,"" Koga said.

Agreed in just 1-2 weeks

In fact, Koga said he once spoke with the CEO of Tortuga Agtech four or five years ago. This was when Oishii Farm was considering whether to develop its own automated harvesting technology or procure it from outside.

""We interviewed several companies, including the company, but at the time, Tortuga Agtech was mainly for greenhouse solutions and plant factories were not the target. That's why we decided to develop our own company,"" Koga said.

After that, Oishii Farm has successfully mass-produced fruit plants and strawberries that can be sold at high prices, making it one of the most popular spots in the agritech world. In February 2024, the company also raised large-scale funds worth over 20 billion yen.

As it has grown to be a much different presence than it had been a few years ago, it is said that an agreement was reached this time only one or two weeks after Oishii Farm's offer was reached.

""I think it's a sense of speed that can only be achieved by startups, but it was also important that the missions of both companies were basically consistent. We want to update agriculture and provide more sustainable, high quality products at a cheaper price to more people,"" Koga said.

According to Koga, as the fundraising market is chilling globally, the agricultural sector is becoming more and more demanding for a volume similar to deep tech, and more companies are struggling to raise funds. Tortuga Agtech was also facing this situation.

""The interests of both parties were aligned, with Tortuga, which had great technology but suffered from market conditions, and Oishii Farm, which aims to overcome the market conditions and accelerate further technological innovation. I think it was a very good acquisition for both parties,"" Koga.",businessinsider

BYDは17日、1秒あたり航続距離で2キロメートルに相当する超高速充電を行えるEV用の新型プラットフォーム（車体）を発表した。

電池材料や冷却技術を改良し、従来より高出力の1000キロワットでの充電に対応することで、5分間で最大400キロメートル分の充電を可能にしたという。

新型プラットフォームは4月に発売するセダン「漢L」と、SUV「唐L」の2車種に搭載する。

急速充電をするには高出力の充電設備が必要になるため、BYDは最大出力1360キロワットの充電システムを中国全土4000カ所以上に整備する計画も発表した。

充電の様子を取材した中国テック系メディアの36Krによると、漢Lの電池残量は5分の充電で7％から62％に上昇し、「携帯の充電より速かった」という。

BYDの王伝福董事長は発表の場で、「油と電気を同じスピードで充電できる時代が来た」と強調した。この発言は同社が1年前に打ち出したスローガン「電比油低」（EVはガソリン車より安い）を踏まえたものだ。

BYDは2024年2月、売れ筋の低価格車種「秦PLUS」を大幅に値下げした。その後、中国では価格競争が激化し、ホンダや日産などガソリン車を主力とする外資ブランドの多くが打撃を受けた。

低価格車種にもADAS

BYDは低価格車種にもADASを搭載すると発表した。 Reuter

急速充電プラットフォームを発表した翌18日、香港市場に上場するBYDの株価は過去最高値を更新した。同社の株価は今年に入って30％以上上昇している。

香港市場は、トランプ大統領就任以降の資金の逃避先となっているほか、DeepSeekフィーバーの後押しもあってこの数カ月上昇が続いているので、BYDはその恩恵を受けている面もある。また充電設備の整備はこれからなので、急速充電プラットフォームの開発が直ちに販売増に直結するわけではない。

より販売への貢献が見込まれそうなのは、BYDが低価格モデルにも先進運転支援システムの搭載を始めたことだろう。

BYDは2月10日、運転や駐車などを補助する先進運転支援システム（ADAS）をほぼ全ての車種に搭載すると表明した。

自社の運転支援技術をA、B、Cの3グレードに分け、以下のように展開する。

A：高精度センサーLiDAR3台と米NVIDIAのチップ「Orin-X」を2つ搭載。 搭載車種：最上級ブランド「仰望」 B：LiDAR1～2台、Orin-Xを1つ。 搭載車種：騰勢（Denza）とBYDブランド上位モデル。 C：LiDARは非搭載。代わりに5つのミリ波レーダーと12個のカメラを備える。NOA（Navigation on Autopilot：ナビゲーション・オン・オートパイロット）を採用し、高速道路での運転支援や自動駐車を行う。 搭載車種：BYDブランド低価格モデル

20万元（1円＝20.6円で計算、約410万円）を超える車種には多くのメーカーが既にADASを搭載しており、今回の発表の目玉は「C」の部分だ。

筆者作成

NOAは中国で普及が進むADASの一種で、自動運転「レベル2」に相当する。システムが自動で運転し、車線変更や追い越しも可能だが、運転者による監視が不可欠となる。

BYDはCレベルのADASを「海洋シリーズ」「王朝シリーズ」を中心に21車種に搭載すると発表した。6万9800元～（約140万円～）の小型車「海鴎（シーガル）」、7万9800元～（約160万円～）の「海豹（シール）」など、10万元を切る低価格の主力モデルにもADASを搭載し、かつ価格は据え置く。

王伝福会長は「2～3年後に、ADASはシートベルトやエアバッグのような当たり前の装備になる」と述べ、2025年を自動運転の大衆化元年にするとの決意を表明した。

BYDは3月に入って、ADASを搭載した海洋シリーズ車種のプロモーションを強化している。

同じ自動車でも高価格帯と低価格帯では消費者が異なる。2024年にBYDが仕掛けた価格競争は特に200～300万円台のガソリン車に大打撃を与えた。今回のADAS搭載も、元々搭載が進んでいる中～高価格帯市場への影響は少なく、やはり150～300万円台で勝負している他メーカーの脅威になるだろう。

中国でも不振のテスラ

テスラは中国での販売が急減している。 Reuter

BYDがベンチマークにしてきたテスラはどうなっているのか。

アメリカではトランプ政権入りしたイーロン・マスクCEOの強硬策への反発が高まり、消費者によるテスラの不買運動が拡大している。株価の下落にも歯止めがかからない。

テスラは中国でも振るわない。中国の乗用車市場信息聯席会（CPCA）によると、テスラの中国製EVの2025年1月の販売台数は前年同月比11.5％減の6万3238台、2月は同49%減の3万688台まで落ち込んだ。

同社は1月にSUV「モデルY」の改良版の受注を始め、過渡期であることも関係しているだろうが、CPCAが公表した1～2月の中国乗用車販売台数が同1.3％増であることを考えると、苦戦しているのは間違いない。

テスラも先進運転支援システム「FSD（フルセルフドライビング）」の中国導入を急いでおり、今月17日から1カ月限定で、無料トライアルを実施している。

つい先日には、同社が上海工場で2026年からモデルYの廉価版の量産を始める方針が欧米メディアに報道された。

株価では対照的なトレンドになっているテスラとBYD。2024年のEV販売台数も2万台にまで差が縮まっている。テスラの想定以上の不振もあって、2025年はBYDのテスラ越えが実現する年になるのかもしれない。

取材に応じた3人の個人投資家に共通するのは、良く言えば型破りな、悪く言えば物議を醸しやすいマスク氏の性質を踏まえて、テスラ株の売却に至ったことだ。

パブリック・リレーション（PR）戦略スペシャリストとして活躍するミカエラ・デラハンティ氏は、2023年8月に初めてテスラ株を購入し、ちょうど1年後の2024年8月に売却した。

「イーロンがトランプと手を組み始めたのを見て、私は（仕事柄）ブランディングの視点から考えてしまいました。典型的なテスラの顧客、テスラ車の購入者にとって、この動きはどう映り、どんな影響を及ぼすのだろうか、と」

企業を顧客とするプロマジシャンのダン・チャン氏は、大統領就任式を直後に控えた1月初旬にテスラ株を売却した。マスク氏の組織リーダーとしてのあり方、さらには政治活動への関与が決定打になったという。

チャン氏はマスク氏とは旧知の仲。チャン氏は決済大手ペイパル（PayPal）の創業時、初期従業員として勤務していたが、当時同社を経営していたのがマスク氏だった。

著名投資家ピーター・ティール氏が創業したコンフィニティ（Confinity）と、マスク氏設立のエックス・ドットコム（X.com）が合併して誕生したのが現在のペイパルで、マスク氏は短期間ながらCEOを務め、2000年秋に解任された。取締役会にマスク氏追放を求めた従業員の嘆願書にはチャン氏も署名した。

トランプ氏に巨額の選挙活動資金を提供したり、米政府効率化省（DOGE）の設立を持ちかけたり、マスク氏が政治活動への関与を深めたことが、チャン氏がテスラ株売却を決断する「最後のひと押し」になったという。

（チャン氏のよく知る）マスク氏の組織リーダーとしてのあり方、トランプ大統領との協力関係が投資家の信頼を揺るがし、結果として株価は下落すると考えたチャン氏はポジションの解消に動いた。

なお、Business Insider編集部が確認した投資口座などの資料によれば、チャン氏は2016年に初めてテスラ株を投資ポートフォリオに組み入れ、1900％超（！）のリターンを得ている。

チャン氏は、マスク氏の米政府効率化省の責任者としての発言や行動がペイパル時代のそれとオーバーラップして見えると語る。

「イーロンがペイパルを追い出された一番の理由は、手元資金が減っていっている時にプログラミング言語の大規模移行をしようと言い出したこと。あまりに軽率なのです。 それは政府にとっても良くないことです。一度言ったことをすぐに取り消してまた別のことを言う、そんな朝令暮改が日常茶飯事のリーダーの下で、職を失うかもしれない不安に追い立てられながら仕事をしていては、目の前のことに集中できるわけがありません」

企業オーナーのジョナサン・グッドマン氏は、テスラを電気自動車業界の成長をけん引するリーダー企業と確信してパンデミックの最中に株式を購入した。

グッドマン氏は当初、マスク氏の何事にもストレートな言動や行動が株価にとってはプラスに働くと考えていた。

しかし、トランプ大統領との関係が（大統領選が終わっても）切れずに続いてやがては共鳴し合うようになり、グッドマン氏も最終的にテスラ株を手放すことに決めたという。

「（企業の情報発信を担う）優秀なスポークスマンを私は尊敬します。イーロンはこれまでいくつもの取り組みについて、スポークスマンとして非常に素晴らしい成果を残してきました。 宇宙開発企業のSpace X（スペースエックス）、人工知能開発のxAI（エックスエーアイ）、そしてテスラ。いずれも業界や人類を前進させる重要な取り組みばかりです」

それほどに高くマスク氏を評価してきたにも関わらず、グッドマン氏はテスラ株を売却した。それは、1月20日のトランプ大統領就任初日の祝賀イベントに参加したマスク氏が、壇上でナチス・ドイツの敬礼を彷彿とさせるジェスチャーを繰り返し見せたからだった。

問題はマスク氏の人格だけ？

グッドマン氏にとって、マスク氏の人格はテスラ株の処分を決断する唯一の要因だった。株式を手放した今も、テスラのビジネスモデルそのものは堅実だと考えている。

「もし明日イーロンがテスラを去ったら、株を買い戻すと思います」

一方、最初の二人（デラハンティ氏とチャン氏）がテスラ株の売却を決めたのは、必ずしもマスク氏の言動や行動だけが要因ではなかった。

デラハンティ氏はこう語る。

「リコール（回収・無償修理）が目につくようになったのです。メモリや車載電池の不具合を理由とするリコールが相次いで、これはマズいことになると考えるようになりました」

直近では3月にも、電動ピックアップ「サイバートラック（Cybertruck）」の外装剥落が後続車の事故につながるとして4万6000台強をリコールすると発表している。

デラハンティ氏はこうした車両品質の問題とトランプ大統領との政治的関係の生み出す問題を併せて考えた結果、消費者にとってのテスラの魅力は今後失われていくと結論した。

チャン氏も同じくテスラ車の品質に対する懸念から、株価の先行きを弱気と考えるに至った。より具体的に言えば、先進運転支援システム『フルセルフドライビング（FSD）』とその延長上にある完全自動運転機能を、チャン氏は肯定的に評価できずにいた。

マスク氏が自動運転技術の開発において安全（確保）メカニズムをさほど重要視しておらず、コスト抑制のために対策不十分のまま市場投入するのではとの疑念が消えなかった。

デラハンティ氏がポジションを解消した後、テスラを強気とするトレンドが強まったものの、彼女は（12月の）ピークを迎えるかなり前に株式を売却したことを後悔していない。

「信頼のおける報道機関や投資家がさんざん強気と持ち上げたテスラ株が、今こうして深刻なボラティリティの嵐の中にいるのを興味深く眺めています。私は自分の判断したタイミングで売却できて本当に良かったと思っています」",businessinsider

製薬業界は、生成AIによる医薬品開発での生産性向上を通じ、毎年数百億ドルの節約ができるかもしれない。

免疫抑制剤ステララ（Stelara）や多発性骨髄腫治療薬ダルザレックス（Darzalex）のような治療薬メーカーであるジョンソン・エンド・ジョンソンは、10年近く従来型のAIを使ってきた。使用例としては、外科医の手技をガイドしたり、創薬をスピードアップしたり、医薬品メーカーの在庫管理を効率化したりするAI対応ソフトウェアツールなどだ。

2023年、同社はAI、データサイエンス、その他の新興テクノロジーに焦点を当てた6週間のデジタル・イマージョン・プログラムを試験的に実施した。2024年は2500人以上の社員が参加し、毎週90分の授業を受けたが、ジョンソン・エンド・ジョンソンは2025年、さらなる拡大を計画している。

スワンソンはBusiness Insiderの取材に対し、企業のリーダーが技術リテラシーを促進する文化を作ることは重要なことだという。

「私たちには135年の歴史があります。今の時代にあった最新の状態を維持するため、過去何度も内部で改革をしてこなければなりませんでした」（スワンソン）

製薬大手、メルクの初期のジェネレーティブAI投資には、GPTealと呼ばれる独自のプラットフォームの開発が含まれていた。HPVワクチン「ガーダシル（Gardasil）」や免疫療法薬「キイトルーダ(Keytruda)」を手がけるメルクは、GPTealによって、OpenAIのChatGPT、メタ（Meta）のLlama」、アンスロピック（Anthropic）のClaudeといった大規模な言語モデルに従業員がアクセスできるようになったが、企業データを外部に出さないようセキュリティを保つことも可能だという。

従業員は電子メールやメモの下書き、その他の生産性重視のタスクに生成AIを使っているが、メルクがこれからやろうとしていることはさらに大胆なものだ。

メルクのシニア・バイスプレジデント兼最高技術責任者（CTO）のロン・キム（Ron Kim）は、「今後私たちに必要なのは、ビジネスに劇的な影響を与えるユースケースを特定し、実装し、追跡し、測定すること、というのは明らかです」と語る。

ジェネレーティブAIによって、メルクの従業員はよりインパクトの大きいタスクに集中する時間を増やすことができる。例えば創薬では、ジェネレーティブAIが、保健当局に提出する規制文書の下書きのサポートが可能だ。

「科学者の何人かは、コピーエディター（校正者）として時間を取られているようにこれまで感じていました。そうした仕事というのは、彼らが訓練されてきたことではありませんから」（キム）

キムは、5万人以上のメルク社員がGPTealを常に使っていると述べた。同社は、セルフサービスのデジタルトレーニングコース、ジェネレーティブAIに焦点を当てた毎月のウェブキャスト、半日から10日間にわたるソフトウェア開発者向けのブートキャンプを組み合わせることで、社員のスキルアップをサポートしている。

さまざまな規模の製薬会社にアピールするAI

ブルー・アース・セラピューティクス（Blue Earth Therapeutics）の最高医学責任者であるダニエル・スティーブンス（Daniel Stevens）博士は、臨床段階の放射性医薬品会社である同社にとってAIは魅力的であると語る。なぜなら、2021年創業の小規模なスタートップとしては、どのように資金を使うかについて賢明であるべきだからだ。

「人工知能の応用というのは、私たちの効率化目標に役立つかもしれないので、興味があります」（スティーブンス）

同社は、ヘルスケア投資会社ソレウス・キャピタル（Soleus Capital）と画像診断会社ブラッコ・ダイアグノスティックス（Bracco Diagnostics）からの資金を含む7650万ドル（約114億円､1ドル＝149円換算）のシリーズAを2024年10月に実施したが、その主な目的は、新しい前立腺がん治療法の安全性と有効性を評価する臨床試験を支援することだった。

スティーブンスによると、ブルーアース社のフルタイム従業員はわずか20人しかいないため、AIのスキルアップトレーニングを提供する必要はまだないという。同氏は、ブルーアースの従業員数が増え、この技術に関する指導を行う準備が整えば、外部ベンダーによるオンラインコースやAI認定資格を利用する予定だという。

抗うつ薬「プロザック(Prozac)」や2型糖尿病・体重減少薬「モンジャロ（Mounjaro）」などの治療薬を手がける製薬大手イーライリリーは、低分子・高分子両方の研究をサポートするためにジェネレーティブAIを活用している。同社はまた、臨床試験用の文書を作成し、規制当局に提出する資料を作成するためにもAIを利用している。

ChatGPTがサービスを開始した後、アップル（Apple）やアマゾン(Amazon）などの大手企業は、データプライバシーに対する懸念を理由に、人気のあるチャットボットの従業員の使用を制限した。イーライリリーの最高情報・デジタル責任者であるディオゴ・ラウ（Diogo Rau）は、「我々は真逆の方向に進んでいます」と語る。

ラウは、会社の機密情報を外部にさらすことなく、まるでGoogle検索を使うようにAIツールを使うよう、イーライリリーの従業員に呼びかけたという。

「ChatGPTを業務に取り入れる必要がある、と全員に伝えました。しかし、外部に漏らしたくないものは何も入れてはいけないと 」（ラウ）

同社はまた、パリで開催される夏季オリンピックに合わせて「AIゲーム」コンテストを開催し、社内の関心を高めようとした。コンテストでは、チャットボットを使って同僚にメッセージを書いたり、生成AIを使ってイーライリリーの歴史に関するクイズを作ったりした。

2024年、イーライリリーは全従業員と管理職に対して、年末のレビューにジェネレーティブAIを使用することも奨励している。2025年、同社はすべての上級リーダーと管理職にAI資格の取得を義務付ける予定だ。

""In the last few years, we've been working on commercializing the classics that everyone has eaten with a little surprise.""

Suzuki Takayoshi, vice-president of the Sweets Department of FamilyMart's Product Headquarters, said at the beginning of the press conference.

On March 24, FamilyMart announced that it will be adding three new products to FamilyMart's ""Fresh Bread"" series, which has sold over 260 million units since its release in 2023, three new products: ""White Raw Koppepan (Tsuboku Strawberry & White Chocolate),"", ""White Raw Croissant (Double Raw Chocolate),"" and ""White Raw French Bread (Double Condensed Milk Milk)"". It will be sold at approximately 16,300 FamilyMart stores nationwide from the 25th. All prices are 168 yen including tax.

The white bread series will be sold at Family Marts nationwide from March 25th. There are three types: white raw koppepan (small strawberries and white chocolate), white croissants (double raw chocolate), and white raw French bread (double condensed milk milk from Hokkaido).

FamilyMart's bread business sales for 2024 hit a record high following in 2023. The number has grown to about 113% compared to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began to slow down customers.

At the 2025 Bread category strategy and policy briefing, new products were announced, and the bread business policy was discussed.

Suzuki said, ""We have taken great care in response to the growing popularity of white products and trends that emphasize texture and appearance other than taste,"" and explained the background to the new product being introduced into the new white bread series.

The strong performance of the ""Raw"" series is one of the factors driving the strong performance of FamilyMart's bread business in recent years. In addition to this, Suzuki said the pillars of growth are ""price strategy"" and ""acquiring new customers through sweet bread.""

As for pricing strategy, FamilyMart is conscious of balanced lineups of low, medium and high-priced products. Even though prices for all kinds of products continue to rise these days, he says that they are able to better grasp consumer needs.

""No matter how much the raw materials are high, customers won't understand that they will raise prices in an affordable price range. It is very sad for us to leave the store empty-handed even if a customer comes to the store. While maintaining the low price, we will expand the price even more luxuriously, and aim to become a store where every consumer can find the bread they want."" (Mr. Suzuki)

The company plans to continue to increase sales through its product range while maintaining pricing that will prevent consumers from leaving.

The price of raw materials is similar to bread, but bag bread is one of the cheapest products in FamilyMart.

""I think it will be the last resort. I want to maintain the low price range,"" Suzuki said.

As a high-priced product, the sweet bread that was developed in 2024 with famous pastry chef Chef Yasushoku Yuji, contributed to sales. Although it is a high price for bread at 185 yen including tax, it also has a ""good value-performance"" that combines both food and sweets, which is said to have led to the support of female consumers in particular.

https://businessinsider.com,Tesla's sales will increase as a tailwind after Musk's political activities. Latest analysis of TD Cowen,https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/tesla-stock-elon-musk-politics-sales-selloff-upgrade-ev-trump-2025-3/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Stock prices have been declining since hitting a record high in mid-December, and at this point (closing price on March 21st), the decline has spread to around 48%. The market capitalization, which was up to $1.5 trillion, has shrunk to around $780 billion.

The direct cause of this slump is Musk's political involvement mentioned at the beginning.

He provided huge amounts of funds to Trump in the presidential election last November, and since the launch of the second Trump administration, he was the head of the newly established US Department of Efficiency (DOGE), and has pioneered debate with numerous actions that fueled political conflict, including sudden dismantling of government agencies and unannounced inbound inspections, and supporting German far-right parties that advocate for immigration.

Still, TD Cowen analyst Itai Micheli pointed out that Musk's moves will be a tailwind for Tesla in the future.

""There are things that people who are concerned about Tesla's future are overlooked: Tesla loses share in counties with more Democrats (due to Musk's political activities), while increasing share in groups with more Republicans. It will take some time, but Tesla can expect a significant increase in sales.""

TE Cowen has kept Tesla's investment decision unchanged, with its target stock price of $388.

EVs spread in Republican support areas

Tesla has gained fame as a pioneer in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and has expanded sales, particularly in the liberal area, which is the Democratic support base.

However, as Musk rose to conservative stardom throughout the November 2024 presidential election, Tesla's brand is beginning to be eroded in areas that have traditionally been ""strong"" (Mikeli). In extreme cases, they are even subject to systematic boycotts and vandalism.

However, on the other hand, there are signs of growing market share in the conservative areas, which are the Republican support base. Micheli modeled the trend and created a predictive scenario and found it could bring Tesla's business to light.

""If the situation continues at stake, Tesla will certainly face headwinds before the tailwinds blow. So this is not the case for a demand forecast for the first quarter (January to March), where severe results are expected. Instead, our analysis is on a multi-year basis, and it could potentially increase sales in areas where EV penetration was previously low, offsetting losses in areas that are currently strongholds, generating profits.""

According to UD Cowen's basic scenario, Tesla's medium- to long-term sales will decline by 22-28% in Democratic-backed counties, totaling 105,000 units, but EV penetration rates will rise to 9.7% in Republican-backed counties, while Tesla's sales will increase by 107,000 units.

The changes that this trend will bring are also positive for Tesla's competitors, with General Motors, Hyundai and Ford EVs benefiting.

Wall Street's investment decisions are divided

The bright outlook for Tesla, Micheli explained, is in contrast to the successive reductions in price targets on Wall Street.

Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has recently reduced its target stock price from the previous $440 to $320. The investment decision was kept unchanged by ""outperform.""

JPMorgan Chase also lowered its target stock price to $120 in the second week of March after Tesla revised its delivery forecast significantly downwards.

JP Morgan analysts analysts analysts analysts analysts argue that Musk's political activities are ""not interesting for the left, but it's a pleasant story for the right, but the impact on Tesla's sales is negative anyway.""

Meanwhile, major investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald raised Tesla's investment rating to overweight on March 19, leaving its target stock price at $425.

With expectations rising for the Cybercab robot taxi that Musk will begin operation in Austin, Texas in June, and the Optimus humanoid robot, the bank asks technological development for reasons to be bullish on Tesla.

This has transformed Tesla into a political symbol, of course, which is not good for investors.""

Ives presented Tesla with a prescription, which was at a turning point.

""If Musk wants to bring this crisis to an end, so that the Tesla brand crisis that we've built up to this point will become snowballed over the next few years and eventually turn into a Black Swan (an unpredictable, hugely impactful extreme event), then we have to tackle two things.""

One is to explain in his own words how Musk will manage Tesla's management and role as head of the Ministry of Government Efficiency Ministry at the first quarter (January to March) earnings announcements, or at the information session, scheduled for early May.

""To continue investing in Tesla, we need to take a step back (from the current state of leaning forward to the Ministry of Government Efficiency) and make sure that Musk is balanced.""

Even if Musk takes a step back, Ives analyzes that the ""overheating"" surrounding Musk as the Ministry of Government Efficiency and its director will ""cold.""

Not everything will resolve comfortably, and although the marks engraved on the Tesla brand will not disappear easily, it is said that it will be possible to avoid a development that will prevent the damage from recovering forever.

Another is to clarify the ""roadmap of development for low-cost EVs and when to market,"" which Tesla has announced to launch within the year, and also provide a detailed perspective on the ""robotic taxi service to be launched in Texas from June.""

Ives believes that there are a lot of issues, including the complete revamp of the Model Y, the main SUV (multipurpose sports car), the issue of inventory management (surplus), and the sluggish demand due to brand damage, and investors will not be convinced unless Musk himself explains what he thinks about these issues.

Of course there are disagreements

Not all investors, like Ives, see Tesla's situation as a ""crisis"" and have a pessimistic outlook.

Tsai Capital President and Chief Investment Officer Christopher Tsai recently spoke to Business Insider and emphasized that it is important to separate Musk's behavior as director of the Ministry of Government Efficiency and his involvement at the heart of the US government (in a position to exert influence).

""Elon is in a position to form policies (in favor of Tesla's business expansion) by engaging in the government. I think negative market sentiment will eventually fade and disappear.""",businessinsider

The data (primary data) held by a company and data obtained through ∞ AI chat are automatically integrated and structured, and the medical records of each customer are generated in real time.

∞AI Customer Twin

Based on the data accumulated in ""∞AI Customer Data Hub"", virtual customer AI (customer twin) is generated, speeding up hypotheses verification and analysis of marketing measures.

∞AI MC Planning

The process of marketing communication measures such as media planning for advertising delivery, planning and effectiveness prediction for advertising copying, is implemented in a dialogue with AI agents.

∞AI CX Planning

We will create an interactive process with AI agents to create ideas for new businesses and services using customer journey design and interactive AI chat, with the aim of improving customer experience (CX).

You can conduct interviews and surveys with ""Consumer AI""

∞AI Customer Twin is an example of a trial using GDO, which operates Golf Digest Online. You can combine user persona with chat logs to create ""consumer AI"" and ask a variety of questions. Photo: Kobayashi Yutaro

The key point is that this new solution can perform tasks that previously required knowledge such as programming and complex processing using an AI agent.

Yamamoto Kaku, Dentsu Digital's CAIO (Chief AI Officer) and executive officer, who appeared at the briefing session on the 24th, defined the definition of an AI agent as a system in which users are judged and presented by trial and error, and works while listening to a database or other AI if necessary.

The practicality of AI agents is clearly seen in the use case of ""∞AI Customer Twin.""

∞AI Customer Twin creates ""AI that imitates users"" as mentioned above. The created AI allows you to ask individual questions in a chat format.

Even with general chat-based generation AI, there is a technique that improves accuracy by giving a role and ordering such as ""Answer as ⚪︎⚪︎"".

In the case of ∞AI Customer Twin, rather than making suggestions, it is fine tuned using chat logs embedded in client company websites and apps.

Therefore, Yamamoto says, ""Even if it doesn't score out of 100, it can simulate a lot of actual users.""",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,Employees aren't particularly concerned about the Tesla stock crash. Testimony from 10 people who own their own shares,https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/tesla-stock-price-drop-employees-react-2025-3/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","従業員の間に満ちている現在の空気をひと言で表現するなら、「肩をすくめてやり過ごそう」とでも言えばいいだろうか。

テスラの株価が史上最高値を更新した2024年12月前後に初めて購入した投資家なら、この急落に恐怖を感じるのも無理はない。しかし、報酬を株式で受け取って長期保有している従業員たちの目に映る景色は、短期投資家たちとは全く異なるようだ。

ある従業員からはこんな正論が聞かれた。

昨年の同時期（つまり2024年3月中旬）と比べればまだ30〜40％高い水準だし、ましてや5年前との比較なら690％も上昇していて、とんでもない水準であることに変わりはないと。

一方、それとは別の複数の従業員が、株価の変動にはあえて目を向けないようにしていると口を揃えた。その中のテキサス拠点に勤務するある従業員は「毎日株価を見ていたら気が変になるよ」と語った。

株価パフォーマンスに影響を及ぼす変数はいくつもあって、もちろんイーロン・マスク最高経営責任者（CEO）の各種行動もその一つだが、それは従業員がどうこうできるものではない（から考えても仕方がない）、というのがその従業員のスタンスだった。

そうした意見は、Business Insider編集部が直接取材していない従業員にとっても、特段違和感のないもののようだ。

テスラ社内のコミュニケーションツールには、株価の値動きをテーマに一部の従業員が意見を交換する場として利用している非公式チャンネルが存在し、そこでも（株価下落に対して）特に際立った反応はないと複数の従業員が証言する。

同チャンネルには一部の従業員と言っても数千人が参加しており、自社に関係するソーシャルメディア投稿やニュース記事を共有するのに使われているという。

ネバダ拠点に勤務するある従業員はそれらを総合して、社内には「陰うつな空気」も「危機感」も漂っていないと語った。

自社株を保有する従業員の心理

テスラにおいて株式報酬の付与は大きな役割を果たしており、それを同社の最も魅力的な特徴の一つと考えている従業員も少なくない。

マスク氏もそれをよく分かっていて、テスラの生産拠点はミリオネアを多数輩出してきたと過去に発言している（米経済誌フォーチュン、2023年11月30日付）。

従業員の中にはそれと異なる立場もある。近頃退社したある従業員はこう指摘する。

「付与された株式報酬の価値が跳ね上がって一気に富裕層の仲間入り、といったシナリオに期待してテスラで働いている従業員がいることは間違いありませんが、そういう人に限って長続きしないのが現実です」

また、別の従業員2人は、株価のボラティリティ上昇（により報酬が目減りするリスクの増大）を受け、「長期キャッシュ」型の報酬オプションを選んだことを、Business Insiderに明かした。業績を反映して決定したインセンティブ報酬を、その後数年（通常4年間）にわたって繰り延べて現金支給する仕組みという。

Business Insiderが独自入手したテスラ社内の給与関連書類（2021年時点）によると、同じテクノロジー業界や自動車業界の企業に比べてベースサラリー（基本給）は見劣りするものの、インセンティブ報酬としての株式付与が大きい。

年次報告書の記載によれば、テスラは2024年に譲渡制限付株式ユニット（RSU）で約26億9000万ドル、ストックオプション（新株予約権）で約35億ドルを従業員に付与している。

上述の長期キャッシュ型報酬を選んだ従業員2人は、自分たちを含むテスラの従業員にとって株価の変動は大きな関心事ではないと強調した。

マスク氏はデフォルトで物議を醸す存在

テスラは今、経営トップであるマスク氏のトランプ大統領との親密な間柄や、米政府効率化省（DOGE）の責任者としての発言力、影響力がハレーションを引き起こし、国民からの強い抗議とそれを要因の一つとする株価急落に直面している。

ニューヨーク・タイムズ（New York Times）はこの2月、マスク氏がX投稿でナチスの親衛隊長だったヒムラーや、総統ヒトラーの後継者と目された国家元帥のゲーリングらに不適切な形で言及したことを批判したテスラのマネジャー、ジャレッド・オットマン氏が解雇されたと報じた。

しかし、Business Insiderの取材に応じたテスラのあるエンジニアは、従業員がマスク氏についてさまざまな形で繰り返し質問を受けることに苛立ちを感じていると前置きした上で、こう語気を強めた。

「自分の会社のCEOについて考える機会って、どのくらいありますか？CEOの行動に個人的に責任を負っているって考えてますか？」

そのように社内にはさまざまな意見や見方があるものの、取材に応じた10人の従業員のうち8人が口を揃えたのは、会社の先行きはおおむね安泰だろう、ということだった。

Advertisement

イギリスの金融ベンチャー・Revolut（レボリュート）は3月25日、日本で子ども向けサービスを開始する。

対象は6～17歳で、保護者が子どものお金の使い方を管理でき、お互いの金融リテラシーを高めるための工夫が凝らされたサービスとなっている。

日本では、キャッシュレス比率が4割に達してきているが、まだ十分に浸透しているとは言えず、子どもを対象にしたサービスも少ない。Revolutの新サービスはどのように日本市場に食い込もうとしているか解説しよう。

親が管理できる「子ども用」金融サービス

Revolutの新サービスは、「6～17歳向けRevolut」と表現されている。国外ではすでに20カ国で提供されており、ユーザー数は約500万人。

以前は「Junior（ジュニア）」というサービス名も使われていたが、対象年齢が幅広いことから「Revolut ＜18」（Under 18＝18歳未満）というサービス名に変わり、さらに今後は「Revolut for Kids & Teens」というサービス名に変更していくという。

Advertisement

ただし、日本では対象年齢を示す「6～17歳向けRevolut」という表現になった。これは厳密にはサービス名ではなく、あくまでサービス名は単に「Revolut」になる。

利用には既存のRevolutアプリではなく、黄色いアイコンが目印となる子ども向けのRevolutアプリをインストールする。

アプリを有効化するには子ども用のアカウントが必要だが、子ども用のアカウントは、保護者のサブアカウントという位置づけで、アカウント作成には保護者のRevolutアカウントも必要になっている。

Revolutには無料のスタンダードプランと、有料プラン2種類があるが、スタンダードプランでは1人分、プレミアムプラン（月額980円）では2人分、メタルプラン（月額1980円）では5人分の子ども用アカウントを紐づけられる。

保護者向けの通常のRevolutアプリでは、メイン画面を左右にスワイプすると、複数の通貨の残高が切り替わって表示される。

子ども用アカウントのセットアップが完了すると、その残高のリストの中に子どものアカウントの残高も表示される。子どもの残高のメニューから保護者は送金でき、残高や利用履歴を把握できる。

保護者からは「おこづかい」として定期的にお金を送ることも、任意のタイミングで送ることもできる。定期送金の場合は「週ごとの指定曜日」に送金ができる。

保護者側から発行したカードの停止やATMの利用禁止など、通常のRevolutのセキュリティー機能も設定が可能。

子ども側の機能としては、決済利用、利用履歴の管理、Revolutユーザーへの送金などが用意されている。ただし、親以外への送金は13歳以上のユーザーでないとできない。

子どもが残高を決済に使いたい時、Visaブランドの物理カード発行が必要になる（発送料500円）。物理カードのアクティベーションをすれば、Apple Pay、Google Payへの登録も可能。

通常アカウントのRevolutだと物理カードを発行せず、バーチャルカードを発行してネットやVisaのタッチ決済対応の実店舗で利用ができるが、6～17歳向けRevolutのサービス開始当初は物理カードの発行が必須となる。

Revolut広報によると、6～17歳向けRevolutでのバーチャルカードのみの発行は「今後提供予定」。

Revolutと言えば、海外での利用シーンの印象も強く、子ども用アカウントでも海外利用は可能。ただし、外貨への両替はできないので、決済時の為替レートで日本円から引き落とされる仕組み。

物理カードの発行も可能。このイエローが6～17歳向けRevolutの特徴のようだ。「Wow」のイラストはカスタマイズ（700円）機能を利用したもの。 撮影：小林優多郎

ポイントは、保護者が子どもの利用履歴を確認できるという点だ。保護者は自分のアカウントから子どもの状況を確認できるため、使いすぎや不審な利用にリアルタイムに気付ける。

セキュリティーも基本的に親が管理する形で、子どもが送金する場合、初めての送金先にはまず保護者アカウントでの承認が必要になる。もちろん、送金履歴もリアルタイムで保護者が確認可能。

なお。海外版では提供されている「貯金機能」に関しては提供されない。これは日本では資金移動業であり、貯蓄サービスを提供できないためだ。

日本は遅れている「金融リテラシー教育」

こうしたRevolutのサービスについて、「日本での金融リテラシーの向上を見据え、単なる親子向けのサービスというだけでなく、アナログ面でのコミュニケーションによる見守りもできる」と同社オペレーション部ストラテジー & オペレーション マネジャーのYidi Li氏は指摘する。

日本では、家庭や学校での金融教育が遅れていると長く言われてきた。

金融広報中央委員会が2016年に実施した「金融リテラシー調査（2016）」によると、「学校等で金融教育を受けたと認識している人の割合」は6.6％、家庭では19.8％だった。これが2022年の調査では、それぞれ7.1％、18.4％と、家庭では減ってしまっている。

2016年の金融教育の経験を聞いた調査の回答。学校では6.6％、家庭では19.8％だった。2022年になると7.1％、18.4％となり、多く変動はしていない。アメリカも学校で19％から20％になったのであまり増えていないが、日本との差は大きい。 出典：金融広報中央委員会

アメリカの学校教育では金融教育を受けた割合が20％に達しており、日本の約3倍となっている。

さらに、日本では金融知識に自信がある人が約12％にとどまるのに対して、アメリカでは71％に達していた。各種調査からも、この自信のなさによって金融教育に二の足を踏む保護者が多い。

2025年3月17日から21日まで、カリフォルニア州サンノゼで「テック業界のスーパーボウル」とも言えるエヌビディア（Nvidia）のGTC（GPU Technology Conference）が開催され、世界中から集まった多くの人々は最新技術に驚きの声を上げた。

エヌビディアは2009年からGTCを開催しているが、15年でその規模は大きく拡大し、半導体やアクセラレーテッド コンピューティング、AI（人工知能）だけではなく、ロボティクス、自動運転車、電気自動車、さらには量子コンピューティングなどの未来のテクノロジーも紹介されるようになった。

「GTCの雰囲気が変わったと感じている人が多い」と、エヌビディアのジェンスン・フアン（Jensen Huang）CEOは3月20日の記者会見で語った。

彼の言う通り、そのイベントは確かに変わっていた。もし2025年のGTCに参加できなかったのなら、あなたが見逃したことを以下で紹介しよう。

AIは今や大きなビジネスで、賭け金も高い

2024年のGTCの基調講演では、ジェンスン・フアンは「収益」という言葉を一度しか使わなかった。だが2025年は10回もそのことについて言及した。「エヌビディアだけでなく、AIエコシステムに関わるすべての人々が利益を上げる時が来た」というのが彼のメッセージだった。

フアンは今回の基調講演で、エヌビディアがチップメーカーから、いわゆる「AI工場」を販売するAIインフラ企業へと進化したことを強調した。

AI工場は知能を生み出す場所であり、最も効率よく生産可能な工場が最も成功するべきだとフアンは説明した。彼は各企業のAI工場の質はその企業の収益に大きな影響を与えると話しており、これはテック業界に限らずどの業界にも当てはまることだと強調した。

「すべての業界がここにある。すべての国がここにあり、すべての企業がここにあるのは、それらが成り立つためには我々の存在が必要不可欠となったからだ」と、フアンは2025年3月20日に記者団に語った。

エヌビディアはAIエコシステムの中心

エヌビディアのテクノロジーは現在のほとんどのAIのイノベーションを支えているため、AIがどこまでできるかの基準を示している。つまりエヌビディアのテクノロジーは、エンジニアたちが新しいアイデアをどのくらい実現するかに影響を与えているのだ。また、フアンが基調講演で紹介した次世代のチップは、非常に強力で速い性能を持っていると紹介され、会場の聴衆はその驚異的な性能に驚き、息を呑むような反応を示したという。

カンファレンスに参加したクラウド企業やAI開発者たちは、「チップの性能が大きく向上することで、開発者が作り上げるテクノロジーや製品にどんな影響があるのか、またインフラ関連の企業が何を準備すべきかについてはまだはっきりと分かっていない」とBusiness Insiderに語っている。そのために、フアンは同時に「複数の世代」を発表したのだと彼らは説明している。

「今では、他の企業も計画を立てやすくなった」とフアンは3月20日の記者会見で語った。

「昔はチップを作り、それを誰かが買ってコンピューターに入れ、コンピューターを売る、という単純な流れだった。しかし今、我々はAIインフラを作っており、それには一度に何千億ドルもの投資が必要だ。だから計画をしっかり立てることがとても重要になる」

AIの進化のペースは速くなっている

カンファレンス会場のサンノゼ・コンベンションセンターは、スケジュールが過密だったり、長い列が出来ていたりしたために、参加者たちの間に慌ただしい雰囲気が漂っていた。AIモデルの進化のペースも速くなっており、会場では参加者同士が話す会話や記者会見、パネルディスカッションで、「新しいテクノロジーの変化はおおよそ6カ月ごとに起きている」という話をよく耳にした。

エヌビディアのシニアディレクターであるディオン・ハリス（Dion Harris）は「日常業務で関わる最も重要な関係者は最先端の研究者たちだ」とBusiness Insiderに語った。彼らは未来に何が起こるかを最もよく理解しているため、例えば、将来的にはAIファクトリーモデルを活用し、非常に大きな価値を生み出すかもしれないという。

Advertisement

ロボットはまだ初期段階

展示会では、フアンが基調講演で話した内容を強調するかのように、さまざまな種類のロボットや自動運転車が展示されていた。

フアンはロボットを「人手不足分を補うもの」とし、すべての車を自動運転にするためのカギであり、私たちが今作り出すことのできる知能を実際に動かすために不可欠なテクノロジーだと説明した。

「物理的なAIとロボット工学は非常に速いペースで進化している。皆さん、この分野に注目してほしい。これが最も大きな産業になる可能性が十分にある」とフアンは基調講演で話した。

ロボットの未来はエヌビディアにとって重要だ。なぜなら、AIを活用して物理的な世界を理解し、3次元で行動を起こすためには膨大な計算能力が必要だからだ。そして、もしエヌビディアが今日のように計算能力の巨大企業であり続ければ、新しい産業の基盤となることで、さらにその存在感が高まることが期待されている。しかし、サンノゼ・コンベンションセンターに展示されているロボットの多くは、計算能力的にはまだ初期段階で開発途中のものが多かった。

エヌビディアは、ロボットが開発段階を早く抜け出せるようにするための無料で使える新たな「推論モデル」を2025年3月18日に発表した。この新しい仕組みを使うと、ロボットはその場で異なる仕事や環境に素早く適応できるようになるかもしれないという。

オムニバース＆シミュレーション部門のバイスプレジデントであるレヴ・レバレディアン（Rev Lebaredian）は、「これで実現可能になるだろう」と、Business Insiderに語った。

「我々はついに、このテクノロジーを中心に産業を築くことができるようになる」

量子コンピューティングがついに登場

2025年のGTCでは、かつては遠い未来の技術と見なされていた量子コンピューティング（フアン自身も2025年1月に「この技術が『非常に役立つ』ようになるまで20年はかかる」と述べ、その結果、関連企業の株価は急落した）の重要性が証明された。

エヌビディアは初の「Quantum Day（量子コンピューティング・デー）」を開催し、研究者たちが新薬の発見、新しい化合物の開発、暗号解読など、さまざまな成果が期待され、急成長している量子コンピューティングに関わるテクノロジーを紹介した。

フアンは、Quantum Dayを開始するにあたって、数カ月前に量子コンピューティングに対して懐疑的だった自分の考えが間違っていたと認め、さまざまな量子コンピューティング企業の幹部たちを迎えて量子処理がテクノロジー業界の次のフロンティアである理由を説明させた。

これまで、量子コンピューティング分野の進展は、エラー修正や、コンピューターがもっと多くの計算をこなせるようにするための技術的な課題のために遅れていた。しかし、2025年のGTCでは、マイクロソフト（Microsoft）、アマゾンウェブサービス（Amazon Web Services）、グーグル（Google）といった大手企業や、ディーウェーブ（D-Wave）、イオンキュー（IonQ）、リゲッティ・コンピューティング（Rigetti Computing）などのあまり知られていない量子コンピューティング企業が、舞台裏で進めてきたことが明らかになった。

フアンは「これはGTCで開催される多くの量子コンピューティング・デーの始まりに過ぎない」とステージ上で述べ、エヌビディアのカンファレンスがこの分野での新しい進展の場を提供し続けることを示した。

Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan said ""vibe coding"" will allow startups to maintain a minority structure.

In an interview with CNBC, he said that coding in AI can accommodate even smaller teams for bigger tasks.

Young engineers struggling in the job market should start up a startup by vibe coding.

The CEO of Silicon Valley's most popular incubator believes that ""vibe coding"" will change the way you look at a startup.

""There are people who are making $1 million to $10 million with less than 10 people, which is something that could never have happened in early stage startups,"" Y-combinator CEO Garry Tan said in an interview with CNBC.

Tan said this was partly due to Vibe coding. Vibe coding was coined by Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI, and used in a February post to X and has become a trend in Silicon Valley.

What does ""vibe coding"" mean?

""Just talk to a large language model (LLM) and you'll code the entire app,"" Tan explained.

""If there's a bug and it doesn't work, if you want to change it, or if you want to change it to a different look, you don't have to code it yourself.""

Tan seems to define this as an increasing number of cases where hard programming processes are relied on AI. Tan said vibe coding is accelerating the speed at which startups develop related software.

""There's no need to hire people to do the job, just talk directly to the LLM who coded it and they'll fix it,"" he explained.

""And it's so good that you can just accept changes without checking.""

According to Tan, vibe coding makes the entire software building process more efficient, and many startups trained by Y-combinators, who are around 81% of AI companies, are making the most of it.

""It's the first time I've ever had, but about 25% of the batch, or 95% of the code, was written by LLM,"" says Tan.

LLM's capabilities allow startups to maintain a small group of people. With full vibe coding, Tan believes that a team of 10 can achieve what's previously built by 50 or 100 engineers.

""If you really get to use cutting edge code generation tools like Cursor and Windsurf, you can literally do 10 or 100 engineers in just a day,"" he explained.",businessinsider

The Henry Passport Index ranks the ""strongest passports"" based on the number of countries that allow for visa-free travel.

In 2025, Singapore, which allows travel to 193 countries, came in first place.

Meanwhile, the US passports have access to 183 countries, ranking ninth in line with four other countries. Japan was second in line with Korea.

Americans considering visiting China, India or Venezuela during spring break should first consider getting a visa.

Some countries with some of the world's most famous spots require American citizens to obtain a visa, and some of the troublesome procedures may be required to plan their long-awaited trip abroad.

British consulting firm Henley & Partners publishes the Henley Passport Index every year. Based on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the index ranks the ""strongest passports"" by the number of countries that are eligible for visa-free travel.

American passport holders can travel to 183 countries around the world without a visa, ranking 9th in the 2025 Henry Passport Index, and four other countries rank in the same ranking as the United States. There are 29 countries ranked 9th or above, including tied rankings, boasting greater freedom of travel than American passports.

The number one place was Singapore, which allows visa-free travel to 193 countries. Japan, which has been at the top for many years, fell to second place in 190 countries, tied with South Korea.

Gold bullion (ingots) and silver coins are one of Costco's hottest items in 2024, with the store selling $200 million a month.

Costco's Chief Financial Officer said the new gold bullion sold out ""within a few hours"" after its launch, slightly above the market's trading price.

While some people have successfully used Costco membership benefits and credit card benefits to buy and resell money to make a profit in a short period of time, Taylor Huff, CEO of My Gold Advisor, told Business Insider, ""For most people, this short-term behaviour is the wrong approach.""

""Some people buy money from Costco when they don't know why or what to do,"" he says.

Huff has given us three secrets that buyers should remember when purchasing gold bullion.

1. Gold is for saving. It's not something to make a profit right away

""Purchase gold is not to make a profit.Purchase gold is to accumulate wealth and protect what you earn. It means exchanging dollars for physical assets outside the banking system.""

Gold averages around 8% per year, making it popular among people seeking hedges against inflation.

But that also means that you should plan to keep the physical gold you purchased at least a year, and if possible, for more.

As traders don't always buy at spot prices, an 8% increase will also help cover the discounts and expenses needed to sell gold bullion in cash.

Of course, the 8% figure is well below Costco's average annual return rate of around 25% over the past decade, but gold investors are often looking for a risk-free alternative than the stock market.",businessinsider

スーザン・フォン・セガーン氏は最初の遺産1万ドル（約150万円）を使ってコンバーチブルを買い、のちに家を買うために貯蓄を始めた。

その後、相続遺産を不動産と証券に投資することで、莫大な富に変えた。

昨年、新たに10万ドル（約1500万円）を相続し、それをおもに家の改修に使っている。

以下のエッセイはロサンゼルス在住の評論家兼CFOであるスーザン・フォン・セガーン氏（56歳）との会話にもとづいている。長さとわかりやすさの観点から編集を加えた。

1993年に亡くなった祖母が1万ドル（約150万円、1ドル=150円換算：以下同）を残してくれたおかげで、私はファイナンスという面で賢くなることができた。

Advertisement

死の床にあった祖母は、私たち4人の孫に豪華な料理をふるまえなくなったため、人生の終わりが近づいたある日、私たちの生活に富を授けてくれた。

私は25歳だったが、短期間しか満足できない何かにそのお金を使いたくないと考えるほどの知恵は身につけていた。

そこで、喜びが長く続くものとしてコンバーチブル（オープンカー）を買い、将来タウンハウスを買うために貯蓄をする計画を立てた。

祖母はふたりとも世界恐慌と二次大戦を経験した

祖母のふたりは、本当に必要なものにだけお金を使うよう、私の両親をしつけた。私はお金を賢く使う、あるいは投資するという考え方を、基本的な金銭感覚として身につけて育った。

20代の前半、私はロサンゼルス界隈を古い日産セントラで走り回っていた。ジオ・メトロLSIコンバーチブルが、喉から手が出るほどほしかったのだが、評論家として当時得ていた収入をそれに費やすのは不可能だと思え、代替案と言えば借金をすることぐらいだった。いずれの方法を選んだにせよ、その車を買ったときに得られる喜びよりも、リスクのほうが大きかっただろう。

祖母のひとりから1万ドルを相続したとき、私は日産を2000ドル（約30万円）で売り、相続金とその2000ドルを使ってほしかったコンバーチブルを買った。他人に勧められる車ではなく、すばらしい性能のお気に入りの車が買えて、本当にうれしかった。私は自分の望み、予算、好みを基準に車を選んだ。

1993年に車を購入後、毎月400ドルを貯蓄に回した

その後、私は決まった額（毎月400ドル［約6万円］）を、まるでそれが自動車ローンの返済であるかのように、1995年の年末まで貯金し続けた。私はミニマリスト的な生き方をしていたので、ときには賢くお金を使う工夫をするだけで、400ドル以上貯金できた。仕事で経費口座があったおかげで、飲み物、駐車場、ビジネスランチなどの代金はすべて、経費として計上することもできた。

遺産を使ってからも、経済的には順調にことが運んだ。買いたいものがある場合も、それが何であれ、お金をうまく使ったり節約したりすることで、いつのまにかそれを買うのに必要な額が貯まっていた。

車の次はマイホーム

数年間貯蓄を続けたことで2万5000ドル（約375万円）を確保できた。これで私にとって最初となる17万5000ドル（約2625万円）のマンション購入の頭金と引っ越しや家具などの費用をまかなえるようになった。私はそのマンションを17万5000ドルで1995年に買った。

私はビジネスパートナーとともにブティック系広告代理店を立ち上げて運営していたが、ドットコムバブルの崩壊と9.11同時多発テロに端を発する不況のあおりを受けて消滅することになった。マンションの価値が上がっていたため、それを担保に7万5000ドル（約1125万円）の融資を得て、そのお金を使って広告代理店の負債を清算した。

マンションの価値は40万ドル（約6000万円）近くにまで上昇し、融資額も22万5000ドル（約3375万円）にまで増加した。2007年、そのマンションを71万5000ドル（約1億725万円）で売った。祖母の遺産を相続することがなければ、そのようなことは不可能だっただろう。

代理店と銀行への支払いを済ませたあと、手元に45万ドル（約6750万円）が残っていたので、のちに婚約者となる人物の借金5万ドル（約750万円）も返済した。

Advertisement

1万ドルが40万ドルになったあとは、手を付けなかった

私は余った40万ドルを証券口座に入れて成長させることにした。コロナ禍がやってきて、市場が崩壊したとき、総資産の10％が失われた。

私たちは2021年に新しい家を買い、頭金として16万ドル（約2400万円）を支払った。その時点で残金は20万ドル（約3000万円）。購入や引っ越しの費用を支払ったのちに残った16万ドルを、ふたたび証券口座に託した。

証券口座のお金と収入を使って、毎月の住宅ローンを返済した。この新しい家の資産価値はおよそ30万ドル（約4500万円）とされている。

2024年に父が亡くなり、10万ドルを相続した

私たちはこれまで、この10万ドル（約1500万円）をさまざまな目的のために利用してきた。新しい屋根、エアコン、給湯器など、家のためにおよそ2万5000ドルを使った。夫のスタートアップに2万ドル（約300万円）ほど投資し、医療費としてもおよそ1万ドルを費やした。

夫も私もまだ現役で働いている。この遺産が私たち夫婦の未来を形づくる。個人としてのあるいは仕事上での必要や欲求を満たすのにじゅうぶんな額だ。",businessinsider

Even after a recent drop in wholesale costs, retail egg prices remain near historic highs, averaging about $6 per dozen — roughly double what people paid a year ago. It's the most Americans have paid for eggs in decades, according to a CNBC analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The surge is part of a pattern that's become increasingly familiar to U.S. grocery shoppers. While egg prices were relatively stable from the 1980s through the early 2010s, the past decade has seen three major spikes, all triggered by outbreaks of avian influenza that have been more deadly than in the past. The virus, which spreads rapidly through commercial flocks, has forced producers to cull tens of millions of egg-laying hens, creating sudden supply shocks that drive up prices. But the current surge stands out — not just for its severity, but its staying power.

Trump's 'drill, baby, drill' agenda",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/trump-drill-agenda-could-cut-profits-test-oil-producers.html,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","President Donald Trump is urging oil producers to ""drill, baby, drill."" U.S. oil and gas investors may not be on board with the plan.

""Right now, with low oil prices, I think we're going to start to see a lot of companies starting to pare back on their capital spending,"" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

The U.S. is already producing more crude oil than any other nation in history. In December 2024, U.S. oil and gas firms produced more than 13.49 million barrels of crude per day. That's an all-time high rate of production, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration records.

High rates of production tend to lower prices, which benefits consumers. But if prices drop too far, affecting producers' profits, they may stop drilling.

Most Americans see oil prices reflected in the price they pay per gallon at gas stations. The retail price of gasoline fluctuates based on seasonal trends and other factors. On March 24, 2025, the nationwide average price of regular unleaded gasoline was about $3.10 per gallon, according to GasBuddy data. That is far below the highest-ever nationwide average price of over $5 per gallon, in June 2022, according to GasBuddy data.

U.S. gasoline prices are expected to fall by 11 cents in 2025 and 19 cents in 2026, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts.

According to the EIA, crude oil prices in the U.S. accounted for about 52.6% of the average retail price of gasoline in 2023, the most recent data available.

The future trajectory of crude oil prices is a key concern for investors in the oil and gas industry.

On March 24, 2025, the spot price of the U.S. benchmark for crude oil, West Texas Intermediate, was hovering below $70 a barrel. Analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights expect WTI to average $66 per barrel in 2025.",cnbc

Consumer confidence dimmed further in March as the view of future conditions fell to the lowest level in more than a decade, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.

The board's monthly confidence index of current conditions slipped to 92.9, a 7.2-point decline and the fourth consecutive monthly contraction. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a reading of 93.5.

However, the measure for future expectations told an even darker story, with the index tumbling 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the 80 level that is considered a signal for a recession ahead.

The index measures respondents' outlook for income, business and job prospects.

""Consumers' optimism about future income — which had held up quite strongly in the past few months — largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,"" said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board.

The survey comes amid worries over President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on U.S. imports, which has coincided with a volatile stock market and other surveys showing waning sentiment.

The fall in confidence was driven by a decline in those 55 or older but was spread across income groups.

In addition to the general pessimism, the outlook for the stock market slid sharply, with just 37.4% of respondents expecting higher equity prices in the next year. That marked a 10 percentage point drop from February and was the first time the view turned negative since late 2023.

The view on the labor market also weakened, with those expecting more jobs to be available falling to 16.7%, while those expecting fewer jobs rose to 28.5%. The respective February readings were 18.8% and 26.6%.

The answer, according to one Wall Street firm, is a whole lot more. The news In a Tuesday note, BTIG analysts said they believe shares of Capital One would be worth $427 apiece if the Discover deal is completed — implying eye-popping upside of more than 137% from Monday's close. The analysts upgraded the stock to a buy rating from hold in the same note. ""We see significant earnings power as Capital One fully utilizes Discover's network to take market share in the prime transactor credit card space,"" the analysts wrote. ""It has long been a [Discover] investor bull case that Discover has an unpolished diamond in its payments network,"" and Capital One's technology capabilities could help the network better compete against rival operators Visa and Mastercard, the analysts argued. BTIG is upbeat on Capital One's stock even if the merger, which is awaiting approval from a pair of financial regulators, does not go through. The firm's price target of $208 a share values the company on a standalone basis and implies about 15% upside from Monday's close. The primary reason that BTIG still likes Capital One, even on its own, is all the excess capital that the firm has built up since the $35 billion acquisition was announced in February 2024. That could enable Capital One to repurchase $25 billion in stock over the next three years instead, equivalent to 12% of the company, analysts predicted, providing a major lift to earnings per share. Analysts also said that while Capital One is not totally immune to a weakening consumer, its decision to tighten underwriting standards a few years ago was smart and improves its competitive positioning against the likes of American Express and Ally Financial . Shares of Capital One are up nearly 1% Tuesday. COF YTD mountain Capital One Financial (COF) year-to-date performance Big picture BTIG's optimistic call arrives roughly a week after Capital One's stock fell in response to an unconfirmed report about the Justice Department's thinking on the Capital One-Discover merger. The report specifically said the DOJ is concerned about the combined entity's concentration in the subprime credit cart market. In response, a Capital One spokesperson told CNBC that the deal remains ""well-positioned to gain approval"" and meets all legal requirements. Citi, KBW and Jefferies all came to the stock's defense last week, with analysts at each firm still expecting the deal to be completed. Capital One shares have rebounded from that initial sell-off on March 17 and traded above $182 apiece Tuesday — up nearly 6% since March 14, outperforming both the S & P 500 overall and the financial sector in that stretch. The antirust discussion also comes against the backdrop of a legal battle between Capital One and President Donald Trump's family business. The Trump Organization filed a lawsuit against the credit card lender on March 7, alleging that Capital One violated consumer protections laws by closing its accounts in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Capital One has said it does not close customer accounts for political reasons. Bottom line We're quite bullish on Capital One — even if we haven't thrown out an estimate of what the stock would be worth post-Discover like BTIG has with its $427 figure. Our current price target of $210 a share is pretty close to the firm's standalone target.

https://cnbc.com,"Recession is coming before end of 2025, generally 'pessimistic' corporate CFOs say: CNBC survey",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/recession-is-coming-pessimistic-corporate-cfos-say-cnbc-survey.html,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","It all adds up to a majority of CFOs (60%) saying they expect a recession in the second half of the year – another 15% say a recession will hit in 2026.

""Too chaotic for business to navigate effectively"" was how one CFO respondent framed their view of Trump's second term to date. ""Extreme""; ""Disruptive""; ""Aggressive""; ""A wild ride,"" were some of the other ways CFOs portrayed their current view.

In a word, the ""pessimism"" has crept back in where the animal spirits had been after Trump's election. That's one way to sum up the results from the latest CNBC CFO Council quarterly survey for Q1 2025. While some chief financial officers said Trump is doing what he promised on the campaign trail, many CFOs said the way he is going about delivering on his agenda is not what was expected.

Many executives in the C-suite and across the economy remain disturbed about the trade war outlook and a White House that has given every indication it is ideologically committed to a major change in global economic policy. Shifting messages from President Trump that continue to add confusion to the tariff planning process haven't helped.

The stock market experienced a relief rally to start the week, and attempted to keep the comeback going on Tuesday morning , as comments from the Trump economic team over the weekend suggested a softer stance on tariffs. But within the boardroom, hope is not likely to replace caution any time soon.

Just a quarter ago, when the recession question in the quarterly survey was laid on the Fed rather than Trump – in the Q4 2024 survey, we asked whether the central bank's efforts to tame inflation would lead to an economic slump – only 7% of CFOs said they thought that was on the calendar for 2025.

In recent weeks, recession has become a more popular default setting in the market, for the first time since the Fed began aggressively raising interest rates to beat back runaway inflation in March 2022. The odds of recession are running as high as 50% at some financial firms, new ""recession watch"" indicators are being created, and other recent CNBC surveying, among money managers and economists, shows a spike in recession fears.

The CFO Council survey is a sampling of views from chief financial officers at large organizations across sectors of the U.S. economy, with 20 respondents included the Q1 survey conducted between March 10 and March 21.

U.S. trade policy is the primary reason for the new economic downturn base case. It is now being cited as the top external business risk by CFOs, at 30%, followed by the related risks: inflation (25%) and consumer demand (20%), with the latest reading on consumer confidence in income, business and job prospects hitting a 12-year low.

Ninety percent of CFOs say tariffs will cause ""resurgent inflation,"" and as CFOs worry more about prices, expectations for when the Fed can engineer it back down to 2% in keeping with its dual mandate keep getting pushed further out. Despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself holding out hopes that any tariffs inflation may be ""transitory,"" half of CFOs now say that the 2% target inflation rate will not be achieved until either the second half of 2026 or 2027.

Pressure on U.S. treasury bond yields is expected to remain, with 65% of CFOs saying the range will still be between 4% and 5% at the end of 2025 (50% of CFOs expect yields to stay within the lower end of this range, between 4% and 4.5%, where 10-year treasury are today).

As industries look to the White House for tariff exemption deals molded in their own self-interest, the general level of economic and market uncertainty among business executives across sectors was registered in one unusual way in the quarterly survey. Typically, when asked to name the stock market sector that will do the best over the next six months, CFOs choose tech, health care or energy. In the history of the survey, the responses to this question rarely deviate from those three sectors. This quarter, though, the majority CFO opinion on the sector with the best growth prospects was, ""Don't know.""

Few CFOs think the bull market will quickly resume its march upwards, with 90% of respondents saying the Dow Jones Industrial Average will retest 40,000 before ever reaching 50,000, which indicates the potential for several thousand points more in the index lost.

In a more key, core way, the cautious corporate view was evident in the change quarter over quarter with respect to spending plans, with the number of CFOs who say their firm plans to increase capex this year declining from Q4. It was not a precipitous decline (roughly 10%), but it is trending in the wrong direction. The largest share of respondents expect spending to remain in line with the recent trend at their companies (45%), and even as it declines as a budget stance, there are still more who expect an increase (35%) in spending than a decrease (20%).

Overall, 95% of CFOs said policy uncertainty is having an impact on their business decision-making.

The most acute way that rising pessimism was registered in the survey was simply by asking CFOs what they think of the economy: 75% of respondents said they are ""somewhat pessimistic about the overall state of the U.S. economy"" right now. And that's despite 75% being optimistic about the state of their own industry.

The good news if a recession is in the cards? Ninety percent of CFOs think it will either be moderate (50%) or mild (40%).

But CFOs remain divided on where it is all leading, measuring a mix of diminished hopes and bleak confusion.

""I feel the current administration is seeing how far they can push before anything breaks. I am hopefully after the first 100 days that things will moderate,"" said one CFO.

But another CFO responding to the survey concluded, ""Complete chaos, without an end game strategy.""",cnbc

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was not upset with national security advisor Michael Waltz after he reportedly added a journalist to a Signal text thread in which top officials discussed pending military strikes. ""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump told NBC News in a phone call when asked if he still had confidence in his top national security aide. Trump blamed a lower-level staffer when asked how The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, came to be included in a text thread that included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. ""It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,"" the president said. Goldberg revealed in a bombshell article Monday that his number on Signal, an encrypted messaging app, had been added on March 13 to a chat thread called the ""Houthi PC small group.""

The thread showed participants discussing and debating plans related to U.S. bombing attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, which were ultimately carried out on March 15. The participants' names appeared to match those of top-level Trump administration officials, including Vance, Hegseth and Waltz, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Goldberg declined to reveal some of the contents of the texts, including the name of one person he described as an ""active intelligence officer."" Goldberg also declined to detail a post from Hegseth that included what the journalist called ""operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.""

At an annual hearing on worldwide threats before the Senate Intelligence Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning, Gabbard said she was ""not going to get into the specifics"" when aggressively questioned by the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. Gabbard and Ratcliffe both testified that the Signal texts did not include any classified information. Warner, after slamming the incident as the latest example of ""sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior"" by the Trump administration, pushed the officials to share the texts with the committee. Gabbard and Ratcliffe did not commit to doing so. But when Sen.

Chinese automaker BYD reported annual revenue of 777 billion yuan ($107 billion) for 2024, leapfrogging U.S. rival Tesla as competition between the two electric vehicle rivals heats up.

In a filing published Monday, BYD posted a 29% increase in revenue from the previous year, bolstered by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This figure exceeded the $97.7 billion annual revenue reported by Elon Musk's Tesla.

Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD, hailed the firm's ""rapid development"" in 2024, noting the company became the first automaker globally to reach the milestone of rolling out 10 million new energy vehicles in November.

""BYD has become an industry leader in every sector from batteries, electronics to new energy vehicles, breaking the dominance of foreign brands and reshaping the new landscape of the global market,"" Wang said in a statement.

The filing comes shortly after BYD announced a new battery technology that it claims can charge EVs almost as quickly as it takes to fill a gasoline car.

The automaker said last week that it's new so-called Super e-Platform will allow cars that use the technology to achieve 400 kilometers (roughly 249 miles) of range with just five minutes of charging. CNBC could not independently verify these claims.

Analysts hailed BYD's new battery platform as ""out of this world"" and suggested the development could lead to a profound change of behavior among EV owners.",cnbc

With genetic testing company 23andMe filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and courting bidders, the DNA data of millions of users is up for sale.

A Silicon Valley stalwart since 2006, 23andMe has steadily amassed a database of people's fundamental genetic information under the promise of helping them understand their disposition to diseases and potentially connecting with relatives.

But the company's bankruptcy filing Sunday means information is set to be sold, causing massive worry among privacy experts and advocates.

""Folks have absolutely no say in where their data is going to go,"" said Tazin Kahn, CEO of the nonprofit Cyber Collective, which advocates for privacy rights and cybersecurity for marginalized people.

""How can we be so sure that the downstream impact of whoever purchases this data will not be catastrophic?"" she said.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta warned people in a statement Friday that their data could be sold. In the statement, Bonta offered users instructions on how to delete genetic data from 23andMe, how to instruct the company to delete their test samples and how to revoke access from their data's being used in third-party research studies.

DNA data is extraordinarily sensitive.

Its primary use at 23andMe — mapping out a person's potential predisposed genetic conditions — is data that many people would prefer to keep private. In some criminal cases, genetic testing data has been subpoenaed by police and used to help criminal investigations against people's relatives.

Security experts caution that if a bad actor can gain access to a person's biometric data like DNA information, there's no real remedy: Unlike passwords or even addresses or Social Security numbers, people cannot change their DNA.

A spokesperson for 23andMe said in an emailed statement that there will be no change to how the company stores customers' data and that it plans to follow all relevant U.S. laws.

But Andrew Crawford, an attorney at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology, said genetic data lawfully acquired and held by a tech company has almost no federal regulation to begin with.

Not only does the United States not have a meaningful general digital privacy law, he said, but Americans' medical data faces less legal scrutiny if it's held by a tech company rather than by a medical professional.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which regulates some ways in which health data can be shared and stored in the United States, largely applies only ""when that data is held by your doctor, your insurance company, folks kind of associated with the provision of health care,"" Crawford said.

""HIPAA protections don't typically attach to entities that have IOT [internet of things] devices like fitness trackers and in many cases the genetic testing companies like 23andMe,"" he said.

There is precedent for 23andMe's losing control of users' data.

In 2023, a hacker gained access to the data of what the company later admitted were around 6.9 million people, almost half of its user base at the time.

That led to posts on a dark web hacker forum, confirmed by NBC News as at least partially authentic, that shared a database that named and identified people with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. The company subsequently said in a statement that protecting users' data remained ""a top priority"" and vowed to continue investing in protecting its systems and data.

Emily Tucker, the executive director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology, said the sale of 23andMe should be a wake-up call for Americans about how easily their personal information can be bought and sold without their input.

""People must understand that, when they give their DNA to a corporation, they are putting their genetic privacy at the mercy of that company's internal data policies and practices, which the company can change at any time,"" Tucker said in an emailed statement.

""This involves significant risks not only for the individual who submits their DNA, but for everyone to whom they are biologically related,"" she said.",cnbc

""We generally view the likes of Amazon , Walmart and Costco as the best positioned to ride a macro storm given the combination of a defensive category mix, relative value and membership lock-in that comes with each platform,"" Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani said in a note to clients Tuesday. The Bernstein report landed the same day as the consumer confidence report that showed the economy touched a 12-year low, the Conference Board said. That followed a recent University of Michigan Survey of Consumers for March falling to its lowest reading since 2022 . The weakening growth outlook is also being frustrated by President Donald Trump's tariff push. The president is expected to follow through with his previously announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2, which are aimed at countries that impose duties on U.S. imports. Reports on Sunday from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News said Trump may end up narrowing the scope of the tariffs, and exclude some industry-specific duties altogether. Due to the mounting macroeconomic uncertainty, Devnani said both gross merchandise value and membership loyalty are the differentiating factors in e-commerce, with Amazon and Walmart seemingly engaged in a race to secure dominance. Earlier this year, Amazon surpassed Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever. Costco has historically been a go-to for staples during times of economic uncertainty. The company focuses on passing along savings to shoppers, and leans heavily on selling memberships for added revenue. Costco CEO Ron Vachris said on its fiscal second-quarter earnings call in early March that one of the company's responses to tariffs is to limit price increases on already burdened shoppers. Bernstein reiterated an outperform rating on all three stocks. The firm's $275 per share price target on Amazon implies about 35% upside from its $203.26 close on Monday, while Bernstein's $113 per share price target on Walmart calls for about 29% upside from its $87.49 close. Amazon stock has slipped more than 6% so far this year, while Walmart is down about 5%. On Costco, Bernstein's $1,177 price target calls for more than 27% upside ahead. The membership-based wholesaler is higher by about 1% this year. Devnani said Bernstein's view of the entire e-commerce segment is cautious, given that a sample basket of stocks in the sector has pulled back roughly 15% since the February highs. ""We continue to live week to week with these stocks as investors try to discern the degree to which the macro backdrop may be shifting, or if these concerns can blow over,"" Devnani said.

Google/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.

One of Google's top executives working on quantum computers said he believe the technology is only five years away from running practical applications that can't be calculated on modern computers.

Julian Kelly, Google Quantum AI's director of hardware, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that a quantum computer may be able to do cutting-edge physics and potentially generate new kinds of data.

""We think we're about five years out from a real breakout, kind of practical application that you can only solve on a quantum computer,"" said Kelly in an interview aired Tuesday.

Quantum technology has enjoyed increased attention after Google announced a breakthrough in error correction in December that the company said suggested a path to working quantum computers.

Microsoft , meanwhile, revealed a new quantum computing chip called Majorana in February. The company had to create an ""entirely new state of matter"" to get the chip to work, CEO Satya Nadella said.

Google's most advanced quantum computer has 105 cubits, or the basic building block of a quantum computer, while experts say 1 million or more cubits will be needed for useful applications.

Quantum computers have been a dream of physicists and scientists since the 1980s. While traditional computers are based around central processors or graphics processors with bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum qubits are on or off based on probability.

""Quantum computers speak quantum mechanics — they can access the way the universe works at the most fundamental level,"" Kelly said.

The first applications for the technology will likely include using the system to simulate cutting-edge physics, Kelly said. That includes ""areas where you've got some system that's sort of just out of reach of what a classical computer to do,"" he added.

Quantum computers may also be able to generate data used to train AI, although Kelly called this use ""speculative."" He said that current artificial intelligence models fundamentally won't be able to work on quantum computers.

""One of the potential applications that you can think of for a quantum computer is generating new and novel data,"" Kelly said.

The quantum computing field has also benefitted in recent months from attention on AI chips made by Nvidia as investors search for another kind of next-generation processor that could spark a similar boom as graphics processing units did during the recent wave of AI investment.

Nvidia doesn't make quantum processors, but the company held a Quantum Day event last week where representatives from 12 leading quantum companies, Amazon and Microsoft talked about the potential of the technology.

The chipmaker's summit came after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in January cast doubt on whether useful quantum computers would hit the market in the next 15 years. Those comments caused the share prices of several public quantum companies to fall.

Huang last week walked back his January comments, saying they were ""wrong,"" but he still signaled that he thought technology had a long way to go.

""Of course, quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,"" Huang said last week. ""But the technology is insanely complicated.""

HWM, formerly part of Alcoa, was focused on the oil & gas industry until a rebrand in 2020 when they re-focused on primarily aerospace, defense and commercial transportation markets. Looking around in aerospace and defense, there are some standout companies that have weathered the market pullback quite well including Kratos Defense & Security , Heico , General Dynamics , even Boeing and General Electric (even though GE is classified as an Industrial Conglomerate). All of these stocks look tradable to the upside in light of the Trump administration's policies aimed at reshoring manufacturing, the implementation of AI within aerospace & defense, and a strong rebound in air travel. Howmet is well positioned in two specific areas of commercial aerospace and industrial gas turbines. We first added HWM to our growth portfolio at Inside Edge Capital on June 24, 2024 with a 1% allocation. Even though the stock is up approximately 75% in that time, during the next reallocation I plan to increase the size by at least a 2% allocation once we have a bit more confidence the broader market pullback is complete. Based on last week's article of the broader market successfully holding our support levels ( almost exactly at our levels ). I think it's about time to attack. Turning to the technicals on the weekly chart, you'll see a beautiful uptrend that began in October 2023 that has formed quite a formidable parallel trend channel (green). Amid the recent market pullback, HWM tested parallel channel support along with the 20-week moving average (orange) and re-engaged on the upside ahead of the broader market averages. Highlighted below the chart is some scary good yearly percentage EPS growth (for an industrial company) of 88%, 65% and 54%. And though 2025 is expected to moderate out to just a 17% growth, 2026 is looking to move back above 20% growth. Looking at the daily chart, you can see a similarly impressive quarterly EPS growth that should be able to carry it above the dotted green resistance breakout level to new highs. If we do in fact increase our position size, I will use a stop around the March lows of $120 for the entirety of the position. I do understand the stock commands a higher valuation with a current PE of 48. But when you consider the EPS growth rate and solid position in the explosive growth sectors discussed, the forward PE of 31 X's 2026 expected earnings of $4.04 based on a last trade of $136.32 may not seem all that stretched. Of course, it is the combination of fundamentals and technicals to manage risk on high growth positions like this that allows us to actively manage our stock portfolios. -Todd Gordon, Founder of Inside Edge Capital, LLC Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!

But those same large metros tend to have higher costs of living as well.

In fact, a single adult would need to earn a minimum of $85,197 to live comfortably in any of the 100 largest U.S. cities, according to a recent SmartAsset analysis.

That figure reflects the amount you would need cover basic needs like housing, food and health care, as well as some discretionary costs and saving for the future, in Indianapolis, the least-expensive city on the list. In San Francisco, on the other hand, you'd need to bring in over $120,000 a year.

SmartAsset used estimates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator and the common 50/30/20 budget guideline to define ""financially comfortable"" and determine the minimum salary a single adult would need in each place. On the 50/30/20 budget, you aim to spend half of your income on needs and 30% on wants, and put 20% toward your savings and investments.

However, these minimums don't always match what typical residents earn in each city. In Indianapolis, for example, the local median household income is just $66,629, according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey. Someone earning that amount would potentially have trouble setting money aside for the future without finding ways to keep their living costs low.

The median income, per Census Bureau data, lines up with SmartAsset's estimate for how much single adults need to live comfortably in just nine of the 100 largest U.S. cities. Here's a look at those places, including how much is left over after meeting SmartAsset's comfortability thresholds.",cnbc

The Cboe Volatility Index , an options-based measure of expected market gyrations, has drifted below its long-term average after previously spiking, which Colas said in his overnight market note Monday is often an attractive time to buy stocks. Specifically, he pointed out that the fear gauge closed at 27.9 on March 10, or more than one standard deviation above its long-term average of 19.5. That close, he said, ""proved to be a good entry point to buy the S & P 500 ."" .VIX 3M line VIX movements ""Even though US large caps wobbled for a few days after, the index is now 2.7 percent higher,"" added Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""This is exactly what should happen.

In more recent moves, the VIX closed at around 17.5 on Monday and edged down even more in Tuesday trading. Should the index hold below 19.5, it will send a message that the recent volatility, induced by President Donald Trump 's tariffs plans and worries about economic growth , has been largely priced into market activity, Colas said. ""It's too early to declare victory over policy-related uncertainty and the stock market volatility it creates, but today was a big step in the right direction,"" he wrote. ""Simply put, the bulls needed not just an outsized rally but also the decline in the VIX to lay the groundwork for further gains."" While the near-term figure he said to watch on the VIX is 27.3, Colas noted that a move past 35.1, or two standard deviations above the norm, would be an even stronger short-term buy signal.

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. Markets are higher on Tuesday as the S & P 500 aims for its third positive day in a row, appearing to shrug off a disappointing economic report. New data from the Conference Board shows that consumer confidence dipped again in March. Meanwhile, in tech Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai made comments stating that there is a potential bubble in the AI data center buildout. Tsai warned that production is moving faster than demand. Jim said that he disagrees after attending Nvidia's GTC conference last week, where CEO Jensen Huang said we still need a lot more data centers. 2. CrowdStrike was upgraded to a buy at BTIG with a price target of $431. Street estimates are too low, analysts said. The firm noted that with the July outage now eight months in the past, CrowdStrike ""has much better visibility on forecasts."" The analysts believe that annual recurring revenue will accelerate in the second half of the year above street forecast. Jim said this was a ""fantastic upgrade."" If the stock price hits the $400 level, Jim said we'd probably sell some of the shares we purchased when prices fell earlier this month. The stock is currently trading in the high $380s. 3 . Honeywell announced the leadership for its Advanced Materials business to be named Solstice Advanced Materials. The company's spin is on track for late this year or early 2026 with David Swell as the new CEO. Sewell most recently served as CEO of WestRock and prior to that was president at Sherwin Williams . Jim said the selection was a ""good pick,"" by Honeywell. However, the company is now in what Jim call's spin purgatory as there is always initial excitement around a company when breakups are announced, but people often wait to buy back in closer to the spin's completion date, something we also saw with DuPont . 4. Stocks covered in Tuesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: KB Home , McCormick , Carvana , Cloudflare , and Oklo .

https://cnbc.com,"At 25, she was a single mom on food stamps—now her business brings in $20 million a year: ‘I don't take no for an answer’",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/farmboxrx-founder-how-i-built-grocery-delivery-company-in-nyc.html,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Ashley Tyrner-Dolce knows what it's like to struggle to afford healthy food for her family.

A little over a decade ago, she was a single mom relying on food stamps and Medicaid. Now, Tyrner-Dolce is the founder and CEO of FarmboxRx, which aims to deliver healthy foods to low-income Americans in food deserts through their health insurance plans.

Last year, the subscription-based business brought in more than $20 million in revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It, and partnered with more than 80 different health plans. FarmboxRx is free of cost for its users: Medicare, Medicaid and other insurance providers pay for the grocery deliveries, as a means of preventative health care.

The company became profitable in 2022, says Tyrner-Dolce.

In 2011, Tyrner-Dolce and her newborn daughter moved to New York from Arizona looking to start fresh. Living in the Big Apple wasn't glamorous: She crashed with friends, relied on government assistance for food and lugged her groceries through the subways, she says.

She landed a role as a business manager in the fashion industry, and got off food stamps — now known in New York as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits — a year later at age 25. Her living situation improved over the next few years, but her trips to the grocery store never did, Tyrner-Dolce says. Finding affordable, healthy food was difficult, as was hauling heavy bags home on her own.

In 2014, she left her corporate job to launch FarmboxRx. She used three years' worth of savings — about $80,000 originally meant to go toward buying a house, she says — to cover startup costs like branding and marketing, a warehouse and legal fees. She cut down on her personal expenses, moving into a small, one-bedroom apartment with her daughter while reselling toys on eBay to bring in additional cash.

DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money

Initially, FarmboxRx was a direct-to-consumer service: Customers subscribed, and received fresh produce on their doorsteps. Tyrner-Dolce wanted to find a way for health plans to help pay for the food, but investors didn't share her vision at first, she says.

""Every VC wanted to turn us into a meal kit,"" says Tyrner-Dolce, now 41. But ""I don't take no for an answer. I like to say I'm a rhino. I can't ever turn around and look back. I have to just charge forward.""

FarmboxRx reportedly reached $1 million in annual revenue in 2019, off those produce subscriptions. That money largely covered the business' expenses, leaving comparatively little for payroll, including Tyrner-Dolce's own salary, she says. But she learned something important that year: Some Medicare and Medicaid users could access discounted and free produce as part of their health plans.

Tyrner-Dolce reached out to ""80 to 100 health plans,"" hoping to land a partnership, she says. She struck up one with Vibra Health Plan, owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield, in 2020. Two years later, FarmboxRx had enough health plan partners to completely leave the direct-to-consumer market.

""That's when we became profitable,"" says Tyrner-Dolce, adding that her company still hasn't taken any external funding.

FarmboxRx isn't the only business with a similar idea. Companies like Mom's Meals and Performance Kitchen similarly sell meal kits online through health plans, and the global healthy food market is expected to reach over $890 billion this year, says a Future Market Insights report.

Major retailers like Instacart, Uber Eats, Kroger and Walmart offer nutrition-based food programs, partnerships or grocery stipends. And the online grocery industry is projected to grow by $1.2 trillion between from 2024 to 2028, according to market research company Technavio.

Tyrner-Dolce says she's confident she can keep growing her business amid increased competition. On March 18, FarmboxRx announced a social needs platform called Driver's Health that offers a broader swath of resources and in-home delivery items, meant for other wellness-related struggles like housing and transportation.

""Tackling diet-related disease is about education, affordability and access,"" says Tyrner-Dolce. ""You have to bring many prongs together to solve this issue.""

In a Tuesday note, New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu stood by his buy rating on the beleaguered electric vehicle maker. Ferragu's price target of $465 suggests 67% upside from where Tesla shares closed on Monday. While Tesla popped about 12% on Monday , the stock still ended the session 43% below its December all-time high. Shares have faced a tough few months, with controversies mounting around CEO Elon Musk 's dominant role within the Trump administration. In addition, the company is expected to post a rough first quarter, reflecting an anticipated decline in deliveries for the period on a year-over-year basis. Car shopping site Edmunds also recently reported that Tesla owners have been trading in their vehicles at record levels. TSLA 1Y mountain TSLA 1Y chart Ferragu pointed out that while Musk's actions have grabbed headlines in the past — such as during his Twitter acquisition in 2022 — they ultimately did not have a materially negative effect on Tesla sales, and he doesn't expect them to do so this time either. The analyst added that Tesla's current problems are largely on the supply side, with demand in China remaining strong. Overall, he sees a roughly 5% decline in first-quarter deliveries year over year, ""in line with recent expectations."" Ultimately, Ferragu thinks the electric vehicle maker will be able to rise above the short-term headwinds plaguing shares. ""A bad quarter is in expectations. It will be the trough,"" he wrote.

Their mission was to take gas burned off by oil producers, convert it into electricity, and use that power to mine bitcoin . It turned into a good business.

But then came the artificial intelligence boom, and Crusoe co-founders Chase Lochmiller and Cully Cavness started to see a much bigger opportunity.

As the company focuses on AI and races to complete what it says could be one of most powerful clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs, in the world, Crusoe is getting out of bitcoin mining. The company said Tuesday that it's struck a deal to offload that operation to NYDIG, a power and financial services firm focused exclusively on bitcoin. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

NYDIG will take on about 135 Crusoe employees, who will continue operating the business under the new ownership. Crusoe will become a major equity holder in the combined entity — second only to Stone Ridge, NYDIG's parent company.

The deal includes Crusoe's technology that captures and converts flared gas from oil fields, and more than 425 modular data centers spread across seven U.S. states and parts of Argentina. Altogether, the operation accounts for roughly 1% of the world's bitcoin mining, according to Crusoe, which was valued late last year at $2.8 billion. NYDIG is also privately held and valued at about $7 billion.

Lochmiller told CNBC that Crusoe started investing in AI infrastructure it its earliest days, and that the business increasingly became a central focus.",cnbc
