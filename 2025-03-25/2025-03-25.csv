Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.

If such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives – and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.

Fortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.

Unfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.

That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.

And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.

Kayla EpsteinUS reporter

On 15 March, the US launched what it described as a ""decisive and powerful"" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Four days earlier, on 11 March, Jeffrey Goldberg writes that he received a connection request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz's.

Signal is used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and send disappearing messages.

Two days later, Goldberg said he was added to a Signal chat entitled ""Houthi PC small group"".

A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the chat, Goldberg reported.

Accounts labelled ""JD Vance,"" the name of the vice-president; ""Pete Hegseth,"" the Defence Secretary; and ""John Ratcliffe,"" the director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chat. Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared to be added.

Goldberg says he watched as the group chat discussed targets and timings for military strikes. And those plans appeared accurate when US later launched air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that matched details from the group chat.

Welcome back to our live coverage as the White House confirms that a journalist was accidentally texted classified US military information.

The Trump administration is facing political uproar after the Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a Signal message group in which US national security officials planned a military strike in Yemen.

The group apparently included Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.

Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, said he had seen classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck.

The report sparked a firestorm of criticism from opposition Democrats and concerns among several Republicans.

We'll bring you live updates, analysis and reaction to this extraordinary story during the UK morning and as the US wakes up, so stay with us.

We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly, and will start back up again in a few hours' time.

Congress is expected to grill Trump officials over the incident in an upcoming Senate intelligence hearing.

Two key witnesses set to appear at that hearing were reportedly members of the Signal chat: Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and John Ratcliffe, director of the CIA.

Thanks for joining us.

Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, a
Washington DC-based magazine that publishes articles on politics, business and
the economy, foreign affairs, culture and the arts, technology, and science.

He has worked there since 2007, when he joined as a national
correspondent before taking over as editor-in-chief in 2016. The magazine won
its first Pulitzer Prizes under his leadership in 2022, as well as a variety of
other awards.

And, as we know now, Goldberg was also part of a classified
conversation where senior US government officials discussed military strikes on
a foreign country.

Read the full story of how he ended up here on The Atlantic's website, external.

The vice-president pushed back against the planned attack, expressing concern over the prospect of ""bailing Europe out""

In the messages revealed by the Atlantic one of the most notable things was Vice President JD Vance's disagreement with Trump's Yemen strategy. 

Vance argued, in the messages, the administration didn't need to rush to attack Yemen and he experienced concern over what should be expected of the Europeans and others for the US doing this. 

“3%  of US trade runs through the Suez. 40% of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message,” Vance reportedly wrote in a message.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,"" Vance says in a later message. ""There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

After pushback from other members of the Trump administration, Vance appears to address Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying ""If you think we should do it let's go"". 

""I just hate bailing Europe out again,"" Vance writes.

""This is blatantly illegal and dangerous beyond belief,"" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren says of the group chat breach. ""Our national security is in the hands of complete amateurs,"" she said on social media.

""What other highly sensitive national security conversations are happening over group chat? Any other random people accidentally added to those, too?""

Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said: ""Think about what we would do if Biden were president and this came out... we would raise the roof"", according to a reporter for Semafor, external. 

""It's going to be interesting to see if anybody loses their job over this,"" she added.

Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono posted: ""Egregious, reckless, and illegal. No amount of spin can change that.""

Max MatzaUS reporter

""It's baffling. It's shocking. It's dangerous,"" says Samar Ali,
a professor of politics and law at Vanderbilt University, saying that the text
chain appeared to be ""a clear violation of our national security laws and our archive
norms"".

Sensitive government communications are required to take
place in a sealed-off room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facility (SCIF), Ali says.

Ali says these rooms are “virtually impossible to penetrate,” unlike the messaging app Signal.

Ali speaks from experience, recalling when she once used a SCIF to hash out negotiations
between the US and EU.

One question Ali raises with me is what accountability those involved in the Signal chat might face? She notes that she would have lost her job and security clearance if she committed similar violations.

Kayla EpsteinUS reporter

Some of the Signal messages National Security Adviser Michael Waltz sent to the chat were set to 
disappear after one week, Jeffrey Goldberg reported in his article for The Atlantic.

That raises concerns about two federal laws that require the preservation of government records: the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act.

“The law requires that electronic messages that take
place on a non-official account are preserved, in some fashion, on an official electronic
record keeping system,"" said Jason R Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and
Records Administration. 

Such regulations would cover Signal, he said.

Official government communications are supposed to be either automatically archived, or the individuals involved are supposed to forward, copy, or preserve the messages.

“The open question here is whether these communications
were automatically archived,"" Baron told the BBC. ""It's not clear whether that occurred.""

It was also unclear whether the individuals in the chat had taken other steps to preserve the records.

The use of Signal to discuss the military strikes also raised security questions.

“Assuming that any of the conversations on
Signal could be considered classified, then under Department of Defense guidance
those communications should have taken place on a classified government network,
or on a network with government-approved encrypted features,"" Baron said.

“We should all be concerned about the use of these
electronic messaging apps to evade federal record keeping requirements,"" he said.

Former defence adviser Mara Karlin says group chat mishap 'not normal'

Mara Karlin, who served under six Secretaries of State and was assistant Secretary of Defence, told the BBC the story from The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg is ""stunning"" and ""not normal"".

Karlin says these types of conversation should take place in a secure space, in the Pentagon or in the situation room in the White House, not in a Signal group chat.

Karlin says she expects both allies and adversaries to pay attention to this, saying they will ask: ""Can the US government keep sensitive information in a secure manner?"" 

Inspector general investigations and congressional investigations will be carried out, Karlin predicts.

""This is historic,"" she adds.

Goldberg says officials got 'lucky' it was him inadvertently added to group chat

Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was inadvertently invited to the Signal group chat with US officials, has been speaking with PBS News Hour about his experience. 

""They got quite lucky that they included my phone number,"" Goldberg told PBS News. 

""If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn't somebody who supported the Houthis, because they were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people who were involved in that operation.""

Goldberg said he doesn't disagree with the administration's statement that the messages show a debate among senior levels, but says that point matters less when considering the security concerns.

'Nobody was texting war plans', says Pete Hegseth in response to The Atlantic report

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth just spoke with reporters in Hawaii about the messages published in The Atlantic's article. 

He mostly deflected questions from reporters, saying Goldberg was not a serious journalist and claiming that he ""peddles garbage"".

""So you're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist,"" he alleged.

He then praised the military operation, saying, ""We will ultimately decimate the Houthis"".

Pressed again on the group chat, Hegseth deflected.

""Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,"" he said.

On Sunday, the US launched what it described as a ""decisive and powerful"" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Messages among top White House officials show not everyone was on board with the plan from the start, in part because American actions would help Europe. Officials in the chat, including Vice President JD Vance, said they wanted Europeans to offer something in exchange for the American action in Yemen.

The White House confirmed the content of the messages as reported in The Atlantic was authentic. 

@PeteHegseth if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.

- JD Vance

VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.

- Pete Hegseth

We've compiled a timeline of the events leading up to a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, gaining access to a chat for top US officials.

Tuesday March 11: Goldberg receives an invitation request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account identified as White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz

Thursday March 13: The editor-in-chief receives a notification that he has been added to a group chat on the app, called ""Houthi PC small group"". A message to the group said it would be used for the coordination of strikes against the Houthis, ""particularly over the next 72 hours"", Goldberg reports

Friday March 14: Now on the second day of communications, Goldberg says conversations diverted as an account called JD Vance spoke of a trip to an economic event in Michigan. Attention then turned back to the Houthis, with an account identified as Pete Hegseth showing support for the proposals to be raised with President Donald Trump

Saturday March 15: Goldberg receives a message in the chat about the attacks on the Houthis at 11:44 local time, just over two hours later the account purported to be that of Waltz says the ""operation was a success""

Among the details shared by journalist Jeffrey Goldberg from the
group chat he was inadvertently invited to are the reactions from White House
officials after military strikes were launched.

Michael Waltz shared a fist emoji, a US flag emoji and a fire
emoji, Goldberg's messages show.

A user with the initials MAR, whom Goldberg believes could be
Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio, said ""good Job Pete and your
team!!”

Pete is in reference to Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense
who apparently shared the details of the planned strikes in the Signal group.

Goldberg says the username Steve Witkoff responded with five
emojis - two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. Witkoff is
Trump's special envoy to the Middle East.

The BBC has not independently verified the individual users in
the chat, but the White House has said it appeared to be ""an authentic
message chain"".

Joe Biden's former transport secretary Pete Buttigieg has just reacted to news of the security breach on his social media account. 

""From an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of (expletive) imaginable,"" the high-profile Democrat says.

""These people cannot keep America safe.""

This is the moment senator Chuck Schumer demands a ""full
investigation"" of the Yemen strike group chat.

Schumer says ""very harsh consequences"" should be faced
by any government employee who shared the sensitive military plans.

Mike Johnson defends Trump administration after Yemen group chat mishap

Reporters on Capitol Hill just asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson about the Signal group. 

""The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it on to that thread, they're going to track that down and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" Johnson tells reporters. 

Johnson said the Trump administration ""acknowledged it was a mistake"".

""What you did see, though, I think, was top level officials doing their job, doing it well,” he added. 

US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz (L) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (R)

As we've been reporting, Editor-in-Chief of the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a group chat with US national security officials.

The White House confirmed the texts published by Goldberg ""appears to be an authentic message chain"" and they were investigating how Goldberg had been added to it.

Goldberg says he received an invite from an account purporting to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz on 11 March, four days before the US launched what it described as a ""decisive and powerful"" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

Also in the chat, Goldberg reports, were accounts that matched the names of Vice-President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) John Ratcliffe.

He also says top officials from various agencies also appeared to be added.

We've been talking a lot about Signal, the app that was used to discuss war plans.

It's a free, open-source encrypted messaging app that was launched in 2014. 

Conversations within the app are end-to-end encrypted - meaning they can only be read or heard by the recipients.

It is often used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and the ability to send disappearing messages.

The White House says both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and stop military strikes in the Black Sea

Washington releases separate statements after American officials met representatives from both countries in Saudi Arabia in recent days

Ukraine agrees to stop military force in the Black Sea, but adds any movement of Russian naval vessels would be a violation of the agreement, its defence minister says

Earlier the Kremlin said talks with the US focused on creating safe shipping lanes in the Black Sea, but the details would remain private

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov added that Russia was in favour of resuming the Black Sea grain initiative - a deal allowing Ukraine to safely export grain, state-owned Tass news agency reports

Edited by James Gregory

The Ukrainian defence ministry has released its own statement on the deal, which largely follows the same wording as the White House. 

But it also adds that the movement of Russian warships outside of the ""eastern part of the Black Sea"" will be treated as a violation of the agreement and a ""threat to the national security of Ukraine"". 

""In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence,"" the defence ministry statement says on X. 

The defence ministry adds that ""additional technical consultations"" will be needed for the ""effective implementation"" of what has been agreed.

Here are the key points from the statement released by the White House following its talks with Russia in Riyadh:

The US also says Ukraine has agreed to these two points.

The statement adds: 

The White House says both Russia and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping and stop military strikes in the Black Sea.

We'll bring you more details and lines from the White House statement on US talks with the Russian delegation in the next post. 

We've just received a statement from the White House on the talks between the US and Ukrainian delegations in Riyadh. It says:

It adds the US reiterated to both sides in the war that the killing has to stop and it will continue facilitating negotiations. 

Europe must acquire all means
to defend itself against military aggression, the president of the European
Council has said.

""If Russia considers that Ukraine's
borders are just a line on a map, why should it respect any other
country's borders,"" Antonio Costa asks in a speech at the European Policy
Centre.

Costa adds that peace without
defence is an ""illusion"" and that Europe needs to continue to stand shoulder to
shoulder with Ukraine to create lasting peace in Europe. 

“Russia's aggression gave a new
sense of urgency to our strategic autonomy, not only on energy but also on
defence,” he says, adding there needs to be a “collective effort to boost our defence
spending by more than 30%, paving the way for decisions which are shaping a Europe
of defence”.

Russian officials met American counterparts for 12 hours of talks

If you're just joining us this lunchtime, here's the latest we know about the talks in Saudi Arabia, as well as what's been happening on the frontline in Ukraine:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be meeting French President Emmanuel Macron tomorrow at the Elysée Palace in Paris, French media is reporting.

The two leaders will hold talks ahead of the next iteration of meetings as part of the ""coalition of the willing"", due to take place on Thursday.

Talks are continuing between European leaders on how to ensure any ceasefire agreement secured between Russia and Ukraine is maintained, as well as how Kyiv can be given assurances about its future security. 

As we've been reporting, among the topics said to have been discussed in Riyadh is the potential revival of the 2022 Black Sea grain deal - which had allowed cargo ships travelling to and from Ukraine to safely navigate without being attacked by Russia.

Both Ukraine and Russia are major grain exporters, and prices rocketed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

A reluctance on the part of international shipping companies to do business with Moscow also hampered Russian exports.

Two deals were brokered by the UN and Turkey - one with Ukraine, and one with Russia - that together were intended to allow both countries to resume and scale-up shipments to amounts closer to pre-war levels.

The deal facilitated the movement of grain, sunflower oil and other products required for food production such as fertiliser through the Black Sea. 

It was initially put in place for a period of 120 days but, after multiple extensions, Russia pulled out in July 2023, claiming key parts of the agreement had not been implemented.

Sergei Lavrov and Antonio Guterres pictured in January 2024

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says United Nations chief Antonio Guterres is in constant contact with Russia on the issue of easing Russian grain and fertiliser exports.

According to the Kremlin, Guterres is ""trying to help"" and looking for ways around current Western sanctions. 

We have not heard anything yet from the UN in response to Lavrov's comments. 

The UN, alongside Turkey, brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative in 2022. But inthe summer of 2023, Russia pulled out of the agreement and stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine.

A separate agreement, called the Memorandum of Understanding, was signed between the UN and Russia to facilitate the export of Russian food products and fertilisers.

The US and Russia did not issue a joint statement after their peace talks in Riyadh because of ""Ukraine's position"", a Russian politician claims. 

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and apparently agreed a joint statement – which wasn't however adopted because of Ukraine's position – that is very typical and symptomatic,"" Vladimir Chizhov, first deputy head of the defence committee at the Russian parliament's upper house, has told Russian media this morning.

He added that he wouldn't ""comment on such details before they are made public”.

The Kremlin said earlier that the contents of the US-Russia talks held in Saudi Arabia yesterday would not be published, with the results still “being analysed”by both sides. 

The two countries were expected to release a joint statement at 08:00 GMT today. It's not clear whether one might still be released later today.

Moscow has accused
Ukraine of continuing to target Russia's civilian energy infrastructure amid
continuing peace talks.

In a statement, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian
drones attacked a power grid in the Krasnodar territory yesterday, as well as a gas
distribution station in the occupied Luhansk region. It also said a Ukrainian drone
targeted an underground gas storage facility in occupied Crimea yesterday,
which was intercepted.

""By continuing daily attacks on Russia's
energy infrastructure, Zelensky confirms that he is incapable of sticking to
agreements or of being managed by foreign guarantors of any possible
agreements,"" the ministry said.

Away from the talks, both Russia and Ukraine have continued to carry out attacks overnight. 

Images have been released by Ukraine's state emergency service, which says show the aftermath of Russian drone strikes in the cities of Fastiv and Boryspil, in the Kyiv region, and the city of Izyum, in the north-eastern Kharkiv region.

James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent in Kyiv

There were 12 hours of talks between the Russians and Americans on Monday in Riyadh. The text we're expecting will probably give some readout of what was discussed. 

What's interesting is the fact Washington and Moscow are even contemplating issuing a joint statement that does not involve the Ukrainians, despite those talks with the Kyiv continuing.

Ahead of these talks, people were describing them as shuttle diplomacy - with three delegations in the same hotel complex in Riyadh. 

But there doesn't seem to be that much shuttling - it seems to be just long talks with one side and the Americans to find where there is common ground.

The focus is on restoring the 2022 Black Sea grain initiative - a very specific deal done to open up one seaway to get grain and fertiliser out of Ukraine, while in return relaxing economic sanctions to let Russia export some more of its grain and fertiliser. 

That is not the same thing as a comprehensive ceasefire across the Black Sea, so we wait to see precisely what they've agreed, if anything. 

But at the moment, it seems to be as ever slow incremental steps rather than anything resembling a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire across the whole of the Ukraine which was demanded by the US and agreed to by Kyiv.

Issues surrounding the safety of shipping in the Black Sea were discussed with the US in Saudi Arabia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says, according to the state-owned Tass news agency.

Lavrov adds that Russia is in favour of resuming the Black Sea grain initiative - a deal allowing Ukraine to safely export grain, after pulling out in 2023. 

The Kremlin said a short while ago that the contents of the talks held in Riyadh yesterday would not be published, with the results still “being analysed” by both sides.

It had been reported earlier, however, that negotiators were examining a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea. 



We're continuing to monitor for updates, and will bring you all the latest right here on this page. Stay with us.

Earlier, we brought you reports that the US and Ukrainian teams in Saudi Arabia were holding a further meeting today. 

That meeting has now ended, the AFP news agency reports, citing a source from the Kyiv delegation. 

""The talks are over. All details will be announced later,"" the source tells a small group of media, according to AFP.

Ukraine's national broadcaster, Suspilne, also reports that the talks - the second round in the past three days - have finished.

Ben TavenerMoscow producer

More now on what we've heard from Moscow about the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia. 

As we reported in our last post, the Kremlin says the results of the meeting have been conveyed to their respective capitals and are currently “being analysed”. 

“We're talking about technical talks, where they go into detail, so of course the contents of those talks definitely won't be made public,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says on a daily conference call with Russian and international journalists.

“The briefings made to the capitals are being analysed [and] we can talk about the understandings [reached] later,” he adds.

On the potential for another call between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, he says there are no plans right now, but that it could be quickly arranged if needed. 

Asked whether there were now grounds for three-way talks including Ukraine, Peskov says that had not been discussed.

A Kremlin spokesperson says both Russia and the US are currently analysing the outcome of talks in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

Dmitry Peskov adds that the content of what was discussed will not be published. 

We'll bring you more on this shortly.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron will hold another meeting on the ""coalition of the willing"" on Thursday.

In the aftermath of the Saudi Arabia talks, the European leaders, along with their allies, aim to provide possible solutions to ensure any potential ceasefire agreement can be maintained and give Ukraine confidence about its future security.

In a statement shared yesterday, a Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer was continually updating the White House on meetings with his allies, following conversations on military planning.

The US and Ukrainian delegations are currently holding a further round of talks in Riyadh, according to reports.

""We are still working with the Americans,"" a member of the Ukrainian delegation tells a small group of media, according to the AFP news agency.

Bloomberg is reporting the same, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has addressed a recent leak of high-level discussions about US airstrikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels, calling the journalist involved “deceitful” and downplaying the significance of the disclosure.

The incident came to light after The Atlantic reported on Monday that its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, had been accidentally added to a Signal group chat that included top Trump administration officials such as Vice President J.D. Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Hegseth.

The group had been actively discussing potential US military operations against the Houthis for days prior to President Donald Trump ordering strikes on Yemen on March 15.

Goldberg claimed that one of Hegseth's final messages before the attack “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing.”

When asked about the leak on Monday, Hegseth dismissed Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes.”

“Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said when pressed on the content of the messages.

National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told Reuters that the message thread “appears to be authentic” and confirmed that an internal review had been launched into “how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

“The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials,” Hughes added, without clarifying whether national security protocols had been breached or if any disciplinary action would follow.

Trump ordered a “powerful military action” against the Yemen-based Houthi militants last Saturday, accusing them of conducting an “unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.” The group, officially known as the Ansar Allah movement, has controlled large portions of Yemen – including the capital, Sanaa – since the mid-2010s.

In what The Atlantic described as a “fascinating policy discussion,” senior US officials reportedly acknowledged the difficulty of building public support for a new military campaign.

“There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” the account labeled ‘JD Vance' said, arguing that “the strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.” In response, Hegseth agreed, stating: “I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”

Trump has claimed that the Houthi attacks “emanate from, and are created by, Iran,” warning that from now on, Washington would view every shot fired by the Yemeni group as if it were fired by Tehran. “Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform last Monday.

TOKYO (AP) — The Unification Church in Japan was ordered dissolved by a court Tuesday after a government request spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The South Korea-based church said it was considering an immediate appeal of the Tokyo District Court's revocation of its legal status, which would take away its tax-exempt privilege and require liquidation of its assets. 

The order followed a request by Japan's Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.

In the ruling, the court said the church's problems were extensive and continuous, and a dissolution order is necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television. 

“We believe our claims were accepted,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government will continue efforts to support victims of the church. 

The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers. 

The church called the court order regrettable and unjust and said in a statement the court's decision was based on “a wrong legal interpretation and absolutely unacceptable.”

Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the church's Japanese branch, accused the government of “fabricating damages.” The church is “not a malicious group that should be dissoloved,” he told a news conference on Tuesday. 




The investigation into Abe's assassination revealed links over decades between the church and Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in the 1960s during an anti-communist movement supported by Abe's grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.

The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family's financial troubles. 

The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group subject to a revocation order based on violations of Japan's civil code. Two earlier case involved criminal charges — the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.

To seek the church's dissolution, the Education Ministry had submitted 5,000 documents and pieces of evidence to the court, based on interviews with more than 170 people.

The church tried to steer its followers' decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability and causing fear and harm to them and their families, seriously deviating from the law on religious groups, officials and experts say.

The Agency for Cultural Affairs said the settlements reached in or outside court exceeded 20 billion yen ($132 million) and involved more than 1,500 people.

Lawyers representing those seeking damages from the church welcomed the court decision as a major first step toward redress.

“We must pursue our effort to achieve redress and to prevent future problems,” head lawyer Susumu Murakoshi told reporters, demanding the church accept the dissolution order and offer an apology and compensation to all victims.

The church was founded in Seoul in 1954 by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative, family-oriented value systems. 

Nicknamed the “Moonies,” after its founder, the church developed relations with conservative world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as his predecessors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

The church faced accusations in the 1970s and 1980s of using devious recruitment tactics and brainwashing adherents into turning over huge portions of their salaries to Moon. In Japan, the group has faced lawsuits for offering “spiritual merchandise” that allegedly caused members to buy expensive art and jewelry or sell their real estate to raise donations for the church.

The church has acknowledged excessive donations but says the problem has lessened since the group stepped up compliance in 2009.

Experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and that the majority of the church's worldwide funding comes from Japan.

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, Palestinian medics said, as hospitals are flooded with dead and wounded since Israel resumed heavy bombardment last week, shattering the ceasefire that had halted the 17-month war. The dead include three children and their parents who were killed in a strike on their tent.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, an Oscar-winning Palestinian director is set to be released a day after he was badly beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces, according to the director's lawyer. The lawyer said Hamdan Ballal had been wounded in the attack and was accused of throwing stones at a young settler, allegations he denies.

Israel's parliament passed a crucial state budget on Tuesday, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to the Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251. Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because it operates in densely populated areas. 




Here's the latest:

An Oscar-winning Palestinian director and two others have been released by Israeli authorities, a day after he says he was badly beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

Associated Press journalists on Tuesday spoke with Hamdan Ballal after he left the police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.

Ballal and other witnesses say he was attacked by Jewish settlers before being detained by the Israeli army Monday evening. The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation.

Ballal is one of the other directors of “No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary. The film chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.

An Israeli strike Tuesday in southwestern Syria killed at least four people as Israeli troops occupying the area clashed with local residents, Syrian state media and a war monitor reported. 

Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said troops fired back at gunmen who attacked them, before launching a drone attack. 

Syrian state-run news agency SANA said several people were wounded, including a woman. The report said Israeli tanks in the southwestern village of Koayiah also fired several rounds. 

Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at seven. The observatory and a town resident told The Associated Press that clashes had erupted between Israeli troops and residents when the Israeli troops fired. 

Israel seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone inside Syria after Islamist insurgents toppled President Bashar Assad and seized power in December, with Israeli officials saying they will thwart any threats.

The lawyer for an Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces says he will be released. 

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Hamdan Ballal, said Tuesday that he and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could feel free to move toward a lasting ceasefire with Hamas since his political allies, who oppose ending the war, have little incentive to trigger new elections while their polling numbers are down, said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

But the vote doesn't mean Netanyahu will move in the direction to end the war, she said. She expected him to further his ultranationalist partners' agenda to keep them as loyal allies and galvanize the nationalist right ahead of any future vote.

“Netanyahu is always thinking about the next elections,” Talshir said. “His goal is to make sure the extreme right will be in his government now and in the future.”

Israel's parliament on Tuesday passed a state budget, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

The budget vote was seen as a key test for Netanyahu's coalition, which is made up of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties who had demanded and largely received hefty sums for their constituents in exchange for support for the funding package. By law, the government would fall and elections triggered if a budget weren't passed by March 31. 

With its passing, Netanyahu buys himself what's likely to be more than a year of political quiet that could see his government coast through to the end of its term in late 2026, a rare occurrence in Israel's fractious politics. It's a political win for Netanyahu, who faces mass protests over his decision to resume the war in Gaza while hostages still remain in Hamas' hands, and over his government's recent moves to fire top legal and security chiefs. 

Palestinian first responders say a nine-member ambulance crew is still missing days after being surrounded and targeted by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said the team was responding to airstrikes in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of the southern city of Rafah when Israeli forces encircled the area early Sunday. It said Israel has refused access to the area since then. 

The military said troops had fired on ambulances and fire trucks that it said had raised suspicion by moving without prior coordination and without headlights or emergency signals. It said those inside were militants, without providing evidence.

The Israeli military says a well-known Palestinian journalist killed in a strike on the Gaza Strip was also a Hamas sniper. 

It shared what it said were internal Hamas documents purportedly showing that Hossam Shabat was a sniper in a Hamas battalion in northern Gaza and had received military training in 2019. The military said he had carried out attacks during the war, without providing evidence. 

Qatar-based Al Jazeera said Shabat, a freelance reporter, was covering the war for the satellite news network when he was killed in an Israeli strike on Monday. It said he had been wounded in an Israeli strike in November. 

Shabat, in his early 20s, was prolific on social media, sharing videos and other reports with more than 170,000 followers on the X platform.

Israel has banned Al Jazeera and accused several of its journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. A number of them have been killed or wounded in Israeli strikes. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war.

One of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary “ No Other Land ” was still missing on Tuesday after being beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by the Israeli military.

Attorney Lea Tsemel told The Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained in the occupied West Bank.

Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya late Monday, according to Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they're being held at a military base for medical treatment, and she said she hasn't been able to speak with them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.

Palestinian medics say Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday.

Nasser Hospital said it received four additional bodies from two other strikes in addition to the family of five.

In central Gaza, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said it received the bodies of six people who were killed in three separate strikes. Three others were killed in a strike on a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital.

In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed 5 people, according to the Health Ministry's emergency service. Another 12 people were wounded, it said.

TOKYO (AP) — A controversial South Korean church with powerful political connections faces dissolution in Japan after a Tokyo court ordered a revokation of its legal status after the government accused it of manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.

The Tokyo District court's ruling would end the Unification Church's tax-exempt status in Japan and force it to liquidate its assets. The church said it is considering an immediate appeal to the country's highest court.

The Unification Church has faced hundreds of lawsuits in Japan from families who say that it manipulated members into draining their savings to make donations, but for decades it largely escaped official scrutiny and maintained close links with the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

That changed in 2022, when former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated. The man accused of shooting Abe allegedly was motivated by the former prime minister's links to the church and blamed it for bankrupting his family. The killing drew public attention and prompted investigations into the church's practices and its links to powerful politicians.




The church was founded in Seoul in 1954, a year after the end of the Korean War, by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative, family-oriented value systems. 

The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, champions anti-communism and the unification of the Korean Peninsula, which has been split between the totalitarian North and democratic South. 

The church is perhaps best known for mass weddings where it paired off couples, often from different countries, and renewed the vows of those already married, at places like stadiums and gymnasiums. The group is said to have a global membership of millions, including hundreds of thousands in Japan.

The church faced accusations in the 1970s and ‘80s of using devious recruitment tactics and brainwashing adherents into turning over huge portions of their salaries to Moon. The church has denied the allegations, saying many new religious movements face similar accusations in their early years. 

Experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and that the majority of the church's worldwide funding comes from Japan.

The Education Ministry asked a Tokyo court to dissolve the church in October 2023, accusing it of trying to steer its followers' decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability, and causing fear and harm to them and their families. 

On Tuesday, the Tokyo District court granted the request, writing that the church's problems were extensive and continuous, and a dissolution order is necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television. 

The Unification Church is the first religious group to face a revocation order under Japan's civil code. Two earlier case involved criminal charges — the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.

The Japanese branch of the church has criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers. In a statement Tuesday, it called the court order “truely regrettable” and “unjust,” adding that the decision is based on “a wrong legal interpretation and absolutely unacceptable.”

The 2022 assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and subsequent investigations unearthed decades of cozy ties between the Unification Church and Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party and triggered public outrage. 

The man accused of shooting Abe at a campaign event allegedly told police he was motivated by the former prime minister's links to the church, which he said bankrupted his family due to his mother's excessive donations.

Abe was known for his arch-conservative views on security and history issues and appeared at events organized by church affiliates. 

Throughout his life, Moon worked to make his church into a worldwide religious movement and expand its business and charitable activities. Moon was convicted of tax evasion in 1982 and served a prison term in New York. He died in 2012.

The church has developed relations with conservative world leaders including U.S. presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and more recently Donald Trump.

Moon also had ties with North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un.

Moon said in his autobiography that he asked Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions, and that Kim responded that his atomic program was for peaceful purposes and he had no intention to use it to “kill (Korean) compatriots.”

President Donald Trump insisted Monday the upcoming visit to Greenland by second lady Usha Vance and other U.S. officials is about “friendliness, not provocation.” Still, the president repeated his assertion that the U.S. could come to control Greenland.



































































































NUUK, Greenland (AP) — Lisa Sólrun Christiansen gets up at 4 a.m. most days and gets to work knitting thick wool sweaters coveted by buyers around the world for their warmth and colorful patterns celebrating Greenland's traditional Inuit culture.

Her morning routine includes a quick check of the news, but these days the ritual shatters her peace because of all the stories about U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on her homeland.

“I get overwhelmed,'' Christiansen said earlier this month as she looked out to sea, where impossibly blue icebergs floated just offshore.

The daughter of Inuit and Danish parents, Christiansen, 57, cherishes Greenland. It is a source of immense family pride that her father, an artist and teacher, designed the red-and-white Greenlandic flag.

“On his deathbed he talked a lot about the flag, and he said that the flag is not his, it's the people's,” she said. “And there's one sentence I keep thinking about. He said, ‘I hope the flag will unite the Greenlandic people.'''

Greenlanders are increasingly worried that their homeland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has become a pawn in the competition between the U.S., Russia and China as global warming opens up access to the Arctic. They fear Trump's aim to take control of Greenland, which holds rich mineral deposits and straddles strategic air and sea routes, may block their path toward independence.

Those fears were heightened Sunday when Usha Vance, the wife of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, announced she would visit Greenland later this week to attend the national dogsled race. Separately, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will visit a U.S. military base in northern Greenland. 




The announcement inflamed tensions sparked earlier this month when Trump reiterated his desire to annex Greenland just two days after Greenlanders elected a new parliament opposed to becoming part of the U.S. Trump even made a veiled reference to the possibility of military pressure, noting the U.S. bases in Greenland and musing that “maybe you'll see more and more soldiers go there.”

News of the visit drew an immediate backlash from local politicians, who described it as a display of U.S. power at a time they are trying to form a government.

“It must also be stated in bold that our integrity and democracy must be respected without any external interference,'' outgoing Prime Minister Múte Boroup Egede said.

Greenland, part of Denmark since 1721, has been moving toward independence for decades. It's a goal most Greenlanders support, though they differ on when and how that should happen. They don't want to trade Denmark for an American overlord.

The question is whether Greenland will be allowed to control its own destiny at a time of rising international tensions when Trump sees the island as key to U.S. national security.

While Greenland has limited leverage against the world's greatest superpower, Trump made a strategic mistake by triggering a dispute with Greenland and Denmark rather than working with its NATO allies in Nuuk and Copenhagen, said Otto Svendsen, an Arctic expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Trump's actions, he says, have united Greenlanders and fostered a greater sense of national identity.

“You have this feeling of pride and of self-determination in Greenland that the Greenlanders are not, you know, cowed by this pressure coming from Washington,” Svendsen said. “And they're doing everything in their power to make their voices heard.”

Denmark recognized Greenland's right to independence at a time of its choosing under the 2009 Greenland Self-Government Act, which was approved by local voters and ratified by the Danish parliament. The right to self-determination is also enshrined in the United Nations charter, approved by the U.S. in 1945.

But Trump is more focused on the economic and security needs of the U.S. than the rights of smaller nations. Since returning to office in January, he has pressured Ukraine into giving the U.S. access to valuable mineral resources, threatened to reclaim the Panama Canal and suggested that Canada should become the 51st state.

Now he has turned his attention to Greenland, a territory of 56,000 people, most from indigenous Inuit backgrounds.

Greenland guards access to the Arctic at a time when melting sea ice has reignited competition for energy and mineral resources and attracted an increased Russian military presence. The Pituffik Space Base on the island's northwest coast supports missile warning and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.

Before Trump's re-election, Greenlanders hoped to leverage this unique position to help the country achieve independence. Now they fear it has made them vulnerable.

Cebastian Rosing, who works for a water taxi firm that offers tours around the Nuuk fjord, said he's frustrated that Trump is trying to take over just as Greenland has begun to assert its autonomy and celebrate its Inuit origins.

“It's so weird to defend (the idea) that our country is our country because it's always been our country,” he said. “We're just getting our culture back because of colonialism.”

It's not that Greenlanders don't like the U.S. They have welcomed Americans for decades.

The U.S. effectively occupied Greenland during World War II, building a string of air and naval bases.

After the war, President Harry Truman's government offered to buy the island because of “the extreme importance of Greenland to the defense of the United States.” Denmark rejected the proposal but signed a long-term base agreement.

When Trump resurrected the proposal during his first term, it was quickly rejected by Denmark and dismissed as a headline-grabbing stunt. But now Trump is pursuing the idea with renewed energy.

During a speech earlier this month he told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed to take control of Greenland to protect its national security. “I think we're going to get it,” Trump said. “One way or the other.”

Even so, Trump has his admirers in Greenland.

And there is no greater fan than Jørgen Boassen. When he spoke to The Associated Press, Boassen wore a T-shirt featuring a photo of Trump with his fist in the air and blood streaming down his face after an assassination attempt last year. Included was the slogan, “American Badass.”

Boassen works for an organization called American Daybreak, which was founded by former Trump official Thomas Dans and promotes closer ties between the U.S. and Greenland.

The former bricklayer, who describes himself as “110%″ Inuit, has a litany of complaints about Denmark, most stemming from what he sees as mistreatment of local people during colonial rule. In particular, he cites Inuit women who say they were fitted with birth control devices without their permission during the 1970s.

Trump must act to secure America's back door, Boassen says, because Denmark has failed to guarantee Greenland's security.

But even he wants Greenland to be independent, a U.S. ally but not the 51st state.

What he has in mind is something more like the free-association agreement the Marshall Islands negotiated with the U.S. when it became independent in 1986. That agreement recognizes the Pacific archipelago as a sovereign nation that conducts its own foreign policy but gives the U.S. control over defense and security. 

“We're in 2025,'' Boassen said. “So I don't believe they can come here and take over.”

Whatever happens, most Greenlanders agree that the island's fate should be up to them, not Trump.

“We have to stand together,'' Christiansen said, her knitting needles clicking and clacking.

LONDON (AP) — The urgent care doctor cocked an eyebrow at Mari Santos and her American accent.

It was four days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, and Santos was a student with a stomach bug in the first weeks of an overseas semester in Glasgow, Scotland. A doctor arrived to see her after a six-hour wait. But before asking what ailed her, he said this: “Interesting time to be an American, I suppose.”

Until then, Santos, 20, had not been thinking about Trump — just her 104-degree fever and concern about being sick while abroad. But the president and his triumphant return to the White House, she says, were on her physician's mind, giving the American University student an instant education in geopolitics. The lesson, as she sees it: “There's a kind of chilling in the air.” 

“I knew that maybe that Europe is not in general big fan of American politics,” Santos said, “but I didn't expect it to be such like a personal thing.”

The United States and its center of gravity occupy a unique space in the international conversation. People the world over talk about America — its policies, its proclivities, its place in the world. They have for generations. They did it during the Iraq War. They did it during the first Trump administration. 

And two months into Trump 2.0, at least in many European and English-speaking countries, it's happening again — sometimes even more intensely. 

Answering for America under the new Trump administration is becoming a delicate experience for some of the estimated 5 million U.S. citizens living in other countries.

From Santos in Scotland to others in New Zealand, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, Republican and Democratic expats alike told The Associated Press in recent weeks that the moment they are revealed to be American changes virtually every conversation to, in essence, “What about Trump?” 

At its root, this change is about whom to trust among those thought until now to be allies, in world politics and in life. Trump, known for insisting the truth is what he says it is, is now the voice of America — not VOA, the independent news service that told the nation's story for eight decades until he silenced it March 16. The president himself has set an example in which trust is almost beside the point. 

“Who do I trust? I mean, who do you trust? Do you trust anybody?” he said during an interview last month with The Spectator, when asked how much he trusts people like Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post.

What comes after the revelation that someone is American, U.S. citizens overseas say, are awkward questions, pauses and euphemisms — but almost always a reference to America under Trump in 2025.

“Before this year, the typical follow-up would be asking where exactly I'm from and what brought me to France,” said Anthony Mucia, 31, a Nebraska native who lives in Toulouse, France and has been overseas for six years. “Twice now, the first thing someone asked me was, ‘Are you glad to be in France now?'” He also gets looks that he interprets as “a bit of ‘shock' or ‘uneasiness.' Almost like it automatically turned into an embarrassing topic.”

What's bending these interactions, expats say, is Trump's flurry of orders and statements that have upended 80 years of international order and spooked markets.

He's talked about how the U.S. will “one way or the other” capture Greenland from Denmark, “take back” Panama and make Canada the 51st U.S. state. He wants to empty and develop war-battered Gaza, and has cut off U.S. aid to the world's neediest people. He's falsely blamed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting the Russian invasion and ended a White House meeting with Zelenskyy after berating the Ukrainian leader. Trump has let Europe's leaders know that the U.S. is not a staunch ally in facing the Russian threat. And he's set off tariff wars with China, Canada and Mexico. 

Not smoothing the American experience overseas is the backlash developing against Trump's association with Elon Musk and Tesla, which has fueled growing boycott movements. People are joining Facebook groups to exchange ideas about how to avoid U.S. products. Feelings are especially strong across the Nordic region — particularly Denmark, where Trump's moves have set “the Danish Viking blood boiling,” one man told The Associated Press.

So far, the interactions are less hostile than wary, Americans overseas say. But anti-U.S. sentiment is emerging as a concern on the cusp of what's expected to be a record-setting international travel season for Americans. 

Jake Lamb, 32, moved from Colorado to Auckland, New Zealand in 2023. He said says he's “noticed a significant shift in the types and frequency of questions I'm asked” over the past year. Kiwis remain friendly about it, but they've been saying they might have to “hide” Lamb or vouch that he's “one of the good ones” if Trump escalates conflicts with former allies. He thinks that the good humor belies wariness.

“I am concerned that it may become difficult for some not to hold individual Americans responsible,” Lamb, a volunteer coordinator for a charity and who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris, said in an email.

Elizabeth Van Horne, 33, has lived in France since 2013. For years, she said, people would ask “why on Earth I'd come to live in France if I could live in the U.S: ‘It's so beautiful, there's so much potential, so much opportunity, like living in a TV show.'”

“Now, that romanticized image has completely changed,” Van Horne, a Democrat, said in an email. Early in March, a postal worker told her it's sad to watch.

“For me,” she said, “that conversation summed it up: ‘Je suis desole pour vous' — ‘I'm sorry for you.'”

Georganne Burke, a Syracuse, N.Y., native living in Ottawa, supported Trump in all three elections and is the chairwoman of Republicans Overseas in Canada. She's a dual citizen, which makes her something like the Peace Bridge that links the two nations in Buffalo, N.Y.

Trump's tariff war, his manner and his provocative talk about how Canada “only works” as the 51st U.S. state “has everybody's hair on fire,” she said in an interview. Burke, 77, says she's received threats and had a tense talk with an anti-Trump co-worker. People ask her, “How could anyone vote for him?”

An invitation to speak about trade near the end of March, she says, came with the organizer saying that he was “pretty sure that most of the people will be polite.” Burke accepted the invitation.

She says anti-American sentiment was bad during the Iraq war under President George W. Bush in 2003. But now it's different. 

“Then, it was kind of more on the politicians,” as the targets of public ire, Burke said in a recent interview. “Now, it's much more personal.” 

Burke's counterpart in London, Greg Swenson of Republicans Overseas UK, says walking around as an American in another country remains more positive than negative. In interviews with media outlets, he readily acknowledges Trump can be “obnoxious.” But Swenson, 62, is an investment banker, and he says the president and America remain good for business.

“In the private capital world, which is not affected by day-to-day (market) volatility, there is just a huge amount of optimism,” Swenson said. That means, he says, that investors want to work with U.S. vendors and customers, seeking American “credibility” through “an affiliation with the president.”

As for what people overseas think of Americans right now: A survey of social media, neighbors and others shows plenty are curious and concerned. When an American dad posted on Reddit his worry that his family won't be welcomed in Ireland, an Irish dad who asked the AP to identify him by his Reddit handle responded this way:

“A lot of people like me are really, really alienated and angry at the US and Americans,” wrote MDMB13. “But the good news is we're Irish so you'll never know because (we) bury our feelings in a far-off place and let them fester over decades.” He ended his comment with a smile emoji.

UPDATE: Lawyer for Oscar-winning Palestinian director detained by Israeli forces says he will be released

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary film “ No Other Land ” on Monday in the occupied West Bank before he was detained by the Israeli military, according to two of his fellow directors and other witnesses.

The filmmaker Hamdan Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya, according to attorney Lea Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they were being held at a military base for medical treatment, but she said Tuesday morning that she had not been able to reach them and had no further information on their whereabouts.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

“We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us,” Adra told The Associated Press. “This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment.”

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed. The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.




“No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.

The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened the documentary.

Adra said that settlers entered the village Monday evening shortly after residents broke the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A settler — who according to Adra frequently attacks the village — walked over to Ballal's home with the military, and soldiers shot in the air. Ballal's wife heard her husband being beaten outside and scream “I'm dying,” according to Adra.

Adra then saw the soldiers lead Ballal, handcuffed and blindfolded, from his home into a military vehicle. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said Ballal's blood was still splattered on the ground outside his own front door.

Some of the details of Adra's account were backed up by another eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.

A group of 10-20 masked settlers with stones and sticks also assaulted activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, smashing their car windows and slashing tires to make them flee the area, one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the AP.

Video provided by the Center for Jewish Nonviolence showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.

The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards — and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.

During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has gifted to Donald Trump a portrait he commissioned of the U.S. president.

Putin gave the painting to Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow earlier this month, the Russian president's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a response to a journalist's question, declining further comment.

The gift was first mentioned last week by Witkoff in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Witkoff told Carlson that Trump “was clearly touched” by the portrait, which he described as “beautiful.”

Witkoff met Putin after talks with Russian officials about trying to end the war in Ukraine. Ceasefire talks continued Monday in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. officials met their Russian counterparts, a day after meeting with Ukrainian negotiators.

During his interview with Carlson, Witkoff described Putin's gift as “gracious” and recalled how Putin told him he had prayed for Trump last year when he heard the then-candidate for the U.S. presidency had been shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. “He was praying for his friend,” Witkoff said, recounting Putin's comments. 

In 2018, Putin gave then-President Trump a soccer ball that the Secret Service had checked for listening devices before Trump gave it to his son — a precaution that hearkened back to a Soviet-era gift to a U.S. diplomat that turned out to be bugged.

In 1945, a carving of the Great Seal of the United States was given as a gift from Soviet school children to then-U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in his office for six years allowing the Soviet Union to eavesdrop on his conversations until the State Department discovered that it contained a covert listening device.




It was not immediately known if the portrait Putin gave to Trump had been examined for bugs. The White House hasn't commented on the portrait.

Trump isn't the first sitting president to receive a gift from Putin. In 2021, Putin gave then-President Joe Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2013, he reportedly sent then-President Barack Obama porcelain plates and espresso cups.

This apparently isn't the first portrait of a U.S. leader Putin has sent, either. In 2014, the Russia president reportedly sent to George H.W. Bush a portrait of the former president on his 90th birthday.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Monday the claim that white people are being persecuted in his country is a “completely false narrative.” It was his latest attempt to push back against allegations made by U.S. President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and some white minority groups in South Africa.

South African-born Musk, who has regularly accused South Africa's Black-led government of being anti-white, repeated a claim this weekend in a social media post that some of the country's political figures are “actively promoting white genocide.”

Ramaphosa said in his weekly message to the nation that South Africans “should not allow events beyond our shores to divide us or turn us against each other.”

“In particular, we should challenge the completely false narrative that our country is a place in which people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution.”

Ramaphosa did not mention names, but his denial was a reference to the allegations by Trump and others that South Africa is deliberately mistreating a white minority group known as Afrikaners by encouraging violent attacks on their farms and introducing a law designed to seize their land. 

The allegations were central to an executive order issued by Trump last month cutting funding to South Africa to punish the government, while offering Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S.




Afrikaners are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa more than 300 years ago. They were at the heart of the apartheid government that systematically oppressed non-whites, although South Africa has been largely successful at reconciling its many racial groups after apartheid ended in 1994.

In his post on X, influential Trump adviser Musk cited a political rally last Friday in South Africa where Black leaders of a far-left opposition party sang a song that has the lyrics “Kill the Boer, the farmer.” Boer is a word that refers to an Afrikaner.

“Very few people know that there is a major political party in South Africa that is actively promoting white genocide,” Musk wrote. He linked to a video of the rally.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X late Monday that the song “is a chant that incites violence. South Africa's leaders and politicians must take action to protect Afrikaner and other disfavored minorities. The United States is proud to offer those individuals who qualify for admission to our nation amid this continued horrible threat of violence.”

The party in question, the Economic Freedom Fighters, is the fourth biggest in Parliament and a political opponent of Ramaphosa's African National Congress. It won 9.5% of the vote in last year's national election. It has come under scrutiny for stirring racial tensions before and for singing the song, which was used during apartheid as a call to fight against government oppression.

The song's modern-day use has been criticized by some in South Africa, including by other political parties, and a group representing Afrikaners challenged its use in court. It was ruled hate speech and effectively banned by a court more than a decade ago.

But it was the subject of several other legal cases before a 2022 ruling found that it was not hate speech and protected under freedom of speech because there was no proof it incited violence. The EFF says it is a historic chant that shouldn't be taken literally and has sometimes changed the lyrics to “kiss the Boer.”

Since Trump's executive order, the South African government has sought to dispel what it says is misinformation over white farmers, who are sometimes victims of violent attacks in their homes. The government has condemned the attacks, but experts say there is no evidence of any widespread targeting of whites and they are in fact part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates, which affect all races.

The group representing Afrikaners says the police have sometimes undercounted farm homicides in official statistics. It recently said it had figures showing there were eight farm homicides in the three-month period between October and December last year when police only recorded one. 

There were a total of 6,953 homicides across South Africa during that same time period, according to the police statistics.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Five-year-old Sila Abu Aqlan curled her lip in concentration as she practiced walking for the first time on a prosthetic leg at a clinic in Gaza City. The foot of the new leg had a little pink sneaker with a lacy frill, matching her pink hoodie.

It has been nearly 15 months since the little girl's leg was amputated after it was left severely burned from an Israeli airstrike. Finally, she is being fit for a prosthetic.

One of the most shocking sights in Gaza's war has been the thousands of children with amputated limbs from Israel's bombardment. The U.N.'s humanitarian aid organization OCHA called it the “largest cohort of child amputees in modern history.”

Throughout the 17-month war, supplies and services for children and adults with amputations have fallen far short of demand. Gaza's ceasefire that began in mid-January offered a window for aid agencies to bring in an increased number of prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, crutches and other devices.

Still, it only covered about 20% of the total need, said Loay Abu Saif, head of a disability program run by the aid group Medical Aid for Palestine, or MAP.

The window slammed shut when Israel barred entry of all medical supplies as well as food, fuel and other aid on March 2. Israel's resumpton of its military campaign last week, killing hundreds of Palestinians, has only added to the ranks of amputees.

With help limited, children wrestle with the psychological pain of losing a limb along with other traumas.

Sila's mother, father and sisters were all killed in an airstrike on her home in December 2023. Sila suffered severe burns to her right leg. A month of treatment had little effect, and Sila would scream in excruciating pain, her aunt Yasmine al-Ghofary said. Doctors amputated her leg above the knee.

“I try as much as I can to make her happy. But the truth is, there's only so much she can be happy. Pain is pain, and amputation is amputation,” al-Ghofary said. 

Sila sees other girls playing and tries to keep up with them using her walker but falls down. “She says, 'Why am I like this? Why am I not like them?” said al-Ghofary.

In October 2023, 11-year-old Reem lost her hand when an airstrike hit nearby as her family fled their home in Gaza City.

Reem can no longer dress on her own, brush her hair or tie her shoes. She gets angry and hits her siblings if she can't find someone to help her, her mother said. Other times, she isolates herself and just watches other children playing.

“Once Reem told her dad that she wished to die,” said her mother, who goes by the traditional name, Umm Reem. “In another instance, we were talking about meat, and she said, ‘Slaughter me like a sheep,' and she was laughing.”

Some 3,000 to 4,000 children in Gaza had suffered amputations as of November 2024, according to Jamal al-Rozzi and Hussein ِAbu Mansour, two prominent experts with rehabilitation programs in the territory who spoke with The Associated Press.

Up to 17,500 adults and children suffered severe limb injuries, leaving them in need of rehabilitation and assistance, the World Health Organization estimated in September.

Throughout the war, hospitals lacked medicines that could have averted amputations. Doctors describes cutting off limbs because of infections that should have been easily treated.

In its campaign in Gaza, Israel has struck homes and shelters with families inside almost daily.

Gaza's Health Ministry on Monday put out a list of the names of more than 15,000 children, 17 and younger, killed by Israel's offensive. The list included nearly 5,000 children younger than 6, including 876 infants who had not reached a year in age.

Israel's offensive has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians of all ages and wounded more than 113,000, according to the ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Nearly 90% of the population of some 2.3 million have been displaced, and vast areas of Gaza have been destroyed.

Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others. Israel says it is targeting Hamas and blames the group for civilian deaths because it operates in residential areas.

Last May, 13-year-old Moath Abdelaal's leg was amputated above the knee after an Israeli airstrike in the southern city of Rafah.

The family had to flee to a tent camp outside the neighboring city of Khan Younis. During the ceasefire, they moved back to their hometown Jabaliya in northern Gaza, but their home had been destroyed, so they live in a tent by the ruins, said his father, Hussein Abdelaal.

Moath's psychological state is worsening, his father said. Moving with crutches around the rubble is difficult. Doctors had to amputate more from his leg, almost up to his hip, because of complications. The boy learned that a number of his friends in the neighborhood had been killed, Abdelaal said.

“He has been having a hard time coping with his new situation. He's not sleeping well next to his siblings. It's difficult to see our son like that,” said Abdelaal.

Sila is being treated at the Artificial Limbs and Polio Center in Gaza City, a program launched by the International Committee of the Red Cross that has provided physical therapy, wheelchairs and prosthetics to hundreds of Palestinians suffering from amputations or paralysis. 

But supplies are limited. Wheelchairs are urgently needed, with 50 to 60 people a day asking for them in northern Gaza alone, said Mahmoud Shalabi with MAP. 

Al-Rozzi, executive director of the National Rehabilitation Society in the Gaza Strip, said Israel blocks materials to manufacture prosthetics from entering Gaza on grounds they could have dual or military uses. 

COGAT, the Israeli military body overseeing aid, said there have never been limitations on medical supplies to Gaza, including wheelchairs, prosthetics and crutches.

Some child amputees have been evacuated out of Gaza for treatment. But the pace of medical evacuations has remained slow, at a few dozen a day, and was reduced after Israel's strikes last week. As many as 13,000 patients of all kinds are waiting their chance to get out. 

Asmaa al-Nashash wants nothing more than for her 11-year-old son Abdulrahman to go abroad for a prosthetic leg.

The boy was selling items from a stand at a U.N. school-turned-shelter in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp when an airstrike hit, she said. Shrapnel tore through his leg, and doctors couldn't save it.

Since then, he often sits alone playing games on her phone because he can't play football with other children, she said. Other kids bully him, calling him the “one-legged boy.”

“My heart gets torn into pieces when I see him like this and I can do nothing for him,” she said.

Anti-government protesters in Turkey clashed with police on Monday amid growing demonstrations over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators and several protesters were arrested.

A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

In a televised address on Monday following a Cabinet meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused CHP chairman Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order.

The Turkish opposition staged a rally outside Istanbul City Hall on Monday evening in support of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Thousands of protesters held flags and placards and chanted slogans.

ISTANBUL (AP) — A media union said Turkish authorities arrested several journalists at their homes in a crackdown Monday, amid growing protests over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

The Disk-Basin-Is media workers' union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people's right to learn the truth.” It called for their immediate release.

The social media platform X said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organizations, journalists and political figures in Turkey.




A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized.

“Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Yerlikaya said on social media.

The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organizations and others had criminal records.

Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor. There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday. He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness.

“I'm working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said.

The mayor's jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.

The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.” The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.

In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan accused the opposition party's chairman Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order instead of addressing the alleged corruption. He also said he would be held to account for the protests.

“I have made this call several times before, and today I am repeating it: Stop disturbing our citizens' peace with provocations. If you have the courage, account for the corruption, theft, bribes taken, and irregularities committed,” Erdogan said.

Erdogan said: “of course, there will be political accountability for these actions in parliament and legal accountability in court.”

Addressing demonstrators outside city hall for a sixth consecutive night, Ozel urged supporters to boycott a number of pro-government companies and television stations. He also challenged Erdogan and the Istanbul chief public prosecutor to broadcast Imamoglu's trial live on state television, to allow the jailed mayor to respond to the allegations and “expose their lies.”

About 15 minutes after Ozel addressed the crowd, police intervened with tear gas and plastic pellets to disperse the demonstrators.

Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said.

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.

Thousands of protesters rallied outside Istanbul's city hall to voice anger over what they see as a crackdown on democratic freedoms. Tensions remained high as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas minutes after opposition leader Ozel's daily address concluded.

Protesters, many young and masked to avoid identification, hurled harsh words to the police and Erdogan and booed those in their ranks who threw bottles and flares at security forces to avoid elevated violence akin to Sunday's police interventions.

“I think it can't get any worse than this,” said one female demonstrator who did not want to be named due to fear of detention. “We will never accept this. If necessary, I will come every day.”

Others echoed her sentiment. “There is a coup against our democracy right now,” said an older male protester who also wished to remain anonymous. “We are here for our children, for the youth. We want them to be free so this country can be more beautiful.”

Several protesters said their aim was not to support specific politicians but to stand up for the Turkish Republic. 

“I would like to say my name, but I cannot,” one man said. “The reason I came here is not Ozel or Imamoglu. I came here to defend my own rights as the youth of Ataturk (founder of the Turkish Republic).

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 43 protesters were detained Monday, and condemned what he called “vile insults” toward Erdogan and his late mother, vowing not to tolerate “such indecency.”

Ali Mahir Basarir, a legislator from the main opposition Republican People's Party, told the AP that the authorities used “pre-determined provocateurs” to justify crackdowns. 

“They start attacking the protesters before the rally is over,” he said. “All they want is a good future. They are exercising their constitutional rights.” and urged the police to not mistreat protesters.

Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara's mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said Monday. 

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

Sixty-five people, including 14 children, were injured in a Russian strike on Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy, according to the regional prosecutor's office. The strike damaged several residential buildings and a school on Monday afternoon.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday commented on the talks between the US and Russia, who he referred to as “the war team”, in Saudi Arabia.

Russian troops launched a missile strike Monday afternoon in Sumy city center, hitting residential buildings and a school. Children at the school were being evacuated, and all were safe, said regional head Volodymyr Artiukh.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. negotiators worked on a proposed partial ceasefire in the 3-year-old war in Ukraine on Monday, meeting representatives from Russia one day after holding separate talks with a team from Kyiv.



It has been a struggle to reach even a limited, 30-day ceasefire — which Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week -- with both sides continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.



One major sticking point is what targets would be off-limits to strike, even after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, because the parties disagree.



While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would also like to see infrastructure like railways and ports protected.

Talks Monday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh were expected to address some of those differences, as well as a potential pause in attacks in the Black Sea to ensure the safety of commercial shipping. Russian state media reported late Monday local time that the talks had ended.





AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on US-Russia officials holding talks right now in Saudi Arabia on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine.







In an exchange with reporters at the White House, Trump said territorial lines and the potential for U.S. ownership of a key nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine have been part of the talks.



Last week, Trump floated the idea of the U.S. taking control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The six-reactor facility — one of the world's largest — was seized by Russia early in the war.

(Iryna Rybakova/Ukraine's 93rd Mechanized Brigade via AP)





“Some people are saying the United States should own the power plant — work it that way because we have the expertise” to get the plant operating, Trump said. “Something like that would be fine with me.”



Since falling under Russian control, the plant's conditions have deteriorated. While its reactors have been shut down for years, they still require power and staff to maintain cooling systems and safety features. The facility is connected to Ukraine's energy grid without producing electricity.



U.S. and Russian representatives met in the morning in Riyadh, Russia's state Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The U.S. and Ukrainian teams met Sunday. 



Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, said the delegation remained in Riyadh on Monday and expected to meet again with the Americans. In his nightly address Monday, Zelenskyy said representatives from Ukraine and the U.S. will meet again, although he did not specify when.



Grigory Karasin, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house and a participant in Monday's talks, told the Interfax news agency the negotiations were going on in a “creative way” and that the U.S. and Russian delegations “understand each other's views.”



Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine continued to launch attacks across their borders.



The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday a Ukrainian drone attacked an oil pumping station in southern Russia that serves a pipeline carrying Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea oil to the Russian port of Novorossiisk for export. It said the drone was downed before it could reach the pumping station.



Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday the Russian military has been fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days. He has accused Ukraine of derailing the partial ceasefire with attacks on Russia's energy facilities, including a gas metering station in Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region.



Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station, a claim Peskov called “absurd.”



Zelenskyy said Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this.”



He added that Ukraine's partners — “the U.S., Europe, and others around the world” — should increase pressure on Russia “to stop this terror.”

Zelenskyy has emphasized that Ukraine is open to Trump's proposal of a full, 30-day ceasefire. Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.



Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at talks and that a pause in hostilities by both countries in the Black Sea would “naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”



Asked about reports speculating that China might send peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any peace deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded Monday with an unequivocal no. 



“Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent,” Guo said at a briefing. 



China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but has not given any weapons or sent any personnel. China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.



A “massive targeted cyberattack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company wrote on Telegram, adding that it was working to restore its systems on Monday. The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules but disrupted its online booking system.



“The railway continues to operate despite physical attacks on the infrastructure, and even the most vile cyberattacks cannot stop it,” the company wrote.



Meanwhile, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces claimed Monday it destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with the use of U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems. It published drone footage on its Telegram page of what it said was the attack.



The strikes occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces, the group said.



A Russian missile struck the northern city of Sumy, across the border from Russia's Kursk region, hitting residential buildings and a school, said regional head Volodymyr Artiukh. Children at the school were being evacuated at the time, and all were safe, he added.



But the regional prosecutor's office said 65 people were injured, including 14 children.



Earlier, Russia fired 99 attack and decoy drones into Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's air force, of which 57 were shot down.





Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.

PARIS (AP) — French actor Gérard Depardieu went on trial Monday in Paris on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a movie set, in a case seen as a potential watershed for the #MeToo movement in France.

Depardieu, 76, is accused of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during filming in 2021 of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”). 

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.

Depardieu denies any wrongdoing.

To reporters massed outside the courtroom, he briefly said “I'm ok.” Inside, he told the judges that he was prepared to answer the court's questions.

“We will be able to show in an impartial, objective and incontestable manner that all of the accusations are lies,” his attorney, Jérémie Assous, told journalists.

“The truth will be obvious and the truth is on our side,” he said.

Depardieu's long and storied career has turned the trial into a post- #MeToo test of the willingness of France and its movie industry to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.

Depardieu has been a darling of French cinemagoers for decades and was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.

But his alleged boorish behavior off-screen has also long made headlines. He has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some others were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.




Feminist and historian Florence Montreynaud described Depardieu's court appearance as “a historic moment” for women's rights, as she joined other campaigners who demonstrated outside the court. A dozen chanted “Sexist violence, complicit judicial system” as they danced to techno music.

“Times are changing. #MeToo has swept through. At last, mentalities are changing,” Montreynaud said to French broadcaster BFMTV.

The trial also follows in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gisèle Pelicot, whose bravery put the spotlight on sexual violence in France. She demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for a horrific catalogue of abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would help make shame change sides.

France has often been ambivalent — even resistant — toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.

At the time of the alleged assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024, prosecutors requested that it go to trial.

Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped the set dresser with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. She says the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.

The assistant director alleged that Depardieu groped her both on set and in the street.

The women sat side by side in court. The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified. Neither has done so in this case.

The trial is expected to last at least two days, but could be extended beyond Tuesday, if the chief judge wants more time. The trial was initially scheduled for October, but then postponed because of Depardieu's health. A verdict is expected at a later date. 

Depardieu grasped his lawyer's shoulder as he strode calmly into the courtroom. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he's fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don't exceed six hours, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours.

Beyond giving his name, Depardieu didn't testify Monday. Instead, his lawyer took up much of the time, raising what he described as legal issues and seeking to cast doubt on witness testimony and the police investigation. The attorney alleged, without providing evidence, that police acted under instructions from magistrates who led the investigation to “make Depardieu fall.”

Depardieu listened intently, sometimes nodding.

One of the plaintiffs burst into tears when her lawyer read a message she wrote about the alleged sexual assault. Sitting by her side, the other accuser put a hand on her shoulder in a gesture of empathy.

The plaintiffs' lawyers said they would lay out their evidence later.

One of the lawyers, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said Depardieu had apologized to her client at the time. “So why apologize if you haven't done anything?” 

It was unclear what the apology message was about.

Durrieu Diebolt had previously said that four additional women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Depardieu would testify.

In an open letter published in October 2023, Depardieu wrote: “Never, but never, have I abused a woman.”

The actor had dropped out of sight in recent months, his film career seemingly on hold. But he still has friends in the industry. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's government on Monday apologized to families of victims of the country's military dictatorship whose remains could be among those found in a clandestine mass grave 35 years ago. 

Dozens of families are still waiting to know whether their parents, children, siblings and friends are in one of more than 1,000 blue bags discovered in 1990 in a ditch in a São Paulo cemetery in the isolated district of Perus. That was the first of many mass graves uncovered by Brazil's authorities after the end of the 21-year military rule in 1985.

The clandestine grave at the Dom Bosco cemetery also contained remains of several unidentified people who were not linked to the fight against Brazil's dictatorship. 

The official apology is part of a deal between prosecutors, family members and the State. It took place during Right to Truth Day, which is also celebrated in other countries.

Human Rights Minister Macaé Evaristo said the Brazilian State was neglectful in the identification process of the bags and bones found in Perus. For almost 25 years, the remains were held by three state universities and laboratories outside Brazil, but only a handful of families finally had their loved ones identified.

Evaristo said Brazil's government has invested about 200,000 Brazilian reais ($35,000) each year for the identification of bags from Perus, but agreed that is not enough to give peace to families of victims.




“What the Brazilian government has been doing is continuing the process of seeking investigation and accountability. We need to remember that our ministry was dismantled,” Evaristo said, in a reference to the 2019-22 presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, an advocate of the country's military dictatorship. “Families have the right to the truth. Brazilian society has the right to the truth.”

Families uncertain if their loved ones' remains were in the Perus mass grave attended the ceremony.

Gilberto Molina, who represented them, had his brother Flávio's remains finally identified in one of the bags in 2005. The Brazilian State only recognized it was responsible for the crime in his brother's third death certificate, early in 2019.

“It was a funeral of almost 50 years. For some other families it still is an even longer one,” Molina said. “I hope that every family here still has perseverance in their quest for justice.”

Brazil's truth commission in 2014 reported that at least 434 people were killed and more than 100 disappeared completely during the country's military dictatorship. The disappearance of former lawmaker Rubens Paiva, as portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film “I'm Still Here” renewed public interest in the dictatorship's abuses, attracting an audience of more than 6 million in Brazil.

Nilmário Miranda, a former government minister and long-time human rights activist, said uncovering a mass grave with victims of the dictatorship in 1990 — only a few years after redemocratization — was a major affair led by then Sao Paulo Mayor Luiza Erundina. Faced with anonymous death threats, she put City Hall officers to oversee the searches.

“It was all under the rug of society, it was all hidden and you couldn't speak about it. That put the deal that ended the dictatorship in check, the one that spared torturers and executioners,” Miranda said, in a reference to Brazil's 1979 amnesty law that didn't punish crimes of the military during the regime.

That law could soon be partially reversed by Brazil's Supreme Court in cases of people who were killed then by state agents and had their remains vanished.

Antonio Pires Eustáquio, who became a manager at the Dom Bosco cemetery in 1976 and helped families in their quest for justice for decades, celebrated the apology.

“This can only happen in a democracy. Dictators don't apologize for their mistakes,” Eustáquio said. “I remember that at that time people always wondered whether I was going to be killed for I knew where the illegal ditch was. My being here means democracy won.”

But Crimeia Almeida, whose husband, her father-in-law and a brother-in-law went missing as guerrilla men about 50 years ago, said the state's apology is not enough.

“The apology is not enough. It is nice, we get emotional, but it doesn't solve the criminal act,” she said.

CAIRO (AP) — When the first explosions in Gaza this week started around 1:30 a.m., a visiting British doctor went to the balcony of a hospital in Khan Younis and watched the streaks of missiles light up the night before pounding the city. A Palestinian surgeon next to him gasped, “Oh no. Oh no.”

After two months of ceasefire, the horror of Israeli bombardment was back. The veteran surgeon told the visiting doctor, Sakib Rokadiya, they'd better head to the emergency ward.

Torn bodies soon streamed in, carried by ambulances, donkey carts or in the arms of terrified relatives. What stunned doctors was the number of children.

“Just child after child, young patient after young patient,” Rokadiya said. “The vast, vast majority were women, children, the elderly.”

This was the start of a chaotic 24 hours at Nasser Hospital, the largest hospital in southern Gaza. Israel shattered the ceasefire in place since mid-January with a surprise barrage that began early Tuesday and was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing more hostages and accepting changes in the truce's terms. It turned into one of the deadliest days in the 17-month war.

The aerial attacks killed 409 people across Gaza, including 173 children and 88 women, and hundreds more were wounded, according to the territory's Health Ministry, whose count does not differentiate between militants and civilians.

More than 300 casualties flooded into Nasser Hospital. Like other medical facilities around Gaza, it had been damaged by Israeli raids and strikes throughout the war, leaving it without key equipment. It was also running short on antibiotics and other essentials. On March 2, when the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire technically expired, Israel blocked entry of medicine, food and other supplies to Gaza.

Nasser Hospital's emergency ward filled with wounded, in a scene described to The Associated Press by Rokadiya and Tanya Haj-Hassan, an American pediatrician — both volunteers with the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. Wounded came from a tent camp sheltering displaced that missiles set ablaze and from homes struck in Khan Younis and Rafah, further south. 

One nurse was trying to resuscitate a boy sprawled on the floor with shrapnel in his heart. A young man with most of his arm gone sat nearby, shivering. A barefoot boy carried in his younger brother, around 4 years old, whose foot had been blown off. Blood was everywhere on the floor, with bits of bone and tissue.

“I was overwhelmed, running from corner to corner, trying to find out who to prioritize, who to send to the operating room, who to declare a case that's not salvageable,” said Haj-Hassan.

“It's a very difficult decision, and we had to make it multiple times,” she said in a voice message.

Wounds could be easy to miss. One little girl seemed OK – it just hurt a bit when she breathed, she told Haj-Hassan -- but when they undressed her they determined she was bleeding into her lungs. Looking through the curly hair of another girl, Haj-Hassan discovered she had shrapnel in her brain.

Two or three wounded at a time were squeezed onto gurneys and sped off to surgery, Rokadiya said.

He scrawled notes on slips of paper or directly on the patient's skin – this one to surgery, this one for a scan. He wrote names when he could, but many kids were brought in by strangers, their parents dead, wounded or lost in the mayhem. So he often wrote, “UNKNOWN.”

Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, an American trauma surgeon from California with the medical charity MedGlobal, rushed immediately to the area where the hospital put the worst-off patients still deemed possible to save.

But the very first little girl he saw -- 3 or 4 years old -- was too far gone. Her face was mangled by shrapnel. “She was technically still alive,” Sidhwa said, but with so many other casualties “there was nothing we could do.”

He told the girl's father she was going to die. Sidhwa went on to do some 15 operations, one after another.

Khaled Alserr, a Palestinian surgeon, and an Irish volunteer surgeon were doing the same. There was a 29-year-old woman whose pelvis was smashed, the webbing of veins around the bones was bleeding heavily. They did what they could in surgery, but she died 10 hours later in the intensive care unit.

There was a 6-year-old boy with two holes in his heart, two in his colon and three more in his stomach, Sidhwa said. They repaired the holes and restarted his heart after he went into cardiac arrest.

He, too, died hours later.

“They died because the ICU simply does not have the capacity to care for them,” Sidhwa said.

Ahmed al-Farra, head of the pediatric and obstetrics department, said that was in part because the ICU lacks strong antibiotics. 

Sidhwa recalled how he was at Boston Medical Center when the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing happened, killing three people and sending some 260 wounded to area hospitals.

Boston Medical “couldn't handle this influx of cases” seen at Nasser Hospital, he said. 

Rokadiya marveled at how the hospital staff took care of each other under duress. Workers circulated with water to give sips to doctors and nurses. Cleaners whisked away the bloody clothes, blankets, tissues and medical debris accumulating on the floors.

At the same time, some staff had their own family members killed in the strikes. 

Alserr, the Palestinian surgeon, had to go to the morgue to identify the bodies of his wife's father and brother.

“The only thing I saw was like a packet of meat and bones, melted and fractured,” he said in a voice message, without giving details on the circumstances their deaths. 

Another staffer lost his wife and kids. An anesthesiologist -- whose mother and 21 other relatives were killed earlier in the war -- later learned his father, his brother and a cousin were killed, Haj-Hassan said.

Around 85 people died at Nasser Hospital on Tuesday, including around 40 children from ages 1 to 17, al-Farra said.

Strikes continued throughout the week, killing several dozen more people. At least six prominent Hamas figures were among those killed Tuesday. 

Israel says it will keep targeting Hamas, demanding it release more hostages, even though Israel has ignored ceasefire requirements for it to first negotiate a long-term end to the war. Israel says it does not target civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because it operates among the population.

With Tuesday's bombardment, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also secured the return to his government of a right-wing party that had demanded a resumption of the war, solidifying his coalition ahead of a crucial budget vote that could have brought him down.

Haj-Hassan keeps checking in on children in Nasser's ICU. The girl with shrapnel in her brain still can't move her right side. Her mother came to see her, limping from her own wounds, and told Haj-Hassan that the little girl's sisters had been killed.

“I cannot process or comprehend the scale of mass killing and massacre of families in their sleep that we are seeing here,” Haj-Hassan said. “This can't be the world we're living in.”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top U.N. official in the world's youngest nation warned on Monday, lamenting the government's sudden postponement of the latest peace effort.

Calling the situation unfolding in the country “dire,” Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage “and put the interests of their people ahead of their own.”

There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.

More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 — and again until 2026.

The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.

Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar's home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.




Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating “particularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.”

He said Kiir and Machar don't trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.

“Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,” Haysom said.

“Given this grim situation,” he said, “we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.”

Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.

He said the U.N. takes the threat of the “ethnic transformation” of the conflict very seriously.

To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.

Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions “through dialogue rather than military confrontation.”

This story has corrected the war toll to 400,000, not 40,000.

ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The leader of the rebels who captured two key cities in eastern Congo tells The Associated Press that international sanctions and Congo's proposed minerals deal with the United States in search of peace will not stop the fighting. 

Meanwhile, neighboring countries announced a broader peace facilitation team to seek a resolution to the conflict.

With a $5 million bounty placed on the rebel leaders by Congo's government, “we will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,” said Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group.

Nangaa dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's comments last week that his country — whose mineral resources are estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world's technology — is looking for a minerals partnership with the U.S.

The U.S. government has not publicly spoken about any such deal, which local observers say could be similar to the Trump administration's recent offer to Ukraine to help end the war with Russia.

“This problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,” Nangaa told the AP over the weekend. “Trying to bribe U.S. with mines can undermine U.S. credibility.”

The rebel leader also rejected the outcome of last week's meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without his group's involvement would fail. He said the rebels can only have a dialogue with Congo's government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict.




“Anything regarding us which are done without us, it's against us,” Nangaa said.

Since launching a major escalation of their decadelong fighting with Congolese forces in January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in eastern Congo, prompting fears of regional war involving neighbors whose militaries are also on the ground.

Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out of talks facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders. After Angola's president and chairperson of the African Union, Joao Lourenco, withdrew as the key mediator on Monday, southern and eastern African leaders announced at a joint summit that a panel of five former African presidents to help seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

The panel will appoint a mediator to replace the Angolan leader, the president's office in Congo said Tuesday in a statement posted on X.

Also Monday, the M23 rebels said their planned withdrawal from the strategic town of Walikale, which they captured last week, is delayed because Congolese forces are allegedly still positioned in the area with attack drones. M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said their presence “compromises” peace initiatives. The AP has reached out to Congo's military.

Holding Walikale gives the rebels control of a road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions.

The M23 is the most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in eastern Congo. It is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.

Although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 forces from neighboring Rwanda supporting the rebels in Congo, Nangaa asserted that the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address “the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country.”

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In the latest twist in South Korea's ongoing political crisis, the country's Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago.

The court's ruling on Monday marks just one front in the deepening turmoil as it simultaneously weighs the far more consequential case of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose December impeachment over his brief but stunning martial law decree has left the country's leadership in limbo for months.

Here's a look at the court's decision and what's ahead: 

The prime minister typically holds limited authority as the country's second-highest official. But Han, a career bureaucrat who has held various government roles since the 1970s, was elevated as the government's caretaker after South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14.

Yoon's impeachment, triggered by his short-lived imposition of martial law that month, immediately suspended his presidential powers and put his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.

As acting president, Han quickly clashed with the liberal opposition Democratic Party, mainly over his refusal to comply with their demand to immediately fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench.




The composition of the court is a sensitive issue since removing Yoon from office requires the support of at least six justices, and a full bench would likely increase the chances of his ouster. Han said he wouldn't appoint the justices without bipartisan consent, but the Democrats accused him of siding with the conservatives in the governing People Power Party, which has been campaigning for Yoon's return to power.

Days after lawmakers impeached Han on Dec. 27, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who stepped in as acting president, filled two of the court's vacancies but refused to appoint a progressive justice nominated by the opposition.

Seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment, ruling that the accusations against him were either not illegal, not serious enough to warrant his removal or that the impeachment motion had failed to meet the required quorum when it passed through the National Assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.

After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies.

Han's case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. Han played no meaningful role in planning or enforcing Yoon's martial law, which was lifted by a legislative vote just hours after Yoon declared it on the night of Dec. 3.

But Han's reinstatement still struck a nerve with the Democrats, who have recently criticized the court for its prolonged deliberation on Yoon's case, which has fueled concerns about a divide among justices, potentially paving the way for Yoon's return.

Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, questioned why the court didn't consider Han's refusal to appoint the justices an impeachable offense. He said Han's actions amounted to a “clear and deliberate violation of his constitutional duty to form a government body.”

Lee also called for the court to make a swift decision on Yoon.

Yoon's office issued a statement welcoming Han's reinstatement, asserting that the court's decision proved the opposition's “excessive impeachment attempts were reckless, malicious, and politically motivated.”

Yoon, who is also facing a separate criminal trial on rebellion charges, stands accused of abusing military power, bypassing constitutional and legal protocols to impose martial law, and orchestrating a failed attempt to dissolve the legislature. But the Constitutional Court likely won't take a deep dive into Yoon's criminal allegations, as it's only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office.

Some experts say Han's testimony before lawmakers, investigators and the court regarding the short-lived martial law decree could possibly influence how justices rule on Yoon's case.

Among the various accusations against Yoon, the National Assembly has alleged that he bypassed a constitutional requirement to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Han's testimony has seemingly supported these claims.

While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation.

Han and other top officials, including Choi and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, have said they attempted to talk Yoon out of martial law, citing potential damage to the country's international reputation and economy. Under South Korea's constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.

U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country into Monday, with the group saying the one attack in the capital killed at least one person and wounded more than a dozen others.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country into early Tuesday, with the group saying one attack in the capital killed at least two people and wounded more than a dozen others.

The American strikes on the rebels, who threaten maritime trade and Israel, entered their 10th day without any sign of stopping. They are part of a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump targeting the rebel group while also trying to pressure Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor. 

So far, the U.S. has not offered any specifics on the sites it is striking, though Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the attacks have “taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer.” That's something so far that's not been acknowledged by the Houthis, though the rebels have downplayed their losses in the past and exaggerated their attacks attempting to target American warships.

“We've hit their headquarters,” Waltz told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “We've hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.” 

An apparent U.S. strike Sunday hit a building in a western neighborhood of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least two people and wounding 13 others, the rebel-controlled SABA news agency said, citing health officials. Footage released by the rebels showed the rubble of a collapsed building and pools of blood staining the gray dust covering the ground. 

AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on the U.S. firing on Yemen's capital as its campaign against the Houthi rebels continues.




A building next to the collapsed structure still stood, suggesting American forces likely used a lower-yield warhead in the strike. 

The Houthis also described American airstrikes targeting sites around the city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and Marib province, home to oil and gas fields still under the control of allies to Yemen's exiled central government. Those strikes continued into early Tuesday as the Houthis separately launched a missile attack on Israel.

The campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people immediately after they began March 15, started after the Houthis threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.

The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.

The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

South Korean firefighters on Tuesday appeared closer to containing the largest wildfires in the country's southeastern regions, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land across the country in the past five days.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.

Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days. 

Officials in Andong, a city in the country's southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters — including schools and indoor gyms — as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries. 

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple's national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.

The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.




More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.

The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest “serious” level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country's southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.

Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts. 

Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country's acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.

Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.

        Senior figures have expressed disbelief and outrage after a journalist revealed that he was sent sensitive information about military strikes in Yemen.
    

Senior figures in the Democratic party have called for the resignation of US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after he sent war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a Signal group chat that included a journalist.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported on Monday that the material shared ""contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing"". 

The US National Security Council stated that the text chain ""appears to be authentic"". 

Two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on 15 March, the US launched a wave of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. 

The revelation, with its clear implications for national security, has sent shockwaves through diplomatic and political circles, and many have called for investigations into how the blunder came about, while others have called for disciplinary action.

The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, led calls for Hegseth's resignation, calling for him to ""be fired"" if he did not quit. In his statement, Martin blasted Hegseth as ""unfit to lead the Defence Department even before he risked our national security"". 

""Hegseth should resign, and if he doesn't resign, he should be fired. It's crystal clear that our men and women in uniform deserve better – and that our national security cannot be left in Hegseth's incompetent and unqualified hands,"" Martin added.

Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the leak on a non-classified system as ""completely outrageous and shocks the conscience"", adding that it shows that Americans are increasingly angry ""due to the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defence.""

In his statement, Jeffries called for House Republicans to join Democrats ""in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach.” Separately, Jeffries told reporters that Hegseth ""has got to be the most unqualified person ever to lead the Pentagon in American history"".

Stressing the gravity of the situation in a floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: “This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time."" 

He underlined that using encrypted instant messaging service Signal, rather than government communications channels, was even more concerning than the leak to The Atlantic.

""It's bad enough that a private citizen was added to this chain, but it's far worse that sensitive military information was exchanged on an unauthorised application,"" Schumer explained.

It has also drawn reaction from former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose use of a private server for classified emails while Secretary of State became a major scandal during her 2016 campaign, with President Donald Trump repeatedly returning to the issue. 

“You have got to be kidding me,” Clinton responded in a post on X while sharing the eyes emoji and The Atlantic article.

Reaction from Republicans appeared more mixed, with many seeking to downplay the incident. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana was among those offering a lukewarm response. 

“A mistake was made. It happens,” Kennedy told media. Other figures in the party recognised the blunder, but refused to call for repercussions for those involved.

But Senate Armed Services Committee Chair, Roger Wicker, was among those telling reporters that ""mistakes were made"". 

“We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis,” the Mississippi Republican senator said, adding that the panel “definitely” plans to investigate the situation. 

Meanwhile, The Hill reported that Republican Senator John Cornyn, of Texas, a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters at the Capitol on Monday the inclusion of a journalist in the chat was “a huge screwup"".

“I mean, is there any other way to describe it,"" he added.

        Ekrem Imamoglu, who was set to be Erdogan's main rival in the 2028 election, was formally arrested and charged with corruption.
    

Tens of thousands of Turkish opposition protesters staged a rally outside Istanbul City Hall on Monday evening in support of the jailed Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The demonstrators waved flags and placards and chanted slogans while clashes between protesters and the police occurred. Several protestors were detained, and police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. 

Imamoglu was formally arrested by a court on Sunday and jailed pending trial on corruption charges, which further triggered the enormous protests on Monday night.

It followed an earlier detention last week, which sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations across Turkey, not seen in more than a decade.

According to the prosecutor's office, the Istanbul mayor was jailed for operating a criminal organisation, collecting bribes, indulging in extortion, unlawfully recording personal information, and bid-rigging.  

He is still being prosecuted, but a request to put him in jail on terror-related charges was denied.

The opposition and some government officials reject the accusations against him and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently. 

Meanwhile, in a televised address on Monday and following a Cabinet meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the opposition party CHP chairman, Ozgur Ozel, who has called for peaceful protests, of disturbing public order.

“I have made this call several times before, and today I am repeating it: Stop disturbing our citizens' peace with provocations,” Erdogan said. He also suggested Ozel would be held to account for the protests.

""Of course, there will be political accountability for these actions in parliament and legal accountability in court.""

Ozel is the head of the Republican People's Party, or CHP, to which Imamoglu belongs.

Imamoglu's imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major contender who could most likely defeat Erdogan in the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. 

“If you weren't here today if you hadn't rushed here since the first day, if you had yielded to tear gas and barricades, if you had gotten scared and remained at home, then today a caretaker appointed by Tayyip Erdogan would be residing here in this building,” said Ozgur Ozel Sunday night, pointing at city hall as he spoke to the massive crowd chanting anti-government slogans. 

Imamoglu is arguably the second most prominent politician in Turkey behind Erdogan, serving as mayor of the 16 million economic and cultural capital of the country.

        The foiled attack came as the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas paid a visit to Israel and the occupied Bank on Monday, where she met with both Israeli and Palestinian officials.
    

The Israeli military on Monday said it intercepted a long-range missile launched from Yemen over Jerusalem, triggering air raid sirens and explosions over the city. 

Local officials said they believed the missile to be from Houthi rebels in Yemen, where a handful of long-range missiles have been fired from in recent days following the resumption of war in Gaza by Israeli forces. 

There was no immediate claim of responsibility from the Houthis. 

The foiled attack came as the European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas paid a visit to Israel and met with the Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa in the West Bank on Monday.

Kallas, who met with both Israeli and Palestinian officials, conveyed the EU message, saying the bloc ""strongly opposes the resumption of war,"" which is ""causing an appalling and unacceptable loss of life in Gaza.""

""My message(s) during my visit here are very clear. Hamas must release all hostages. Israel must fully reinstate humanitarian aid to Gaza, and negotiations must resume,"" Kallas said at a press conference with the Palestinian Prime Minister in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

""We cannot remain silent about the grave violations of international law and rights of the Palestinian people,"" Mohammad Mustafa, the Palestinian Prime Minister, said.

According to Gaza's health ministry, more than 50,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the Israel-Hamas war after hundreds more deaths were added to the casualty toll following Israel's resumption of hostilities last week in its surprise wave of airstrikes. 

Israel blames Hamas for refusing to release the remaining hostages following the completion of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.

The January ceasefire put an end to over a year of fighting that had been sparked by Hamas' 7 October, 2023, onslaught on Israel, in which militants murdered about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured 251 others.

The majority of hostages were released in the first months following the Gaza war, while approximately 2,000 Palestinian detainees were exchanged for 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in January's truce deal. 

Hundreds of thousands of Gaza residents were permitted to return home by Israeli forces. 

The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the ceasefire's next phase. However, those talks, which called for Hamas to free the remaining 59 hostages in exchange for more Palestinian captives, a permanent ceasefire, and an Israeli departure, never began. 

35 of those hostages are believed to be dead.

        The head of the peacekeeping mission in the country said President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar must put the interests of the South Sudanese people first.
    

The top UN official in South Sudan has warned the country is on the brink of a renewed civil war after the government abruptly postponed the latest round of peace efforts.

Describing the situation as “dire”, Nicholas Haysom, the UN Special Representative and head of the peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, said on Monday that international efforts to support peace will only succeed if President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar are prepared to engage constructively and “put the interests of their people ahead of their own”.

South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, gained independence from Sudan in 2011, following decades of conflict. But by 2013, it descended into a civil war rooted in ethnic divisions, as forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, clashed with supporters of Machar, a Nuer.

The conflict claimed the lives of more than 400,000 people before a peace agreement establishing a unity government was signed in 2018. While elections were initially set for 2023, they have been postponed twice, and are now expected in 2026.

Recent tensions have flared in the north of the country, where government troops have been fighting a militia known as the White Army — widely believed to be aligned with Machar.

On 4 March, the White Army reportedly overran a military garrison in Nasir, prompting a forceful government response, including the surrounding of Machar's residence in the capital, Juba and the arrest of several of his allies. 

Days later, a UN helicopter evacuating government soldiers from Nasir came under fire, resulting in multiple fatalities, among them a South Sudanese general.

Haysom warned that tensions and violence are escalating as the elections approach, and that political competition between longtime rivals Kiir and Machar is intensifying.

He also noted that Kiir and Machar do not have sufficient trust in one another to demonstrate the leadership necessary to enforce the 2018 peace accord and steer South Sudan towards a secure and democratic path forward. 

“Given this grim situation, we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war,” Haysom added.

A return to conflict, he said, would risk repeating the horrors of 2013 and 2016, when violence devastated communities and displaced millions.

To help de-escalate the crisis, the UN peacekeeping mission, which has nearly 18,000 personnel, is engaged in intensive shuttle diplomacy with international and regional stakeholders, including the African Union.

The unified message, Haysom said, is for Kiir and Machar to meet, recommit to the 2018 peace deal, uphold the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve disputes “through dialogue rather than military confrontation.”

Ukraine is looking for thousands of new soldiers, including 18-year-olds, for its fourth year of resisting Russia's invasion. 

A network of enlistment centres has been set up, offering on-demand sign-ups and a new one-year contract for young recruits.

In Donbas, volunteers undergo intensive training. Many are over 40 and have held a gun for just two weeks. ""Protecting our country is the only thing we can do,"" says Natalia, 50, a mother of three from Sumy.","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        Rwanda has rejected Ndayishimiye's words as ""surprising"" and said there was no plan to spark conflict in Burundi.
    

The president of Burundi has claimed that neighbouring Rwanda is planning to foment a conflict in his country, warning that it is backing a rebel group in an effort to destabilise its neighbour, citing ""credible intelligence"".

In an interview with the BBC, President Évariste Ndayishimiye claimed that Rwanda's plan resembled what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where a long-established paramilitary rebel group, M23, has swept through key parts of the country in an effort to seize control.

The group is widely thought to be supported by Rwanda, which denies taking any direct role in the conflict.

In his interview, Ndayishimiye claimed that the Rwandan government intended to first trigger instability and then claim it had started without external involvement.

""They would say it's an internal problem when it's Rwanda (who is) the problem,"" he said of the government led by his counterpart, President Paul Kagame. ""We know that he has a plan to attack Burundi. Burundians will not accept to be killed as Congolese are being killed. Burundian people are fighters.""

Ndayishimiye also accused Rwanda of fomenting a failed coup in Burundi in 2015, but said he had no intention of going to war.

""We don't have any plans to attack Rwanda,"" he said. ""We want to resolve that problem by dialogue.

""We are calling on our neighbours to respect the peace agreements we have made. There is no need for us to go to war. We want dialogue, but we will not sit idle if we are attacked. We don't have anything to ask (of) Rwanda, but they refuse because they have a bad plan — they wanted to do what they're doing in the DRC.""

Ndayishimiye has not provided any evidence for his claims. Rwanda has rejected Ndayishimiye's words as ""surprising"" and said there was no plan to spark conflict in Burundi.

The government in Kigali has also denied links to rebel groups in Burundi and insists the two countries are cooperating to secure their border.

Meanwhile, Burundi is seeing its largest influx of refugees in decades as tens of thousands of people flee the fighting in the eastern area of DRC.

According to the UN World Food Program (WFP), as Congolese government troops fight Rwanda-backed rebels who now hold two major cities, the number of registered refugees who need food assistance has doubled since January and now stands at 120,000. 

The decades-long conflict in eastern DRC escalated in January when the M23 rebel group seized the strategic city of Goma. The following month the group took the city of Bukavu, which lies less than 30 miles from the Burundi border.

The presidents of DRC and Rwanda met last week in Qatar for their first direct talks since the cities were seized.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region. The conflict has created one of the world's largest and longest-running humanitarian crises, displacing more than 7 million people displaced over the years.

Many of those displaced to neighbouring countries including Burundi have escaped lethal violence only to face serious food insecurity. WFP warned yesterday that its funds for operations in Burundi are “stretched to the limit” and likely will be exhausted in June. It said it might have to ""suspend food assistance entirely” from July or earlier.

        Moscow and Kyiv have struggled to reach even a limited 30-day ceasefire with both sides continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.
    

US negotiators on Monday held talks with representatives from Russia to push forward a proposed partial ceasefire in the three-year war in Ukraine. 

Moscow and Kyiv have struggled to reach the limited, 30-day ceasefire, which was agreed to in principle last week. 

Both sides have continued to attack each other with drones and missiles despite the agreement. 

On Monday evening, Ukrainian officials said children were among the casualties after a Russian missile attack injured 88 people in the Ukraine city of Sumy. 

“Every day like this, all the nights with Russian missiles and drones against our country, every day of the war means losses, pain and destruction that Ukraine never wanted,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his evening address. 

One major sticking point in negotiations is what targets are off-limits to strike.

US negotiators originally proposed a ceasefire on both ""energy and infrastructure"" however the Kremlin has declared the agreement should more narrowly cover simply ""energy infrastructure.""

Zelenskyy has declared he would also like to see infrastructure such as railways and ports protected. 

After the talks on Monday, US President Donald Trump said that territorial lines and potential US ownership of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine were part of discussions. 

“Some people are saying the United States should own the power plant — work it that way because we have the expertise” to get the plant operating, Trump said. “Something like that would be fine with me.”

The nuclear power plant — Europe's largest — has been under Russian control since the early days of the invasion. Zelenskyy has publicly rejected the concept of US firms owning Ukrainian power plants. 

The US is expected to move between Russia and Ukraine to finalise details of the ceasefire and also negotiate measures to ensure a separate ceasefire in the Black Sea. 

“We're not far away from that,” US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said of a permanent ceasefire during a podcast episode with Tucker Carlson over the weekend. 

He also claimed that within the four regions Moscow has claimed as under its control — Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia — the ""overwhelming majority of people have indicated they want to be under Russian rule"", despite referendums held in these provinces being slammed as illegitimate by the west. 

Grigory Karasin, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house and a participant in Monday's talks, told the Interfax news agency the negotiations were going on in a “creative way"" and that the US and Russian delegations “understand each other's views.”

Zelenskyy on Sunday evening said that ""since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this.”

On Monday, the Ukrainian leader said US and Ukraine representatives were set to meet again, although did not specify when.

        Criticism by Denmark's leader Mette Frederiksen comes after the White House announced a US delegation would be visiting the Arctic island.
    

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen criticised the US on Tuesday for putting ""unacceptable pressure"" on Greenland, ahead of an unsolicited visit to the Arctic island by members of the Trump administration. 

A delegation from Washington including Second Lady Usha Vance, wife of US Vice President JD Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright is set to visit semi-autonomous Danish territory from Thursday until Sunday.

""I have to say that it is unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark in this situation. And it is pressure that we will resist,"" Frederiksen told Danish media.

""You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.""

US President Donald Trump on Monday repeated his desire to take over Greenland, using national security as a justification. He said that the upcoming visit was about ""friendliness, not provocation"".

However, Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede on Monday called the visit ""highly aggressive"". He said that there would be no official meetings with the US representatives as the island has just held elections, with a new government yet to be formed. 

Egede, who will remain in his post until a new government convenes, wrote on Facebook that there was worry on the island over the visits. 

The ""only purpose"" of a trip by Waltz is ""a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood,"" Egede said. 

Frederiksen referred to Egede's comments in her interview on Tuesday, saying that it was ""clear that when you make a visit in this way, and the Greenlandic politicians clearly say that they do not want the visit, you cannot interpret it as respectful.""

“It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs, or what Greenland wants,” the Danish leader concluded. 

Greenland is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a long-time US ally that has rejected Trump's overtures. Copenhagen has recognised the island's right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Last month, JD Vance blasted Denmark for ""not doing its job"" and ""not being a good ally"" by not countering the Chinese use of sea lanes in the region. 

""So you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?"" JD Vance told Fox News. ""If that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do.""

During the US delegation's visit to Greenland, Usha Vance and one of her three children will ""visit historic sites"" and ""learn about Greenlandic heritage"", according to her office. 

A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that it ""should not be a surprise"" that Waltz and Wright would visit ""a US Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground,"" referring to the US Pituffik military space base in northern Greenland.

        Second lady Usha Vance is set to travel to Greenland this week as Trump continues to suggest the US could take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.
    

US President Donald Trump on Monday insisted that second lady Usha Vance's planned visit to Greenland is about ""friendliness, not provocation.""

""This is friendliness and provocation. We're dealing with a lot of people from Greenland that would like to see something happen with respect to their being properly protected and properly taken care of,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting.

The wife of US Vice President JD Vance, Usha Vance, is set to travel to Greenland this week as Trump continues to suggest the US could take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.

Her office said Vance will leave on Thursday and return on Saturday.

Usha will be part of a US delegation set to “visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.”

Trump's conciliatory tone on Monday comes as Greenland's prime minister Múte Bourup Egede warned of “American aggression” and lamented a “mess” caused by the upcoming visit from Vance, who will be joined by Trump's national security adviser and energy secretary.

Trump claimed to have been receiving positive overtures from the island nation, although authorities there have clearly expressed concerns ahead of the visit.

Egede, who remains in the post as Greenland's prime minister until a new government is formed, acknowledged Sunday on Facebook that there is worry on the island.

The visit of “the wife of the United States vice president and the United States president's highest security adviser cannot be seen only as a private visit, ""he said. “We can already see now how big a mess it's caused.”

Egede said there would be no official meetings with the US visitors because a new government has yet to be formed.

He called on Greenland's allies to show support, adding that “the only purpose” of a trip by Waltz is “a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood.”

“We have been treated unacceptably,” he wrote on his Facebook account.

However, Demokraatit's Jens-Frederik Nielsen, the likely next Greenlandic leader, attempted to allay fears by announcing that he was forming a new coalition government ""with the clear goal of creating security for our country and our people.""

“When foreign dignitaries travel to our country on what are called private visits, it rightly causes concern,” he wrote on Facebook. “There is no reason to panic. But there is good reason to stand together and to demand respect. I do. And I will continue to do so.”

Greenland is a self-governing region of Denmark, and northwestern Greenland houses the US Pituffik military base that falls under the Pentagon's Space Force.

But Trump has repeatedly said that he thinks the US should take control of Greenland for strategic and national security purposes, something that has rattled NATO ally Denmark and the European Union.

California Attorney-General Rob Bonta has urged users of genetic testing company 23andMe to delete their personal data, warning them of potential risks if the company goes bankrupt, the New York Post reported on Sunday.“Given 23andMe's reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,” Bonta said in a statement on Friday.  According to the California Department of Justice, the state's Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA) allows users to delete their accounts and genetic data and request that any biological samples be destroyed.“In addition, GIPA permits California consumers to revoke consent that they provided a genetic testing company to collect, use, and disclose genetic data and to store biological samples after the initial testing has been completed,” the department noted on its website.

The breach, which occurred in October 2023, exposed the personal data of more than 6.9 million customers, including names, locations, birthdates, and family tree information. The data was then shared on an online forum used by cyber criminals, the Post reported.Once valued at over $320 per share in February 2021, the company's stock is now trading at under $2, the NYP reported.

Some great Israeli movies have been released during the past year and now these movies, along with some other wonderful films that will be released soon, will be playing on March 26 in theaters all over Israel for NIS 10. Among the most popular recent Israeli movies that will be shown will be Adir Miller's The Ring, the directorial debut of this beloved stand-up comedian, who also stars in this semi-autobiographical film about a man who goes to Budapest with his estranged daughter to try to reclaim his family's Holocaust legacy.Erez Tadmor's two latest movies are part of the program: Matchmaking 2, a funny but romantic look at dating in the ultra-Orthodox world, and Soda, a period drama starring Lior Raz of Fauda and Rotem Sela from A Body That Works, which tells the story of a former partisan living in Tel Aviv in the 1950s who meets a mysterious woman who may have been a Kapo in Auschwitz.  This has been a great year for women directors in Israel, and you can see Maya Kenig's The Milky Way, a dystopian comedy about a single mother who sells her breast milk to rich families; it's a highly original film that succeeds on every level. Maya Dreifuss's Highway 65 is a suspenseful, neo-noir police thriller starring Tali Sharon and Idan Amedi.Sophie Artus's Halisa tells the story of a nurse who works in a pediatric clinic in a mixed Arab-Jewish neighborhood in Haifa. Veronica Kedar's Day Trippers is about an Israeli woman dealing with a crisis by getting high in Amsterdam with a young woman from England. Advertisement NELL BARLOW (left) and Naama Amit in ‘Day Trippers.' (credit: IDDO SOSKLONE)Unreleased filmsThis Israeli Cinema Day is also an opportunity to see movies that haven't been released yet. Nir Bergman's Pink Lady, which won an award for its director at the Black Nights Film Festival in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, tells the story of a haredi (ultra-Orthodox) couple struggling to deal with the husband's attraction to men, and will be included in the program.Anat Maltz's Real Estate: A Love Story, which won the Israeli Feature Film Competition this year at the Haifa International Film Festival, is about a young couple looking to leave trendy Tel Aviv and settle down in Haifa, who find their day of apartment hunting turns into a turbulent, stressful experience. As Iran is in the headlines daily, you might be interested in seeing Eran Riklis's latest film, Reading Lolita in Tehran. It is an adaptation of an Iranian literature professor's memoir, starring Golshifteh Farahani, who was in Riklis's Shelter, and Zar Amir Ebrahimi, who co-directed and acted in Tatami, the story of an Iranian judoka.This Israeli Cinema Day is in honor of the late actor/director Ze'ev Revach, who died in January at age 85. Considered to be one of the most influential and important figures in Israeli cinema, he won three Ophir Awards – the “Israeli Oscar” – two for Best Actor and one for Lifetime Achievement. Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar called him, “One of the greatest actors who grew up in Israel,” saying that “Revach gave us unforgettable moments, laughter and tears, and his legacy will continue to live on in the heart of Israeli culture.”

The IDF denied claims made on Monday by No Other Land Israeli co-director Yuval Abraham on X/Twitter that Hamdan Ballal, the Palestinian co-director of the Academy Award-winning documentary, was taken from an ambulance by IDF soldiers.Abraham said that Ballal was beaten, bleeding, and wounded in his head and stomach. Abraham also added that Ballal had since disappeared and that it's ""unclear whether he is receiving medical treatment or what is happening to him.""The military reported that several terrorists had thrown rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles near Susya in the West Bank.  Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving ""mutual rock-throwing"" between Palestinians and Israelis at the scene.The IDF and Israel Police arrived to disperse the confrontation as several terrorists began throwing rocks at the security forces.

The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police. An Israeli citizen was injured in the incident and was evacuated to receive medical treatment. Contrary to claims, no Palestinian was apprehended from inside an ambulance, the military added.Abraham wrote on the social media platform in Hebrew and English.

In February 2025, Harvard's Center for American Political Studies published a poll showing that 46% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 in the United States supported Hamas – not the Palestinians, but Hamas. The same poll showed that 39% of this same demographic opposed the unconditional release of the Israeli hostages. How did we ever get to this situation?In an October 2024 poll of Americans, Pew Research found that “adults under the age or 30 are as likely to trust information from social media as they are to trust national media outlets.” A poll two months before found that 52% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 got their political news from TikTok and 50% of users of X said that they regularly get their “news” from that platform.   What is the “news” about Jews and Israel that the “under 30s” are seeing on social media?Nonprofit antisemitism monitoring platform Cyberwell reported in late 2024 that 11 months after the October 7 attacks there had been a “36% increase in online Jew-hatred” and a “doubling in outright calls to violence against Jews.” None of this is happening by chance. The speed of which antisemitic content is created, the consistency of the messaging and the specific targeting of younger people unambiguously reflects a well thought out and well managed social media strategy. One Palestinian advocate has called this coordinated effort the “Instafada: social media as resistance.” Another noted that its strategic use of “social media….. has empowered laypeople to coordinate, take to the streets in protest, build encampment protests on universities, initiate petitions and fundraisers, disrupt politicians, stop arms factories, and revive the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign (which has ultimately affected the profits of corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's).”  Hand using mobile smartphone with icon social media and social network. (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)A perfect example of this strategy in action was the campaign launched by Hamas supporters denying that Israelis were sexually assaulted during the October 7 terrorist attacks. Despite the fact that Hamas live-streamed and shared videos of women being raped, there was a massive online campaign conducted last February and March by pro-Hamas influencers and activists calling the reported sexual assaults “atrocity propaganda,” intended to distract the public from the war and to “unfairly demonize Hamas.”It is therefore no surprise that under 30s are disproportionately supporting Hamas and against something as fundamentally humanitarian as releasing the hostages. How has the organized Jewish community responded to this onslaught of online hate? It hasn't. In the last year, I have had several tens of conversations with leading Jewish organizations and philanthropists and have been shocked how little has been done to reclaim the social media narrative.There is no successful company in the world, especially one focused on consumers, that does not have a social media strategy.

Nonprofit antisemitism monitoring platform Cyberwell reported in late 2024 that 11 months after the October 7 attacks there had been a “36% increase in online Jew-hatred” and a “doubling in outright calls to violence against Jews.” None of this is happening by chance. The speed of which antisemitic content is created, the consistency of the messaging and the specific targeting of younger people unambiguously reflects a well thought out and well managed social media strategy. One Palestinian advocate has called this coordinated effort the “Instafada: social media as resistance.” Another noted that its strategic use of “social media….. has empowered laypeople to coordinate, take to the streets in protest, build encampment protests on universities, initiate petitions and fundraisers, disrupt politicians, stop arms factories, and revive the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign (which has ultimately affected the profits of corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's).”  Hand using mobile smartphone with icon social media and social network.

Despite the fact that Hamas live-streamed and shared videos of women being raped, there was a massive online campaign conducted last February and March by pro-Hamas influencers and activists calling the reported sexual assaults “atrocity propaganda,” intended to distract the public from the war and to “unfairly demonize Hamas.”It is therefore no surprise that under 30s are disproportionately supporting Hamas and against something as fundamentally humanitarian as releasing the hostages.

Donald Trump has reacted to the report claiming that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mistakenly included The Atlantic magazine editor to a group chat discussing fundamental US military Houthi war plans.

When pressed about The Atlantic's revelation on Monday that senior cabinet members and advisers texted war preparations to a journalist using Signal, Trump gave a surprising response, saying that “I don't know anything about it.”

The US President launched a scathing attack against the magazine. “I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it. You're saying that they had what?”

In his remarks, Trump also mentioned that this was the first time he heard about the purported intelligence exchange.

Trump then requested information about the security breach from reporters.

“What were they talking about?” Trump enquired. He then seemed to mistake the breach for a deliberate effort to undermine the US military's presence in Yemen.

“It couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective. I can tell you that,” the President remarked.

Later, Trump reshared billionaire Elon Musk's X remarks on Truth Social. “Best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of The Atlantic magazine, because no one ever goes there,” the Tesla CEO wrote.

What has The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg saidJeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic said that officials shared extremely private and classified information in the group chat regarding the Pentagon's strategy to launch military airstrikes against the Houthis, leading to condemnation of the government's handling of this crucial information. Goldberg claimed to have been added to the “Houthi PC small group” on Signal, an open-source encrypted messaging platform. According to The Atlantic report, an account named “Pete Hegseth” posted information on impending raids on Yemen in the chat group on March 15. Trump said that same day he issued an order for a series of strikes on Hothi-dominated areas in Yemen. Following the report about the leak, former national security staffers and members of Congress blasted the  Trump administration on social media. “If House Republicans won't hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I'll do it my damn self,” Representative Pat Ryan, a Democrat from New York wrote on X.

On Monday night, Bollywood actor Sonu Sood's wife, Sonali Sood, suffered injuries in a major car accident on the Mumbai-Nagpur highway. The actor has now shared an update about his wife's health.

In an interview with India Today, Sonu talked about his wife getting injured and said, ""She's doing fine now. Had a miraculous escape. Om Sai Ram.”

An insider told Hindustan Times that Sonali was travelling with her sister and nephew, who was behind the wheel and also sustained injuries in the crash. The incident occurred late Monday night (March 24), and both Sonali and her nephew are currently receiving treatment at Max Hospital in Nagpur. Sonu rushed to be with his wife and has been in Nagpur since the last night.

Meanwhile, Sonali and her nephew are under observation at the MAX Hospital in Nagpur; Sonali's sister escaped unhurt, sustaining only minor injuries.

Sonu Sood recently starred in Fateh, his directorial debut. The action thriller, produced by Shakti Sagar Productions and Zee Studios and co-produced by Ajay Dhama, stars Sonu in the lead role alongside Naseeruddin Shah, Jacqueline Fernandez, Vijay Raaz, and Dibyendu Bhattacharya.

The film follows the story of an ex-agent who emerges from his tranquil life to bring down the entire cyber mafia syndicate when a local girl falls victim to it and goes missing. It opened to a mixed-to-positive response from the audience, earning only ₹ 19.05 crore worldwide at the box office.

Speaking about the challenges he faced while making Fateh, Sonu told ANI, ""I wanted to work with the best of the best in the world. A lot of people, including the action director who shot Fast and Furious, Jurassic Park and the song which was written by Hans Zimmer, To the Moon... so getting all these people from Hollywood was a big challenge but I, like I said when you are doing your first you have to make sure you get the best.""

Samsung Electronics co-chief executive officer Han Jong-hee died of cardiac arrest on Tuesday, the South Korean tech giant said. Han Jong-hee was 63.

Han died at a hospital while being treated for cardiac arrest, a company spokesperson said. The company is yet to name his successor.

News agency Reuters reported that Han was in charge of Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile devices division, while co-CEO Jun Young-hyun oversees the chip business of South Korea's biggest company.

Samsung Electronics shares were flat in morning trade.

Han's death comes at a crucial juncture for the company as it seeks to catch up with SK Hynix Inc. in AI memory, and navigates sluggish demand for consumer electronics.

Last week, Han told attendees at Samsung's annual shareholders' meeting of the company's challenges. He told investors that 2025 would be a difficult year, but the company would pursue mergers and acquisitions to address growth concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Han shared leadership duties with Jun Young-hyun, who's taken the helm of the company's pivotal semiconductor business. Han was in charge of everything else at the massive electronics manufacturer.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, a day after it was revealed that he added the editor-in-chief of Atlantic magazine to a chat group where top US national security officials discussed plans about attacking the Houthis in Yemen earlier this month.

In an interview with NBC News on Tuesday, Trump called Waltz “a good man,” adding that he “has learned a lesson.”

The President further stated that the outcome of the March 15 airstrikes, which he called “perfectly successful,” was not affected at all following the inclusion of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg in a Signal group. The group also included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

He pointed out that it was the “only glitch in two months” following his presidency, “and it turned out not to be a serious one.”

Trump's remarks come after White House issued a new statement on Tuesday over the alleged blunder. Earlier, the National Security Council stated that The Atlantic's story seemed to be a “authentic message chain.”

Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary for the White House, said: “Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

Taking to X, she even shared three “facts about his latest story”.

According to Leavitt, the White House Counsel's Office has given advice on different channels for Trump's top officials to interact “as safely and efficiently as possible.” She also noted that no “war plans” were discussed or secret data was sent to the thread.

Citing the National Security Council, she said that the White House is conducting an investigation into how Goldberg's number was accidentally added to the thread.

“Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,” she added.

Meanwhile, Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are demanding Waltz's resignation following alleged “outrageous national security breach.”

“We need a full investigation and hearing into this on the House Armed Services Committee, ASAP,” the Democrat added.

Following The Atlantic's story, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, blasted the magazine and told reporters that “nobody was texting war plans.”

He called Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.”

Outrage erupted after The Atlantic revealed a major security breach by the Trump administration. Top administration officials mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal group chat and shared extremely classified military plans about attack on Houthi dominated areas in Yemen with him.

The action has sparked intense debate about the future of national security adviser Mike Waltz. many are contemplating whether he should be fired for the major blunder.

The discussion about Waltz's future comes after Chuck Schumer, the Senate's minority leader, called the tragic incident “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time” on the Senate floor on Monday. He called on Republicans to look into the details of the breach, the harm it caused, and how the US can prevent it from happening again.

Taking to X, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware wrote, “Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed a crime – even if accidentally.” Calling the Trump administration “dangerous”, he stated that this government cannot be trusted to protect Americans.

Representative Pat Ryan of New York even declared that if House Republicans do nothing, he will “IMMEDIATELY” begin his own congressional investigation.

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief, was mistakenly invited into a Signal chat group that included over a dozen high-ranking Trump administration officials, including Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and others, according to the Atlantic.

Speaking to MSNBC, Goldberg poked fun at Walz, saying: “I'm thinking to myself, I'm glad Mike Waltz didn't invite a Houthi into the group or a Russian spy, or an adversary of the United States.”

While nothing has been decided as of yet, according to Politico, White House insiders warned that President Donald Trump will make the final choice over the course of the next day or two as he observes coverage of the regrettable incident.

The official, who was given confidentiality to speak about internal deliberations, stated, “Half of them saying he's never going to survive or shouldn't survive.”

Waltz should step down to avoid placing the president in a “bad position”, stated two senior White House sources to Politico.

According to a third source with knowledge of the aftermath, Trump has discussed the issue with Waltz, and the White House is currently supporting him.

During a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that President Trump still has complete faith in his national security staff, which includes national security adviser Mike Waltz. The press office refused to provide any additional comments, quoting Trump as saying that “the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective.”

A viral video on social media is being circulated with the claim that it shows the moment University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki drowned. The clip shows a woman being pulled into the ocean by surging waves. In the video, a man and a woman can be seen in knee-deep water before crashing waves knock them over, and then carry the woman out of sight as the man tries to rescue her.

Konanki, 20, an Indian-origin woman, vanished while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She was last seen at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

The clip appears to depict the kind of scenario Joshua Riibe, the person last seen with Konanki, described when he was previously interrogated by authorities. However, he had claimed he saved Konanki from drowning and soon passed out after ingesting salt water.

The video is being circulated with a false narrative. AFP found after reverse image searches that the video is months-old, and shows a different man and woman in Sochi, Russia. The outlet reported that according to Russian media outlets, the woman was swept away on June 16, 2024, at Riviera Beach in the resort city along the Black Sea. Her body was found days later.

The outlet further noted how photos on Google Maps and Russia's Yandex Maps show a matching coastline at Riviera Beach. The Dominican Republic beach where Konanki disappeared looks very different in photos.

A June 2024 article by the US Sun identified the woman in the video as aspiring model Diana Belyaeva, 20. The man seen in the video was identified as her boyfriend.

Meanwhile, Dominican Republic authorities recently allowed Riibe to leave, following which he returned to his home in Iowa. He was released after Konanki's parents asked Dominican authorities to let him go, and urged them to declare their daughter legally dead. The grieving parents said they were convinced that their daughter had drowned, even though her body has not been found yet.

“Both sides of the authorities have shown us how high the ocean waves were at the time of the incident, and both sides of the authorities have clarified the person of interest was not a suspect from the beginning,” Subbarayudu Konanki, the missing woman's father, reportedly said.

“It is with deep sadness and a heavy heart that we are coming to terms with the fact our daughter has drowned,” he added. “This is incredibly difficult for us to process.”

Israeli settlers beat up one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary film No Other Land on Monday in the occupied West Bank before he was detained by the Israeli military, according to two of his fellow directors and other witnesses. (Also read: Oscars 2025: Directors of 'No Other Land' urge world to address Palestine issue)

The filmmaker -- Hamdan Ballal -- was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya, according to attorney Leah Tsemmel. Police told her they're being held at a military base for medical treatment and she said she hasn't been able to speak with them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers -- some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform -- attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while the settlers continued throwing stones.

“We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us. This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment,"" Adra told The Associated Press.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians -- a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.

“No Other Land"", which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.

Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.

The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theatre that screened the documentary.

Adra said the settlers entered the village on Monday evening, shortly after residents broke the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramzan.

A settler -- who according to Adra frequently attacks the village -- walked over to Ballal's home with the military, and soldiers shot in the air. Ballal's wife heard her husband being beaten outside and scream “I'm dying"", according to Adra.

Adra then saw the soldiers lead Ballal, handcuffed and blindfolded, from his home into a military vehicle. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said Ballal's blood was still splattered on the ground outside his own front door.

Some of the details of Adra's account were backed up by another eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.

A group of 10-20 masked settlers with stones and sticks also assaulted activists with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, smashing their car windows and slashing tires to make them flee the area, one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the AP.

Video provided by the Center for Jewish Nonviolence showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The three million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.

The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled.

Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards -- and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.

During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank in wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has also been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

A routine message on Signal changed everything for Jeffrey Goldberg, an Israel-American journalist, when a connection request from Michael Waltz, national security adviser to President Donald Trump, on March 11 led him into an unexpected journey into military secrets and high-stakes strategy.

Given the “contentious” relationship between the Trump administration and journalists, Goldberg briefly wondered whether someone was impersonating Waltz in an attempt to entrap him. 

However, he decided to accept the request, hoping it was the real Waltz and that the conversation would focus on issues like Ukraine or Iran, matters of pressing international importance, as mentioned in his account for The Atlantic magazine, where he serves as editor-in-chief.

Two days later, the journalist received a notification that he was to be added to a Signal group chat titled “Houthi PC small group.” He wrote in the magazine that the name alone suggested the conversation would focus on sensitive matters related to the Houthi movement in Yemen.

He mentioned that at 4:28 pm (local time), the first message appeared. It was from “Michael Waltz,” and the content revealed the serious nature of the discussion. The message read, “Team – establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”

Goldberg, who had spent years reporting on national security matters, was shocked by the message. In his account, he explained that the term “principals committee” typically refers to the highest-ranking officials within the national security apparatus, such as the secretaries of defence, state, and treasury, along with the CIA director. 

Journalists were rarely, if ever, invited to be part of such discussions. Yet, Goldberg found himself included in what appeared to be a highly secretive conversation, something he had never experienced in his career.

The message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.” 

Goldberg had never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting before, nor had he ever heard of one being coordinated through a commercial messaging app, he wrote.

A massive earthquake of magnitude 6.8 sent tremors off the coast of Riverton in New Zealand on Tuesday, said the United States Geological Survey.

The quake, which initially was recorded at 7 magnitude, struck at a depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) off the southwest tip of the South Island, the USGS said. So far, no tsunami warning has been issued for the region.

As per the USGS website, there have been green alerts for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses, as per which it has concluded that there are low chances of casualties and damage.

Further, it said that the population residing in the quake-hit region live in structures that are highly resistant to earthquakes, with an exception of some vulnerable structures.

Meanwhile, New Zealand's emergency management agency said that it was ""assessing whether the earthquake has created a tsunami that could affect"" the country.

In a national advisory, the agency said, ""If a tsunami has been generated in this location it is not likely to arrive in New Zealand for at least one hour.""

Previously, a 6.3 magnitude that struck Christchurch in 2011 had killed 185 people.

According to USGS the eastern margin of the Australia plate is one of the most seismically active areas of the world due to the high rates of convergence between the Australia and Pacific plates.

In New Zealand, it said, the 3000 km-long Australia-Pacific plate boundary extends from south of Macquarie Island to the southern Kermadec Island chain.

Since 1900, around 15 instances of magnitude 7.5 plus earthquakes have been recorded near New Zealand. Nine of these, and the four largest ones, occurred near the Macquarie Ridge, including the 1989's destructive 8.2 magnitude on the ridge itself.

The largest earthquake recorded in New Zealand itself was in 1931, the 7.8 magnitude Hawke's Bay earthquake, which claimed the lives of 256 people.

The Bengaluru-based founder of asset management firm 16VC has come under fire for advertising unpaid jobs on LinkedIn. Sridhar Arunagiri took to LinkedIn last week to share vacancies for four roles within his company. Sridhar made it clear that 16VC would only hire a “top performer” who would be expected to work out of their Bengaluru office, with no remote or hybrid flexibility.

And then came the stinger - “this is an unpaid role until you match all the checklist,” wrote Sridhar.

Sridhar told HT.com in an emailed statement that the position is a paid one, with an “unpaid” period during which skills of the candidate will be assessed. 

His post made it clear that candidates selected for the roles of product manager, software engineer, UX developer, and growth marketer would have to fulfil an extensive list of requirements before they could get paid. Then, too, the first month on the job would be unpaid.

“We're not hiring anyone just because they have the right skills on paper or some outdated projects. come join us, prove what you can do in a real environment, and from the next month, we'll make it paid,” wrote Sridhar. His post has triggered backlash at a time when conversations around work-life balance are happening across the country.

You can take a look at the post here.

In his post, the Bengaluru-based founder wrote “This is not a 9-to-5” - indicating that employees would be expected to work long hours. “This is a high-speed, high-impact opportunity for those who want to build something massive,” he added.

“The job posting was structured to filter applications effectively. Today, any job post attracts thousands of applications, making it difficult to identify the right candidates efficiently. My approach was intended to streamline the process and ensure that only genuinely interested and highly motivated candidates applied,” Sridhar A told HT.com over an email.

""I also want to emphasize that this is a paid role. The mention of an unpaid period was meant to assess skills before onboarding a candidate into a full-time, compensated position. My plan was always to follow up with a post after hiring someone to confirm that it is a paid role. 

“The interview process is still ongoing, and I will be updating the post accordingly once the selection is completed,” he added.

Sridhar's post was widely criticised not just on LinkedIn but also X and Reddit.

“Post keeps getting worse with every line,” wrote one X user. Another called it “Labour exploitation wrapped into motivational trash.”

 

Several people pointed out the contradiction in his LinkedIn post, where on the one hand he said that his company would rather pay above market rate for a top performer, and on the other hand called it an unpaid role.

Some even doubted the authenticity of not just his post but the company as a whole. In fact, a quick Google search for “16VC” reveals that dozens of people have accused the firm of defrauding them with fake job offers.

The LinkedIn post also reached the popular ‘LinkedIn Lunatics' forum on Reddit, where reactions were similarly negative.

A man's post slamming the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has surfaced online. In his share, the Indian-origin content creator claimed that after getting a cut in his hand, which left him with a deep wound, he only faced delays from the NHS. He further stirred a debate on social media after saying he travelled to India for proper medical attention.

“While I was in the UK, a glass shattered on my hand, severely damaging a nerve and leaving my tendon 90% torn, making it impossible to raise my finger. I rushed to a pharmacy where they told me it was a deep cut that required hospital treatment. They helped me wrap the wound and gave me energy tablets to prevent me from fainting,” Aryan Mangal wrote.

He continued that he waited three hours before meeting a doctor at the hospital and was asked to meet a hand plastic surgeon the next day. According to Mangal, the surgeon numbed his hand with injections and asked him to come back for surgery after three days.

“As I got up to leave, my wound started (bleeding) again, so the doctor tightened the bandage and gave me extra dressings in case it bled at home. Later, I developed a fever because the wound was open and infected, and I had to take medication until Tuesday. That evening, I woke up to 7–8 missed calls from the NHS and a voice note informing me that my surgery had been postponed by 4–5 days,” he continued.

He went on to say that, frustrated by the delay, he travelled to India to get his surgery done. “Unfortunately, my experience with the NHS wasn't great. While the doctors were kind and professional, the delays were excruciatingly painful,” he added. He concluded his post with a video.

A 76-year-old woman was attacked and killed by over 50 dogs of her daughter in Colorado City town of US' Arizona, an incident which took place in February this year but seeing an arrest only recently.

Jessica Hoff, 47, was arrested on Friday in connection with the February incident, according to news agency Associated Press.

Jessica Hoff left her 76-year-old mother LaVonne Hoff, who had dementia, home alone in Colaroda City with the dogs on February 3 while she did errands, the report said.

LaVonne Hoff required 24-hour care, according to the Pueblo County sheriff's office, quoted in the report.

Later that day, deputies found LaVonne Hoff unconscious and several dogs running loose along with about two dozen other dogs and seven birds that were in cages, the sheriff's office said.

A search of Jessica Hoff's house and another nearby property led to discovery of 54 dogs, some in poor health. The animals, along with several birds, were found in unsanitary conditions and were taken by animal control, according to the sheriff's office.

Hoff, who was in jail on Monday, is set to appear in court on Thursday. As of now, prosecutors have not filed formal charges against her, according to court records.

She is being represented by a public defender, whose office does not comment on cases to the media.

Under Colorado law, criminal negligence resulting in an at-risk person's death can lead to prison time between two and six years while aggravated cruelty to animals can carry between a year and 18 months in prison.

The White House on Tuesday insisted that no classified material was sent on a chat between senior officials about strikes on Yemen that was accidentally shared with a journalist.

“No war plans were discussed,” President Donald Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. “No classified material was sent to the thread.”

The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in an article, claimed that he was inadvertently invited into a group chat where top US officials planned for strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels.

While Trump informed the public about the strikes on March 15, Goldberg claimed that he knew about them hours earlier as he was part of the chat, which included US defense secretary Pete Hegseth and vice president JD Vance.

Top Democrats were quick to condemn the incident, describing it as a major security breach and calling for an investigation to determine how it happened.

On Tuesday, Leavitt said that the White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on several different platforms for Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.

She also criticised Jeffrey Goldberg, saying that the magazine editor is “well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

“Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed, and that's what matters most to President Trump,” Karoline Leavitt added.

Earlier today, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he was unaware of the incident. ""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,"" Trump said.

 

Jeffrey Goldberg said he was unexpectedly invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the “Houthi PC small group”.

The editor claims that hours before those military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15, defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan in the messaging group, “including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing”.

He added that US officials in the group also debated whether the US should carry out the strikes, and at one point Vance appeared to question whether US allies in Europe, more exposed to shipping disruption in the region, deserved US help.

A Texas man has been sentenced to six years in prison for urinating in women's water bottles, an act that led to one victim contracting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). 

Quoting court documents, The Independent reported that Lucio Catarino Diaz, a former janitor at a Houston medical facility, was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, his urine. 

Diaz, who had already served two years of sentence, committed the crimes in the summer of 2022 at a doctor's office located along the East Freeway. 

The practice had a shared five-gallon water dispenser used by staff and others in a common area.

An employee, identified as MA, noticed on August 30, 2022, that “the water she got from the water dispenser had a funny taste and smell to it,” according to the complaint. She later told police that she began bringing her own water bottle instead of drinking the “sour” water. 

The employee eventually “noticed her water from her personal water bottle that she brought from the store smelled nasty,” the documents said, adding that she decided to dispose of the bottle rather than investigate further.

As the office lacked security cameras, the woman purchased a small camera online and attached it to her computer. She also placed a large water bottle in the camera's view.

Later that evening, the woman was notified of movement on the camera. “What she witnessed moments later was far worse than anyone could imagine,” court documents revealed.

“The video clearly showed the nighttime janitor, Lucio Diaz, approach M.A.'s desk as if to clean, set the cleaning rag and cleaning bottle on the desk, unzip his pants, pull out his penis, grab the water bottle sitting on the desk, unscrew the cap, and begin to insert his penis into the water bottle (turning it upwards to ensure the water in the bottle touched his penis), and rub his penis on the mouth of the bottle,” report quoted court documents. 

“He then put the cap back on the bottle, set it back where he found it, zipped up his pants, grabbed the cleaning bottle and rag, and continued to ‘clean' the desk. Lucio Diaz was not phased, he was not nervous—he had done this before—and it had now become just a part of his daily ‘cleaning' ritual,” the report added. 

According to the complaint, Diaz admitted to the crimes during police questioning, saying he “did it because he knew [the employee] would drink it the next day” and mentioned having a “sickness.”

The woman later underwent several STD tests, all of which came back positive for Herpes simplex virus type 1, a condition she had never tested positive for before, the complaint revealed.

Tests on Diaz also showed he was positive for the same virus, along with chlamydia. 

Following this, several other women working at the medical practice found they had contracted STDs. The Independent reported it has reviewed multiple civil suits filed against Diaz.

On October 10, 2022, another woman who was targeted by Diaz informed police that she tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 and chlamydia after consuming water from her bottle that had been contaminated with his urine, as stated in the court documents, reported USA Today.

Biotech giant 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday sparking DNA data breach concerns. The company's shares fell to as much as 50% on Monday after founder Anne Wojcicki resigned as CEO. As of now, 23andMe has not confirmed if it is looking to sell to interested bidders.

Jason Koebler-led 404 Media viewed 23andMe's court documents and reported that the biotechnology company is looking to protect itself from the potential damage of dozens of legal cases about past data leaks. Hackers had obtained personal data of about seven million customers in October 2023. According to the 404 Media report, it included ‘health-related information based upon the user's genetics'.

The company, in the documents, also stated that it has faced ‘over 50 class action and state court lawsuits' and 'approximately 35,000 claimants have initiated, filed, or threatened to commence arbitration claims'.

23andMe has collected DNA from saliva samples from more than 15 million customers, Bloomberg reported. As per the report, the ‘personal information can now be sold as part of a court-supervised auction'.

The Wojcicki-led organization filed for Chapter 11, which refers to bankruptcy. 404 Media adds that it owes money to pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, artificial intelligence companies, health insurance companies, and marketing companies.

As concerns about the data auction surfaced, 23andMe issued an open letter to customers. “Your data remains protected. The Chapter 11 filing does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data. Our users' privacy and data are important considerations in any transaction, and we remain committed to our users' privacy and to being transparent with our customers about how their data is managed.”

However, it stated that buyers will have to ‘comply with applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data'.

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the US bars employers and health insurance companies from discriminating against people due to genetic information.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta last week advised customers to delete their genetic data due to 23andMe's financial troubles.

""Once that data is out there, then, even if you requested your account to be deleted, they can't find your information because it no longer has your name attached. So for most people that might be fine as long as their names (are) not attached.""

The Social Security Administration (SSA) on Monday announced several ‘transparency initiatives' under President Donald Trump - including a detailed explanation of its newly introduced identity verification change. The agency further hinted at layoffs, offering workers ‘voluntary opportunities to depart the agency or move to a frontline customer service position'. 

In a press release, SSA stated that President Trump ‘has been clear that good government must serve the People'. ""This begins with being transparent in how its government makes decisions and operates as good stewards of the resources entrusted to it,” Lee Dudek, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, said.

“With this guiding principle in mind, Social Security is taking several important steps to increase transparency and accountability in order to help others understand our agency's work and the complexities we navigate.”

Here are 5 key points on the Social Security Administration's transparency initiative:

Earlier this month, the SSA had announced that it will impose tighter identity verification measures starting March 31. This rule change will affect millions of Americans to verify their identity in person rather than over the phone. 

On Monday, the agency stated that those ‘who cannot successfully use the agency's online my Social Security service will need to visit a field office in person to complete the verification process'. 

More details are published on the SSA's ‘What to Know about Proving Your Identity' page. 

Acting Commissioner Dudek has started meeting with his senior leadership team throughout the week ‘to tackle a range of challenges facing the agency', the SSA said.

“During the Weekly Operational Report (WOR) meeting, leaders focus on specific topics, the options presented to the acting commissioner, and the resulting decisions made during these meetings.”

Dudek published a summary of select agency challenges under the titles: Treasury Offset Program (TOP) Resumption, Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification (eCBSV) Cost Reduction and Enhancements Plan, Payroll Information Exchange (PIE) Phased Implementation Plan and Strengthening Identity Assurance Across Customer Service Channels.

The SSA acknowledged that people do not get prompt customer service after calling the agency's 800 number. 

“People deserve to know the wait time challenges they will face if unable to use the agency's secure and convenient online services,” the press release says. 

Dudek is planning to increase the level of detail shared with beneficiaries. 

Like other federal agencies, the SSA will also be cutting costs in what is described as an ‘efficiency' move. The agency is identifying ‘unused and underutilized office space'. 

“SSA published its Efficiencies and Cost Avoidance webpage that lists soft-term lease terminations, including an explanation for each location and whether any change affects the public or not. For nearly all locations, the space being terminated is only a small room within the larger Social Security office location.”

The Social Security Administration hinted at layoffs. In its transparency release, the agency stated that it has ‘identified opportunities to optimize its workforce by offering voluntary opportunities to depart the agency or move to a frontline customer service position'.

US President Donald Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25 per cent tariff on countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela, a punitive measure that could hit Asian markets including China and India, among others, and sow fresh global trade uncertainty.

""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse,"" he wrote on his Truth Social network. 

""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country.""

The latest across-the-board 25 per cent levies targeting direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan oil can take effect as soon as April 2, according to an order signed Monday by Trump.

According to Trump's order, the 25 per cent tariff expires a year after the last date that a country has imported Venezuelan oil -- or sooner if Washington decides so.

Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants. Venezuela subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.

But Caracas said Saturday it had reached an agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras.

The US President's action could hit China and India, with experts noting that Venezuela exports oil to both those countries and to the United States and Spain.

In December 2023 and January 2024, India was the top buyer of Venezuelan crude oil. In the first month, New Delhi imported approximately 191,600 barrels per day, which rose to over 254,000 in the following month. In January 2024, India was importing nearly half of Venezuela's total oil exports (almost 557,000 bpd for the month).

In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5 per cent of the country's total crude oil purchases.

In February, Venezuela also exported some 500,000 barrels of oil per day to China and this figure was 240,000 barrels for the United States, according to a report by AFP.

Following Trump's announcement, oil prices gained 1 per cent on Monday. Brent crude futures rose 84 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to $73 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was up 83 cents, or 1.2 per cent, at $69.11.

Price gains were capped, however, as the US gave oil producer Chevron until May 27 to wind down its oil operations and exports from Venezuela. Trump had initially given Chevron 30 days from March 4 to wind down that license.

The two moves taken together alleviate some pressure on Chevron while putting more pressure on other consumers of Venezuelan oil, though it is uncertain how the Trump administration will enforce the tariff.

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed tariffs on US allies and foes alike, attempting to strong-arm both economic and diplomatic policy. The secretary of state, in consultation with other US agencies, is authorized to determine if the levy will be imposed.

Trump told reporters Monday that the 25 per cent tariff would be on top of existing rates. He has dubbed April 2 ""Liberation Day"" for the world's biggest economy, already promising reciprocal tariffs tailored to each trading partner in an effort to remedy practices that Washington deems unfair.

He earlier signalled sector-specific duties coming around the same day -- but the White House said Monday it might take a narrower approach.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Green card holders living in America may soon be required to surrender their social media accounts to the government under a new proposal by President Donald Trump administration's as part of their crackdown on immigration. Visa applicants living abroad are already required to share their social media handles with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Now, under the new proposal, the policy will expand to those already living legally in America and are applying for permanent residency or seeking asylum.

The move could potentially allow the White House to bar critics from making the United States their home. It will affect many Indians living legally in America and are active contributors to Indian and US politics. The increased scrutiny from the government could discourage these people from speaking on political matters online due to the risk of negative consequences.



In a notice released on March 5, the Trump administration announced that it's seeking public comment on its plan, saying USCIS has ""identified the need to collect social media identifiers ('handles') and associated social media platform names from applicants to enable and help inform identity verification, national security and public safety screening, and vetting, and related inspections.""

The document said that the vetting of social media accounts was necessary for ""enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.""

The plan is an extension of a current policy that mandates visa applicants abroad to provide their social media handles. The proposal is to extend the scrutiny to already existing residents who are lawfully present in the country, including those with green cards and asylum seekers who are applying for permanent residence. 

The increased social media vetting comes amid the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement, including closer scrutiny of green card and visa holders.

Since coming to power for the second time, Trump's hardline approach to deporting immigrants has intensified America's already stark partisan divide. 

On January 20, his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to team up to fight ""an invasion"" of illegal immigrants. He cast the nation's estimated 11 million immigrants in the US illegally as the driving factor behind crime, gang violence and drug trafficking - assertions not supported by government statistics, and accused immigrants of draining US government resources and depriving citizens of jobs.

Almost immediately, federal law enforcement started posting photos of the crackdown to social media: agents wore body armor and jackets emblazoned with names of multiple agencies - including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, known as ATF - during raids on immigrants without proper legal status.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was spotted jogging at London's Hyde Park in a white saree and slippers. Trinamool Congress' Kunal Ghosh shared a series of pictures and videos from Ms Banerjee's London visit in which the Chief Minister can be seen walking around London from Buckingham Palace to Hyde Park, basking in the beauty of the city, along with other officials.

Ms Banerjee chose a white saree with a green border and her signature white slippers for what is described as a ""warm-up"". She wore a black cardigan and a shawl to beat London's cold weather. Take a look:

In one of the posts on X (formerly Twitter), TMC's Kunal Ghosh wrote: ""According to the Chief Minister, today it is not a walk, but a warm-up"".

Ms Banerjee was also seen ""back-walking"" and clapping.

This is not the first time Ms Banerjee has been seen jogging in a foreign land. During her official visit to Spain in 2023, the Chief Minister had a ""refreshing morning"" in Madrid as she jogged in a saree and slippers. The message was clear: ""Stay fit, stay healthy!""

Ms Banerjee arrived in London on Sunday as part of an official visit aimed at strengthening Bengal's ties with Britain. Reflecting on the relationship between Bengal and Britain, Ms Banerjee stated, it ""spans centuries, rooted in history, culture, and commerce"".

""As we landed in London yesterday, we stepped into a city that, much like Kolkata, carries the weight of its past while embracing the dynamism of the present. Before the day's engagements commenced, I took a moment to immerse myself in the essence of London's timeless grandeur. From its iconic landmarks to its storied streets, the city exudes an old-world charm that speaks of history and evolution - values that Bengal, too, holds close to its heart,"" she wrote in a post on X.

US President Donald Trump was shocked to learn that his administration's top officials and aides mistakingly leaked war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic after the journalist was mistakenly included in a private Signal group chat. When asked about the security breach during a press conference at the White House's Roosevelt Room on Monday, the stunned commander-in-chief told reporters, ""You're telling me about it for the first time.""

""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine but I know nothing about it...You're saying that they had what,"" Trump said.

He, however, added that ""the attack was very effective"" in any case. 

Trump Says He Knows ‘Nothing' About His Defense Officials Texting War Plans To The Atlantic Editor pic.twitter.com/ni8W1sQTNi



The material in the text chain ""contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing,"" The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, did not dispute the authenticity of the messages. The National Security Council said reported the text chain ""appears to be authentic.""

The report said Goldberg received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. He was then added to a group, which also included Waltz, in addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, two that before the strike. 

Goldberg then received texts from other top government officials designating representatives who would work on the matter. He also shared that Hegseth sent information on the strikes, including ""targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing"" to the group chat.

The messages revealed by the Atlantic also highlighted Vice President JD Vance's disagreement with Trump's Yemen strategy. Goldberg, in his report, said that a person identified as Vance expressed doubts about carrying out the strikes on March 14, saying he hated ""bailing Europe out again"". He also argued that the Trump administration didn't need to rush to attack Yemen saying Europeans were more affected by Houthi attacks on shipping than the United States.

He made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the US by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.

""Three per cent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 per cent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message,"" Vance reportedly wrote in a message.

""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,"" Vance says in a later message. 

Vance in the chain of the messages questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of ""a moderate to severe spike in oil prices"" and if the timing of the operation might be a ""mistake.""

""I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,"" Vance argued. ""But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""

After pushback from other members of the Trump administration, Vance appears to address Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying ""If you think we should do it let's go"".

""I just hate bailing Europe out again,"" Vance said.

""I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,"" Hegseth replied. He added, ""I think we should go.""

The vice president's communication director, William Martin, in a statement, downplayed the debate.

He said Vance ""unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy.""

A US journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other top American officials discussed upcoming strikes against Yemen's Huthi rebels, the White House confirmed Monday.

President Donald Trump announced the strikes on March 15, but in a shocking security breach, The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that he had hours of advance notice via the group chat on Signal.

""The message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,"" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said.

The White House said Trump ""continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team,"" after the US president earlier said he did not ""know anything about"" the issue.

The leak could have been highly damaging if Goldberg had publicized details of the plan in advance, but he did not do so even after the fact.

He did, however, write that Hegseth sent information on the strikes, including on ""targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing,"" to the group chat.

""According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 pm eastern time,"" Goldberg wrote -- a timeline that was borne out on the ground in Yemen.

Goldberg said he was added to the group chat two days earlier, and received messages from other top government officials designating representatives who would work on the issue.

On March 14, a person identified as Vance expressed doubts about carrying out the strikes, saying he hated ""bailing Europe out again,"" as countries there were more affected by Huthi attacks on shipping than the United States.

- 'Stunning and dangerous' -

Group chat contributors identified as National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Hegseth both sent messages arguing only Washington had the capability to carry out the strikes, with the latter official saying he shared Vance's ""loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.""

And a person identified as ""S M"" -- possibly Trump advisor Stephen Miller -- argued that ""if the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.""

The security breach provoked outrage among Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing it as ""one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time"" and calling for a full investigation.

Senator Jack Reed also slammed the leak, saying: ""The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous.""

And Hillary Clinton -- who was repeatedly attacked by Trump for using a private email server while she was secretary of state -- posted the Atlantic article on X along with the message: ""You have got to be kidding me.""

- Huthi attacks -

The Huthi rebels, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the ""axis of resistance"" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the United States.

They have launched scores of drone and missile attacks at ships passing Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza war, saying they were carried out in solidarity with Palestinians.

The Huthis' campaign crippled the vital route, which normally carries about 12 percent of world shipping traffic, forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.

The US began targeting the Huthis in response under the previous administration of president Joe Biden, and has launched repeated rounds of strikes on Huthi targets, some with British support.

Trump has vowed to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,"" citing the Huthis' threats against Red Sea shipping, and US strikes have continued over the past 10 days.

US President Donald Trump has simple advice for Kamala Harris if she decides to run for governor of California in 2026: start talking.

""Let her run,"" Trump said in an interview with OutKick on Saturday when asked about Harris' potential political future. ""I don't want to be [giving] people advice politically, but one thing she's gotta start doing is she's gotta start giving interviews.""

Trump pointed out that former President Joe Biden avoided interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic but still won the election. ""Biden - during the COVID thing, he did no interviews, and he got away with it because of COVID,"" Trump said.

Since her defeat in the 2024 presidential election, there's been a lot of speculation on Kamala Harris' future in American politics. Reports suggest she is weighing three options: running for California governor in 2026, making another presidential bid in 2028, or remaining a Democratic powerbroker without seeking office.

With sitting Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom term-limited, the 2026 race presents a significant opportunity for Harris. She is expected to decide by summer end.

At a pre-Oscars party last weekend, she spoke about ""staying in this fight"" while meeting key Democratic figures. Harris previously served as California's attorney general after winning elections in 2010 and 2014, before becoming a US senator in 2016. 

If she runs, she will join a crowded Democratic field that includes Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins, ex-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, state schools chief Tony Thurmond, and former comptroller Betty Yee.

The election is set for November 3, 2026, with primaries in June.

During the 2024 campaign, Harris was cautious with media interactions and avoided popular platforms such as Joe Rogan's podcast - unlike Trump, who took an aggressive media approach. With help from his son Barron, Trump engaged across traditional and independent outlets, appearing on shows hosted by Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schultz. 

His running mate, JD Vance, also pushed back against media narratives on mainstream networks, while Harris' VP pick, Tim Walz, admitted he was restricted from doing more interviews.

During his interview with OutKick, Trump also reflected on his political comeback, saying that his re-election in 2024 ""showed how bad [Democrats] were.""

Officers have confiscated nearly 6.5 tonnes of cocaine from a semi-submersible submarine intercepted off the Azores while bound for the Iberian peninsula, Portugal's judicial police said on Tuesday.

The bust amounts to nearly a quarter of the record 23 tonnes seized across the whole of 2024 in Portugal, often considered one of the first points of entry for the drug into Europe.

Drug traffickers have been caught using semi-submersible vessels, sometimes dubbed ""narco-submarines"", to smuggle cocaine while attempting to evade detection.

The vessel was intercepted ""in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, around 500 nautical miles (more than 900 kilometres)"" south of Portugal's Azores archipelago, the judicial police statement said.

Five crew members were onboard the vessel, which was used by an international crime ring, the statement added.

Besides the Portuguese navy and airforce, international partners including the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the British National Crime Agency and the Spanish Guardia Civil contributed to the bust, according the police.

Many so-called ""narco-submarines"" cannot fully dive like a true submarine, but some are able to dip completely underwater.

Most of the cocaine smuggled into Portugal comes across the sea from Latin America.

Nancy Wilson, the famous American musician from the rock band Heart, expressed her discomfort with being an American in the current political climate, calling it ""embarrassing"".  In a recent interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wilson opened up about the state of the world and her feelings as an American today. 

The conversation touched on Heart's iconic 1975 single, ""Crazy on You"", which she explained was originally written as a critique of the Vietnam War. Interestingly, she noted that the song's message continues to feel relevant even in today's world.

""We were kind of embarrassed at that time to call ourselves American because of the dirty politics of the Vietnam War,"" Wilson explained. ""To be as subtle as possible, it's more embarrassing now.""

According to the New York Post, Wilson's remarks were not taken lightly, and both fans and critics slammed the wealthy singer for her contentious comments about the country.

""Says the millionaire who made tonnes of dough playing music,"" one X user scoffed. ""I just can't with these people right now.""

Stop playing 80's Heart music and it's not as embarrassing

""Stop playing 80s Heart music, and it's not as embarrassing,"" a third X user quipped.

""It's embarrassing to be a Heart fan now,"" added another former backer of the band.

Others instructed Wilson to ditch the US if she's that embarrassed.

""Then leave; you won't be missed,"" one person remarked. ""Move, I guess,"" commented a second.

A Chinese woman jumped off a hospital roof and died after a doctor messed up a routine tooth extraction process, a report in South China Morning Post has claimed. The woman surnamed Wu, 34, hailed from Anhui province in eastern China and had undergone a wisdom tooth extraction at the Anqing Municipal Hospital, known for its dental department, earlier this month.

During the procedure, the doctor mistakenly removed a healthy tooth and then forcibly stuffed the incorrectly extracted tooth back in place.

""For an hour and a half of the surgery, they did not use anaesthesia, and my sister endured it,"" Ms Wu's brother said, adding that the doctor used wire to tie the wrong tooth along with several others.

The botched operation damaged Ms Wu's teeth and she was left with severe pain and a swollen face. She was unable to eat and survived by only drinking water for the next few days as the pain kept her up at night.

Chronicling her experience on social media, Ms Wu shared a video, where she recounted the horrifying experience. ""No one really addressed this incident. The hospital lied to me from start to finish, causing me immense suffering. Who will save me? Because of the harm this hospital caused, I will die here,"" she said.

One of Ms Wu's relatives said she had warned that she would be using her 'death' to prove her innocence after no action was taken against the hospital staffers.

""Wu had repeatedly reported the issue to the hospital and authorities, but nothing was done. This broke her psychological defences, and she said she would use death to prove her innocence,"" the relative said.

After her death, the hospital announced that the doctor involved had been suspended and that both the health commission and police were investigating the matter. Meanwhile, Ms Wu's family has rejected the hospital's offer of Rs 11.7 lakh (100,000 yuan) in compensation and demanded to see surveillance footage of the rooftop plunge.Also Read | Meta's AI Comment Experiment Sparks Outrage: ""Feels Like Dark Mirror Episode""

""Dozens of settlers attacked the gathering at Iftar,"" Nawajaa told Reuters by phone. ""The young men came out to prevent them, and there were about eight injuries on our side.""

Israeli police arrested three men, including Ballal, who was injured during the standoff, he said. It was unclear how badly he had been injured.

India's Permanent Representative to the UN advised Pakistan not to try to ""divert"" the attention

India on Tuesday slammed Pakistan for its ""repeated references"" to Jammu and Kashmir at a United Nations debate on peacekeeping reforms. Speaking at the Security Council, India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said the remarks were ""unwarranted"" and reiterated that the region ""was, is, and will always be an integral part of India.""

""India is compelled to note that the delegate of Pakistan has yet again resorted to unwarranted remarks on the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Such repeated references neither validate their illegal claims nor justify their state-sponsored cross-border terrorism,"" Mr Harish said.

He advised Pakistan not to try to ""divert"" the attention of the forum to drive its ""parochial and divisive agenda"".

Mr Harish also said that Pakistan continues to ""illegally occupy"" part of Jammu and Kashmir, and ""must vacate"" the territory.

Mr Harish's retort came after Syed Tariq Fatemi, the Special Assistant to the Pakistani Prime Minister, spoke on Jammu and Kashmir during a discussion on the future of UN Peacekeeping at the Security Council.

India has maintained that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan but insists that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility for such engagement.

In a recent podcast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that every attempt to foster peace with Pakistan was met with hostility and betrayal.

In an interaction with US-based podcaster Lex Fridman, he recalled that he had specially invited his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014.

""It [invitation] was a gesture of goodwill. It was a diplomatic gesture unlike any in decades,"" he said.

""Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal. We sincerely hope that wisdom prevails upon them and they choose the path of peace,"" PM Modi said.

A mysterious spinning orb illuminated the UK night sky on Monday sparking widespread confusion and speculation about a potential UFO sighting. The glowing anomaly was spotted spiralling across the sky in various northern regions, including Greater Manchester, Derbyshire, and Yorkshire. Eyewitnesses described the phenomenon as a strange, swirling light surrounded by misty rings, moving slowly across the sky before disappearing into the night.

The sightings weren't limited to the UK, with reports also emerging from Slovenia and Sweden, where Facebook users shared images and wondered about the origin of the mysterious spinning lights. ""Anyone else just sees this in the sky? It just kept spinning,"" one person wrote on Facebook.

Another commented, ""Has anyone else just seen this over Radcliffe in the sky because me and the kids are freaked out."" A third added, ""What have we just seen??? It was moving and then faded away after about 2 mins and there were other small what looked like stars moving around it too.""

A fourth added, ""It was like a whirlpool of lights floating across the sky, I've never seen anything like that before.""

The real reason:

The mysterious spinning lights were officially attributed to a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a mission for the US National Reconnaissance Office (NROL-69). After liftoff, excess fuel was released into space, freezing and catching sunlight to create a breathtaking spiral display visible from the UK. This phenomenon, known as ""rocket ice clouds,"" was previously observed in 2023 over parts of the US following another SpaceX launch.

""The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky,"" the Met Office said.

A motorcyclist who fell into a massive sinkhole that opened on a Seoul street was discovered dead following an extensive overnight search, Seoul officials announced on Tuesday. According to the BBC, the unidentified man, in his 30s, was found in cardiac arrest around noon on Tuesday, after the sinkhole swallowed him as he drove by. The sinkhole measured approximately 65 feet in both width and depth, according to the Gangdong Fire Station.

Notably, the sinkhole suddenly appeared near an intersection in Seoul's Gangdong district around 6:30 p.m. local time on Monday. Emergency responders launched a search and rescue operation, eventually locating the motorcyclist around 11 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The victim, who was wearing a helmet and motorcycle boots, was found unconscious and without a pulse. Rescuers also recovered his Japanese-made motorcycle and mobile phone from the sinkhole.

Dashcam footage captured the moment when a car narrowly escaped the sinkhole, with its rear wheels barely clearing the edge. Immediately after, a motorcycle and its rider fell into the deep pit.  Authorities suspect that a ruptured water main pipe may have caused the road to collapse, leading to the massive sinkhole.

The 17-hour search operation was extremely challenging due to the presence of water and soil at the scene, which made it difficult for rescuers to navigate. Additionally, heavy machinery from a nearby construction site had become entangled, further complicating the rescue efforts, according to a fire station official.

""It was only after draining the area and deploying heavy equipment to remove the soil that we were able to locate the man,"" he added.

A woman in her 40s, who happened to be passing by the area just before the sinkhole appeared, sustained a minor injury and is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.

Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon visited the site of the massive sinkhole on Monday night, calling for an investigation into the cause of the incident and measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future.  The cause of the sinkhole remains unknown. Seoul officials said they planned to conduct a ""detailed and comprehensive investigation.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

It started as a joke. In December 2024, Donald Trump glibly told Justin Trudeau that Canada should become the 51st state. Three months later, the “joke” seems to have become an American foreign policy goal for the second Trump administration.

Canadian Parliament has been unanimous in its response: “Canada is not for sale.” But Canada's head of state, King Charles, has remained largely silent on the matter — until recently.

Over the last several weeks, observers have started to pick up on subtle signs of support for Canadians from the King. But many people have no doubt been wondering why there's not been a direct statement of support from King Charles.

The answer to that question isn't as simple as many people might think.

Since 1689, Britain has been a constitutional monarchy. The sovereign is the head of state, but the prime minister leads the government. As such, the King can't interfere with politics. He is supposed to remain neutral and be the embodiment of the nation.

This crucial separation between palace and Parliament was solidified in Canada and throughout the Commonwealth in 1931 with the Statute of Westminster. In 1954, the Royal Styles and Titles Act separated the British Crown from the other Commonwealth realms. Queen Elizabeth became the first sovereign to ever be called Queen of Canada.

As a constitutional monarch, King Charles is bound by parliamentary limitations on his authority. He cannot act without taking advice from the prime ministers in his various realms.

This means King Charles can't make a political statement about the ongoing tensions between Canada and the U.S. without the green light from Ottawa. When asked about the situation in January, a palace official said simply that this is “not something we would comment on.”

As former Alberta premier Jason Kenney later explained on social media:

“For Canadians disappointed that King Charles has not commented on President Trump's threats to annex Canada: in his capacity as King of Canada, he can only act on the advice of his Canadian first minister, i.e. Justin Trudeau.”

Or, at this moment, Mark Carney.

The King met with Trudeau at Sandringham, the royal family's private estate in Norfolk, England, on March 3. This meeting seems to have prompted a series of symbolic gestures demonstrating the monarchy's solidarity with Canadians.

The next day, the King conducted an inspection of the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales in his capacity as head of the Armed Forces. Canadian medals and honours adorned his naval dress uniform during the inspection.

A week later, the King planted a red maple tree at Buckingham Palace to honour Queen Elizabeth's commitment to the preservation of forests and the bonds among Commonwealth nations.

On March 12, the King met with representatives from the Canadian Senate.

He presented a ceremonial sword to Gregory Peters, the Usher of the Black Rod (one of the Senate's chief protocol officers). Raymonde Gagné, the speaker of the Senate, was also present for that meeting.

Delighted to see that Buckingham Palace has just shared this lovely photo of Senate Speaker @sengagne.sencanada.ca and our gentlemanly Usher of the Black Rod, Greg Peters, with King Charles III. The King presented the Black Rod with a new ceremonial sword. #SenateofCanada #Canada #KingCharlesIII[image or embed]

And on March 17, the King met with Carney as part of the new prime minister's whirlwind diplomatic tour of western Europe.

Some observers even pointed to the Princess of Wales's red dress at the Commonwealth Day Service of Celebration on March 10 as yet another nod of recognition for Canada.

These sorts of gestures are examples of what is known as “soft power.” Unlike the hard power of military and economic force used by governments, soft power describes any number of ways that people or groups can influence others through culture, personal diplomacy and even fashion.

As one Buckingham Palace source remarked: “The King knows that seemingly small gestures can send a reassuring sign of recognition about what is going on around the world.”

One of the best known forms of the monarchy wielding soft power is through the use of state visits. At the British prime minister's request, world leaders are invited to London by the sovereign. The red carpet is rolled out for them, they're wined and dined in lavish dinners at Buckingham Palace and they often make a speech to Parliament.

These state visits are a way for the Royal Family to use its soft power to positively influence diplomatic relations.

In February, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented Trump with an invitation from the King for a second state visit to the U.K.. So far, no date for the trip has been announced, but the King's meetings with Trudeau and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy reportedly irritated Trump.

It remains to be seen how King Charles navigates his constitutional role as both king of the United Kingdom and of Canada. Will Trump's state visit only be about British interests? Or will Charles use it as a chance to address the concerns of his Canadian subjects?

Authorities have charged a 47-year-old Colorado woman after her mother with dementia was allegedly mauled by dogs residing in what they deemed 'unsanitary conditions.'

Jessica Hoff has been charged with criminal negligence resulting in death and 54 counts of aggravated animal cruelty, according to the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office. Her arrest on Friday followed a February 3 call reporting an unconscious woman.

Deputies arrived to find 76-year-old LaVonne Hoff unresponsive, with multiple dogs roaming freely inside the home and two dozen more on the property. She was pronounced dead at the scene, NBC News reported. 

Investigators determined that Jessica Hoff had left her mother- who required 24-hour care for dementia-alone while running errands. During that time, the dogs attacked LaVonne inside the home. An autopsy confirmed the cause of death as a dog attack.

Authorities later searched Jessica Hoff's home and a second property in Colorado City, discovering a total of 54 dogs and seven birds. Many of the animals were found in unsanitary conditions, with several dogs in poor health.

A disturbing video has surfaced of a woman being brutally attacked on a crowded train platform in Calgary, Canada, with bystanders failing to intervene. The footage has gone viral, sparking widespread outrage and allegations of racism, as the victim appears to be of Indian descent. 

The footage shows the man, identified as Braydon Joseph James French, grabbing the woman's jacket, repeatedly shaking her. He then grabbed her water bottle, splashed water on her face, slammed her into transit shelter walls, and demanded her phone while violently shaking her. The assailant fled the scene without taking her phone, allowing the woman to contact the authorities. Bystanders witnessed the attack but failed to intervene.

Here's the video:

Russia said on Tuesday it was willing to strike a new agreement on the safety of shipping in the Black Sea - a possible stepping stone towards a ceasefire with Ukraine - but only if the United States ordered President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to respect it.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said only such an order would provide the assurances that Russia needed.

Each side criticised the other over the collapse in 2023 of an earlier agreement intended to ensure the safety of merchant shipping in the Black Sea after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

""We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskiy and his team to do one thing and not the other,"" Lavrov said in televised comments.

""And it seems to me that our American partners have received this signal. They understand that only Washington can achieve positive results in stopping terrorist attacks, stopping shelling of civilian infrastructure, energy infrastructure not related to the military-industrial complex.""

Russia frequently accuses Ukraine of ""terrorist"" actions and Kyiv has often used similar language in response to Russian attacks that have killed thousands of civilians in Ukraine during three years of war.

Lavrov's comments indicated that Russia will demand a further tightening of U.S. pressure on Zelenskiy before it will agree to a maritime ceasefire, which Washington says would be an important step towards a more comprehensive truce.

Zelenskiy and Trump had a disastrous meeting in the White House last month, and Kyiv and its European allies fear Trump could seal a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin that gives in to Russian demands and undermines their security.

The maritime ceasefire under discussion would be a successor to the earlier Black Sea deal that had allowed Ukraine to safely export nearly 33 million metric tons of grain despite the war.

Moscow withdrew in 2023, saying its own food and fertiliser exports faced serious issues because of Western sanctions affecting payments, logistics and insurance. Kyiv had earlier accused Russia of obstructing the initiative.

Lavrov said the market for grain and fertiliser needed to be ""predictable"". He said Russia could not take Zelenskiy at his word, a charge Zelenskiy often levels at Putin.

The Black Sea initiative was the priority of discussions at a meeting between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Monday, Lavrov added.

The Kremlin said earlier on Tuesday that both Russia and the U.S. were analysing the outcome of the talks, but the details would not be made public.

Ukraine's national broadcaster Suspilne cited a source as saying Ukrainian and U.S. officials would meet in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday.

When Trump and Putin spoke last week, the Russian leader declined a proposal by the U.S. president for a full 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but agreed to a moratorium on attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Ukraine says it is ready to join a limited energy ceasefire if it is properly documented.

A North Carolina man, who says he is ""blind,"" has been charged with murder after he called 911 to report three deaths, the People reported.

The Bladen County Sheriff's Office (BCSO) reported in a Facebook post on Tuesday, March 18, that a shooting was reported at a home in Clarkton the previous day. Upon arrival, deputies found Kevin Musser at the front door, wearing blood-stained clothing and holding a handgun.

According to a report by WECT, Musser, 35, was the one who made the initial 22-minute 911 call. During the call, he falsely identified himself as ""Randy"" and claimed that three men had been shot and killed inside the residence. He also alleged that he had been shot in the hand.

Musser further claimed to be ""blind"" and told authorities the victims were already ""beyond help,"" WECT reported.

When deputies arrived, Musser briefly shut the door and attempted to escape through the back but was quickly arrested. He was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, while authorities discovered the bodies of three men inside the home.



The victims, identified as Daniel Dennis, 62, Randy Benton, 54, and Phillip Palmer, 32, all suffered multiple stab wounds, according to the BCSO.

Following an interview with the sheriff's Criminal Investigation Division, Musser was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and possession of methamphetamine, as per a March 19 update from the BCSO.

Law & Crime also reported that Musser is accused of stealing a victim's wallet.

As of March 19, Musser remains in custody at the Bladen County Detention Center without bond. It is unclear if he has legal representation.

Amid a heated legal dispute, a 2021 photo featuring Rippling's Prasanna Sankar, his estranged wife Dhivya Sashidhar, and Sam Altman has resurfaced on X. The image, originally from November 2021, is now circulating as Sankar publicly accuses Sashidhar of infidelity and filing false police complaints.

The resurfaced post was captioned: ""Super inspiring to meet @sama for dinner tonight at our place. @dhivsash and I loved the conversation.""

In a series of posts on X, Prasanna Sankar accused his wife, Dhivya, of having an affair with a married man named Anoop for over six months. He claimed he discovered the relationship after receiving screenshots of their conversations from Anoop's wife.

Beyond the infidelity allegations, Sankar stated that after they began negotiating their divorce, Dhivya filed multiple false complaints against him, including accusations of domestic violence and rape. He asserted that Singaporean authorities investigated the claims and cleared him of all charges.

Sankar further accused Dhivya of abducting their 9-year-old son despite a court ruling in his favor. He alleged that she took the child to the U.S., prompting him to file an international child abduction case. ""The judge ruled in my favor, ordering the return of the child,"" he wrote.

Prasanna Sankar is the co-founder of Rippling, a San Francisco-based HR tech company valued at $10 billion. Originally from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, he is an Indian-origin entrepreneur now based in Singapore. However, according to his LinkedIn profile, he left Rippling in 2020. 

Sankar pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT Trichy), where he met his wife.

Before founding Rippling, he worked at leading tech firms, including an internship at Google in 2006 and a role at Microsoft Canada.

Since January 2023, he has been leading 0xPPL, a decentralized social network focused on crypto communities, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Highlighting his passion for programming, Sankar shares on LinkedIn: ""I used to do a lot of programming contests: I was ranked #1 in India at TopCoder while in college, was a two-time Google Code Jam world finalist, and a two-time ACM ICPC world finalist.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Conspiracy Probe After Kunal Kamra Mocks Eknath Shinde","https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/eknath-shinde-kunal-kamra-supari-for-comedy-conspiracy-probe-after-kunal-kamra-mocks-eknath-shinde-8004769","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 05:47:42 GMT","

Mumbai Police are investigating if Kunal Kamra's jokes targeting Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde were part of a conspiracy and whether the comic received money or any other form of help to mock the Maharashtra Chief Minister, sources have said.

A team from Khar police station visited Kunal Kamra's Mumbai home, where his parents stay, with a summons, asking the comic to appear for questioning in connection with the cases against him. Since the comic is believed to have left the state, the summons has been sent to his WhatsApp number too. Kamra faces multiple charges, including defamation and statements conducing to public mischief.

According to Mumbai police sources, they are trying to find out if Kunal received money or any other help to target Eknath Shinde. They are also probing if someone helped the comic write the lines he used against the Sena chief. Police have said Kunal Kamra's phone and other devices may be examined during the probe.

In a show shot at Mumbai's Habitat studio, Kunal Kamra targeted Mr Shinde with a parody of 'Bholi Si Surat', a popular song from the 1997 blockbuster Dil To Pagal Hai. He used the 'gaddar' (traitor) jibe against the Shiv Sena leader, who led a rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray in 2022, bringing down his government and splitting the party.

Upset with the remarks, Shiv Sena workers vandalised the studio, a preferred venue for stand-up comedy shows. Mr Shinde has said he did not support the vandalism, but cited party workers' sentiments and said, ""every action has a reaction"". He has also asked who gave Kunal Kamra ""supari"" to target him. 

Besides the vandalism, the studio also faced a demolition exercise with civic officials alleging building law violations. The studio announced it has decided to shut down for now and said it was not responsible for the content in performers' shows. ""We have never been involved in the content performed by any Artist, but the recent events have made us rethink about how we get blamed and targeted every time almost like we are a proxy for the performer,"" it said.

In a statement issued late last night, Kunal Kamra said the studio or any political party was not responsible for his remarks. ""An entertainment venue is merely a platform. A space for all sorts of shows. Habitat (or any other venue) is not responsible for my comedy, nor does it have any power or control over what I say or do. Neither does any political party. Attacking a venue for a comedian's words is as senseless as overturning a lorry carrying tomatoes, because you didn't like the butter chicken you were served,"" he said in a post on X.

He said he does not fear the mob and won't be hiding. The comic said he was willing to cooperate with police and courts. ""But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke? And against the unelected members of the BMC, who have arrived today at Habitat, without prior notice, and tore the place down with hammers?"" he asked.

The Opposition, meanwhile, has backed the comic and slammed the Maharashtra government for going after him. Uddhav Thackeray, Mr Shinde's former boss, said Kunal Kamra has told the truth. ""It was not satire. Those who steal are 'gaddar'. There is no 'freedom of expression' when it comes to traitors,"" the Sena (UBT) chief has said.

Former US secretary of state makes remark on X amid scandal over use of private server for classified information

Hillary Clinton – the former US secretary of state who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump amid a scandal over her use of a private server for classified emails – reacted to Monday's news of a leak of highly sensitive military plans at the White House by saying: “You have got to be kidding me.”

Clinton punctuated her reaction on the X platform with an eyes emoji and a link to an Atlantic article that revealed how Trump officials inadvertently broadcast plans of US airstrikes on Houthi rebels through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.

Trump and his supporters criticized her ruthlessly for her classified emails and private server use before and after he defeated her in the presidential election nine years earlier, even calling for her to be imprisoned.

Among them were some of the participants in the group chat reported on by the Atlantic: the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the Central Intelligence Agency director, John Ratcliffe; and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz.

“If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now,” ex-Fox News host Hegseth said on his former network in 2016, as CNN showed in a montage which went viral Monday night.

That same year, Rubio remarked on Fox: “Nobody is above the law – not even Hillary Clinton, even though she thinks she is.”

In 2019, Ratcliffe told Fox: “Mishandling classified information is still a violation of the Espionage Act.”

And in a 2023 CNN appearance, Waltz complained about the lack of prosecution over “the Clinton emails”.

All were appointed to Trump's cabinet after he won his second presidency in November.

On Monday, the White House confirmed the leak reported by the Atlantic but essentially insisted it had been harmless, demonstrating “deep and thoughtful coordination between senior officials”.

“The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security,” White House spokesperson Brian Hughes told the Guardian.

Hegseth, meanwhile, insulted the Atlantic journalist who was inadvertently brought into his Signal chat, Jeffrey Goldberg, as “a deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes”. Hegseth asserted: “Nobody was texting war plans,” prompting Goldberg to respond on MSNBC by saying he had seen a “minute-by-minute accounting” of plans to bomb targets in Yemen associated with Houthis.

Asked Monday for his take on Goldberg's report, Trump claimed: “I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of the Atlantic … but I know nothing about it.”

By Tuesday, he reportedly told NBC News that Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man”. He also echoed Hughes in claiming Goldberg's presence in the Signal chat “had no impact at all” on the ensuing military operation.

Clinton served as secretary of state under former president Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013.

As she ran for the presidency, the FBI's then-director James Comey said there was evidence Clinton had either sent or received 113 emails on a private server with information that was classified at the time of the correspondence. Information in another 2,000 emails or so was later classified.

Comey said Clinton had been “extremely careless” but had not acted in a way rising to the level of criminal charges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Defence secretary, US vice-president and senior Trump advisers wrote openly about the strikes on Yemen

US defence secretary

The appointment of the Fox News host to head the Pentagon was highly controversial. A former Army National Guard officer, Pete Hegseth, 44, has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement and alcohol abuse.

His contributions to the group chat include suggesting that because Americans were unfamiliar with the Houthi armed group in Yemen that messaging could instead focus on the alleged failures of the former US president Joe Biden.

He also appeared to be one of the most gung-ho participants, warning: “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza ceasefire falls apart – and we don't get to start this on our own terms.” Hegseth also makes references to enforcing “100%” operational security in the event the action was paused, despite the fact it was already compromised by a journalist's presence in the group.

Most alarming, however, was Hegseth's sharing of a “TEAM UPDATE” the Atlantic decided not to publish because of the risk it said that it posed to US servicemen and operations in the Middle East.

US vice-president

The 40-year-old served as a press officer in Iraq for six months in a non-combat role before studying law at Yale and beginning his political career after the success of his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

In the chat, Vance, who has often appeared as Trump's tag team partner, not least in the Oval Office pile-on of Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, displays more independence of thought in the conversation.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate-to-severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

Later in the chat he reinforces his animus towards Europe, previously seen at the Munich Security Conference, in a message responding to Hegseth: “If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”

Senior Trump adviser

Miller, 39, a longtime bete noire for liberals due to his incendiary views on immigration and other issues, was also seen as an intellectual architect of efforts to block the election of Joe Biden in 2020, suggesting publicly that slates of “alternate” electors be sent to Congress.

Identified by the Atlantic as SM in the conversation, he intervenes to insist that the president has already been clear about the decision to attack Yemen, suggesting that he speaks for Trump and with his authority.

“As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. Eg, if Europe doesn't remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”

National security adviser

A former Republican member of Congress and special forces soldier who served overseas, Waltz, like other former military personnel in the chat, including Vance, Hegseth, and the director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, should have been aware of the breach of operational security involved in the chat.

It was Waltz, the Atlantic suggests, who erroneously invited Jeffrey Goldberg on Signal to take part in the war planning group.

Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, is also involved in negotiations with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, over a Ukraine ceasefire plan. Witkoff contributes congratulatory emojis after the Yemen attack. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, reported contribution amounts largely to offering congratulations on the operation, and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, offers “kudos”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Luigi Mangione's lawyers want computer for him to review case materials in deadly shooting of Brian Thompson

The accused killer of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes – not for communicating with anyone – as he awaits trial.

In a court filing made public late on Monday, Luigi Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding Thompson's deadly shooting on 4 December. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.

Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's “no connection to Mr Mangione for any of said alleged threats”.

Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.

An Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He has not entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.

Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.

But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans' frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.

Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.

Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.

If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.

Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there are not enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

In an interview on his cross-country tour, the senator said Americans are ‘very disturbed' by the chaos in Washington

Bernie Sanders said Donald Trump has “absolutely” created a constitutional crisis in the United States and is pushing the country “very rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society”.

The independent senator from Vermont has been rallying the anti-Trump resistance on a cross-country “Fight Oligarchy” tour, drawing some of the largest crowds of his decades-long political career as he taps into rising anger over the president's stunning power grabs.

In an interview after an event in Tempe, Arizona, on Thursday night, Sanders accused Trump of “illegally” attempting to dissolve government agencies, including via an executive order, signed hours before the senator took the stage, to dismantle the US Department of Education, which cannot be done without the approval of Congress. He also pointed to the Trump administration's defiance of a federal judge's order not to deport a group of Venezuelan immigrants.

“So yes, I think we are in the midst of the constitutional crisis,” Sanders said.

In the dizzying two months since Trump returned to power, Sanders is packing venues across the country – in Republican-held districts and swing states Democrats lost in 2024. The senator said Americans were clearly “very disturbed” by the daily turmoil in Washington, and that they felt squeezed, stressed and desperate for leaders who are willing to fight for them.

“For years, I've talked about the concept of oligarchy as an abstraction,” Sanders said. But he believes the message hits harder now that Elon Musk, the world's richest person who donated nearly $300m to elect Trump and other Republicans in 2024, is leading the administration's government-slashing effort that includes overhauls of veterans' services and social security. “You've gotta be kind of blind not to understand that you have a government of the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, by the billionaire class.”

Locked out of power in Washington, the opposition party must learn to fight harder, Sanders said, echoing the calls of angry constituents across the country.

“There's got to be more militancy in the Congress in making Republicans pay a price in one way or another for what they're doing,” Sanders said, calling the Democrats' support for the GOP-written spending bill a “disaster”.

Despite his criticism, Sanders has refused to engage with questions about the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is facing calls for his resignation after he paved the way for the bill without extracting any concessions. During an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Sanders dismissed as “nonsense” a question about whether the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should run for the Senate, which some have suggested is a way to primary Schumer. Schumer has remained defiant, and cited his early encouragement of Sanders' cross-country tour as an example of his strong leadership instincts.

In the interview, Sanders, a progressive who caucuses with the Democrats and has twice sought the party's nomination, argued that Democrats' troubles run much deeper than one person or one decision.

“The problem is the Democratic party has no grassroots,” he said in the interview on Thursday. Gesturing to the overflow crowd that turned out to his rally with Ocasio-Cortez in Arizona, he said of his colleagues: “You tell me how many people are going out?”

Sanders' popularity comes at a moment when approval of the Democratic party is at record lows.

In his view, the party's descent traces the rise of money in politics, which over time made Democrats reliant on wealthy donors and inside-the-Beltway consultants. While he credited the party with ushering in progress on social issues such as civil rights, women's rights and LGBTQ+ rights, the senator said Democrats have for too long failed to champion an economic agenda that would meaningfully address the concerns of working-class people – an assessment many leaders roundly rejected.

Yet after decades of warning against the ills of corporate concentration and rising wealth inequality, Sanders, a big smile spreading across his face, said he was “noticing” that more of his colleagues were starting to adopt his populist pitch.

“My colleagues are not dumb people. They are by and large very, very smart people. And you've got to be deaf, dumb and blind, not to analyze the solution,” he said, noting that Democrats not only lost support among working-class voters, but saw their support decline with young people and Latinos – key parts of the party's electoral coalition. “They see those things, they read the polls. And I think some of them at least understand that there has to be a turn around, and they've got to start addressing the needs of working-class people.”

At 83, Sanders has all but ruled out a third presidential run. His joint appearances with Ocasio-Cortez last weekend generated speculation about her political future and whether she was prepared to assume the mantle of his progressive movement.

In the interview, Sanders reflected on how much the movement had grown since he was first elected to Congress in 1990 and co-founded the Progressive caucus: “There are dozens and dozens of really strong progressives out there who are, I think, going to be the future political leaders.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

A former New York Yankees player and his wife say they have “many questions” and “few answers” after their youngest son fell ill and died during a family vacation.

Miller Gardner – the son of Brett and Jessica Gardner – was 14.

Miler Gardner died in his sleep on Friday morning, according to a statement from the couple that was released by the Yankees on Sunday. Costa Rica's judicial investigation agency reportedly told NBC News that the boy seemingly died by asphyxia “after a possible intoxication after apparently ingesting some food”.

The cause of death was preliminary, and officials are awaiting an autopsy and an analysis of toxicology testing results, NBC reported.

Miller Gardner's body was found in a hotel room in the popular Costa Rican resort area of Manuel Antonio, on the country's Pacific coast.

The Gardners' statement said their family had “so many questions and so few answers at this point”.

“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” Jessica and Brett Gardner said in the release. “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

The Yankees said their organization was “filled with grief”.

“Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss,” a statement from the team said. “It wasn't just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years – so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”

Brett Gardner, 41, was drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and spent his entire Major League Baseball career – from 2008 to 2021 – with the organization. The outfielder helped the Yankees win a World Series championship in 2009, and was a popular figure in the clubhouse and with the team's fans.

President says national adviser Mike Waltz had ‘learned a lesson'; senate intelligence committee chair criticizes handling of classified information

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dodged questions about her involvement in the Signal group chat to which an Atlantic journalist was added.

“Senator, I don't want to get into this,” Gabbard said when Senator Mark Warner asked if she had participated in the chat.

She has repeatedly said there was no classified information in the conversation.

Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel declined to say whether the bureau would investigate claims that cabinet members improperly leaked national security information in the chat.

“I was just briefed about it late last night, this morning. I don't have an update”, said Patel.

Warner asked for an update “by the end of the day”.

Senator Angus King pressed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on why climate change was not included as a national security threat in the report.

“We recognize environmental changes and their potential impact on operations, but our focus remains on the direct threats to people's health, wellbeing, and security,” Gabbard said.

King rebutted by saying that climate change exacerbates mass migration, famine, displacement, and political violence.

Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, should resign amid Monday's leak.

Wyden called the Signal chat “obviously reckless, obviously dangerous, both the mishandling of classified information and the deliberate destruction of federal records or potential crimes that ought to be investigated immediately”.

“I'm of the view that there ought to be resignation, starting with the national security adviser and the secretary of defense, Director Radcliffe and Director Gabbard,” Wyden said.

Democratic senator Mark Warner grilled Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen.

Gabbard claims that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

Ratcliffe said that, when he was confirmed as CIA director, he was briefed by agency officials about “the use of Signal as a permissible work use” and “a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration”.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, delivered the intelligence community's annual threat assessment, listing China's military, Mexico's drug trade and Russia's nuclear weapons among some of the most alarming threats to the country's national security.

Before FBI director Kash Patel began his remarks, a protester yelled “Stop funding Israel!”

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, called the protester a “lunatic”.

Democratic senator Mark Warner went on to describe the leaking of the Yemen war plans in a Signal group chat as part of a pattern of actions taken by the second Trump administration that weakens US national security.

“I can just say this. If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired, as I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error,” said Warner, the Senate intelligence committee's vice-chairman.

He outlined a litany of grievances against the Trump administration, from its cancellation of foreign aid to its firing of probationary federal employees.

“No, the Signal fiasco is not a one-off. It is, unfortunately, a pattern we're seeing too often repeated. I fear that we feel the erosion of trust, from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners, [which] can't be put back in the bottle overnight. Make no mistake, these actions make America less safe,” he said.

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, largely confined his opening remarks to warning of the threats posed from traditional enemies such as Iran and China, while implying that the intelligence community had lost its focus under Joe Biden.

“Given these threats, we have to ask, are our intelligence agencies well postured against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is no, at least not yet. As the world became more dangerous in recent years, our intelligence agencies got more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions rather than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we've been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said.

News that the Atlantic's top editor was added to a group chat where US national security officials discussed their plans to bomb Yemen is looming over the Senate intelligence committee's annual hearing into global threats facing the United States.

Among the guests at the hearing are two reported members of the group chat, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, the CIA director. As the hearing began, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee, condemned the leak.

“Yesterday, we stunningly learned that senior members of this administration, and according to reports, two of our witnesses here today, were members of a group chat that discussed highly sensitive, likely classified information that supposedly even included weapons packages, targets and timing, and included the name of an active CIA agent,” Warner said.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me, all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101.”

Warner called Monday's leak “one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information”. He also called it a “pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information”.

“The erosion of trust from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners can't be put back in the bottle overnight,” he added.

Democratic senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, began his remarks by condemning the reckless use of a messaging app to discuss a sensitive military strike in Yemen.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” he said, “it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101. Who are all the names? Who are they? Well, it apparently included a journalist.”

The Senate intelligence committee has started its “World Wide Threats” hearing.

The hearing comes a day after the controversial leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen via a messaging app.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, director of the FBI, are appearing before the panel.

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Yesterday, Donald Trump said he was unaware of the alleged US data breach, but he did share a joke his close ally Elon Musk made on X in a post on his Truth Social platform.

The UK's deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has reacted to the alleged US data breach.

Rayner told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that she “doesn't have much more to add” in response to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly accusing Europe of “free-loading” off the US.

Rayner said, “I don't recognise that there is a challenge between the UK and US relations, they are as strong as they've always been.”

Rayner added that “people say things in private messaging” and insisted it was “for the vice-president to decide and to clarify what he means by those conversations”.

My colleague Peter Beaumont has noted five things US adversaries could learn from today's White House leaks.

“Friendly and hostile governments alike will also have learned that what Vance, Hegseth and others say in public – in disparaging Europe, for example – they say in private, too.

“Any notion that the Trump administration's bark is worse than its bite should be thoroughly disabused by the contempt expressed by Vance for Europe and by the transactional nature of the conversation.”

Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Britain is a “freeloading” country that expects the US to meet its defence needs.

At the lobby briefing this morning, prime minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson spoke at length about the contribution the UK makes to joint military operations with the Americans, following the extraordinary leak of messages showing the contempt President Trump's most senior allies have for Europe's record on defence.

But the spokesperson also refused to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical, JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

At the lobby briefing this morning, asked if Britain was a pathetic freeloader, the PM's spokesperson replied:

You can see, from the way in which the UK has worked closely with the US, supplying regional security and defence, our commitment to working with the US on matters of regional security.

You'll know the UK provided air-to-air refuelling support for recent strikes against Houthi key rebel targets [the raid discussed in the messages inadvertently shared with Godlberg].

We also continue to support the US-led coalition against Daesh with routine combat air patrol over Iraq and Syria.

And we'll continue to work with the US and other allies to ensure stability and security in the Middle East.

Asked again if Britons were freeloaders, the spokesperson repeated the point about the UK working with the US closely in the Middle East.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Tech CEO accused of aiming to privatize space and satellite operations as federal agencies reportedly seek contracts

Elon Musk appears to be laying the groundwork to privatize some space and satellite operations now under the authority of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), or steer lucrative contracts toward his SpaceX and Starlink companies, former agency employees say.

They're sounding the alarm as at least four other federal agencies have reportedly begun pushing new contracts toward Musk's Starlink satellite internet company. Musk, the world's richest man, has been tasked by Donald Trump with drastically slashing the federal government workforce and costs.

The situation raises conflict of interest questions for one of Trump's closest allies who backed him with millions of dollars of funding in the 2024 election. Musk boasts that his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) “slashes spending”, but critics say he's using his position to steer government funding toward his companies.

Noaa could offer the biggest prizes yet for Musk, presenting the opportunity for SpaceX to have a commanding financial advantage in a commercial US space market expected to grow to a value of nearly $2tn in value over the next decade. Already Doge likely has access to competitors' confidential business information at Noaa, former employees at the agency say.

More importantly for the public, it would put control of the nation's communications infrastructure in the hands of a rightwing billionaire. Noaa's activity quietly touches the basic functions of daily life, and everything from dependable cellphone service to how Americans connect to the internet to weather forecasting is at stake, five former Noaa employees who spoke with the Guardian said.

“There's a lot of smoke but we're not sure where the fire is yet,” a former employee said. “We're waiting to see when the next shoe drops.”

In the wake of a firing spree that gutted some Noaa space operations, Donald Trump Jr's investment firm stoked speculation by purchasing $50m worth of SpaceX shares. Noaa operates as part of the US commerce department and is responsible for a range of economic activity relied upon by the public. Musk's Doge team has laid off about 1,300 Noaa staff so far.

SpaceX primarily launches rockets and satellites for Musk and national governments. Starlink, meanwhile, has nearly 6,000 satellites in low-earth orbit and provides satellite broadband internet service and military communications to at least 2.7 million people in 100 countries.

SpaceX is the biggest player in the private space industry and several former Noaa employees praised the company as an often good partner prior to Musk's attack on the agency. The space technology company had strong momentum prior to the new Trump administration, making it difficult to parse what is legitimate business and what could be construed as corruption, former employees said.

A new emergency Freedom of Information Act request for communications among Noaa offices and Doge in part seeks to shine some light on those questions. The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) request noted that privatization of the agency has long been a goal of the right and was called for in the Project 2025 rightwing playbook. The move “is driven by greed and corruption”, Peer's executive director, Tim Whitehouse, said.

“The danger is that Musk's enterprises could morph into government-sponsored monopolies that would operate with no fear of antitrust prosecution,” Whitehouse added.

Leadership for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered staff in February to find tens of millions of dollars in funding for new Starlink contracts, Rolling Stone reported. The FAA is in the process of updating ageing air traffic control networks and last year awarded a $2.4bn contract to Verizon, but Starlink has already edged into the process.

At the US Government Services Administration, Doge ordered federal staff to use Starlink for internet services, an employee told NBC News. Another agency plans to contract with Starlink, according to a federal employee familiar with the situation who spoke with NBC News. Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protection recently authorized an evaluation of Starlink to help monitor the border.

The nascent space traffic coordination program manages thousands of satellites, debris and spacecraft, and helps prevent up to 50,000 near-collisions, called conjunctions, daily. Starlink accounts for a large number of those.

Called the Traffic Coordination System for Space (Traccs), the program would also eventually provide launch and re-entry services for commercial satellites and spacecraft, former employees said. Musk's company already works closely with Traccs, but the program has avoided “vendor lock” and contracts with multiple companies, in no small part because Musk's agenda may not always align with the nation's, one former official said.

“SpaceX is a great service provider, but as long as he's in control of the company it's not anything that can be counted on,” a former Noaa employee said.

Those who spoke with the Guardian said it didn't appear that SpaceX had any interest in privatizing or taking over Traccs prior to Trump's re-election, but Musk's Doge fired all but one Traccs member – in effect crippling a sorely needed operation. That could open the door for privatization, and SpaceX is best positioned.

“They discover something is broken and conveniently say: ‘Oh, we can fix this,'” a former Noaa employee said.

Noaa satellites in lower-earth orbit are largely utilized to forecast weather three to seven days out, and the data is given for free to weather forecasting providers such as AccuWeather, and utilized in aviation, shipping, defense and other critical industries.

Some companies want to profit off the data, and few are better positioned than Musk's to land contracts or take over. But private industry's data and forecasts are of extremely poor quality compared to those from the Noaa, a former employee said.

Noaa weather satellites have redundancies and fail-safes intentionally built in, and huge effort is put into calibrating them with weather on earth: Noaa flies planes into storms to confirm that the data its satellites are providing is accurate, for example.

The data is “highly reliable, 24/7, no breakdowns, no ifs, ands or buts”, a former agency employee said. If Noaa satellites fail, explode or crash, they added, then people who rely on that data may die, or serious economic damage may be inflicted.

“The risk of having outages is so significant because that data is used all the time for everything, and for far more than people realize,” a former employee said.

Musk, by contrast, has a mission of eliminating redundancies and finding efficiencies, and former agency employees noted his rockets and satellites have a history of crashing and exploding.

Meanwhile, Noaa monitors space weather, including solar flares, coronas and radiation, and geomagnetic storms that can damage the electric grid and telecommunications on earth and beyond. That could have implications for Musk's well-known plans to colonize Mars.

“If you're serious about sending people to Mars, then you have to be able to monitor and respond to space weather,” an employee said.

SpaceX, telecom giants and other industries are lobbying the federal government to auction off valuable bands on the radio frequency spectrum – the electromagnetic waves that enable wireless communication, including among the military, the CIA, Noaa and their satellites.

The obscure function is essential to a wide range of commercial activities, such as cellphone use, and industry “wants to get their hands on all that they can” because it's a finite resource, a former agency employee said.

A large part of Noaa's forecasts stem from its satellites monitoring water vapor movement in the atmosphere, and the agency owns the radio frequencies at which vapor vibrates. If the Musk-aligned FCC sells bands too close to that frequency, potential interference could impede satellite function and disrupt reliable weather forecasting and cellphone use.

“Starlink wants more and more spectrum, and you hope [the FCC] would not be stupid enough to auction off the bands next to where water vibrates, but … I wouldn't put it past anybody,” an employee said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A major security leak is triggering bipartisan outrage after the Atlantic revealed that senior Trump administration officials accidentally broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat with a journalist reading along.

According to the Atlantic, the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally invited into a Signal chat group with more than a dozen senior Trump administration officials – including the vice-president, JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and others.

The group discussed secret military plans for recent US attacks on the Houthi armed group in Yemen.

The leak has shocked people across the political spectrum. The minority Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, called it “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time”. He urged Republicans to seek a full investigation.

What did Hegseth say? On Monday Hegseth said that “nobody was texting war plans” and attacked Goldberg as “deceitful and highly discredited” without refuting any specifics from the Atlantic story.

An appeals court judge claimed on Monday that Nazis were given more rights to contest their removal from the United States during the second world war than Venezuelan migrants deported by the Trump administration.

The comments came during a contentious hearing shortly after a lower court thwarted the Trump administration's effort to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court rejected its use and ruled accused migrants must get hearings first.

What does the administration claim? That the Alien Enemies Act, which permits deportation of foreign nationals during wars or invasions, is applicable because the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua's activities constitute an “invasion”. But they have not provided solid evidence that those deported are even gang members: one is a 23-year-old gay makeup artist with no apparent gang affiliations.

Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 65 people in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including women, children and two journalists, the Palestinian health authority said on Monday, nearly a week after Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas.

Palestinians in Gaza have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel launched its new offensive in the territory, which started on Tuesday last week with a wave of airstrikes that killed about 700 people, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the territory run by Hamas – ending two months of relative calm in which many had returned north to their damaged homes.

How many people have been killed in the war? The Gaza health ministry said at least 50,082 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 had been wounded since the beginning of the war, which began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.

And how many journalists? More than 170 journalists and media workers have been killed since October 2023, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), whose director said in a statement: “This nightmare in Gaza has to end. The international community must act fast to ensure that journalists are kept safe and hold Israel to account.”

The discovery of underground ovens and 200 pairs of shoes in what activists call an “extermination camp” has horrified Mexico, sparking protests and spotlighting the more than 120,000 people registered as missing.

Ukraine has accused Moscow of making “hollow statements about peace” after 88 people were injured in a Russian missile attack, as US and Russian officials began talks in Saudi Arabia.

Turkish authorities arrested more than 1,100 people, including journalists, after tens of thousands took part in anti-government protests.

Swedish shoppers boycotted major supermarkets for seven days, protesting over “runaway” food price rises.

Tesla car sales slumped in Europe last month, reflecting a backlash over Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. The carmaker sold fewer than 16,000 vehicles across Europe last month, down 44%, according to Jato Dynamics. Meanwhile, police in Texas said they found and seized “incendiary devices” at a Tesla dealership in Austin yesterday.

It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers: why can't people remember early childhood? Freud called the phenomenon infantile amnesia, and for many years scientists wondered whether it resulted from trouble in creating or retrieving memories. Now, research appears to suggest an answer.

US honeybee deaths have hit record highs, with some commercial beekeepers reporting the loss of 60% of their colonies on average over winter, a survey found. It's pushing many beekeepers close to ruin. “There's no one single thing affecting honeybees but we are trying to figure out what the most important stresses are right now,” said Scott McArt, a Cornell associate professor.

Derek Harris has lived in Sharrington, England, for 50 years. In January he heard that the telecoms firm BT would be withdrawing the village's telephone box. But he and other campaigners argued it was an “iconic heritage asset,” and vital to combat poor phone signal. Yesterday, BT backtracked: the village's red box will stay connected.

US Department of Agriculture calls in university to help study decline as Trump administration staff cuts sting

Honeybee deaths have hit record highs in the US, with the unprecedented loss of colonies pushing many beekeepers close to ruin as scientists scramble to identify the main cause of the huge declines.

Commercial beekeepers have reported losing more than 60% of their colonies, on average, over the winter, according to an ongoing Project Apis m. survey that covers more than two-thirds of America's managed bees.

This enormous rate of decline is higher than record reductions seen last year and is on track to be the “biggest loss of honeybee colonies in US history”, according to Scott McArt, an associate professor of entomology at Cornell University.

McArt said that the extraordinary rate of loss became apparent during this winter's mass movement of honeybee hives to California to pollinate the vast almond crop there.

Honeybees, although introduced to the US, have become vital to the agricultural system by pollinating half of all crops, including apples, berries, pumpkins, melons and cherries. Beekeepers are increasingly struggling to maintain the bee numbers necessary to undertake this work.

“Something real bad is going on this year,” said McArt. “We have been seeing high losses year after year but if anything it is getting worse, which is troubling. Some places are having devastating losses and there was a shortfall in pollination in some almond orchards this year. Whether these impacts will cascade to other crops remains to be seen, it's certainly possible.”

The latest honeybee losses are valued at $139m and have come as the honey price has climbed by 5% amid a drop in honey production. Many beekeepers are now struggling to absorb these shortfalls, with some going out of business altogether.

“It's all gone,” said one beekeeper in response to the Project Apis m. survey. “The equity on the house is gone, our retirement is gone, the family member's money is gone. All that's left are empty boxes. We don't even have the dead bees. They are gone too.”

A certain portion of a colony typically perishes over their more moribund winter months but this rate of loss was typically only around 10% or 20% until around two decades ago when a phenomena called colony collapse disorder, where colonies completely disappear or die, started to emerge in the US. Now, typically half of all colonies are lost on average.

Scientists have ascertained that the climate crisis, habitat loss and pesticide use have badly affected all bees, the vast majority in the US being 4,000 native, wild species rather than honeybees. For managed honeybees, a lack of nutrition, poor handling practices and rampant infestation by varroa mites, a type of parasite, and diseases have also taken their toll.

The loss of bees, both captive and wild, in the US is already starting to limit the supply of some food crops and is reducing the yield of honey. The declines are part of a broader crisis in the insect world where species are being wiped out at an alarming rate. Researchers warn that the loss of insects imperils basic functions of life on Earth, such as food production, the flowering of plants and waste disposal.

The latest, record leap in honeybee losses is now being investigated by staff at the US Department of Agriculture, which is analyzing bees, wax and pollen to determine if parasites and viruses are to blame for the deaths.

However, cuts in staff numbers by Donald Trump's administration has required Cornell University to step in and take on further required research to determine if the samples have been affected by pesticides. It will take around a month before scientists haver a better idea as to the main drivers of the latest losses.

“There's no one single thing affecting honeybees but we are trying to figure out what the most important stresses are right now,” said McArt. “There are a suspicions of a lot of things at the moment, you should see my inbox right now. There are theories about a new virus bring involved but we have to gather the data. We can't rule anything out at this stage.”

The record loss of honeybees follows figures released last year showing that, conversely, there are now an all-time high number of honeybee colonies in the US – 3.8m, around 1m more than five years previously.

This is down to more people becoming interested in beekeeping, meaning that more colonies are being split and created, McArt said. “That is driving up colony numbers but it doesn't mean they are doing well,” he said.

“The colony loss rates are increasing, if anything, even though we are putting more supply into the system. Another important point is that we have very good evidence of range declines and even extinctions among wild pollinators, which aren't being managed by anyone.

“Comparing honeybees and wild bees is like comparing a chicken and a woodpecker. That doesn't mean honeybees, which are a part of agriculture like chickens, aren't beautiful. They bring a lot of joy to people and without their crop pollination we wouldn't be doing well at all.”

Mette Frederiksen says trip by members of the Trump administration ‘not what Greenland needs or wants'

Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has accused the US of putting “unacceptable pressure” on Greenland – which she has vowed to resist – before an unsolicited visit to the Arctic island by members of the Trump administration.

The White House surprised Nuuk and Copenhagen on Sunday by announcing that a US delegation led by the second lady, Usha Vance, would be arriving in Greenland later this week.

Also due to participate in the visit from Thursday to Saturday are the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, now embroiled in an embarrassing security leak, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright.

“I have to say that it is unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark in this situation. And it is pressure that we will resist,” Frederiksen told Danish channel TV 2 on Tuesday.

The Danish leader also dismissed the idea of the trip being a private visit, saying: “You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.”

Trump's threats to acquire Greenland, she said, should be taken seriously. “President Trump is serious … He wants Greenland. Therefore, it cannot be seen independently of anything else,” she told Danmarks Radio (DR).

She said: “It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs or what Greenland wants from a visit. Therefore, no matter how we twist it, it is a completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, the Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population, but it is also on Denmark and thus the kingdom.”

Copenhagen, Greenland's former colonial ruler, retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, which is still part of the kingdom of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire for the US to gain control over the island, which he has said is crucial for American security.

Greenland's prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, has accused Washington of “foreign interference” in relation to the planned visit, amid political uncertainty in the territory as coalition talks continue less than a fortnight after a general election.

The US president responded by saying the delegation had been invited by “officials” on the Greenlandic side. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he told reporters on Monday.

The Nuuk government, however, disputed that. “For the record, the Greenlandic government has not issued any invitations for visits, either official or private,” it said in a statement. “The current government is acting as an interim government pending the formation of a new coalition, and we have kindly requested all countries to respect this process.”

The territory is led by a caretaker government as the Greenlandic Democrats continue with coalition talks following an election earlier this month. On Monday, Greenland's most US and Trump-friendly party, Naleraq, left negotiations over their belief that Greenland should rapidly declare independence.

Kuno Fencker, a member of parliament for Naleraq, which came second to the Democrats in the election, said the party had been “thrown out” of coalition talks, in part because of the upcoming US visit.

“It has an effect because many of the members think that we, especially me, are selling the country to the US,” he said, adding that it was not in his authority to do so.

Accusing the Danish media of “fear-mongering” over the US and Trump, he said: “Divide and rule is being used extremely towards Greenland and fear-mongering about the United States. And especially Donald Trump is framed as the big villain, big bad wolf, here.”

The White House has said Waltz and Wright will visit the US space force base in Pituffik, in the north of Greenland, for briefings from US personnel, and they are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog-sled race.

The White House National Security Council has said the delegation aimed to “learn about Greenland, its culture, history and people”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

White House says both sides agree to ‘ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes'

The White House has just published two readouts from its talks with Russia and Ukraine, effectively announcing an agreement for a ceasefire at sea “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

It also said the two countries agreed to “develop measures for implementing” the earlier agreement to stop strikes against energy infrastructure, both statements said.

Ukraine and Russia will also “continue working toward achieving a durable and lasting peace,” the statements read.

In the Ukraine-specific readout, the White House also said the US confirmed it “remains committed to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.”

The Russia-specific document noted that the US would help “restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

Both versions ended stressing that “the United States reiterated President Donald J. Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict must stop, as the necessary step toward achieving an enduring peace settlement.”

“To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh,” they said.

US state secretary Marco Rubio just welcomed the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to Washington DC, but the entire media coverage of their meeting lasted exactly 36 seconds as they posed for a picture in front of their national flags.

They did not respond to questions from reporters.

The Ukrainian readout, posted by the Ministry of Defence on its Telegram account, confirms the main agreement, but contains some additional guidance not in the original text.

The statement, released in the name of defence minister Rustem Umerov, says that “the movement of Russian military vessels beyond the Eastern Black Sea will be considered a violation of the spirit of this agreement.”

It added it will also “be considered a violation of the obligations to ensure freedom of navigation in the Black Sea and a threat to the national security of Ukraine.”

“In such case, Ukraine will have the full right to exercise the right to self-defence,” it noted.

Curiously, it also goes further than the US statement on the energy strikes, saying that “all parties agreed to implement the agreements … on a complete ban on attacks on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine and Russia.”

The statement also added that “for the effective implementation of the agreements, it is important to hold additional technical consultations as soon as possible to agree on all the details and technical aspects of the implementation, monitoring and control of the agreements.”

Let's see what comes out of Russia.

It's worth noting that while we technically got two separate statements on US talks with Ukraine and Russia, they are very, very similar.

In fact, the key parts on ceasefire at sea and agreement “to develop measures for implementing” the ban on energy infrastructure strikes are literally the same to avoid any confusion in interpreting what has been agreed by the sides.

After US president Donald Trump spoke with Russian president Vladimir Putin earlier this month, the two sides issued completely different readouts, leading to confusion over the extent of the ban on strikes on infrastructure and whether it only covered energy, or also critical civilian infrastructure.

This time we get two very similar texts, only marginally customised to cover individual discussions: with Russia, on restoring its access to agricultural and fertiliser exports; with Ukraine on returning prisoners of war, civilian detainees, and forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

Let's see what details come out in further briefings we are surely going to get from the other sides of the agreement: Ukraine and Russia.

The White House has just published two readouts from its talks with Russia and Ukraine, effectively announcing an agreement for a ceasefire at sea “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

It also said the two countries agreed to “develop measures for implementing” the earlier agreement to stop strikes against energy infrastructure, both statements said.

“To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh,” they said.

The UK police investigating the fire of the electricity substation in Hayes that disrupted the operations of Heathrow airport and European air space last Friday have confirmed it found “no evidence to suggest that the incident was suspicious in nature.”

It said it was “no longer treating this as a potentially criminal matter,” supporting other partners as they look into what caused the fire.

“Should any relevant new information or evidence come to light it will be looked at and considered as appropriate,” they said.

Republican US senator Tommy Tuberville claimed in an interview with Fox Business earlier that Greenlanders are “all in on it,” referring to US plans to take control over the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

His comments sparked a furious reaction from Danish diplomats and lawmakers, adding fuel to the growing frustration with what they see as the US interference in Danish and Greenlandic politics.

Danish ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen told Tuberville in a social media post that he “simply got this wrong.”

“You have to revisit your facts on Greenland, including what the people want.

It is not respectful to send a delegation of senior officials at this time, when the Greenlandic politicians say that they do not want this visit.”

Rasmus Jarlov, outspoken chair of the defence committee in the Danish parliament, went further saying “it is very hard to deal with this.”

“The leader of Greenland viciously says no. Every single member of the Greenlandic parliament says no. They just had an election two weeks ago. No one who wants to be American was elected. Not a single one,” he said.

He added that a recent poll showed that 85% of Greenlanders are against leaving Denmark, and only 6% backed the move towards the US.

He continued:

“It is almost unanimous. Never has a NO been clearer.

Yet these [expletive] people just continue to lie and tell the American public that people in Greenland want to be part of the USA. And the American ‘journalists' let them get away with it.

It is unbelievable.”

Earlier I brought you the latest comments from Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, talking about the “unacceptable” pressure put by the US on Greenland with this week's visits of vice-president JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, and senior US officials (11:45).

Here is a video of what she said:

On the earlier topic of US Signal group on Yemen, we've had an on-the-record reaction from the UK, with prime minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson refusing to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical of Europe, JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

And the spokesperson insisted that the UK remains happy to share intelligence with the US despite the leak, which involved detailed planning for a military attack being shared inadvertently on Signal, a commercial chat app, with a journalist.

Asked if the government was satisfied that any intelligence it shared with the Trump administration would be properly handled, the spokesperson relied:

Yes. The US is our closest ally when it comes to intelligence and defence. We have a longstanding relationship on intelligence and defence cooperation … We will continue and continue to build on the very strong relationship we already have with the US.

The spokesperson would not discuss the leak in detail. But asked if the government was “100% confident” about sharing secret information with the US, the spokesperson replied: “Yes.”

For more UK reactions, you can follow my colleague Andrew Sparrow's live blog here:

We're getting more lines from Russia on its talks with the US over the weekend and on Monday.

Reuters is reporting that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov claimed the country was willing to strike a new agreement on the safety of shipping in the Black Sea – a possible stepping stone towards a ceasefire with Ukraine – but only if the United States ordered President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to respect it.

Each side criticised the other over the collapse in 2023 of an earlier agreement intended to ensure the safety of merchant shipping in the Black Sea after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Reuters said.

“We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and his team to do one thing and not the other,” Lavrov said in televised comments.

Reuters noted that Lavrov's comments indicated that Russia will demand a further tightening of US pressure on Zelenskyy before it will agree to a maritime ceasefire, which Washington says would be an important step towards a more comprehensive truce.

In his regular update last night, Zelenskyy said that “Russia remains the only actor dragging this war out, jeering at both our people and the global community,” as he called for “strong actions” to “push Russia toward peace.”

Russia sought to blame Ukraine for blocking a joint US-Russian statement on progress made in peace talks in Saudi Arabia, with senior Russian senator Vladimir Chizhov telling state TV channel Rossiya-24:

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and apparently agreed on a joint statement, which was not adopted though because of Ukraine's position, is very typical and symptomatic,” Reuters reported.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that “there is an understanding that the contacts will continue, but there is nothing concrete at the moment.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Actor denies assault and says any crude comments he made on film set were due to his bad mood

The French actor Gérard Depardieu has admitted in court that he grabbed the hips of a woman who has accused him of sexual assault, but said it was to avoid slipping and was not a sexual attack.

“I grabbed her hips,” the actor, 76, told his trial for sexual assault at the Paris criminal court on Tuesday. The head judge noted that this was a change from his testimony during police interrogation when he had denied that any physical contact had taken place with the 54-year-old set decorator.

Depardieu is on trial for the alleged sexual assault of the set dresser as well as alleged sexual assaults of a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.

He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted. He denies any wrongdoing, telling the court on Tuesday: “I deny all of it.”

Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the #MeToo movement – said: “I grabbed her hips so as not to slip because I was so upset by her, by the heat. It was a Friday – it was the end of a film shoot with a man who was very tired.”

Depardieu said any crude comments he made while grabbing the set decorator were because he was in a bad mood at the end of the day's filming.

The court heard that the set decorator, Amélie, had been working on styling film sets in a building in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 10 September 2021.

She told the court that Depardieu, who had been seated on a stool in the corridor between takes, began talking to her about the set and complained of the heat in the building. She said he told her: “It's so hot, I can't get an erection.” He also allegedly said: “I know how to make a woman come without touching her.”

After he went to another room to film a scene, he returned to sit in the same corridor, she told the court. He asked Amélie why she was on the phone to her “bloke”, she said. She told him she was in fact busy on the phone trying to track down parasols for the film. He allegedly said: “Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy.”

Amélie alleged that he then grabbed her hips, pulled her towards him and trapped her between his thighs with great force, and grabbed her body, including her pubis, waist and chest. “He grabbed me by the hips, pulled me forwards [towards him], trapped me with his legs,” she said.

“That's where I understood the strength he had, he held me very, very hard. I remember his eyes, I saw this big face, red eyes, very angry, very agitated. And he was saying: ‘Come touch my big parasol', with a crazy look. I've never seen anything like that. That phrase is so idiotic; how would I have invented that – it makes no sense to talk of genitals like a parasol.”

She said: “That fear that I felt – what stands out for me is not his sexual desire, but his savagery. It was the fact that he knew I was afraid – I saw his eyes light up with a kind of pleasure in making someone afraid. I remember that savagery. He really terrified me, and that amused him.”

Depardieu denied assault. He said he had been unhappy with Amélie's work as a set decorator, because a bedroom scene wasn't ready and was done poorly. He had made comments that Amélie couldn't even run a bric-a-brac shop let alone decorate a set, he said.

Depardieu said he weighed 150kg at the time and was so overweight he couldn't possibly have gripped anyone between his thighs. He told the panel of three judges: “I would never put anyone between my legs. You can do a test if you like – with the paunch I have, I can't do it.”

He said he did tend to make vulgar comments on set, telling the court he could often shout things like “Pussy! Pussy!”

When the head judge questioned that he would actually speak like that on a film set, he said he could: “If it's hot, if I'm in a bad mood, things always go on too long.”

Depardieu said: “I don't see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I'm not somebody who rubs himself against others on the Métro. I've been told that exists, I don't know about those types of things, there are so many vices I don't know.” He said there was no way he would put his hands on a woman's backside.

He said, however, that he did use crude language on set but just to be “provocative” and to “relax” people. Asked by the head judge if he had said: “It's so hot I can't get an erection”, Depardieu replied: “Maybe I said that, yes, why not?”

Depardieu said the media had used the allegations against him to damage his reputation. He attacked the #MeToo movement as well as the women who had held protest placards outside a concert tour he was giving at the time of the allegations. “This movement is going to become a terror,” he said.

Amélie told the court that no conversation had taken place with Depardieu where he had criticised her work.

The double Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen described a childhood marked by fear and manipulation when he took the witness stand on Tuesday in a Norwegian court to testify against his father and former coach.

Gjert Ingebrigtsen has pleaded not guilty to charges of physically abusing two of his seven children, namely the track athlete and his sister, Ingrid. The 59-year-old faces up to six years in prison, with the trial due to run until 16 May in Sandnes, south-western Norway.

“My upbringing was closely tied to fear. I've been aware of a fear-based culture for a long time. As a teenager, it was a concept I really identified with, because I felt I had no free will or say in anything,” said Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who won 5,000m gold at the Paris Games and the 1500m in Tokyo.

“I was in an environment where everything was controlled and decided for me,” he was quoted as telling the Sør-Rogaland district court by the Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. “There was an enormous amount of manipulation.”

During the first day of the trial on Monday, Gjert Ingebrigtsen told the court he was innocent of the charges against him, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported. He is due to testify next week, NTB said.

Jakob Ingebrigtsen, 24, told the court about several incidents of violence.

Prosecutors allege Gjert Ingebrigtsen struck Jakob several times after he received a negative report about his behaviour from school when he was aged eight. “I remember being extremely scared. Now I've done something seriously wrong. I'm terrified of what's going to happen,” Jakob told the court about the lead-up to the incident.

Jakob also told the court that when at age 16 he met Elisabeth Asserson, who is now his wife, his father tried to put a stop to the relationship, fearing having any relationship would harm his son's sporting career. “I found it extremely difficult that someone like my own father could speak that way about Elisabeth, someone I cared about,” he told the court.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Swirl visible for several minutes is thought to have been caused by frozen exhaust plume from Falcon 9

The truth is out there … it is just not quite as exciting as was hoped.

A large, glowing spiral that lit up the skies over the UK on Monday night and prompted speculation of an alien encounter is believed to have been caused by a SpaceX rocket.

The growing swirl, visible for several minutes across Britain, was initially thought by some to be an aircraft, or even extraterrestrial activity, but has now been attributed to a launch at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

Elon Musk's company SpaceX held a launch for the US government shortly before 1.50pm local time (1750 GMT) and it is understood the Falcon 9 rocket's frozen exhaust plume caused the display.

The Met Office said on the social media site X: “The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky.”

Lord Dover, a senior technical officer at the University of Hertfordshire's Bayfordbury Observatory, said the spiral was visible for about 10 minutes from 7.52pm – moving across the sky before dipping over the horizon.

“(The SpaceX) rocket… dumped fuel in the upper atmosphere to shed weight before returning to Earth,” he said.

“This fuel formed an expanding, swirling cloud that developed into a giant spiral shape as it travelled over the Atlantic.

“These sightings are becoming common in some parts of the world, but it's still unusual for rocket launches to be visible like this from the UK.”

The celestial display was visible across much of Europe, with hundreds taking to social media to share footage and imagery.

Steven Hall told the BBC that as he was taking out his bins in Suffolk he saw a “huge catherine wheel which appeared to have its own atmosphere around it”.

He added: “It did pass my mind, is this an unexplained, unidentified flying object.”

Dave, from Bristol, said he initially thought the blue spiral was “a plane with its headlight on”.

He said: “It suddenly went blurry and I thought ‘Oh, it's gone into cloud,' but then realised there weren't any clouds.

“I watched this fuzzy light for what felt like about a minute when all of a sudden it started shooting out these spiral arms and spinning.

“I realised straight away it was SpaceX because I've seen it so much on YouTube, but I can totally see how others would have been weirded out by it – it really did look alien.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Academics from US hoping to escape funding freezes and ideological impositions are being actively recruited

Laced with terms such as “censorship” and “political interference”, the Belgium-based jobs advert was far from typical. The promise of academic freedom, however, hinted at who it was aimed at: researchers in the US looking to flee the funding freezes, cuts and ideological impositions ushered in by Donald Trump's administration.

“We see it as our duty to come to the aid of our American colleagues,” said Jan Danckaert, the rector of Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), in explaining why his university – founded in 1834 to safeguard academia from the interference of church or state – had decided to open 12 postdoctoral positions for international researchers, with a particular focus on Americans.

“American universities and their researchers are the biggest victims of this political and ideological interference,” Danckaert said in a statement. “They're seeing millions in research funding disappear for ideological reasons.”

The university is among a handful of institutions across Europe that have begun actively recruiting US researchers, offering themselves as a haven for those keen to escape the Trump administration's crackdown on research and academia.

Since Trump took power in late January, researchers in the US have faced a multipronged attack. Efforts to slash government spending have left thousands of employees bracing for layoffs, including at institutions such as Nasa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US's pre-eminent climate research agency. The government's targeting of “wokeism” has meanwhile sought to root out funding for research deemed to involve diversity, certain kinds of vaccines and any mention of the climate crisis.

In France, the director of the prestigious Pasteur Institute in Paris, Yasmine Belkaid, said it was already working to recruit people from across the Atlantic for work in fields such as infectious diseases or the origins of disease.

“I receive daily requests from people who want to return: French, European or even Americans who no longer feel able to do their research or are afraid to do it freely,” Belkaid told the French newspaper La Tribune. “You might call it a sad opportunity, but it is an opportunity, all the same.”

The sentiment was echoed by France's minister for higher education and research, Philippe Baptiste, in a recent letter that called on research institutions to send in proposals on how best to attract talent from the US. “Many well-known researchers are already questioning their future in the US,” he said. “Naturally, we wish to welcome a certain number of them.”

On Thursday, the Netherlands said it was aiming to swiftly launch a fund to attract researchers to the country.

While the fund would be open to people of all nationalities, the country's education minister, Eppo Bruins, hinted at the tensions that have gripped US academia in announcing the plans.

“There is currently a great global demand for international top scientific talent. At the same time, the geopolitical climate is changing, which is increasing the international mobility of scientists,” Bruins said in a letter to parliament.

“Several European countries are responding to this with efforts to attract international talent,” he added. “I want the Netherlands to remain at the vanguard of these efforts.”

The Dutch effort comes after France's Aix-Marseille University said it had set up a programme – titled Safe Place for Science – that would put aside funding for more than two dozen researchers from the US for three years.

“We wish we didn't have to do this,” said Éric Berton, the university's president. “We're not looking to attract researchers. But we were quite indignant about what was happening and we felt that our colleagues in the US were going through a catastrophe … we wanted to offer some sort of scientific asylum to those whose research is being hindered.”

Two weeks after the programme was launched there have been about 100 applications, with researchers from Yale, Nasa and Stanford among those who have expressed interest. The university continues to receive about 10 applications a day, said Berton, many of them from researchers involved in studying climate, health or social sciences.

Berton said he hoped universities across Europe would join his in providing a safe space for researchers. “I think that we need to realise the historic moment we're living through and the serious, long-term consequences this could have,” he said. “Europe must rise to the occasion.”

At VUB, the opening of the 12 postdoctoral positions was also aimed at acknowledging the global impact of Trump's crackdown. Two research projects in which the university was involved – one delving into youth and disinformation and another investigating the transatlantic dialogue between the US and Europe – had been cancelled due to “changed policy priorities”, it said.

For the university in Brussels, the openings were also a vindication of sorts. In a 2016 interview with Fox News, Trump had sought to characterise life in Brussels as akin to “living in a hellhole”, falsely accusing migrants in the city of failing to assimilate.

“At the time, the statement elicited many emotional reactions in Europe,” the university said. “This gives additional symbolic meaning to the VUB initiative.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Messages inadvertently shared with Atlantic journalist lay bare the unvarnished truth about how Vance and Hegseth feel about European allies

If Europe wasn't already on notice, the extraordinary leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen was another sign that it has a target on its back.

The administration officials gave Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic a front-row seat to the planning for the strike against the Houthis – a stunning intelligence leak that has caused anger against Republicans who called for criminal investigations against Hillary Clinton and others for playing fast and loose with sensitive information.

On the face of it, the strike against the Houthis had far more to do with the administration's policies on protecting maritime trade and containing Iran than its concerns about Europe freeloading on US defense spending and military prowess.

But Vance appears determined to push that angle as a reason to postpone the strike.

“I think we are making a mistake,” wrote Vance, adding that while only 3% of US trade goes through the Suez canal, 40% of European trade does. “There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” he added. “The strongest reason to do this is, as [Trump] said, to send a message.”

Vance was contending that once again the United States is doing what Europe should be. It is consistent with his past arguments that the US is overpaying for European security and the derision he displayed toward European allies (almost certainly the UK and France) when he described them as “some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. (Both fought in Afghanistan and the UK fought alongside the US in Iraq).

It was during this policy discussion, Goldberg wrote, that he was convinced that he was reading remarks by the real Vance, as well as defense secretary Pete Hegseth, national security advisor Michael Waltz, and senior Trump advisor Stephen Miller.

Then Vance went a step further. He tacitly admitted a difference between his foreign policy and Trump's saying that the strike would undermine the president's Europe policy – one that has been led by Vance in his divisive speech at the Munich Security Conference where he accused European leaders of running from their own electorates and of his Eurosceptic comments on Fox News.

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote. “There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

Those designated on the call also reflect the vice-president's growing clout in foreign policymaking circles. Vance named Andy Baker, his national security advisor who helped lead the transition team at the Pentagon, as his representative. Hegseth named Dan Caldwell, a leading proponent of “restraint” in the exercise of US foreign power abroad to protect Europe and counter rivals like Russia, indicating the Vance team's presence at high levels of the Pentagon as well.

At heart, the disagreement indicated that Vance's views of foreign policy are not quite aligned with Trump. Trump broadly sees the world as transactional and optimists in Europe have claimed he could force a positive outcome by forcing those nations to spend more on defense budgets. But Vance appears far more confrontational and principled in his antipathy toward the transatlantic alliance, and has attacked European leaders for backing values that he says are not aligned with the US.

That makes Vance even more of a concern for Europe. Kaja Kallas, the European foreign policy chief, accused Vance of “trying to pick a fight” with European allies. Another European diplomat said: “He is very dangerous for Europe … maybe the most [dangerous] in the administration.” Another said he was “obsessed” with driving a wedge between Europe and the US.

Back on the chat some sought – carefully – to talk Vance down. Hegseth said the strike would promote “core” American values including freedom of navigation and pre-establish deterrence. But he said the strikes could wait, if desired. Waltz, a foreign policy traditionalist, said: “It will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.” But he agreed that the administration sought to “compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans”.

“If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance replied. Hegseth agreed that “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.” But, he added, “we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this.”

Miller, the Trump confidant, effectively ended the conversation by saying that the president had been clear. “Green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return.”

Broadly, the administration's policies on Europe are coming into focus. And there are few stepping up to voice backing for Nato or for Europe writ large. On a podcast interview this weekend, the senior Trump envoy Steve Witkoff mused about the potential for the Gulf economies to replace those of Europe. “It could be much bigger than Europe. Europe is dysfunctional today,” he said.

Tucker Carlson, the host and another Trump confidant, agreed. “It would be good for the world because Europe is dying,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Investigation into death of two-year-old Émile Soleil, who went missing from a village in 2023, takes surprise turn

A long investigation into the mysterious death in 2023 of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested the boy's grandparents on suspicion of murder.

The death of Émile Soleil, who was two and a half when he went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, has remained unexplained even after the discovery of his skull and teeth by a walker just over a mile from the village nine months after his disappearance.

Prosecutors at the time said the cause of his death, which shocked the country, could have been “a fall, manslaughter or murder”. Police later found more bones and items of the boy's clothing.

Émile was at his grandparents' summer home in the small hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Two neighbours last saw him walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000ft) up in the French Alps. His mother and father were absent on the day of his disappearance.

Some media outlets had focused on the role of the boy's grandfather, who was questioned in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school, but police had considered his involvement as only one of many possible hypotheses explaining the boy's death.

But on Tuesday morning the grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of “voluntary homicide”, the chief prosecutor of Aix-en-Provence, Jean-Luc Blachon, said in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse.

Contacted by AFP the couple's lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, said she had no comment, having “only just heard” about the development.

Two other members of the family were also arrested, prosecutors said. Their identity was not revealed.

Speculation that a development in the case was imminent resurfaced earlier this month when investigators returned to the village. Tuesday's arrests were the result of fact-finding “over recent months”, the prosecutor told reporters, adding that forensic police were examining “several spots in the area”.

A funeral mass for the toddler was held in February this year in the presence of several hundreds of mourners. Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying “the period of silence must yield to the period of truth”, adding: “We need to understand, we need to know.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

UK Health Security Agency's tool highlights viruses and bacteria, many not yet seen in the country, that could pose biosecurity risk

Deadly disease-causing organisms from pathogen families that include bird flu, plague and Ebola pose a threat to health in the UK and should be prioritised for research, government experts have said.

The first tool of its kind from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) lists 24 types of viruses and bacteria where a lack of vaccines, tests and treatment, changes due to the climate crisis or growing drug resistance pose a biosecurity risk.

The pathogen families on the list cause many diseases not currently seen in the UK. However, climate change could change how and where they spread, said Dr Isabel Oliver, UKHSA's chief scientific officer, while a large outbreak overseas could have “major impacts globally, including socioeconomic impacts”.

Viruses in the Filoviridae family include the Marburg and Ebola haemorrhagic fevers, while Flaviviridae include mosquito-borne viruses dengue and Zika. Bacteria families highlighted include those home to Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, and Bacillus anthracis, which causes Anthrax.

Others listed include the Coronaviridae family, which includes Covid-19, and the Orthomyxoviridae family which includes avian influenza.

Oliver said UKHSA's scientists had considered “not just the fact that some of these families have got high potential to cause pandemics or epidemics, but also where there are currently gaps in the availability of either diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, or where there are evolving and growing changes around antimicrobial resistance, or where there is a significant sensitivity to climate change, that might mean that this threat evolves or changes more rapidly”.

She said one of UKHSA's concerns, reflected in the tool, was “the change in the distribution of mosquitoes and ticks that can carry viruses that cause adverse health effects to humans” linked to climate and environmental change.

The document, which will be updated regularly, does not indicate which pathogens UKHSA considers most likely to cause the next pandemic, Oliver stressed, but those most in need of increased scientific investment and study. She said it would be used in conversations with the scientific community “to help ensure that investment is focused to where it can have the biggest impact”.

Some diseases highlighted, including the Caliciviridae family member norovirus, already pose a “high” domestic burden in the UK, but have no specific treatment or vaccine available.

The first report from the UK Covid inquiry found that prior to 2020 there had been too much focus on the risk of an influenza pandemic, with officials then taking too long to adjust to the threat from a different type of virus.

The Paramyxoviridae family – which includes measles, as well as Nipah virus – is among those highlighted as a concern.

Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said he agreed with the assessment: “A novel measles-like virus would pose a threat far worse than Covid. Such a virus would have a much higher R number [indicating how contagious an infectious disease is] than the original variants of Covid – making it impossible to control by even the strictest lockdown. It would also be considerably more deadly, and (unlike Covid) it would be a threat to children. This is the kind of pandemic that public health agencies around the world are most concerned about.

“That said, there are many potential kinds of novel pandemic threats – so-called Disease X – and the UKHSA report is a timely reminder that we should not put all our eggs in one basket.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Far right party doubles its number of seats, while chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, hopes to form government before Easter



Germany's new parliament sits for the first time on Tuesday with the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) the second biggest force, as negotiators seek to iron out key differences on tax and migration that are likely to dominate a new coalition government under Friedrich Merz.

The 630 members of the Bundestag, 230 of whom are newly elected, will sit in parliament at a unique time in postwar German history. The AfD has doubled its number of seats to 152, while centrist parties are overhauling the country's military and fiscal policy in response to rising threats to European security.

The MPs taking seats on Tuesday range in age from 23 to 84. The youngest is Luke Hoss, a student from the far-left Die Linke who has promised to give away most of his €11,000-a-month salary. The oldest is Alexander Gauland, a former journalist from the AfD who in 2018 downplayed Hitler and the Nazis as “just birdshit in our more than 1,000-year history”.

The new parliament contains about 100 fewer MPs than the previous one after the outgoing government reformed Germany's electoral law to shrink persistent bloat. Fewer than a third of MPs in the new Bundestag are women, slightly below the share in the previous legislature.

The gender inequality is lowest in the Greens, where women make up 61.2% of MPs, and highest in the AfD, where they make up 11.8%. Women are also greatly underrepresented in the centre right, accounting for 22.6% of MPs in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and 25% of MPs in the Christian Social Union (CSU).

Lawmakers of foreign descent are also disproportionately rare in the new parliament. The share of MPs with a migration background – those with at least one parent who was born without German citizenship – is 11.6%, according to estimates from the nonprofit group Mediendienst Integration, compared to about 30% in the general population.

Zada ​​Salihović, a 24-year-old from Die Linke who has become the second-youngest MP in the Bundestag after Hoss, said the new parliament was “still a reflection of a privileged minority” that did not adequately represent women, workers, young people, eastern Germans and people with migrant backgrounds.

“It's not a coincidence, it's an expression of structural barriers and power relations,” she said. “When parliaments are so homogeneous, it's not only the perspective of the majority that's missing – there's also a lack of fair solutions.”

The first sitting will open with a speech from Gregor Gysi, the longest-serving member of parliament, who began his political career in the Socialist Unity party in communist East Germany. The 77-year-old will be free to decide the length and content of his speech, and will chair the session until the president of the Bundestag is elected.

The CDU/CSU has nominated the CDU party treasurer, Julia Klöckner, to be Bundestag president, a position similar to that of the speaker in other countries. The Greens had protested after reports that Klöckner, the former agriculture minister under Angela Merkel, had planned to introduce herself to the AfD faction this week, arguing that it would “send a wrong signal of normalisation”. Klöckner's presence at the meeting appeared to have been cancelled after scheduling conflicts, the news outlet Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland reported on Monday.

Tense coalition talks are under way between the CDU/CSU, the largest faction in parliament, and the Social Democratic party (SPD). The chancellor-in-waiting, Merz, hopes to form a government before Easter.

The probable incoming government scored an early win this month after securing the support of the Greens to amend the constitution and loosen Germany's debt brake. The proposal, which was approved on Friday by the Bundesrat, a legislative body akin to an upper house of parliament, paves the way for a debt-financed package of investments in defence, infrastructure and climate action.

The proposal would have probably failed to pass in the new parliament, which contains a “blocking minority” from the AfD and Die Linke, who oppose sending weapons to Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Russian missile attack injures 88 in Sumy, officials report; Saudi Arabia ceasefire talks to continue with nothing yet agreed. What we know on day 1,126

Ukraine's special forces said on Monday they destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with Himars rocket systems. The special operations command published drone footage and announced: “Special operations forces in cooperation with the GUR of the ministry of defence, missile forces and artillery destroyed two enemy Ka-52 and two Mi-8 helicopters in the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation.” The strikes occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces, the group said. Ukrainian forces have since 18 March been striking across the border into areas of Belgorod oblast including the village of Demidovka, according to Russian and Ukrainian war watchers. Some claimed Ukrainian troops had managed to seize a small amount of territory in Belgorod. Their reports could not be verified.

A Russian missile attack hit a densely populated district including schools in Ukraine on Monday, wounding 88 people including 17 children, said officials in the city of Sumy. Many more children escaped injury as they had been evacuated to air raid shelters, said the regional governor, Volodymyr Artiukh. Ukraine's foreign minister, Adrii Sybiha, said: “Instead of making hollow statements about peace, Russia must stop bombing our cities and end its war on civilians.” Sumy is just across the border from Kursk oblast where Ukrainian forces have been holding Russian territory since August 2024.

As of Monday night no ceasefire partial or otherwise had been agreed between Russia and Ukraine despite Russian claims of the Ukrainians breaching one by attacking energy stations. After Donald Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on 18 March, the Russian president was said to have ordered a halt to such attacks for 30 days. However, talks involving the US, Ukraine and Russia adjourned in Saudi Arabia on Monday with no ceasefire as yet signed. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday evening that “since 11 March, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped”.

It will be the Ukrainian and US delegations' turn to meet on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia. The talks in Riyadh appeared to have coalesced around the safety of shipping in the Black Sea. Washington is supporting the idea of a Black Sea ceasefire deal – a major aim of Russia – before securing a wider agreement. Ukraine has inflicted heavy naval losses on Russia in the Black Sea, including sinking its flagship there and blowing up submarines and other vessels as well as crippling Russian bases – forcing Moscow to withdraw its navy from Crimea. Simultaneously, Russia has been unable to halt Ukrainian grain and other exports despite pulling out of what was known as the “Black Sea grain initiative” and returning to attacking shipping and Ukraine's civilian port infrastructure.

A “massive targeted cyber-attack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company said, adding that it was working to restore its systems on Monday. The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules but disrupted its online booking system.

After reports surfaced that China might send peacekeepers to enforce any peace deal, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Monday: “Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent.” China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but says it has not given any weapons or sent any personnel. China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.

A Ukrainian artillery strike on Monday killed six people in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region, the region's Russia-installed governor said. According to Russian reports, two of the dead worked for the Russian military-owned propaganda TV station Zvezda, which is internationally sanctioned; while another worked for state-aligned and internationally sanctioned Izvestia newspaper – part of a media group chaired by a rumoured mistress of Vladimir Putin who is also sanctioned. Russian authorities described the media employees as journalists and claimed they were deliberately targeted. There was no comment from Ukrainian officials.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Vast majority unaware how many people were enslaved and for how long, although poll finds support for reparations is rising

Britons are widely ignorant of the scale and legacy of Britain's involvement in slavery and colonialism, a survey has found, with the vast majority unaware how many people were enslaved, how long the trade went on for, or for how long UK taxpayers were paying off a government loan to “compensate” enslavers after abolition.

The poll, released to coincide with Tuesday's UN International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, was commissioned by the Repair Campaign, which is working with Caricom to secure reparatory justice for member states through health, education and infrastructure projects.

The sample of more than 2,000 people representative of the UK population found 85% did not know that more than 3 million people had been forcibly shipped from Africa to the Caribbean by British enslavers.

It also found 89% were unaware British merchants had enslaved people in the Caribbean for more than 300 years and that 75% did not know it was after 2000 that British taxpayers finished paying off the money borrowed by UK government in 1833 – equivalent to 40% of the government's total annual expenditure at the time – to compensate enslavers for their “loss of property”.

Nonetheless, the survey found support for some form of reparations is growing, with 63% now agreeing that Caribbean nations and descendants of enslaved people should receive a formal apology, up 4% from last year's poll, while support for financial reparations has also increased, with 40% now in favour. Ninety per cent of those in favour of financial reparations said they should be directed toward long-term education, health and infrastructure projects.

Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group for Afrikan Reparations, said she was “not surprised” about the lack of understanding about the scale of slavery, and that reparative justice also required education.

“People point to reparations and think merely in financial terms, but one of the most important things is correcting the record – because until people learn what happened there will not be that widespread, public will to make reparation possible,” she said.

The Labour government has said the UK will not pay cash reparations, but is working with Caribbean partners on issues such as security, growth and climate change.

Ribeiro-Addy said there had to be a “willingness to listen” from the UK government, which is yet to make a formal apology for slavery, faced with a “large chunk of the world” that was unified on the need for reparative justice. “For us not to listen is disgraceful and could have consequences of its own,” she added.

Walker Syachalinga, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, which is investigating claims against institutions, companies and families, said of the survey's findings: “They speak to what has been a feature of English law and commerce – this idea of offshoring the more unpalatable aspects of our history while retaining the benefits.”

Denis O'Brien, Repair Campaign's founder, said the poll showed “heartening” growth in public support for an apology and reparations, but also “how little people in Britain really know about the country's past.”

Dr Hilary Brown, a programme manager at Caricom Secretariat, said: “Our shared humanity demands justice for the horrific crimes committed. Addressing the knowledge gap in the UK on the country's history of trading and enslaving Africans is urgent.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

With the cost of feeding a family up by an estimated £2,290, consumers, like many across Europe, are taking direct action

Marcel Demir was not impressed. The Swedish student had been monitoring the price of chocolate and crisps and had noticed that both had gone up astronomically.

“Absolutely, prices have gone up,” he said, standing outside a branch of Sweden's grocery store chain Coop in Stockholm Central train station. “I usually buy crisps and chocolate and they've gone up a lot. Chocolate recently. Crisps over the last year.”

The 21-year-old from Eskilstuna in south-eastern Sweden is not alone in his consternation.

According to some estimates, the annual cost of feeding a family in Sweden has gone up by as much as 30,000 kronor (£2,290) since January 2022. A packet of coffee is soon expected to reach the symbolic threshold of 100 kronor (£7.64). That's an increase of more than a quarter since early last year, according to the government agency Statistics Sweden.

Last week, after the biggest rise in food prices for two years in February, thousands of people across Sweden decided to vote with their feet, boycotting the country's biggest supermarkets for seven days from last Monday.

Helped by viral posts on TikTok and Instagram, the campaign has become a national topic of conversation and a political flashpoint.

Protesters blame the rise in prices on an “oligopoly” of supermarkets and big producers prioritising their profits over customers, and a lack of competition between companies. But supermarkets blame far-ranging factors including war, geopolitics, commodity prices, harvests and the climate emergency.

It is one of several cost-of-living protests that have unfolded across Europe in recent weeks. Shoppers in Bulgaria boycotted big retail chains and supermarkets last month in protest at rising food prices, reportedly leading to a drop in turnover of almost 30%. In January, a boycott in Croatia spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

The Swedish protest initiative, “Bojkotta vecka 12” (Boycott week 12, so called because it was held in the 12th week of the calendar year), asked consumers to stop shopping at big food shops including Lidl, Hemköp, Ica, Coop and Willys to protest against rising prices.

“We have nothing to lose, but everything to gain,” social media posts said. “Food prices have run away while food giants and the big producers are making billions in profits at our expense.”

Demir was not wrong: of all foods, chocolate prices went up the most last month, rising by 9.2% according to tracking site Matpriskollen. Cooking fat prices rose by 7.2% and cheese by 6.4%. Milk and cream rose by 5.4%.

Not everyone is convinced by the merits of the seven-day action, however.

Though Sandra Gustavsson, 34, has been noticing the rising cost of food, she is more in favour of a complete overhaul of shopping habits – such as using a “reko-ring”. This is a way of buying locally produced goods without intermediaries.

“Since Covid it feels like food prices have just gone up, up, up,” said Gustavsson, who works as a head of operations and lives in Gothenburg. “One week is good because it starts a conversation,” she added. “But otherwise I don't think it has an effect.”

Filippa Lind, a leading figure in the boycott, said conversation about the action – for and against – was everywhere. Lind, a student from Malmö, said she was doing it both as somebody who was affected by the “unreasonably high prices” and as an “act of solidarity for others”.

Calling for government to act, she said: “Politicians need to step in and break apart this oligopoly that is causing high prices because of lack of competition between grocery companies.”

Now they plan to continue their protest with a three-week boycott of Ica, which is Sweden's leading grocery retailer with around a third of the market share, and the dairy producer Arla. After that, they say, they will add more companies to the boycott list.

“I hope it will lead to political action that will indefinitely lower the prices on basic goods,” said Lind.

Accusing the centre-right, Moderate party-led coalition government of inaction, the Social Democrat economic spokesperson, Mikael Damberg, said in parliament on Tuesday: “In Sweden today, ordinary families empty their savings accounts and borrow money to get through everyday life.”

In response, the finance minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, said that inflation had fallen since the government took office in 2022, when it was about 10%. In February 2025, the inflation rate was 1.3% – up from 0.6% in January.

But, she acknowledged, food prices were still high. “To support those who have it hardest is important,” she said. “It is also important now to see what we can do about food prices.”

The minister of rural affairs, Peter Kullgren, said price rises had been caused by largely international factors such as higher commodity prices due to crop failures, but said that competition in trade needed improving.

“Food prices have increased over time and they hit the economically weakest households hardest: families with children, students and the old on low pensions. It needs to be addressed,” Kullgren said.

He added that tackling the problem and ensuring prices stabilise was a “high priority” for the government, which met with food industry figures last Thursday. He described their discussions about high food prices as “constructive” and promised: “We will now take that work further.”

On Friday, the government also presented a new food strategy that included measures to increase Swedish food production. Kullgren said he wants to see better competition in the food industry, including the launch of new grocery stores to encourage competition throughout the country.

He also warned that boycotts could have “the opposite effect” of the one intended, and said he could not support them.

Jenny Pedersén, a spokesperson for Hemköp, was unable to comment on how customer numbers had been affected by the boycott, but said food prices in Sweden were being affected in the same way they were in other countries.

“There are many factors that are affecting food prices,” she said. “Everything from war, geopolitics, commodity prices, processing costs, climate change, weather and harvests.

“There are a few categories driving inflation at the moment – in particular dairy, coffee and cocoa/chocolate. Dairy is one of the biggest grocery store categories, and therefore has a big impact on inflation, both its rise and fall.”

The Coop chain said it had seen a “slight decline” in customer numbers last week compared with the same time last year, but were unable to pinpoint a definitive reason.

“We do not rule out that there is a certain effect of the boycott, but it is still difficult to assess,” said its spokesperson Håkan Andersson.

The Ica spokesperson Jenny Gerdes said the impact of the boycott varied significantly between stores, but that some stores had seen “some impact”, including increased food waste.

“We understand our customers' concerns about rising food prices and respect their right to express their frustration,” she said. “It has become more expensive to grow, produce, package and transport food, but also to run a store.”

Johanna Eurén, a spokesperson for Willys, said: “We have full understanding for customers and the worry and frustration that food prices have increased. We understand that people want to show their discontent.” However, she added: “We probably think the boycott is a bit misguided.”

Lidl and Arla were also contacted for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Report finds that 98 domestic abuse victims in England and Wales died by suspected suicide in 2023-2024

Domestic abusers are driving their victims to suicide, police have warned as they admitted to past mistakes and pledged to investigate more “hidden” cases of violence against women.

The concession came as a new report revealed that deaths by suicide among victims of domestic abuse surpassed the number of people killed by an intimate partner for a second year in a row.

The 1,012 domestic abuse-related deaths recorded in the past four years were described as a “grim milestone” by Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for domestic abuse. She said it showed “how deeply ingrained violence against women and girls is in our communities”.

Of the 262 domestic abuse-related deaths recorded in England and Wales between the start of April 2023 and the end of March last year, 98 were classified as suspected victim suicide following domestic abuse (SVSDA).

The latest report by the Domestic Homicide Project, which is funded by the Home Office and led by the NPCC using live police records, also examined deaths where someone had fallen from a height.

Twenty-two such deaths were recorded across 13 forces during the four-year period. Of these, 36% were recorded as SVSDA and 27% as unexpected deaths.

Three of the women who died from a fall were pregnant at the time of their death, a proportion the report called “notably” high, considering that just five women in the entire four-year sample were pregnant.

The analysis was carried out in collaboration with the campaign group Killed Women, which has pushed for domestic abuse to be a key line of inquiry for police investigating any death of a woman who has fallen from a height.

In 2024, the Guardian's Killed Women Count campaign reported on every woman allegedly killed by a man. At the end of the year, the number of deaths stood at 80.

Rolfe, a Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, told a briefing that she expected to see a rise in the number of manslaughter convictions as a result of a new “unexpected deaths policy”, which will prompt officers to consider whether domestic abuse could have been a contributing factor in an individual's death.

She said there was a challenge in Britain's “adversarial” legal system when it came to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a causal link between domestic abuse and someone taking their own life.

“Of course, the burden of proof should sit with the prosecution,” she said. “But what's really clear from the research and speaking with families is that in the past, in too many cases, investigators have missed obvious patterns of coercive, controlling behaviour.

“I don't think police are missing homicides that are staged [to look like] suicide. However, it's very clear that there is more for us to do to be really curious about what's happened, to ensure that evidence at the scene of an incident is very thoroughly captured and explored.”

Rolfe also said that she wanted “to be able to answer victims' families' questions and be able to look them in the eye and say that every possible line of inquiry was followed”.

She added: “I've met some incredibly impressive families who have felt they themselves have needed to investigate after their loved one's death, and that's wrong, because that's our job, and we must do that.”

The report also revealed that 68% of victims and/or perpetrators of domestic abuse were known to the police or another agency, and called for better information-sharing to prevent future deaths.

In 54% of domestic homicides, the perpetrator was already known to the police, and in 90% of SVSDA cases involving a history of coercive and controlling behaviour, the suspect had previous contact with agencies other than the police.

The proportion of deaths that were killings by current or former partners remained at about 30% across the four-year period, the report found.

The 1,012 domestic abuse-related deaths recorded over the four years include 501 domestic homicides – 332 by current or ex-partners and 169 by another adult relative. The most commonly recorded risk factors in relation to suspects were mental ill health, a history of coercive and controlling behaviour, alcohol use and drug misuse.

Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: “The better we understand the links between domestic abuse and homicides, suicides and unexpected deaths, the better equipped we are to prevent them from happening in the first place.”

The One Day actor will star in Sophia Chetin-Leuner's Porn Play, one of four new premieres announced by the London theatre

Ambika Mod is to star as an academic addicted to violent pornography in a new play at the Royal Court in London. Mod, best known for her screen performances in One Day and This Is Going to Hurt, will take on her highest profile theatre role to date in Porn Play, written by Sophia Chetin-Leuner and directed by Josie Rourke.

Billed as “funny, unsettling and honest”, it opens in November at the Royal Court's smaller Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Chetin-Leuner, whose play This Might Not Be It was set in a mental health unit and staged at the Bush last year, said: “Ever since I was a teenager, going to see plays at the Royal Court has shaped my ideals and purpose of who I want to be as a writer – so it's a terrifying privilege to have Porn Play debuting here.” The play was shortlisted for Soho theatre's Verity Bargate award in 2022. Chetin-Leuner said she began writing it to explore the effects of pornography on women but that it has “evolved into something much more delicate and intricate over the years”.

Mod, who studied at the St Albans performing arts school Theatrix, is also an improv and sketch comedian. Last summer she appeared with the comedy troupe the Free Association at the Edinburgh fringe. Her stage productions have included Nassim Soleimanpour's White Rabbit Red Rabbit, a monologue which performers deliver sight unseen.

Porn Play is one of four new premieres announced by the Royal Court. Deaf Republic, which opens in August, is adapted from the poems of Ukrainian-American author Ilya Kaminsky and will be staged by the company Dead Centre, collaborating with the poet Zoë McWhinney. It will be told through spoken English, sign language, creative captioning and puppetry, using an ensemble of deaf and hearing actors.

That will be followed by a co-production with the National Theatre of Greece entitled Cow | Deer created by Katie Mitchell, Nina Segal and Melanie Wilson. A performance with no words, it will evoke the lives of the eponymous animals and is described by the trio as “an experiment in recalibration … looking beyond the purely human into the more-than-human world”.

Opening in October is a new play by Nick Payne, The Unbelievers, starring Nicola Walker who is currently in the throuple comedy Unicorn in the West End. The Unbelievers will be directed by Marianne Elliott who called it an “honest exploration of motherhood”. The theatre also announced the return of Soleimanpour's Echo, which had a short run last summer, and a tour for Breach theatre's Section 28 musical After the Act, previously staged at the New Diorama in London when it was run by David Byrne, who took over at the Royal Court in 2024. It was also announced that Tife Kusoro, whose play G drew acclaim last year, will join the theatre on attachment for 18 months and write a new play.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Academic who died in 1987 is thought to be responsible for documents that vanished over a 30-year period

Scotland's national archive has traced the mysterious disappearance of more than 3,000 historical documents over a period of 30 years to a history professor with an all-consuming interest in stamps.

The theft began to unravel when a National Records of Scotland archivist attended an auction in London in 1994. There, he discovered that 200 of the items for sale belonged to the archive, some still marked with their NRS reference numbers.

The items, 3,100 items in total, mainly family, estate and business correspondence, were traced back to an academic and archivist, Prof David Macmillan, who died in 1987. Born in Ayrshire, Macmillan studied history at the University of Glasgow before teaching at the University of Sydney and then Trent University in Ontario, Canada, where he was a professor for 20 years.

Records showed that he made annual visits to the NRS archives as a user from 1969 until 1980, when he was caught taking a single item from the archive in Edinburgh and his access was immediately revoked. It was assumed at the time that this was an isolated incident.

But the scale of his thefts became apparent in 2012, when a researcher saw a reference in an online catalogue at Trent University to an item he thought may have belonged in Scotland and raised concerns. NRS archivists went on to discover about 2,900 items which had been stolen by Macmillan and then gifted to Trent University's archives after his death.

Although Prof Macmillan was not convicted of any offences, NRS is confident that he carried out the thefts, which experts believe were motivated by his interest in stamps and postmarks. The correspondence he took was not of high financial or historical value, and it remains a mystery why someone whose own working life was sustained by the use of archives would abuse the trust of these institutions in such a blatant manner.

Dr Alan Borthwick, head of medieval and early modern records at NRS, said: “In essence he was looking for correspondence, especially from parts of the world where Scots were involved in general personal or business matters, but also routine domestic correspondence, which might turn out to have unusual postmarks – a bit magpie-like, he was attracted by something ‘shiny' even if most people couldn't see the attraction.”

NRS now has almost all its documents back in their rightful position, overseen by more robust security measures than Macmillan encountered, which protect its collection of 38m documents spanning nearly 1,000 years of Scottish history.

Of the 3,100 items returned, about 2,000 were stolen from the NRS archives, with others taken directly from other institutions across the UK including the National Archives and the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh and the National Library of Scotland.

About 500 items were found to belong to collections held by private owners, and 100 items remain of unknown origin.

Alison Byrne, chief executive of NRS, said: “These historical thefts were on an unprecedented scale and carried out we believe by one individual who was a regular visitor to the institutions he stole from.

“Thanks to the highly detailed and painstaking work of NRS archivists, we have been able to restore these records to their original collections and ensure they are available for study once again.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Employees who may have to return home risk death or imprisonment at hands of authoritarian governments

Foreign workers at US government-backed media outlets being cut by the Trump administration say they face deportation to their home countries, where some risk imprisonment or death at the hands of authoritarian governments.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration moved to defund the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent federal agency that oversees the Voice of America (VoA), the US's largest and oldest international broadcaster, and provides grants to Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe and other news agencies. The agency had around 3,500 employees with an annual budget of $886m in 2024.

“We have many coworkers in different services, several of whom came here and sought asylum visas. If their own government knew they worked for RFA [Radio Free Asia] and they went back to their own country, their lives would be at risk,” Jaewoo Park, a journalist for RFA, told the Guardian.

“Authoritarian governments have praised what Trump is doing right now,” Park said. “In Burma, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, there were people who fought for freedom and democracy, and they came to work at RFA. It's very risky for them. Their lives are in danger if Radio Free Asia doesn't exist.”

Chinese and Russian state media have praised the cuts of the news agencies, with a Russian broadcaster calling the cuts a “holiday” for Russian state media outlets.

The shuttering of the agency was unexpected and has caused chaos for Park and others. “My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and we're very concerned because I might go back to South Korea because I'm on a working visa. My wife is almost due and we just bought a home last year,” he added. “It's very concerning and depressing.”

But the impact of the decision will be felt globally, said Park. He cited Radio Free Asia's broadcasts to North Korea which, he noted, defectors from North Korea have cited as an important source of independent news.

“We know North Korea is a very oppressed country. They cannot hear anything other than the government press,” he said.

Workers at Voice of America have also pointed out the risks and dangers posed to some employees on visas who may have to return to their home countries now their positions are in jeopardy.

Two contributors for VoA are currently imprisoned in Myanmar and Vietnam and four contributors to Radio Free Asia are currently imprisoned in Vietnam. Russia, Belarus and Azerbaijan also reportedly have journalists affiliated with the news agencies currently imprisoned.

“Dozens of VoA staffers in Washington are on J-1 visas [non-immigrant visas meant to encourage cultural exchange], and if they lose them, they may have to return to countries whose governments have a record of jailing critics,” wrote Liam Scott in the Columbia Journalism Review, a VoA journalist who was notified their contract would be terminated on 31 March. “Two Russian contractors on J-1 visas who are set to be officially terminated at the end of March are considered at significant risk of being imprisoned if they return to Russia, according to a VoA staffer with knowledge of the situation.”

Stanislav Aseyev, a Ukrainian journalist, shared in a post on X that he was tortured for writing for Radio Liberty after being told it was an “enemy” of Russia.

“Now, the ‘enemy of Russia' is being destroyed by America itself, and my torture seems doubly in vain,” he wrote.

A VOA employee who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told the Guardian: “Screwing over the people who worked for them and helped them, reminds me of what happened to Afghan interpreters.” Following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Afghan interpreters for the US military were left behind, stranded and in danger while trying to obtain special visas to escape to the US.

“It would be an even bigger shame if people that sacrificed for our country were thrown under the bus. It's a tremendous own goal in terms of US foreign policy and US national interests,” they said.

Federal workers, journalists and labor unions filed a lawsuit last week against the US Agency for Global Media over the shuttering of the agency by the Trump administration, seeking immediate relief to reverse it.

Donald Trump issued an executive order to defund the US Agency for Global Media, on 14 March. Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, formally joined Voice of America as special adviser in late February 2025.

Lake lost the 2022 election for governor of Arizona and a 2024 US Senate race in Arizona as the Republican nominee. She claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump and filed lawsuits claiming her 2022 election bid was also stolen from her. Those lawsuits were dismissed and her lawyers were recently ordered by a federal court to pay $122,000 in legal fees to Maricopa County for the “frivolous” lawsuits.

Lake claimed in a press release that the agency was “not salvageable” and accused it of “massive national security violations, including spies and terrorist sympathizers and/or supporters infiltrating the agency”.

The US state department and US Agency for Global Media did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Asked about the visa and immigration statuses for workers at the news agencies during a press briefing on 21 March, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “I have the question out to the secretary. It's something that I'm following up with as well. He's a busy guy.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Head of tech giant's consumer electronics and mobile devices division passed away at a hospital on Tuesday

South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics said on Tuesday that its co-chief executive officer Han Jong-hee has died due to cardiac arrest. Han was 63.

Han was in charge of Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile devices division, while co-CEO Jun Young-hyun oversees the chip business of South Korea's biggest company.

Han passed away at a hospital on Tuesday while being treated for cardiac arrest, a company spokesperson said, adding that a successor had not yet been decided.

The South Korean firm has been suffering from weak earnings and sagging share prices in recent quarters after falling behind rivals in advanced memory chips and contract chip manufacturing, which have enjoyed strong demand from artificial intelligence projects. Samsung has also ceded its smartphone market crown to Apple.

Han, who joined Samsung Electronics nearly 40 years ago, built his career in the TV business. He became vice-chair and CEO of Samsung Electronics in 2022. Han was also one of the company's board members.

He chaired Samsung's shareholder meeting last week, where he and other executives were grilled by shareholders after the company's failure to ride an AI boom made it one of the worst-performing tech stocks last year.

In semiconductors, Samsung lags behind SK Hynix in HBM chips that Nvidia and others rely on for AI graphic processing units.

“First and foremost, I sincerely apologise for the recent stock performance not meeting your expectations. Over the past year, our company failed to adequately respond to the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market,” Han said.

He was scheduled to attend Samsung's launch event for new home appliances on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ballal released after spending night on floor of military base after he was detained following attack by Jewish settlers in West Bank

Hamdan Ballal – the oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces – has been released from detention, it has been confirmed.

My colleague Lorenzo Tondo has more in this report:

Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians left a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they were being held on Tuesday. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.

The three had spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack, according to Ballal's lawyer, Lea Tsemel.

The Israeli military said on Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation. On Tuesday, it referred further queries to police, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lamia Ballal, the director's wife, said she heard her husband being beaten outside their home as she huddled inside with their three children. She heard him screaming, “I'm dying!” and calling for an ambulance. When she looked out the window, she saw three men in uniform beating Ballal with the butts of their rifles and another person in civilian clothes who appeared to be filming the violence.

“Of course, after the Oscar, they have come to attack us more,” Lamia said. “I felt afraid.”

In an earlier post, we reported that Israeli shelling had, according to officials, killed at least five people in southern Syria earlier on Tuesday.

The Syrian foreign ministry has now put out a statement in reaction to the deadly attack (this text has been translated):

The Israeli forces' brutality is unacceptable. We affirm our absolute rejection of these crimes. 

We call for an international investigation into the crimes committed against innocent people and into Israeli violations. We also call on the Syrian people to hold on to their land and reject any attempts at displacement or the imposition of a new reality by force. 

We affirm that these attacks will not deter Syrians from defending their rights and their land.

Press freedom organisations have condemned the killing of two journalists in Gaza on Monday, who died in separate targeted airstrikes by the Israeli armed forces.

Hossam Shabat, a 23-year-old correspondent for the Al Jazeera Mubasher channel, was killed by an airstrike on his car in the eastern part of Beit Lahiya.

Video reportedly from minutes after the airstrike, which has not been verified by the Guardian, shows people gathering around the shattered and smoking car and pulling a body out of the wreckage.

Mohammed Mansour, a correspondent for Palestine Today, was also killed on Monday, reportedly along with his wife and son, in an airstrike on his home in south Khan Younis.

In the hours after the deaths, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Palestinian press freedom organisations released statements condemning the attacks. “CPJ is appalled that we are once again seeing Palestinians weeping over the bodies of dead journalists in Gaza,” said Carlos Martínez de la Serna, CPJ's program director.

“This nightmare in Gaza has to end. The international community must act fast to ensure that journalists are kept safe and hold Israel to account for the deaths of Hossam Shabat and Mohammed Mansour. Journalists are civilians and it is illegal to attack them in a war zone.”

Oscar-winning Palestinian director Hamdan Ballal, who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces, has been released from detention.

At least 50,144 Palestinian people have been killed and 113,704 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement earlier today.

The Israeli military issued more calls to evacuate parts of northern Gaza, telling Palestinians to head towards “known shelters” in the south even though there is no guarantee of safety there.

Israeli legislators have given their approval to the 2025 state budget, a key test for Benjamin Netanyahu's fragile coalition government that would be at risk of collapse if the vote didn't go his way and snap elections were called.

At least five people have been killed in Israeli shelling of the southern Syrian province of Daraa, local authorities said. It came after the Israeli military said it had launched attacks on the Syrian airbases of Tadmur and T-4.

In a post on X early this morning, the United States Central Command (Centcom) appeared to confirm fresh attacks on Yemen, targeting Houthi rebels. The post came after reports of new US attacks on the northern province of Saada, which reportedly injured at least two people and destroyed a cancer hospital.

No Other Land, a film about Israeli displacement of a Palestinian community, won the documentary feature film Oscar at the beginning of this month.

The documentary, which has Palestinian and Israeli directors, focuses on the steady forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes in Masafer Yatta, a region in the occupied West Bank targeted by Israeli forces.

The film's co-directors are Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham. It highlights the parallel realities in which the two friends live - Abraham with his yellow Israeli number plate that lets him travel anywhere, while Adra is confined to a territory that only ever gets smaller for Palestinians, despite it being their homeland.

Despite the critical acclaim, the film could not find distribution in the US and was self-distributed instead. “I believe it's clear that it's for political reasons,” Abraham told Deadline about the lack of formal distribution.

In an acceptance speech after winning an Oscar, Abraham said:

We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together our voices are stronger. We see each other, the atrocious destruction of Gaza and its people which must end, the Israeli hostages brutally taken in the crime of October 7, which must be freed.

When I look at Basel, I see my brother but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military law that destroys his life and he cannot control.

There is a different path. A political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. And I have to say as I'm here, the foreign policy in this country is helping to block this path.

And why? Can't you see that we are intertwined? That my people can be truly safe if Basel's people are truly free and safe. There is another way. It's not too late for life, for the living.

The lawyer for Oscar award winning Palestinian director Hamdan Ballal, who was attacked by a group of Israeli settlers, says he will be released from detention by the Israeli military (see post at 11.18 for more details).

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Ballal, one of four co-directors of the No Other Land documentary, made the announcement. It is unclear when Ballal will be released.

Tsemel said on Tuesday that her client and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.

She had earlier said they were accused of throwing stones at a young settler, allegations they deny.

Ballal had his house in the Israeli-occupied West Bank surrounded by settlers during yesterday's attack in the village of Susya, the Center for Jewish Nonviolence group (CJNV) said.

On Tuesday, Israel confirmed it had killed an Al Jazeera employee in the Gaza Strip, accusing the journalist, Hussam Shabat, of being a “sniper terrorist” for Hamas, the AFP news agency reports.

Al Jazeera said Shabat was killed on Monday by an Israeli strike on his vehicle in northern Gaza. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the attack as part of a “massacre of journalists” in the Palestinian territory.

A joint statement released by Israeli military and Shin Bet internal security agency said that forces had “eliminated... a sniper terrorist from the Beit Hanun Battalion of the Hamas terrorist organisation, who was also employed as a journalist by Al Jazeera”.

Referring to Shabat, the Israeli statement that said security forces had “in October 2024... exposed the terrorist's direct affiliation with the military wing of the Hamas terrorist organisation”.

Israel has repeatedly accused Al Jazeera reporters in Gaza of being “terrorist operatives” affiliated with groups like Hamas and has suspended the network's broadcasts. The network vehemently denies these accusations.

Jonathan Dagher, head of the RSF's Middle East desk, said in a statement that Israel's accusations from 2024 “can in no way justify his murder, as they are based on documents that in no way constitute that the journalist had any affiliation” with Hamas's armed wing.

According to the Israeli statement, “internal Hamas documents” proved Shabat had taken part in military training conducted by the militant group's Beit Hanun Battalion in 2019.

Al Jazeera denies Israel's accusations and says Israel systematically targets its staff in Gaza.

Israel's state budget has become law, the Times of Israel reports.

The passing of the budget occurred before a 31 March deadline that would have seen Netanyahu's government fall if not passed.

“The budget has everything we need to win on the front and on the home front. We all approached this budget with a great sense of mission and responsibility,” said finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.

“We promoted measures that will support growth and allow the Israeli economy to maintain its strength and continue to prosper. This is a war budget, and, God willing, it will also be the victory budget.”

Israel Katz, Israel's defence minister, said on Tuesday that if Hamas continues to not hand over hostages taken on 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group will pay “a heavy price,” Reuters reports.

“Our main goal now is to return all the kidnapped people home. If Hamas continues its refusal, it will pay increasingly heavy prices in taking territory and thwarting terrorist operatives and infrastructure until it is completely defeated,” Katz said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

First-half goals from Jackson Irvine and Nishan Velupillay gave Australia a crucial win in China as they seek to pip Saudi Arabia to automatic World cup qualification

Aha, Joey Lynch's report is with us.

That means we're done here, so thanks for your company and see you next time. Peace.

I would like to apologise to young Benji and his parents,” Mr Gallico said in a club statement. “My actions were wrong. I should never have pushed Benji, or any child for that matter, the way I did on Saturday.”

What a sentence that is!

This is great to see.

I can't lie, crocs are perhaps my favourite animals – now that you ask. The purity of their evil is special.

For your ears…

Oh, more questions. Irvine praises Ryan Teague's quality and composure on debut, noting that he's done really well at club level. Otherwise, he praises China's second-half improvement but thinks Australia defended the box well and limited them to crosses and shots from distance. “Everything to play for,” he says in conclusion. “Exciting times.”

Irvine is player of the match and extols a massive team effort for this win and the one against Bahrain at the weekend. He's had a difficult club season in front of goal, he says, but he seems pretty happy with today's work.

The Australia players linger, celebrating a massive win. They've still plenty of work to do – they have to assume Saudi will beat Bahrain, so they'll need either a win in Japan or a draw in Riyad to qualify at this juncture.

A tremendous win for the Socceroos. A win in Japan, or a draw in Saudi, and they qualify for the World Cup automatically.

90+2 min Credit where it's due, the home fans are still having it.

90+1 min Another change for Australia, former golden boy Arzani on for Boyle, who's played well.

90+1 min A long ball and Abduweili controls well, a touch setting Wang Ziming for a shot, which he slices miles from anywhere.

90 min We'll have three added minutes.

89 min This has been a pretty good effort from Australia, who took what they needed in the first half and have protected it well enough in the second.

89 min What is wrong with people? Barbra Banda is a hero.

87 min and that's Wang's last contribution; he's replaced by Wang Ziming.

86 min Wang volleys clear and Degenek hesitates, opting to let the ball bounce, and Serginho reads that better than he does, collecting and moving on to Zhang, who shoots wide. He's put loads into this game, but hasn't found the quality to affect it.

84 min China might just've run out of ideas. Australia are doing a much better job of controlling possession now, spreading play wide then turning to go backwards, and so on. I'm not sure China have the legs left to press them.

82 min Two further changes for Australia, Caceres and Duke replacing Borrello and Velupillay.

81 min Of course, Australia are no strangers to playing off to reach the finals.

80 min Whoever finishes third and fourth in the group will then move into a fourth round with the other third and fourth-placed teams – there are two groups of three with the winners of each to qualify and the second-places to play off for the right to join an intercontinental playoff.

77 min Two more changes for Australia: Karacic and O'Neill replace Miller and Teague. Miller, in particular, was extremely effective in the first half, his attacking impetus crucuial to securing that 2-0 half-time lead.

76 min “Japan v Saudi-Arabia was reasonably fun, as far as goalless draws go,” returns Kári Tulinius. “Hervé Renard sent his Green Falcons out to get a draw, and they did. Samurai Blue had a number of good chances, but couldn't convert. Like previous iterations of the team, they play extremely attractive football, but lack that cutting edge up front which might get them far in the World Cup. Meanwhile, the stars of the show in Saitama were the fans, who cheered on their side and sang all the way through the match.”

The China fans have also been excellent. I guess Saudi are assuming they can beat Bahrain and that australia won't beat Japan, meaning a win in the final match will take them through.

74 min Credit to China, they've given this a good go, and they're on the attack again when Wang Yudong catches Degenek in possession down the left, finding Zhang, who crosses … but again, Ryan dives to collect. He's been very secure so far.

72 min Accordingly, if Australia see this one out and given their vastly superior goal difference, a win against Japan will see them through; a draw will be enough if Saudi don't beat Bahrain.

70 min Japan v Saudi has ended goalless so, assuming for a moment that Australia see this out, they'll be three points ahead of Saudi with two games to go.

68 min Now then! Zhang wins the ball outside the box down the left, quickly punches a cross into the middle … where Degenek does well to intercept and clear.

67 min A double chsnge for China. Off go Huang and Xie; on come Wang Yudong and Wang Haijian.

66 min This time, Wang punches the corner clear, Australia look to sustain the attack, and Miller is penalised for fouling Serginho.

65 min Australia might've weathered the storm. They win another corner, this time down the left…

64 min They're playing added time in Saitama, where it remains Japan 0-0 Saudi.

62 min Teague, on debut, humps a booming corner to the back post where Degenek, having lost Abduweili, steers a side-footed volley wide of the near. That was a really good chance to finish this, and a reminder that Australia are better when looking to score than when hoping to defend.

61 min Australia need to find a way of keeping possession, or at least an out-ball. Currently, they're having to defend attack after attack, but as I type, Miller wins a corner off Jiang, their first of the second half.

60 min The corner is swung way too deep to the edge, and Yang's eventual shot is nowhere near goal.

59 min Here come China again, Yang bursting down the right and slinging over a cross that forces Miller to chest behind, under pressure form Li.

57 min Nice again from China, Huang dashing around the outside and clipping back a cross for Zhang, who arrives at the ball ahead of Burgesss … but can't wrap his head around it, instead powering an effort into the near-post side-netting. Australia need to do something to halt the home side's momentum here, because this is one-way traffic.

55 min And here come China again, Zhang finding Abduweili, who lays off immediately for Serginho and, from the edge, he panels a shot that's too close to Ryan; the keeper dives to palm behind, and the corner comes to nowt.

54 min We've not seen Australia as an attacking force this half. I guess they're happy with that thy've got, but their defence doesn't look strong enough to rely on.

52 min Xie curls the corner in and again, Ryan is there, this time punching clear. He's been solid so far tonight but, as Brighton fans will confirm, he's always got a ricket in him.

51 min China keep at it, though, Xu seeing a shot blocked behind for a corner, which gets the home crowd going – they're bouncing away behind the goal and the noise is decent.

50 min Australia's narrow back three are making it difficult for China to attack through the middle, but they send it wide to Li, who swings cross out … and Abduweili contorts to impart brow to ball … but Ryan plunges left to field easily enough.

48 min China have started the half on the front foot, Australia sitting off. I guess they don't want to risk pressing because they don't want to leave open space to be attacked. And, as I type, a ball in behind looks to have released Zhang down the left side of the box, but a phalanx of defenders get between him and the men up in support, then Australia clear and Borrello turns Han … who manhandles him to the ground.

46 min China have made a half-time change, Serginho coming on for his debut in place of the ineffectual Wei.

 46 min We go again…

Australia re back out early, keeping warm and such. David Moyes' Everton did that the year they finished fourth, the idea being to show their opponents they were readier to go … then in typical Ev style, they drew Villarreal in Champions League qualifying and got battered.

Half-time entertainment:

With 57 minutes gone in Saitama, it remains Japan 0-0 Saudi Arabia.

A fine first half for the Socceroos, who look good to record an important victory.

45+3 min Miller has been a danger all half and again, he gets down the right before digging out a cross … but there's no one there to attack it.

45+3 min China aren't quite out of this yet – they've shown an ability to get behind Australia, but not yet found a killer pass or cross.

45+1 min We'll have three additional minutes.

45 min It seems that Trent Alexander-Arnold is indeed leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid. I guess for free, that makes some kind of sense, but on the other hand, brilliant though his ball-striking is, he offers every opponent a defensive weakness to target.

43 min Ach, China work an overload, them, looking for Li down the right, Xu passes into touch. Still, they moved the ball nicely there.

41 min Australia have played well so far. The quality isn't great, but they started with aggression and intensity, not allowing China to settle, and that's a lot of the reaoson they lead 2-0.

39 min China crowd the six-yard box – there are 13 men in it – but the delivery isn't great. Still, though, Burgess feels forced to head behind, so Wei will go again … and this time, Ryan collects competently enough.

37 min A quiet period. China are doing their best to haul themselves back into the game, but are struggling to find the attacking edge. Still, again they get down the right, forcing Burgess to slide a cross behind at cost of a corner.

35 min Better from China, Xu getting around the side of the Australia defence and cutting back, but there's no one there to collect; no matter. Wei then picks up possession and from the edge, unleashes a nasty outswinger that flies just past the far post.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Analysts warn a European force would have difficulty sustaining a peacekeeping mission over time — particularly if there's no backing from the United States.

LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was among the first leaders to volunteer troops to help protect a postwar Ukraine. With French President Emmanuel Macron, he's working to recruit partners for a coalition of the willing to staff an international peacekeeping force.

The British public — including those of fighting age — is generally amenable to the idea of sending troops to Ukraine. The U.K. has a long history of military intervention overseas; Brits are used to turning on the telly and seeing their compatriots deployed in foreign countries. Prince William visited Estonia last week to show support for the British soldiers guarding NATO's border with Russia.

But within the security community, concern is growing about whether a European force could sustain such a mission long term — particularly if there's no meaningful backing from the United States.

There's a “lot of caution about how the force will operate, what the mandate will be, whether they could enjoy American cover or not, or whether they could become sitting ducks for being tested by Putin,” said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a security think tank. And there are “grave doubts” in the defense community about the capacity to support a European mission for what “is likely to be years and years of commitment.”

The British Army, like many worldwide, faces major challenges in recruitment and retention. In 2010, it numbered  more than 100,000 full-time personnel; by 2024, it had fallen to 72,000.

“Generation Z is not joining the Armed Forces in the way my generation did,” former Defense Minister Ben Wallace, 54, said once.

Recent polling suggests younger Britons are, indeed, less willing to enlist. Only 11 percent aged 18 to 27 say they would fight for Britain if called upon — half as many as in the same survey 20 years ago. Thirty-seven percent said they would fight only if they agreed with the cause; 41 percent said they wouldn't under any circumstances.

On a recent afternoon in central London, young people entering an army recruitment office — a self-selecting group — expressed more enthusiasm.

“If it means keeping the peace, definitely, I'd go to Ukraine,” said Dominykas Beloglazovas, 18, emerging from the office after asking about the army.

If a ceasefire allows a European peacekeeping or “reassurance” force — an idea Russia has rejected — the heavy lifting would likely fall to Britain and France. Other countries, including Australia, Canada, Denmark and Sweden, have also said they are considering sending forces in some form.

In Britain, Cambridge law professor Catherine Barnard says, there's consensus around the war. “There is a strong British understanding that Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022,” she said. “It's not a messy situation in the sense that these things are unclear. … You don't have the complexity around the situation like we did in Iraq.”

Officials have discussed a force of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops. After a meeting of military chiefs of Ukraine's allies outside London on Thursday, Starmer mentioned potential air and sea support, also.

Reversing the “hollowing out” of British forces in recent years would require spending “something on the far side of 3 percent” of GDP, according to Ben Barry, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Starmer pledged recently to increase defense spending to 2.5 percent by 2027.

Britain and others “could probably provide 30,000 troops in Ukraine,” Barry said, but would “struggle to sustain them for the long term.”

Outside the recruitment center, Beloglazovas wasn't surprised by his peers' lack of enthusiasm to join the army.

“I want to sign up for the sake of protecting this country,” he said. “It's a part of me that has to be filled in.” But he recognized that “not many people want to join, because they are scared, and there's a lack of patriotism nowadays.”

Recruitment challenges here long predate the war in Ukraine.

“It's fiendishly difficult,” said Eyal, the analyst. “One of the problems that nobody likes to discuss when we talk about boosting defense expenditure is that you can buy a lot of military equipment if you throw money at it, but you can't manpower overnight. That takes time.”

Still, he noted, action often generates an uptick in interest.

“If the deployments in Ukraine are not too dangerous, that could actually improve or provide a short boost,” he said.

At a cafe near the recruitment center, two men were asked whether they would feel duty-bound to enlist if British troops were stationed in Ukraine. They debated.

“I'd likely sign up,” said Dan Clarkson, 25, a skilled trades worker eating chicken and chips on his lunch break. But he'd want to believe in the “reason behind it.” “Things like fighting for land and power, I think that's a bit dated.”

He opposes conscription, he said, and didn't think many his age would join even if there were a draft. (Britain abolished compulsory national service in 1960, and there's no talk of reinstating it.)

“In World War I and World War II the country seemed very patriotic. Now I think, no one's really bothered. If things kick off, the mood is ‘I'll just move to Spain' or something. Everyone's been bubble-wrapped for the last 20-odd years. There's no, ‘Let's stand and fight for the country.' There's nothing like that.”

Vytautas Stankevicius, 34, ruled out the idea of enlisting for medical reasons but expressed skepticism about the mission overall. “Even if they agree to peace, they aren't going to keep the agreement for peace,” he said. “Putin wants to get all the old lands Russia had when it was in the Soviet Union. As soon as Putin sees an opportunity, he's going to strike again.”

Back at the recruitment center, Richard, a 21-year-old soldier whose service is split between a ceremonial role, in dress uniform and bearskin hat, and front line work, said talk of deployment to Ukraine was premature.

“I don't think it's about to happen anytime soon,” said Richard, who spoke on the condition his last name be withheld because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “The civvies and public think it's kicking off, but we don't think so.”

“But if it does, I'd go and help with the civilian side of stuff, then I'd feel like I'm helping towards something, yeah?”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Hossam Shabat and Mohammad Mansour are among more than 170 journalists killed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for  Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram only hours before he was killed was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called the “assassination” of its correspondent, Shabat, and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said that it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

This is Hossam's team, and we are sharing his final message :“If you're reading this, it means I have been killed—most likely targeted—by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old—a college student with dreams like anyone else. For past 18… pic.twitter.com/80aNO6wtfO

In the post, Shabat said that for the past 18 months, he had dedicated “every moment of my life to my people,” documenting the horrors in Gaza to “show the world the truth they tried to bury.”

“By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven't known in the past 18 months,” he wrote. “I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honor of my life to die defending it and serving its people.”

The message was signed: “For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.”

More than 170 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the war in October 2023, according to CPJ, which has maintained a database of all journalists killed for their work over the past 30 years.

During the war, Shabat became known for his live reporting from on the ground and heartfelt interviews with people who had lost so much. Wearing a press vest and helmet, he documented moments of grief and tragedy in crowded hospitals, displacement camps and the sites of strikes. He spoke with parents mourning their dead babies, people calling out for their family in the rubble, and mothers whom he calmed down when they couldn't speak through weeping.

He also found moments of joy — such as his tearful reunion with family after a year and a half of war.

A post shared by Khaled Beydoun (@khaledbeydoun)

Videos posted by Al Jazeera after his killing show a crowd of people surrounding his lifeless body, shouting his name and weeping. The video could not be immediately verified by The Washington Post.

In March 2024, Shabat visited a northern Gaza hospital to document sick children who were facing deteriorating conditions. There, he and other Gaza-based journalists discovered Fadi al-Zant, who, after videos of the emaciated 6-year-old went viral, became one of a handful of children evacuated to receive medical care in the United States, as The Post reported in July.

Mansour, who was also a correspondent for Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun, was killed by a missile strike at his home in Khan Younis, and his wife and child were injured, the newspaper said. “Attacks against civilians, including journalists, are never acceptable under any circumstance,” Kengo Sakajiri, the paper's executive editor added in a statement.

In a statement, the IDF said it had “struck several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists in the area of Khan Younis and Rafah” on Monday, and that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance, additional intelligence and precise munitions.”

When Shabat, along with five other journalists, was first labeled a militant by Israel in October, Al Jazeera warned that what the network described as “fabricated accusations” may serve as a “pretext for further violence” against the journalists.

The IDF in October said six Al Jazeera journalists were “exposed” as alleged members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad based on what it said were documents found in Gaza that Israel alleged confirmed their military affiliations, including directories and training documents. The Israeli military released the documents, along with screenshots of them that included IDF-transposed labels and English translations.

Posting the photos and names of the journalists, the Israeli military said most of the journalists were allegedly part of “Hamas's military wing [spearheading] propaganda for Hamas at Al Jazeera.” The Post could not verify the authenticity of the documents.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for several areas of northern Gaza late Monday, forcing another round of displacements for Palestinians who were able to return to their homes in the devastated north in late January for the first time since the early days of the war. The military described it as a final warning before the areas would come under attack.

Nearly 125,000 people have been displaced in recent days as they fled Israeli bombardment and ground operations, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Monday, before the latest evacuation orders. The United Nations estimates that over the past week, Israel has issued evacuation notices for more than 14 percent of the enclave, along with “vast ‘no go' areas along the border,” spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Monday.

It was past 10 p.m. in Gaza when the evacuation order for Jabalya came in, leaving families with few options other than fleeing on foot, in the dark, in search of relative safety. Two hours before, similar warnings were issued for the areas of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.

“People left under the cover of darkness,” Razan Faisal, a resident of Jabalya who opted to stay behind, said in an interview Tuesday. “We have many elderly people and children, and evacuations involve walking for long hours, which is extremely difficult,” she said, adding that the situation in Jabalya is dire. “There is no aid, and only a few supplies are available in the market at extremely high prices.”

Since March 18, the day Israel broke the fragile truce and resumed bombing Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 792 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday. More than 60 percent of them are women and children, according to the ministry.

JERUSALEM — Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was attacked Monday by a group of Jewish settlers in the West Bank and later arrested by the Israeli army, according to activists and a neighbor who spoke to The Washington Post.

Ballal was released Tuesday after being interrogated by police, according to a statement by activists familiar with his condition. They added that Ballal went to a hospital after being freed.

The Palestinian director was in his home village of Susya, part of the cluster of rural Palestinian communities known as Masafer Yatta, when settlers approached the village and tried to graze their sheep on private Palestinian land just before iftar, the sundown meal at which Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan, according to Nasser Nawajah, who lives in the small village and reports on settler violence for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. He spoke with Ballal's wife, who described the attack.

A video taken by Khamudi Mahmoud, a resident of the village, shows a tall man wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap aggressively approaching Ballal in a rocky clearing as Ballal backs away and a crowd of villagers shout behind him.

Dozens of masked settlers wielding batons, knives and a rifle then attacked property and residents, activists who document settler attacks in the area said in a statement afterward.

“Hamdan tried to retreat, and he brought his kids and wife inside the house and stood at the door to protect them,” Nawajah said. Four settlers began to hit the door of Ballal's house, injuring Ballal's head, according to Nawajah, recounting what Ballal's wife told him.

The settlers fired bullets next to the house and then dragged Ballal away while he was injured, Nawajah said.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted to X that a “violent clash” broke out between Palestinians and Israelis and that it involved “mutual stone-throwing.”

The United Nations said it is making the “difficult decision” to scale back its presence in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. About one-third of the roughly 100 international staff members in Gaza will be temporarily relocated, the agency said in a statement.

“We are not abandoning Gaza,” U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said in a news briefing Tuesday, adding that the decision to reduce international staff numbers was because the U.N. was unable to guarantee the safety of its employees.

On Monday, the United Nations said a strike that hit a U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza, killing a Bulgarian employee and injuring five other international staff members, came from Israeli tankfire — something the Israel Defense Forces has denied. The U.N. has called for an investigation, with spokesman Stéphane Dujarric saying Monday, “The Israelis knew exactly where this U.N. facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.”

Also Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its offices in Rafah was “damaged by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties. Fortunately, no staff were injured in this incident, but this has a direct impact on the ICRC's ability to operate.”

The IDF said in a statement that its forces had “fired at a building after identifying suspects inside and feeling threatened. … Upon review, it was found that the identification was mistaken, and the building belongs to the Red Cross.” It added that the incident would be investigated.

Aid groups have warned about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. The U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Monday that nearly 125,000 people in the enclave have been displaced in recent days as they flee Israeli bombardment,

“This is a human catastrophe,” UNRWA said Monday, emphasizing that Israel's siege and blockade of all aid into Gaza has caused food shortages and sent prices soaring.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram, hours before he was killed, was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called Shabat's “assassination” and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

Top officials in the Trump administration discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application that mistakenly included a journalist, the White House acknowledged Monday, a development that swiftly drew criticism from Democrats and Washington's national security establishment.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the message thread revealed in an extraordinary report by the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, “appears to be authentic,” and that administration officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

The “inadvertent number” belonged to Goldberg, whose article details a robust policy discussion that occurred in the lead-up to a March 15 military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants. Goldberg reported being added to the group chat, which occurred on the encrypted messaging platform Signal, by President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. Other participants appeared to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and several other senior aides, the Atlantic article says.

Hughes, the National Security Council spokesman, characterized the discussion as “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials” executing Trump's national security strategy. But the disclosure immediately raised questions about how the administration has discussed classified national security matters and whether anyone will be disciplined.

Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent days that they will investigate unauthorized leaks to journalists, citing reporting in a number of publications. Several of them also for years criticized the handling of classified information by Democrats in other cases.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

At least four people have been killed in the blazes, which have burned more than 36,000 acres and threaten population centers home to more than 200,000 people.

SEOUL — Wildfires driven by strong winds and dry weather are ravaging southeastern South Korea, killing at least four people and burning more than 36,000 acres, officials said Tuesday.

Five wildfires were 88 percent contained on average as of Tuesday morning local time, according to a government news release. One has been completely contained, and the largest — which has burned more than 31,000 acres near population centers that are home to more than 200,000 people — was 55 percent contained.

Four people — three firefighters and a government official assisting with firefighting efforts — were found dead near the fires, according to South Korea's Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

“Wind speeds will reach 10 to 20 meters per second today afternoon while temperatures will hit [78 degrees Fahrenheit], raising the risk that the wildfires will spread,” Lim Sang-seop, the chief of South Korea's forest service, told reporters Tuesday.

The largest fire was threatening Uiseong, forcing at least 1,550 residents to flee, Lim said. Nearly 50,000 people live in the county. Overnight, the fire had entered the outskirts of the city of Andong — which is home to at least 153,000 people — forcing more than 1,260 people to evacuate, he added.

“The containment rate was 60 percent yesterday, but the fire perimeter grew overnight due to winds, lowering the containment rate to 55 percent,” Lim said.

Almost 80 helicopters and more than 3,100 personnel from the military, the forest service and local fire stations will be deployed Tuesday, he said.

Wildfires are not uncommon in South Korea, especially in the country's eastern areas that are sparsely populated and covered by woodlands. Hundreds of wildfires erupt every year, according to the country's forest service, although most are small and contained.

The country's largest recorded wildfire occurred in the country's east coast in April 2000, when fires burned more than 58,000 acres and caused $32 million worth of damage. In March 2022, fires burned more than 40,000 acres, also on the east coast, and wreaked $750 million of damage.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Follow:


            The medical staff looking after Pope Francis considered stopping his treatment so he could die, according to the lead doctor, after the 88-year-old pontiff was hospitalized with a drawn-out respiratory illness.
    


            Professor Sergio Alfieri told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera the most critical moment came on February 28 when the pope had a breathing crisis and inhaled his own vomit.
    


            “We had to choose whether to stop and let him go or force it and try with all the drugs and therapies possible, running the very high risk of damaging other organs. And in the end, we took this path,” Alfieri said.

High anxiety and whispers of a conclave: How the Vatican is dealing with Pope Francis' hospitalization



            Alfieri, who led the team at Rome's Gemelli hospital, said the decision to continue with treatment was made by Francis' nurse. “The Holy Father always decides. He delegated all kinds of health care choices to Massimiliano Strappetti, his personal health care assistant who knows perfectly well the Pontiff's wishes.”
    


            He reportedly told Alfieri: “Try everything, we won't give up. That's what we all thought too. And no one gave up.”
    


            Francis left the hospital on March 23 after 38 days in hospital, the longest since his election as pope 12 years ago. The pontiff had a number of breathing crises during his time in hospital, with Alfieri previously saying that two of them put the pope's life in danger.
    


            During his stay the Vatican provided an extraordinary level of detail about Francis' condition.
    


            Alfieri said this was the pope's decision and that the Vatican's bulletins were prepared by the medical team with some additions from Francis' personal secretaries.
    


            “From the first day he asked us to tell him the truth and he wanted us to tell the truth about his condition… nothing was ever changed or omitted.”
    


            Francis has returned to his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he will receive treatment including mobility and respiratory-related physiotherapy, especially for voice recovery, and engage in personal prayer, according to the Vatican.



            Doctors also advised the pope to have 24-hour medical assistance, including oxygen therapy, and in case of any emergencies.
    


            The pope will return to work gradually. He has shown determination to recover, resuming some duties and signing documents. Francis has not led the Angelus prayer for the past seven Sundays, but has still offered reflections every week – most recently calling for “peace” in war-torn regions.
    


            “You have continued to pray for me with so much patience and perseverance. Thank you so much. I also pray for you,” he said in a post on X on Sunday. “Let us pray together for peace, especially in martyred Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.”

The grandparents of a French toddler who went missing nearly two years ago have been arrested on suspicion of his murder, prosecutors said Tuesday.

Two-year-old Émile Soleil disappeared from his grandparents' garden in Le Haut-Vernet, a hamlet in the French Alps, in July 2023. Nine months after his disappearance, his remains were discovered by a hiker near the village.

Now the long investigation into the toddler's death has taken a shocking turn with four individuals — including Émile's grandparents and two of their adult children — being taken into police custody.

Emile's grandfather Philippe Vedovini and his wife, who was not named by the prosecutor, were arrested in the commune of La Bouilladisse on suspicion of “voluntary homicide” and “concealing a corpse,” according to a statement by the Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor.

Emile's disappearance gripped the nation as long and widespread searches yielded nothing. His parents were absent on the day he vanished. At the time they told a Christian website they still hoped for a miracle.

The case also sparked media attention, particularly surrounding Émile's grandfather, who, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, was questioned by police in the 1990s over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school. But police had considered his involvement as only one possible explanation behind the boy's tragic death.

Earlier this month, investigators returned to Le Vernet, with forensic teams combing through “several spots in the area.” The prosecutor confirmed that forensic operations are still ongoing in various locations, with new developments expected as the investigation unfolds.

CNN has reached out to the grandparents' lawyer.

Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has been sworn in for a seventh term, and he mocked those who derided him as “Europe's last dictator” by saying his country has more democracy “than those who cast themselves as its models”.

“Half of the world is dreaming about our ‘dictatorship', the dictatorship of real business and interests of our people,” Mr Lukashenko, 70, said in his inauguration speech at the Independence Palace in the capital of Minsk.

Hundreds of opposition supporters living abroad held anti-Lukashenko rallies on Tuesday to mark the anniversary of Belarus' short-lived independence in 1918 following the collapse of the Russian Empire.

Mr Lukashenko marked three decades in power last year, and his political opponents have denounced the tightly orchestrated January 26 election as a farce.

The Belarus Central Election Commission declared he won with nearly 87% of the vote after a campaign in which four token challengers on the ballot all praised his rule.

Opposition members have been imprisoned or exiled abroad by Mr Lukashenko's unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech.

Months of massive protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of nine million people followed the 2020 election and brought on the harsh crackdown.

More than 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and independent media outlets and non-governmental organisations were closed and outlawed, bringing condemnation and sanctions from the West.

Thousands of Lukashenko supporters attended Tuesday's inauguration ceremony, where he denounced his critics as foreign stooges who were at odds with the people.

“You don't and won't have public support, you have no future,” he declared. “We have more democracy than those who cast themselves as its models.”

Belarusian activists say it holds more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Centre.

“The election was held amid a deep human rights crisis, in the atmosphere of total fear caused by repressions against civil society, independent media, opposition and dissent,” according to a statement released Tuesday by Viasna and 10 other Belarusian human rights groups.

They said Mr Lukashenko's hold on power is illegitimate.

Mr Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, relying on subsidies and political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself in office for a quarter of a century, an alliance that helped the Belarusian leader survive the 2020 protests.

Mr Lukashenko allowed Moscow to use the country's territory to invade Ukraine in February 2022 and later hosted some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons.

Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after running against Mr Lukashenko in 2020, vowed to keep fighting for the country's freedom.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, according to Palestinian medics.

The dead include three children and their parents, who were killed in a strike on their tent near the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital.

The hospital has received a flood of dead and wounded since Israel resumed its heavy bombardment of Gaza last week, shattering the ceasefire that had halted the 17-month war.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 113,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.

Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Israel launched the campaign vowing to destroy Hamas after its attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023 in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251.

Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because it operates in densely populated areas.

Meanwhile, one of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land was still missing on Tuesday after reports he was beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by the Israeli military.

Lawyer Lea Tsemel told the Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained.

Mr Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya late Monday, according to Ms Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they are being held at a military base for medical treatment, and she said she has not been able to speak to them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village.

Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Pope Francis' medical team briefly considered suspending treatment, but instead decided on an aggressive course that put his organs at risk, the doctor co-ordinating his hospital care has said.

Dr Sergio Alfieri said the 88-year-old pontiff and people close to him alike understood “that he might not survive the night”, after the bronchospasm attack during which the pope inhaled vomit.

“We needed to choose whether to stop and let him go, or to push it and attempt with all of the possible drugs and the treatments, taking the very high risk of damaging other organs,” Dr Alfieri told told the Milan daily Corriere della Sera.

“In the end, that is the path we chose.”

Francis was released on Sunday after 38 days of treatment for double pneumonia, under doctors' orders to observe two months of convalescence during which he should avoid large gatherings.

The pope appeared weak and frail when he greeted the crowd outside the Gemelli hospital before his discharge.

The Vatican has said it is not clear if the pope will meet with the King on a Vatican state visit next month, or any Holy Week activities leading up to Easter on April 20.

Dr Alfieri said that the pope remained “alert” throughout the February 28 ordeal and that his personal health care assistant, Massimiliano Strappetti, “who knows perfectly the pontiff's wishes”, urged them “to try everything. Don't give up”.

Dr Alfieri acknowledged that the treatment risked damaging the pope's kidneys and bone marrow, “but we continued, and his body responded to the treatments and the lung infection improved”.

The medical bulletin that night said the pope had suffered a bronchiospasm so severe that he inhaled vomit “worsening his respiratory picture”. Doctors used a non-invasive aspiration to clear his airways.

Three days later, in a second life-and-death crisis, the pope suffered a pair of acute bronchiospasms episodes. Doctors used a camera tube with a device to remove mucus plus that yielded abundant secretions.

The bulletin emphasised that the pope “always remained alert, oriented and collaborative”.

Dr Alfieri said he believed that prayers for the pope help keep him alive, something that the doctor said is backed by scientific literature.

“In this case the whole world was praying. I can say that twice the situation was lost, and then it happened like a miracle,” the doctor said, adding that “of course he was a very co-operative patient”.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Brazil's government has apologised to families of victims of the country's military dictatorship whose remains could be among those found in a clandestine mass grave 35 years ago.

Dozens of families are still waiting to know whether their parents, children, siblings and friends are in one of more than 1,000 blue bags discovered in 1990 in a ditch in a Sao Paulo cemetery in the isolated district of Perus.

That was the first of many mass graves uncovered by Brazil's authorities after the end of the 21-year military rule in 1985.

The clandestine grave at the Dom Bosco cemetery also contained the remains of several unidentified people who were not linked to the fight against Brazil's dictatorship.

Monday's official apology is part of a deal between prosecutors, family members and the state.

It took place during Right to Truth Day, which is also celebrated in other countries.

Human rights minister Macae Evaristo said the Brazilian state was neglectful in the identification process of the bags and bones found in Perus.

For almost 25 years, the remains were held by three state universities and laboratories outside Brazil, but only a handful of families finally had their loved ones identified.

Ms Evaristo said Brazil's government has invested about 200,000 Brazilian reais (£26,860) each year for the identification of bags from Perus, but agreed that is not enough to give peace to families of victims.

“What the Brazilian government has been doing is continuing the process of seeking investigation and accountability. We need to remember that our ministry was dismantled,” Ms Evaristo said, in a reference to the 2019-22 presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, an advocate of the country's military dictatorship.

“Families have the right to the truth. Brazilian society has the right to the truth.”

Families uncertain if their loved ones' remains were in the Perus mass grave attended the ceremony.

Gilberto Molina, who represented them, had his brother Flavio's remains finally identified in one of the bags in 2005.

The Brazilian State only recognised it was responsible for the crime in his brother's third death certificate, early in 2019.

“It was a funeral of almost 50 years. For some other families it still is an even longer one,” Mr Molina said. “I hope that every family here still has perseverance in their quest for justice.”

Brazil's truth commission in 2014 reported that at least 434 people were killed and more than 100 disappeared completely during the country's military dictatorship.

The disappearance of former politician Rubens Paiva, portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film I'm Still Here, renewed public interest in the dictatorship's abuses, attracting an audience of more than six million in Brazil.

Nilmario Miranda, a former government minister and long-time human rights activist, said uncovering a mass grave with victims of the dictatorship in 1990 — only a few years after redemocratisation — was a major affair led by then Sao Paulo Mayor Luiza Erundina.

Faced with anonymous death threats, she appointed City Hall officers to oversee the searches.

“It was all under the rug of society, it was all hidden and you couldn't speak about it. That put the deal that ended the dictatorship in check, the one that spared torturers and executioners,” Ms Miranda said, in a reference to Brazil's 1979 amnesty law that did not punish crimes of the military during the regime.

That law could soon be partially reversed by Brazil's Supreme Court in cases of people who were killed then by state agents and had their remains vanished.

Antonio Pires Eustaquio, who became a manager at the Don Bosco cemetery in 1976 and helped families in their quest for justice for decades, celebrated the apology.

“This can only happen in a democracy. Dictators don't apologise for their mistakes,” Mr Eustaquio said.

“I remember that at that time people always wondered whether I was going to be killed for I knew where the illegal ditch was. My being here means democracy won.”

But Crimeia Almeida, whose husband, her father-in-law and a brother-in-law went missing as guerrilla men about 50 years ago, said the state's apology is not enough.

“The apology is not enough. It is nice, we get emotional, but it doesn't solve the criminal act,” she said.

President Donald Trump has downplayed revelations of a US security breach.

It comes after it was reported that top national security officials for President Trump, including his defence secretary, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic”.

Mr Trump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, more than two hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.

The material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing”, editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.

It was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security.

The US has conducted air strikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.

Just two hours after Mr Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the US began launching a series of air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

The National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat.

In addition to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, it included vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Mr Trump's director of national intelligence.

Mr Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Mr Trump's national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.

Mr Hegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Mr Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Mr Trump from the publication.

He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Mr Goldberg ended up on the message chain.

“Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,” Mr Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defence secretary.

Mr Trump on Tuesday in a brief interview with NBC News' Garrett Haake downplayed the incident as “the only glitch in two months” of his administration “and it turned out not to be a serious one”.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday said in post on X that no war plans were discussed and that no classified material was sent to the thread”.

Ms Leavitt said on Monday the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Mr Waltz and the national security team. Mr Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Mr Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man”.

Earlier on Monday, Mr Trump told reporters: “I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine”.

Government officials have used Signal for organisational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting.

Ms Leavitt said the White House counsel's office has provided guidance to Mr Trump's top officials on a number platforms to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.

The sharing of sensitive information comes as Mr Hegseth's office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defence personnel to determine how reporters have received information.

Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Mr Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defence secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.

The administration's handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic politicians. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.

“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Mr Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a speech on Monday afternoon.

“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.

He said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Mr Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the administration immediately”.

Some Republicans also expressed concerns.

Senator Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters: “We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top United Nations official in the world's youngest nation warned on Monday.

Calling the situation unfolding in the country “dire,” Nicolas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if president Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage “and put the interests of their people ahead of their own”.

There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict.

But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Mr Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Mr Machar, an ethnic Nuer.

More than 40,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Mr Kiir and Mr Machar together in a government of national unity.

Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 — and again until 2026.

The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Mr Machar.

Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire.

Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Mr Machar's home in the capital Juba and arresting several of his key allies.

Mr Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating “particularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players”.

He said Mr Kiir and Mr Machar do not trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move toward a future with a stable and democratic South Sudan.

“Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,” Mr Haysom said.

“Given this grim situation,” he said, “we are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war”.

Mr Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.

He said the UN takes the threat of the “ethnic transformation” of the conflict very seriously.

To try to prevent a new civil war, the UN special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.

He said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Mr Kiir and Mr Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions “through dialogue rather than military confrontation”.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail for legal purposes — not for communicating with anyone — as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive.

In a court filing made public late on Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he have a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson.

Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal site where Mangione is being held.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.

Defence lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there is “no connection to Mr Mangione for any of said alleged threats.”

Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference.

Mr Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.

Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges.

He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He has not entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Mr Thompson's death.

Mr Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.

The case also channelled some Americans' frustrations with health insurance companies.

Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.

Some people have lionised the accused killer, donated money to his defence and even flocked to his court appearances.

Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.

Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.

If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing.

But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.

Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there are not enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defence.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

French actor Gerard Depardieu has acknowledged that he used crude and heated language around a woman who accuses him of sexual assault and grabbed her hips but denied assaulting her, as he gave evidence for the first time at his trial in Paris.

She told the court that he had behaved “like a madman” who took “pleasure in frightening me”.

The second day of the Paris trial centred on the Oscar-nominated actor's behaviour during the filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.

The 76-year-old has denied assaulting the women.

But during more than an hour of evidence on Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualised language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.

Depardieu said he had been in a “bad mood” because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.

“I understand perfectly if she's a bit upset,” he said. “I don't have to talk like that, get angry like that, voila.”

But he insisted that he is not a sexual predator.

“I'm not touching the butts of women,” Depardieu said.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (£62,000) if convicted. The verdict is not expected immediately after the trial.

The set dresser gave evidence after Depardieu. She described the alleged assault in detail.

She said he grabbed her hips then started “palpating” her behind and “in front, around”. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.

“That's when I had a reflex of ‘My God'. I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn't do it,” she said. “He terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.”

“It was very brief, there was no shouting,” she said, adding that she had been too “petrified” to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu's hands from her.

“I saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that's what I felt, it's savagery,” she said. “He terrified me, and that amused him.”

She said Depardieu's calm and co-operative attitude in court bore no resemblance to his behaviour at work.

“Here, he's exemplary, he doesn't move, he's quiet, he doesn't make any noise,” she said. “He's not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.”

On the film set “he started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities”, she told the court.

The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.

In his evidence, Depardieu said he had noticed that the set dresser had been taken aback by his behaviour and language. He acknowledged that his behaviour can be boorish.

“I've always been told I have a Russian nature, I don't know if it's because of the drinking or the vulgarity,” he said. “I have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.”

French star actor Gerard Depardieu, on trial for sexual assault, told the Paris court Tuesday that he was not in the habit of ""groping"" women, and called the #MeToo movement a ""reign of terror.""He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement, which he told the court Tuesday ""will become a reign of terror"".

Gerard Depardieu is more than just a household name in France.

Two women have accused the French actor of assault on the set of 'The Green Shutters' in 2021.

Actor Gérard Depardieu arrived in a Paris court on Monday for his trial over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, a case placing one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence.

Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream analyzes the legal pushback to the Trump administration's deportation of illegal migrants on ‘America Reports.'

The Justice Department said this week that it has invoked the state secrets privilege in its ongoing court battle over the deportation of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, a national security tool that allows the government to withhold certain information from the courts for national security purposes. 

In the 10-page court filing submitted to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior Trump administration officials said they chose to invoke the privilege because disclosure would pose what they described as a ""reasonable danger"" to national security and foreign affairs. 

""The Court has all of the facts it needs to address the compliance issues before it,"" the Justice Department officials said, adding: ""Further intrusions on the Executive Branch would present dangerous and wholly unwarranted separation-of-powers harms with respect to diplomatic and national security concerns that the Court lacks competence to address.""

The news comes as Boasbeg has repeatedly pressed government lawyers for more information about its deportation flights last weekend, which sent around 261 migrants, including Venezuelan nationals and members of the gang Tren de Aragua, from the U.S. to El Salvador.

The flights left U.S. soil around the time Boasberg agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, or the little-used wartime immigration law passed by Congress in 1798, to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals.

Hours later, however, planes carrying hundreds of migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed on the basis of the law in question, arrived in El Salvador.

In the days that followed, Boasberg ordered both parties back to court to testify over the removals, and whether the Trump administration knowingly defied his court order.

The Justice Department had largely refused to comply with his requests for information – which included questions on how many individuals it deported ""solely on the basis"" of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation, where the planes landed, what time each plane took off from the U.S., and from where – citing national security protections.

Boasberg previously warned the Trump administration of consequences last week if it were to continue to violate his order, noting that their options were to either file information under seal or invoke the state secrets privilege.

Should the Trump administration invoke the state secrets privilege, Boasberg noted at the time, the court ""is obligated to ‘determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege.'""

This was disputed in the filing by Bondi and other senior Justice Department personnel, however, who said in the filing Monday night, ""No more information is needed to resolve any legal issue in this case.""

The legal back and forth comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly stressed that a federal judge, in their view, does not have the ability to rule on national security matters or immigration issues – putting Boasberg, and his ruling, directly in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

The Justice Department also appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C., which heard the case yesterday. The three-judge panel declined to immediately rule on the matter, though a decision is expected sometime this week.

President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, is facing a Senate hearing on Tuesday morning about his qualifications to run the massive retirement system, as well as his plans for the agency at a time when it has been targeted for significant job cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. 

The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.

Here's what to know about the hearing. 

The Senate hearing will be streamed at 10:10 a.m. ET at the Senate Finance Committee's website, which can be found here.

Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020. 

Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.

In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits. 

""The objective isn't to touch benefits,"" Bisignano told CNBC. ""The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,"" adding that he views himself as ""fundamentally a DOGE person.""

The executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to find fraud, waste or abuse within the system. 

Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner. 

The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.

The Big Four giants—EY PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG—have all launched legal arms to compete against the traditional legal sector, but recent cracks show that their vision is not playing out.

The Legal Services Act 2007 introduced Alternative Business Structure (ABS) licenses, which allowed the Big Four to compete in the UK legal market.

It wasn't the firms' first time in the market, having had legal practices since the 1990s, but the ABS saw the Big Four aggressively reshape their legal businesses.

PwC was the first Big Four to launch a dedicated legal services arm, PwC Legal, in 2014, followed shortly by EY and KPMG.

Deloitte completed the group with the launch of Deloitte Legal in 2018.

The push into the legal market was starting to look positive. In 2023, data by Saïd Business School revealed the Big Four generated $1.5bn (£1.25bn) in revenues from their legal segments.

The figures increased from $900m in 2015 to $1.2bn in 2017.

However, the cracks have started to show.

Last week, news broke that EY was making more cuts, this time for around 30 staff in its legal department, EY Law.

In a statement EY said: “These proposals would continue to strengthen EY's existing legal capabilities in corporate law, company secretarial, tax litigation and immigration but would, regrettably, result in a reduction of roles across other areas of the UK Law business.”

This isn't the first time EY has taken the shears to its legal arm. In December 2023, news broke it was shutting EY Riverview Law, the Manchester-based legal services business it acquired in 2018.

On top of that its headcount has fallen to around 160 after a series of high-profile departures, including nearly a dozen lawyers leaving for the City office of Hunton Andrews Kurth in December.

According to Scott Gibson, director of Edwards Gibson: “If we exclude Deloitte's ill-fated lock-stock and barrel acquisition of 27-partner TMT boutique Kemp Little in 2021, between 2019 and 2024, the Big Four's legal divisions combined hired 35 partners in London.”

“Against this, the quartet lost 40 serving partners (including two-thirds of the laterals who joined during that time) to rival law firms,” he added.

So, why are the Big Four not storming the legal market?

Christopher Clark, director at Definitum Search, says: “One challenge lies in the conflicts with the audit businesses, preventing a large number of legal instructions from getting off the ground.”

The Big Four's bread and butter is their accountancy departments, which are tightly regulated by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

Plainly put, if the firm is auditing a business's financials, the rest of its business can't touch any work for that client.

Another issue is the structure of the Big Four firms. Nick Woolf, partner at Woolf&Co, highlighted that “however big their legal practice, they are always going to pale into insignificance compared to other parts of the firm.”

He noted the culture this creates explaining lawyers “who take pride in their own book of business, winning work themselves and seeing their own name in lights, are likely to be very disappointed by seeing none of these traits rewarded or even applauded in a Big Four firm.”

Woolf added that the Big Four had recruited the wrong partners for their needs.

Out of the Big Four, it seems KPMG is keeping its head above the water.

Gibson noted that the firm hired eight partners for KPMG Law UK in London versus just one for the rest of the Big Four.

“In 2024, whilst KPMG only managed to hire one partner in London, this was still 100 per cent more than the rest of the quartet combined,” he noted.

Speaking to City AM last July, the head of KPMG Law UK, Stuart Bedford, explained that the firm is not looking to challenge traditional Big Law on the likes of big corporate M&A deals. However, as he points out, there is a Venn diagram that overlaps with these firms and those deals.

“What we do is slightly different and tends to be the sorts of projects that actually those firms don't really focus on,” he added. 

This comes after KPMG revealed last month it launched KPMG Law US, the first law firm owned by a Big Four firm serving the US market.

A spokesperson for KPMG told City AM: “Whilst there is a lot of market uncertainty, we continue to grow and there are opportunities to help clients to not only remain compliant but optimise their businesses in a rapidly changing regulatory environment all while finding cost-effective ways of meeting their regulatory needs.”

An overview of the Big Four market, Gibson noted that firms “were able to sell themselves to lawyers with their ready made global networks, blue-chip client base, legendary organisational abilities, and gargantuan turnover.”

“In their numerous set-piece growth plans, the Big Four have themselves often conflated the volume of partner hiring from other law firms with success.”

He stated, “on that basis, with the possible exception of KPMG, the Big Four are failing.”

“If this was not already clear enough, unfortunately, EY's latest retreat from Big Law in the UK is likely to make it even harder for the rest of the quartet to attract and retain quality lawyers – let alone rainmaker partners,” Gibson added.

A spokesperson for Deloitte Legal told City AM: “Deloitte Legal's approach is blending legal expertise with our ability to deliver scale and leverage technology, alongside the broader range of Deloitte capabilities.”

“Our focus is on business solutions to the chief legal officer and becoming their business partner – a strategy that continues to resonate strongly with our clients and also with our people,” they added. 

This comes as the Big Four firms have a profitability problem.

After two years of redundancies after redundancies, recent news showed the situation has escalated to the senior partnership. City AM has a long read on what is next for the Big Four.

Oops, something went wrong

Investors are betting on new Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan to turn around the troubled chipmaker.

While it's unclear whether Intel's financial problems can be fixed quickly, Wall Street analysts — and current and former employees — generally agree on what steps Tan needs to take, short of a breakup. Those steps include everything from cutting jobs to turbocharging Intel's young foundry business.

A semiconductor industry veteran, Tan was appointed to his new role on March 12. Investors applauded the news: Intel stock rose more than 15% the next day. Analysts liked Tan's experience as former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a semiconductor design software company, and his experience on boards of some 14 semiconductor companies, including Intel.

Now the hard part.

Tan is inheriting a company whose financial losses have made it a takeover target in recent months. Many Wall Street analysts and investors believe Intel — which is the only American leading-edge chip manufacturer — would be better off splitting up and selling its struggling manufacturing business. Case in point: The stock has risen on various reports in recent months of potential deals, some of which were allegedly being worked on with the support of the Trump administration.

Reuters reported last week that Tan plans to keep Intel's manufacturing business running for now and is looking to bolster Intel's faltering AI chip efforts to catch up to Nvidia (NVDA). He said as much in a letter to employees on March 12: ""Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before.""

Read more about Intel's stock moves and today's market action.

Yahoo Finance interviewed four Wall Street analysts and nine current and former Intel employees — including high-level executives. The employees were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance.

And Intel's product business, which designs the chips, can't outsource to rival manufacturers so easily — Intel semiconductors are specifically made in accordance with its own internal manufacturing processes. Not to mention, Intel's billions in CHIPS Act funding requires it to retain majority ownership of its foundry.

Intel declined to make Lip-Bu Tan available for an interview but told Yahoo Finance: ""Lip-Bu is spending a lot of time listening to customers and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success.""

Here's what company sources and Wall Street analysts said he has to do to to avoid a break up.

Intel is one of the few remaining chipmakers that both designs and makes its own chips.

On the design side, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as AMD (AMD) and, of course, Nvidia in an increasingly AI-dominated industry. On the manufacturing side, Intel has repeatedly faced delays.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger attempted to grow Intel's revenue by opening its in-house manufacturing business — a ""foundry"" — to outside customers on a large scale. Foundries such as Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) produce chips for other companies. Intel historically produced chips for its internal product business before Gelsinger launched Intel Foundry Services (IFS) in 2021.

The foundry strategy had mixed results. Intel is set to achieve a big feat by launching a new advanced chip manufacturing process called 18A this year, and IFS has deals with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). But analysts debate whether Intel can sustain the foundry, which lost $13.4 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue in 2024.

Bottom line: Intel needs to attract more big outside customers. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success.

In order for Intel's manufacturing business to survive, the company must succeed in launching 18A. While Intel manufacturing employees had previously suggested that the new technology was having trouble, those same employees said this week that 18A is progressing — and Intel manufacturing staff is feeling ""positive"" about its success.

As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said: ""[I]f the results are good and companies are happy, they'll increase their capacity at"" the foundry.

Per Reuters, Tan is looking to boost Intel's AI chip efforts to rival Nvidia and others.

Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, Intel scrapped a multiyear project, Larrabee, to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD's graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU, which ultimately failed. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores.

""Intel has a very good finance organization, but the company does sometimes make these decisions that are overly led by the early years' financial outcome,"" said a former high-level executive. ""You only learn from deploying. If you intend to be in that market long term, you might as well have access to the market, even if it costs you through the first generation.""

Former and current Intel employees describe the company, whose staffers refer to themselves as ""Team Blue,"" as slow and bureaucratic. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management.

It's a tough balancing act. The two current employees said any layoffs could depress morale and risk slowing the progress of 18A. Tan already has said Intel has ""hard decisions"" ahead. One of the employees said their colleagues are bracing for a potentially ""huge amount” of layoffs in the second or third quarter.

They said their teams are already understaffed, and cuts to middle management would result in those teams being moved around, creating chaos.

One of the high-level former executives said, ""The depth of talent at Intel is immense, and the loyalty that people have is astounding,"" later adding, ""The answer lies in inspiring the people you have.""

Oops, something went wrong

Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler said Tuesday that she is in favor of holding interest rates steady for ""some time"" as some economic data shows signs of softness and progress on inflation slows.

The Fed's rate-setting committee ""can react to new developments by holding at the current rate for some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new policies,” she said in a speech in Washington, D.C., citing a ""heightened level of uncertainty.""

The central bank last Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5% for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Kugler is particularly watching inflation amid an increase in consumer expectations for inflation in the short term because of Trump's tariffs.

""I am paying close attention to the acceleration of price increases and higher inflation expectations, especially given the recent bout of inflation in the past few years,"" Kugler said.

Kugler highlighted that prices of goods have started rising again after falling over the past year, which she says is ""unhelpful"" because it helped keep a lid on overall inflation and also impacts inflation expectations.

Fed officials will get a new reading on inflation during the month of February this Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge.

Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in February, up from the 2.6% seen in January. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.3%, unchanged from January.

Kugler said the PCE shows ""welcome progress"" from a peak of more than 7% in June 2022, but ""that progress has slowed since last summer.""

Kugler also noted that some economic data has shown weakness, pointing to recent retail sales, and that the pace of hiring during the first two months of the year has slowed compared with the strong gains in November and December, but she said that could reflect weather disruptions and seasonal adjustment challenges.

Overall, though, the economy's ""solid position"" allows the Fed to be patient for now as it weighs uncertainties stemming from Trump's economic policies.

Trump on Monday said he would like to see the Fed lower rates because inflation is coming down.

""I'd like to see the Fed lower interest rates,"" he said Monday during a Cabinet meeting, where he stressed that grocery and energy prices are coming down.

""That's just my opinion, because things are coming down. We have inflation under control. Tremendous amounts of money will be soon coming in from tariffs.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the same Cabinet meeting Monday also promised inflation would be contained, stressing that the administration is reducing ""excess employment in the government sector ... so everyone laid off from the government will have an opportunity to go into the private sector.""

That, Bessent added, ""is going to lead to disinflation"" and get inflation ""under control.""

Oops, something went wrong

Boeing (BA) wants President Trump to let it out of a guilty criminal plea agreement the jet maker reached with the Biden administration, according to a report.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Boeing is pushing Trump's new Justice Department officials to allow it to withdraw that 2024 plea, in which it admitted that its workers conspired to defraud aviation regulators.

Boeing did not comment on the Wall Street Journal report.

Avoiding a criminal conviction would be a major victory for the company that could allow it to avoid compounded headwinds as it tries to show progress on several fronts more than one year after a door plug blew off a Boeing-made Alaska Airlines (ALK) 737 Max 9 jet.

Criminal convictions can foreclose or suspend a company's right to contract with the federal government and frustrate its ability to secure loans, according to Eddie Jauregui, a white-collar defense attorney with Holland & Knight and former federal prosecutor.

Read more about Boeing's stock moves and today's market action.

Those consequences have particular meaning for Boeing, which counts the federal government as its largest customer and also happens to be the country's largest exporter. Just last week, Boeing won a major contract to build a new F-47 jet fighter for the Pentagon.

Admitting guilt was meant to insulate Boeing from facing a criminal trial on the government's allegation that the jet maker misled Federal Aviation Administration officials before two fatal 737 Max 8 crashes killed 346 people in the past decade.

Those allegations initially produced a deferred prosecution agreement reached in 2021, but last year the DOJ notified Boeing that it had breached the agreement after a door plug blew off a Boeing-made 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines.

After Boeing and Biden's DOJ officials reached the guilty plea deal last year, they submitted it to a federal judge.

But that US judge for the Northern District of Texas, Reed O'Connor, decided late last year in an order that the deal was insufficient, in part because of its terms governing the selection and conditions for a corporate monitor tasked with protecting against future fraud.

O'Connor cited provisions in the agreement that included race as a condition in selecting a corporate monitor as ""inappropriate"" and ""against the public interest.""

The judge said the crash victims' families opposed race as a consideration in the selection of the corporate monitor, as well as a section that omitted Boeing's compliance with the monitor's anti-fraud recommendations as a condition of its probation.

Families who lost loved ones in the crashes also objected to the deal and called it a ""sweetheart"" scenario for Boeing. In their objection filed in the Texas court, they said the DOJ made concessions to Boeing that it would not extend to any other criminal defendant.

O'Connor, a former President George W. Bush appointee, has a track record of siding with conservative litigants against the government, according to reporting from Reuters.

Before Trump took office, Boeing and the Justice Department told the judge they were still working ""in good faith"" on amending the plea deal.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the two sides are still negotiating changes to the deal and that the proposal is expected to be submitted to the judge by April 11.

There was another legal development this week involving Boeing. A federal judge in Illinois ruled on Monday in a separate case that former Boeing CEOs Dennis Muilenberg and Dave Calhoun, as well as Boeing suppliers, could not be held liable for negligence claims brought by families of victims killed in the 2019 Max crash.

The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked evidence that the executives knowingly participated in misconduct.

Oops, something went wrong

Former Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger spent a good chunk of 2023 and 2024 not only trying to transform the semiconductor icon but also seeking to get his fair share of the CHIPS and Science Act funding from the Biden administration.

Gelsinger — who has spent more than 45 years in the tech industry, mostly in semiconductor development at Intel — talked up the need for the law's funding for domestic chip manufacturing in TV interviews (including with this journalist). He also had photo ops with former President Joe Biden at Intel chip plant construction sites and seemed as excited about what the funding meant to Intel's future and the industry as discussing the outlook of artificial intelligence.

In effect, Gelsinger was the face of the CHIPS Act.

Though Gelsinger, who parted ways with Intel in December, is no longer CEO, and President Trump has criticized the CHIPS Act, Gelsinger still views the funding the same way.

""You'll raise the national consciousness of chips,"" Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance on a video call late Monday in one of his first interviews since leaving Intel.

Read more about Intel's stock moves and today's market action.

Listen: What Bill Gates thinks about Intel

Gelsinger announced Monday he will become executive chair and head of technology at Gloo, where he has been an investor and chair for over 10 years. Gloo is a technology platform that supports 450,000 churches, faith networks, service providers, and nonprofits, and it aligns with the values of the deeply religious Gelsinger.

Gelsinger added on the CHIPS Act: ""Supply chains move because they're advantaged. So in that sense, I see chips [making], plus some of the economic inducements, as being a formula that I fully agree with looking forward. But we can't go backward on what we put in place for the CHIPS Act. We need to continue to restore manufacturing. We need long-term research and development.""

The Biden administration's CHIPS Act was signed into law in 2022, introducing major government subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. The law was meant to shore up critical chip supply chains and reduce reliance on industry heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).

The law included $39 billion in subsidies for US chipmaking along with $13.2 billion for semiconductor R&D. Intel received a $7.86 billion grant from the CHIPS Act.

The funds were supposed to support new advanced packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon. However, Intel said in February that its promised $28 billion chip fabrication plants in Ohio would be delayed in opening until 2030 and 2031. This marks a more than five-year delay in the opening timeline as Intel struggles to stabilize its business.

""The CHIPS Act was designed to, I'll say, close the gaps that had emerged with Asia,"" Gelsinger said.

Despite the need to diversify the US chip supply chain, the CHIPS Act has become a punching bag for President Trump as of late.

During his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Trump said the CHIPS Act was a ""horrible, horrible thing."" He told House Speaker Mike Johnson to ""get rid"" of the legislation and earmark the remaining cash to reduce debt or ""any other reason you want to.""

Interestingly, Trump touted Taiwan Semiconductor's plans to spend $165 billion to build new chip facilities in Arizona. But $6.6 billion of the funding for the project will come in the form of grants via the CHIPS Act, as Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley pointed out.

Trump has since called the CHIPS Act a ""disaster.""

""I think it has been a massive distraction,"" Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). ""The semiconductor industry did not really need it. I think ... there could have been other ways.""

Arya acknowledged, however, that the CHIPS Act has created good-paying manufacturing jobs in the country.

The face of the CHIPS Act probably agrees.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

""Liberation Day"" came early. Wall Street hinted at the start of a comeback in the hopes that President Trump's next round of April 2 tariffs will be narrower than many had feared. Investors are scrambling back into Big Tech, and for good reason. The recovery doesn't have to wait for the tariff deadline. The inklings of them not happening is enough.

The swift tumble of the Magnificent Seven and the not-so-magnificent puns that followed bolstered the case for the end of the AI trade. The shock of DeepSeek's success and the frustration over ballooning investment costs without clear returns was the kindling for Big Tech's unraveling. Talk of a new high-tariff era was the spark. But a change of heart speaks to the allure of seeing any setback as a buying opportunity. And it gets at the staying power of trillion-dollar enterprises.

When the market was down, with steep tariffs as the backdrop, the AI trade was unwinding. Under a more limited set of duties, however, beaten-down stock prices now look like excuses to buy back in. If you can wait out the trough, why not buy AI stocks on sale?

But after so much uncertainty, any clarity — for tech, for the market, for businesses, and for consumers — will come with a big asterisk.

It helps that the perceptions of a gentler tariff regime are coming directly from the White House. Trump administration officials have tried to spread the message that the market may be overreacting to the scope of the reciprocal tariffs. Several reports in recent days signaled that the levies will be more targeted than the president has let on, focusing instead on specific countries, about 15% of nations, with persistent trade imbalances with the US.

The market rejoiced at this semblance of clarity — but there's a “for now” coming. After four weeks of losses, coinciding with Wall Street's response to Trump's global trade remake, it's hard to tell if this is the start of a revival or just the latest gyration in an erratic narrative of threats, walk-backs, anticlimaxes, and muddled deals.

Is the clever move to follow the White House's cues to get ahead of the deadline? Or to wait and see how the cement dries? This is a market that has been burned before.

""Investors shouldn't be overly optimistic yet,"" said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. ""V-shaped recoveries are rare, and sustained stabilization typically requires a period of sideways movement before confidence can fully return.""

But for the tech optimists out there, the peeling back of trade uncertainty leaves the fundamental case for the tech giants intact: a wide moat around the business, an array of recurring revenue streams, and a perception of irreplaceability.

In one sense, the ticking time bomb of tariffs will come as a relief. The next phase of the tech trade follows reset expectations with more modest valuations, alongside revenue growth and a reinvigorated sense of urgency around AI innovation and supremacy.

Investors for the past month were confronted with new reasons to sell. When peak tariff uncertainty subsides, it should become more clear why they bought in the first place.

Oops, something went wrong

The US economy has undergone a narrative shift over the past month.

After two years of outperforming expectations, it now appears the economy is growing slower than many on Wall Street thought it would to start 2025. But while the economy is cooling, it isn't collapsing.

""Growth looks like it's maybe moderating a bit, consumer spending moderating a bit, but still at a solid pace,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during his most recent press conference on March 19.

Powell's description of an economy that ""seems to be healthy"" came after the Fed lowered its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projection for 2025 to 1.7% in its latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) last week. This marked a move lower from the 2.1% growth the Fed had projected back in December.

Economic forecasters across Wall Street have made similar revisions to their full-year GDP projections based on expectations that President Trump's tariff policies will weigh on business activity. JPMorgan now sees US economic growth of 1.6% this year, down from a prior forecast of 1.9%. Morgan Stanley is now at 1.5%, down from 1.9%, while Goldman Sachs projects growth of 1.7%, down from 2.4%.

Notably, none of these revisions have been calls for an outright economic downturn or some sort of rapid slowing in economic growth. For instance, in March, Goldman Sachs moved up its probability for a recession in the next 12 months to 20% from a prior projection of 15%. Given the chances of a recession in the next 12 months typically stand at about 15% at any given point in history, Goldman's move to 20% isn't exactly arguing that's the most likely outcome.

""If you go back two months, people were saying that the likelihood of a recession was extremely low,"" Powell said. ""So, [it] has moved up, but it's not high.""

Powell's assessment of the US economic picture falls in line with what many forecasters have been saying, but it is more optimistic than other data points. Popular betting market Kalshi is now pricing in a 40% chance of recession in the next year, about double the chances that were projected in mid-February. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool recently made headlines, as it's currently forecasting a nearly 2% decline in GDP for the first quarter. And several measures of consumer sentiment have tumbled in the past month as policy uncertainty has made consumers more wary about the economic outlook.

But most of those are indicative of vibes right now as fears of tariffs and federal layoffs make headlines. They don't reflect the reality of the economy's position.

It's happened before: In 2022, consumer sentiment and confidence measures — both considered ""soft"" survey data — plunged in a similar fashion. Back then, consumers kept spending, keeping the ""hard data,"" like the monthly retail sales report, afloat.

In a research note to clients on Sunday, Morgan Stanley's chief global economist wrote that ""all the cries about recession"" are ""probably"" overdone. He pointed to January's decline in retail sales spooking investors, only to then be reversed by a gain in February. 

The same could be said for S&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. On Monday, the index reading came in at 53.5 for March, a rebound from the 51.6 seen in February and above economists' expectations of 50.9.

S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist Chris Williamson wrote in a release Monday morning that his firm's data shows the US economy likely grew at a 1.5% annualized pace during the first quarter of 2025. As Williamson highlighted, this points ""to a slowing of GDP growth"" compared to the 2.3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Again, this reflects weaker growth but not a catastrophic slowdown. In terms of impacts to the stock market, research from RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina shows that when GDP for the year is between 0.1% and 2%, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) struggles. Notably though, as the chart below shows, stocks do far worse when GDP is between 0.1% and 1%.

The key investor question right now is whether economic growth forecasts have come down far enough — or if they will keep moving lower and further weigh on stocks. For now, Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan tells Yahoo Finance that the current signs of slowing aren't abnormal.

For instance, consumer spending fell in January for the first time in nearly two years. But the loss came after several strong months of above-trend spending to end 2024. After growing at an ""unsustainable pace"" to end last year, Ryan said his team had already expected that metric to cool to start 2025.

""The question is, do we get more than that?"" Ryan said. ""And at this point, you know, we're not there, given the labor market [is] still OK, and labor income growth is still enough to support consumption.""

Ryan pointed out that if labor market dynamics changed and the US economy started posting monthly job losses or the unemployment rate shot higher, then the outlook for consumer spending would also likely deteriorate.

But for now, metrics Ryan looks at — like the rolling average of workers continuing to apply for unemployment benefits — are ""nowhere near what I would consider sending a recessionary signal.""

Oops, something went wrong

Job-hopping has lost its luster.

The median pay increase for workers switching jobs sank substantially to 4.8% last month from a pinnacle of 7.7% two years ago, according to recently released data from the Atlanta Fed.

While job changers tend to receive higher pay increases than job stayers, the gap between job stayers and those who switch roles has fizzled and is now at its lowest level in a decade. A worker who stayed put and received an annual raise saw nearly the same bump in pay — 4.6%, the Atlanta Fed found.

“The pendulum is swinging back from the pandemic premium for new hires,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at employment search site ZipRecruiter, told Yahoo Finance.

“The gap between wage growth for job switchers and job stayers ballooned to the widest gap on record during the Great Resignation,” she said. “Companies rushed to rehire after the pandemic, and the No. 1 focus was on hiring incentives — signing bonuses and raising starting pay.”

The problem is that many companies felt burned by offering huge salaries and bonuses to people who stayed only a short while and then left for better opportunities.

Now the focus is on longer-term retention incentives such as retirement and health insurance benefits that make workers want to stay, Pollak said.

Federal job cuts and layoffs by large companies are contributing to a chilly job market overall, flashing the warning signs that the golden era for job seekers has ground to a halt. A recent Harris Poll found that 7 in 10 Americans think it's difficult to find a better position than the one they have now — and three-quarters say employers hold the power in the market.

“Hiring is so weak and unemployment durations are growing,” Pollak said. “Employers are opportunistically able to pick up great talents on the cheap.”

Talk about glum. A record-low 13% of job seekers described their search as going well, per the findings in a new ZipRecruiter report. Gloomier still — more than 6 in 10 job seekers reported zero job offers, the highest level in three years.

In 2022, wage growth contributed to people quitting their jobs for higher-paying options, Allison Shrivastava, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Yahoo Finance.

“At that time, finding a new job was easy for most, and companies had to compete to hire workers. Now, that competition has greatly decreased,” she said. “This shift … has made leaving their current job for a new one less attractive.”

The data backs that up. Workers are staying in their current jobs, as seen with the low quits rate tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics — 2.1% or 3 million people quit in January.

“The labor market is on ice,” Shrivastava said.

Another more recent cause of that cooling is the result of mixed messages about where things are going.

“Confusion and uncertainty (are) causing workers and companies to hold onto jobs and workers, while at the same time holding off on expanding their labor force,” she said. “This freezing can only last so long until the market gets frostbite, leading to an increase in layoffs or a further slowdown in hiring or quitting.”

On a brighter note: It could also be that some people were able to find roles that were a better fit for them in 2022 when job switching was commonplace, and they are happy where they are, Shrivastava said. “Either way, it's clear that people are going to be staying in their current jobs for longer.”

One caveat that can impact those lower starting salary figures: When people change fields, they tend to take a pay cut initially. And plenty of folks have been doing just that.

During the pandemic many workers had time to do some soul-searching about what they really wanted to do, and the number of those transitioning to new careers has risen.

“Only about 30% of job seekers say they want to switch industries, but more than 50% of recently hired workers got their jobs in a new industry,” Pollak told me.“That suggests that workers who keep an open mind, expand their search, invest in new skills, and follow opportunity are disproportionately successful.”

Whether you're a career switcher or simply a job shifter, it's not always about the money.

“Many job jumpers leave not just for money,” Jayne Mattson, a career coach, told me. “They leave companies because they aren't getting any professional development or growth, or they found employment during COVID and it is not the right role and they want to find a better fit.”

Mattson's advice for job seekers: Before you start your search, think of what you want in your next role and what it looks like.

“When people are leaving their job, I always ask, ‘What do you hope to get in your next role that you are not getting now?' If they're not clear of what they want to do, what their values and interests are, how will they know if they get an offer that is the right one?”

	Humans undergoing similar radiation for cancer treatment often suffer painful side effects

A protein unique to tardigrades (one shown here under a microscope) can help reduce DNA damage caused by radiation in mice.

1 hour ago

A protein found in tardigrades — tiny animals less than a millimeter long — can protect mice from radiation damage.

Most cancer patients undergo radiation therapy as part of their treatment, often leading to devastatingly painful side effects. But there may be hope for mitigating some of that damage. Mice with cells engineered to produce a protective protein unique to tardigrades experienced reduced radiation damage, researchers report February 26 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

Radiation attacks the DNA of tumor cells, preventing tumor growth and eventually killing it. But it also damages the DNA of healthy tissue near the tumors, destroying those cells, too. People undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer can develop damaged throats or mouths, making eating and drinking extremely painful. Prostate cancer patients may experience rectal bleeding.

“I treat cancer patients with radiation, and I see a lot of side effects from treatment itself — side effects that can be really debilitating and severe,” says James Byrne, a radiation oncologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

These unintended consequences can lead people to stop treatment before their tumors are under control. While at MIT, Byrne and biomedical researcher Giovanni Traverso had “started to explore possibilities of creating radiation protection,” Byrne says, when they realized they could use a little help from tardigrades. 

Tardigrades may be as tiny as dust mites, but they are tough little creatures — even capable of tolerating extreme conditions like outer space. Nicknamed “water bears,” they can survive radiation doses about 1,000 times the lethal dose to humans.

Tardigrades produce a key damage-suppressor protein known as Dsup, which binds to their DNA to protect them from radiation. Byrne and Traverso wanted to somehow arm mice with this protein so they would be better equipped to deal with radiation.

The duo and their colleagues used lipid nanoparticles — tiny particles composed of fat molecules that can carry chemicals — to deliver messenger RNA, or mRNA, with instructions for creating the Dsup protein directly into mouse cheek and rectum cells. Byrne and his colleagues discovered that when exposed to radiation, the DNA of mice producing Dsup proteins showed fewer signs of radiation-induced damage compared to the DNA of mice that couldn't make Dsup.

“It highlights some of the value of research into areas where one might not immediately see a clinical outcome, like studies of DNA damage in tardigrades,” says Zachary Morris, an oncologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved with the study. “You can take findings from more basic or fundamental science and pair them with new delivery mechanisms and suddenly be in a situation where you have a very impactful finding with immediate relevance to human health.”

The researchers now plan to carefully evaluate the safety of this system before testing it on humans. Since tardigrade mRNA is foreign to humans, they want to ensure that injecting it doesn't lead to adverse reactions. Instead of directly injecting cells as they did with mice, they also want to develop patient-friendly ways to deliver the mRNA to human cells, such as using hydrogels.

“We were hoping to use what nature has really perfected as [this] optimized radiation protection, to potentially help patient care in the long term,” Byrne says.

	John Green's new book unravels how social injustice sustains the disease

Henry Reider, a survivor of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, makes videos to fight stigma surrounding the disease in Lakka, Sierra Leone. His story and those of others like him are the subject of John Green's new book.

Everything Is TuberculosisJohn GreenCrash Course Books, $28

A few years ago, renowned author John Green met a boy named Henry at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. Henry was small and, at first glance, looked about 9 years old to Green. Everyone at the hospital seemed to know and love him, making Green believe he was the child of a health care worker. That is until staff revealed that Henry was a patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis — and that he was 17.

Henry was small because he grew up malnourished. At age 5, he became ill with tuberculosis, which waxed and waned within his body for most of his youth, further emaciating him.

Green's latest nonfiction book, Everything is Tuberculosis, weaves Henry's story into the social and medical history of tuberculosis — one of the world's deadliest bacterial diseases. Over 1 million people died of tuberculosis in 2023, despite our ability to cure infections with antibiotics and prevent them with vaccines. “We know how to live in a world without tuberculosis,” Green writes. “But we choose not to live in that world.”

That's partly due to stigma, a central theme of the book. Negative, unfair beliefs about tuberculosis have been used to dehumanize and blame people for their illness. In some communities, the sick have been shunned, thought to be cursed or possessed by demons. In 18th and 19th century Europe, the disease was romanticized as an affliction of poets and artists. Like stigma, Green argues, this belief allowed society to other the sick as fundamentally different and even accept their deaths as “divine compensation” for their poetry and art.

Today, people living with tuberculosis have told Green that fighting stigma is even harder than fighting the disease itself. Through stories of Henry and others like him, Green argues convincingly that 21st century tuberculosis is caused not by bacteria but by injustice. He retraces the path of this injustice, from the disease's racialization in the 19th and 20th centuries to the ongoing global misallocation of treatments. Green contends, for instance, that Henry might have accessed safer and more appropriate medication sooner if it weren't for where he lives. Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health couldn't afford the high costs set by U.S. pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson for a treatment that might have cured Henry earlier.

In the end, Green reminds readers that we all must care. “In a world where everyone can eat, and access healthcare, and be treated humanely, tuberculosis has no chance. Ultimately, we are the cause,” Green writes. “We must also be the cure.”

Scientists have gotten the best-ever view of 'space tornadoes' howling near the Milky Way's black hole. The cosmic twisters could play an important role in distributing organic molecules throughout the galaxy.

""Space tornadoes"" are swirling near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, new telescope observations have revealed in unprecedented detail.

Astronomers recently zoomed in on the cosmic twisters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. Although these rotating structures had been seen previously, the new observations with ALMA are 100 times sharper than the earlier views, the team reported in a new paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

The researchers began by pointing ALMA at a region of the galaxy known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), which surrounds our galaxy's core supermassive black hole and is filled with seething clouds of dust and gas. The team wanted to uncover the mechanism driving the relentless motion of these clouds.

They used ALMA to trace certain molecular compounds — such as silicon monoxide, which is particularly good at revealing shock waves — within the maelstrom. This allowed the team to detect previously unseen details in the cosmic dust storms — including a new type of long, slender filament that seems to form when shock waves ripple past.

""Unlike any objects we know, these filaments really surprised us,"" because they appear to move quickly and in a direction counter to the structures surrounding them, Kai Yang, an astronomer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and lead author of the study, said in a statement.



The researchers describe these filaments as space tornadoes. ""They are violent streams of gas, they dissipate quickly, and they distribute materials into the environment efficiently,"" the authors said in the statement. The team's observations suggest that, in addition to emitting silicon oxide, these whirlwinds might disperse complex organic molecules — such as methanol, methyl cyanide and cyanoacetylene — throughout the CMZ and beyond.

""ALMA's high angular resolution and extraordinary sensitivity were essential to detect these molecular line emission associated with the slim filaments, and to confirm that there is no associations between these structures with dust emissions,"" Yichen Zhang, an astrophysicist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a co-author of the paper, said in a statement.

Further observations with ALMA will help the researchers determine how widespread these slim filaments are within the CMZ and how they contribute to molecular cycling in the region.

Alef has billed its Model A electric vehicle, which is capable of operating both as a road-based car and as an aircraft, as the cure for congestion.

A new kind of road-legal flying car is now a step closer to hitting the roads, and skies, after its maker Alef Aeronautics signed an agreement with aerospace companies PUCARA Aero and MYC to build it.

The Alef Model A is designed to work as both a road vehicle and aircraft, with its aim being to beat commuter congestion, representatives say.

Styled as a ""retro"" flying car, the Model A will operate as an all-electric car capable of vertical takeoff and landing. When in flight, the chassis can rotate 90 degrees to become a large, fixed wing for aerodynamic flight, with the body of the car made from mesh, allowing air to flow through when in flight mode.

When the body rotates, the ""cockpit"" section of the vehicle stays in place to keep the pilot stabilized. “To have a good distance, you need good aeronautics, which means you need wings,” said Jim Dukhovny, founder and CEO at Alef Aeronautics, in an interview with CNN.

""When you tilt, when you do the transition, you look like a biplane, you actually have two wings — a top wing and a bottom wing — which makes it incredibly efficient, incredibly battery efficient and gives it the long distance.""



Unlike other flying car prototypes, the Alef Model A is only a single-seater and therefore not envisaged as a taxi or passenger vehicle. In 2023, Alef Aeronautics told CNN that the vehicle would have a road range of 200 miles (321 kilometers) between charges, versus a flying range of 110 miles (177 km). On the road, it will have a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour) — below the minimum speed limit for highways in states such as Florida.

Engineers have been building this vehicle since 2015, the year that Alef Aeronautics was founded. While they initially thought they could build one in just six months, it wasn't until 2019 that a pilot first flew a full-scale prototype.

The Model A is expected to cost $299,999 when it launches, and the company has received a reported 3,200 pre-orders to date

There is still a great deal of uncertainty over how easily individual customers can take to the skies, however. In October 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced new rules for ""powered-lift aircraft,"" defined as ""an aircraft capable of vertical takeoff, vertical landing, and low speed flight"" such as flying taxis.

However, the rules state that only those already certified as pilots with a Private Pilot License (PPL), Commercial Pilot License (CPL), or Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL) will be able to fly powered-lift aircraft. This means presently that Model A operators will need to have spent several months and logged a minimum 40 hours of flying time to attain a license before being allowed to fly it.

Scientists have discovered the fossilized remains of a new fish species called Ferruaspis brocksi, which lived 15 million years ago, and some of the fish have their final meals preserved inside their stomachs.

Fossils of 15 million-year-old freshwater fish discovered in Australia represent a species completely new to science — and they still have the remains of their final meals in their stomachs.

The fossils of the new species, named Ferruaspis brocksi, were unearthed by paleontologists at the McGraths Flat fossil site in New South Wales, Australia, according to a new study published March 17 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Inside several of the fish's stomachs were the fossilized remains of their last suppers, including bits of insect larvae, two insect wings, and a bivalve (a mollusk with two hinged shells, such as a clam or a mussel).

The discovery is the first fossil of a freshwater smelt — a small, silvery fish — in the group Osmeriformes to have been discovered in Australia and will help scientists determine when these fish arrived on the enormous island.

""The discovery of the 15 million-year-old freshwater fish fossil offers us an unprecedented opportunity to understand Australia's ancient ecosystems and the evolution of its fish species, specifically the Osmeriformes group during the Miocene epoch, 11-15 million years ago,"" study lead author Matthew McCurry, a paleontologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, said in a statement.

Osmeriformes is a broad order of fish that includes various smelt species found worldwide, both in freshwater and marine environments. Smelt are relatively common across the U.S., particularly in the Great Lakes, the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska, though some species are also present in inland rivers and lakes. There are at least six species of smelt across the country, including rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), Eulachon or Columbia River smelt (Thaleichthys pacificus) and delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus).



Scientists have long wondered exactly when smelt and related species arrived in Australia because the fossil record for this group of fish and their ancestors has been notably sparse. ""Without fossils it has been hard for us to tell exactly when the group arrived in Australia and whether they changed at all through time,"" McCurry said.

In the new study, the researchers describe how they discovered the fossilized remains of F. brocksi embedded in goethite, an iron-rich mineral. By analyzing the fossils with high-powered microscopes, the researchers discovered that the specimens had been preserved with a surprisingly high level of detail. The position of the fish's bones and fins, cells that gave the fish color, and their final meals had all remained frozen in time for 15 million years.

Because the paleontologists discovered several fish from this new species preserved at the same site, they could piece together what the ancient fish species might have looked like, as not every fish was entirely preserved. According to the researchers, F. brocksi represents an early ancestor of species in the Osmeriformes order found across Australia and New Zealand today.

""The fossils formed between 11 [million] and 16 million years ago and provide a window into the past,"" McCurry said. ""They prove that the area was once a temperate wet rainforest and that life was rich and abundant in the Central Tablelands, NSW [New South Wales].""

Their stomach contents also offer a glimpse into the behavior of this ancient species. ""We now know that they fed on a range of invertebrates, but the most common prey was small phantom midge larvae,"" McCurry said.

Additionally, the unexpected discovery of fossilized pigment cells called melanophores allowed the researchers to determine what color the fish might have been. ""The fish was darker on its dorsal surface, lighter in colour on its belly and had two lateral stripes running along its side,"" study co-author Michael Frese, a researcher at the University of Canberra and Australia's national science agency CSIRO, said in the statement.

Melanophores are responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives color to skin, hair, eyes and feathers.

""Fossilised melanosomes have previously enabled palaeontologists to reconstruct the colour of feathers,"" Frese said, but melanosomes have never been used to reconstruct the color pattern of a long-extinct fish species.

Where is it? Tofua, Ha'apai, Tonga [-19.73996943, -175.072336]

What's in the photo? Smoke coming from a volcanic cone near the island's summit

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? April 23, 2022

This stunning aerial shot highlights the ""looming threat"" of a volcanic island in Tonga, which could violently explode in the future. The island also has a colorful origin story in Tongan mythology, which involves quarreling gods, a stolen mountain and a brightly shining anus.

The island, named Tofua, consists mainly of a massive ring-like caldera left by an explosive eruption millions of years ago. The caldera's steep walls stand up to 1,690 feet (515 meters) above sea level and harbor a deep crater lake that is around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) across. The island is part of the Ha'apai island group, a chain of volcanic islands and reefs located along a fault line between the Pacific and Indo-Australian tectonic plates.

One of the Ha'apai region's most famous inhabitants is the underwater Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai volcano, which violently erupted in January 2022, unleashing a gigantic plume of ash and steam above the ocean's surface. The explosive outburst, which occurred around 50 miles (80 km) south of Tofua, released as much energy as hundreds of atomic bombs, unleashed giant atmospheric shockwaves that reverberated across the globe, triggered a localized tsunami and wiped out a small nearby island. It also added record amounts of water vapor to Earth's atmosphere.

Tofua is docile compared to Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai. However, the smoke in the image, which was pumping out of a volcanic cone north of the crater lake, known as Lofia, is a reminder that the island is still very much active and could blow its top once again in the future, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

""There's the looming threat that Lofia could erupt explosively, much like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai did in 2022,"" though nothing suggests an eruption is imminent, NASA representatives wrote in October 2024.

Tofua has erupted at least 12 times since 1774, according to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program. The most recent and eruptive phase began in 2015 and is technically ongoing. However, the activity has mostly diminished as of May 2024.

In Tongan mythology, there is a colorful tale to explain Tofua's giant caldera and the creation of Kao — a tall cone-shaped island around 2.5 miles (4 km) northeast of Tofua, which is just out of shot in the satellite image.

In ""Tongan myths and tales,"" (Kraus, 1924) which was compiled from oral tradition told by local people at the time, American anthropologist Edward Winslow Gifford wrote the story:

—Erupting 'sharkcano' spits out a giant underwater plume in Oceania

—Antarctica's 'Deception Island' is one of the only places on Earth where you can sail into an active volcano

—Eerily circular 'Goblin Forest' surrounds sacred volcano with human rights

""Three deities from Samoa, Tuvuvata, Sisi, and Faingaa, conspired to steal Tofua. So they came and tore up the high mountain by its very roots and its place was taken by a large lake. This enraged the Tongan gods very much and one of them, Tafakula, essayed to stop the thieves. He stood on the island of Luahako and bent over so as to show his anus. It shone so brilliantly that the Samoan deities were struck with fear, thinking that the sun was rising and that their dastardly works was about to be revealed. Hence, they dropped the mountain close to Tofua and fled to Samoa. The mountain became the island of Kao.""

It is unclear from the account why Tafakula's anus shone like the sun.

A new species of dinosaur named Duonychus tsogtbaatari has been discovered by scientists, and unlike other therizinosaurs, this species has only two clawed fingers instead of three.

A new species of dinosaur with strange claws has been unearthed in Mongolia by paleontologists.

This new genus and species is a therizinosaur, plant-eating, two-legged giants with long claws, and was discovered buried in the Gobi Desert, according to a new study published Tuesday (March 25) in the journal iScience.

Unlike other therizinosaurs, which have three fingers on their hands equipped with long, sharp claws, this new species only has two fingers. This unique anatomy inspired its scientific name, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, which is Greek for ""two digits"" and honors the Mongolian paleontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.

""Many species of therizinosaurs have been discovered, and this group had pretty much been defined by their three-fingered hands sporting large claws,"" study co-author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, told Live Science in an email. ""To find a specimen with only two fingers/claws was surprising as this was so out of the ordinary for this group of dinosaurs.""

Therizinosaurs are a group of dinosaurs that lived across what is now Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous Period (100 million to 66 million years ago). Despite being part of the theropod group of dinosaurs — typically associated with carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex — therizinosaurs were herbivorous. These dinosaurs are known for their enormous, sickle-shaped claws, with some species growing talons as long as 20 inches (50 centimeters).

All other therizinosaurs that have previously been discovered, including Therizinosaurus and Beipiaosaurus, have three clawed fingers on their hands, making the discovery of two-clawed D. tsogtbaatari unusual.

""Therizinosaurs are already some of the most unusual dinosaurs out there, but Duonychus tsogtbaatari takes it to another level,"" study lead author Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, a paleontologist at Hokkaido University in Japan, told Live Science in an email. ""This newly discovered species from Mongolia breaks the mold with just two fingers instead of the typical three, offering a rare glimpse into how theropod hands evolved and adapted."" ""But what truly makes this discovery exciting is the incredibly well-preserved keratinous sheath on its claw — the first such case in a medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaur,"" Kobayashi added.

Duonychus tsogtbaatari fossil claw during excavation.

The new fossil was unearthed during the construction of a water pipeline in the Bayanshiree Formation in Ömnögovi Province, southern Mongolia. The specimen had excellently preserved hands, with a 3D sheath where the claw — made out of keratin, like our fingernails — would have been. Parts of the arms, spine and hips were also preserved.

""The hands, a hallmark of therizinosaurs, are exquisitely preserved with all the finger and wrist bones intact in this specimen,"" Zelenitsky said. ""Even the keratinous sheath of the claw is preserved revealing how big and sharp its claws really were.""

Other species of dinosaur, such as T. rex, had two fingers, but this marks the first time a therizinosaur has been found with fewer than three digits. This species likely evolved to lose one of the three fingers of its ancestors, the study authors suggested.



The researchers think that D. tsogtbaatari may have evolved this unique hand in order to better grip vegetation, allowing for more efficient feeding.

""The loss of the third finger in Duonychus tsogtbaatari might actually have made its remaining two fingers even better at what they were designed for — grasping,"" Kobayashi said. ""Based on the shape of its well-preserved claw and how it curved, Duonychus was likely using its hands to grab onto branches and pull vegetation closer, kind of like how chameleons do today."" ""We think many therizinosaurs may have used their hands for foraging in a 'hook-and-pull' motion, but Duonychus takes this to another level with its extreme claw structure.""

—Australia's 'upside down' dinosaur age had two giant predators, 120 million-year-old fossils reveal

—What if a giant asteroid had not wiped out the dinosaurs?

—Secrets of 1st dinosaurs lie in the Sahara and Amazon rainforest, study suggests

Additionally, Kobayashi suggested that the claws may have played other roles, such as in ""defense, courtship, or even play.""

The researchers are thrilled by this discovery, as it not only reveals unexpected diversity within therizinosaurs, but also marks the fifth time that a theropod dinosaur group has evolved to lose their third finger.

""While more fossils would help confirm this, all signs point to Duonychus representing a true evolutionary shift, not just a fluke,"" Kobayashi said. ""It's a remarkable find that reshapes our understanding of therizinosaurs and theropod evolution as a whole.""

Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.

""Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?"" he said.

Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.

A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.

Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.

Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid ""buy-in program,"" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.

Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The ""Work Without Worry"" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.

Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. ""It's a trap — a poverty trap,"" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.

Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.

Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.

Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. ""That's the trumpet I've been blowing,"" he said with a smile.

The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. ""If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,"" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her ""Condition of the State Address."" ""Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.""

Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.

National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.

In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.

Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.

""You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,"" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. ""I don't think it has to be expensive"" for the state and federal governments, she said.

Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.

Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. ""Awareness of these programs is really limited,"" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.

In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.

The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. ""This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,"" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.

Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, ""Zach of All Trades.""

On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.

After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.

Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.

There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. ""This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,"" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. ""If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.""

A Japanese man who spent nearly 50 years on death row before he was acquitted of murder will be compensated 217 million yen ($1.45m), in what his lawyers say is the country's largest-ever payout in a criminal case.

Iwao Hakamata, 89, was found guilty in 1968 of killing his boss, his boss's wife and their two children, but was acquitted last year after a retrial.

Mr Hakamata's lawyers had sought the highest compensation possible, arguing that the 47 years in detention - which made him the world's longest-serving death row inmate - took a toll on his mental health.

Judge Kunii Koshi, who granted the request on Monday, agreed that he had suffered ""extremely severe"" mental and physical pain.

The Japanese government will pay Mr Hakamata's financial compensation, in what local media is widely reporting as the biggest payout for a criminal case in the country's history.

Mr Hakamata's case is one of Japan's longest and most famous legal sagas.

He was granted a rare retrial and released from prison in 2014, amid suspicions that investigators may have planted evidence that led to his conviction.

Last September, hundreds of people gathered at a court in Shizuoka, a city on Japan's south coast, where a judge handed down the acquittal - to loud cheers of ""banzai"", or ""hurray"" in Japanese.

Mr Hakamata, however, was unfit to attend the hearing. He was exempted from all prior hearings because of his deteriorated mental state.

He had lived under the care of his 91-year-old sister Hideko since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014. Hideko had fought for decades to clear her brother's name.

Mr Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant in 1966 when the bodies of his boss, his boss' wife and their two children were recovered from a fire at their home in Shizuoka, west of Tokyo. All four had been stabbed to death.

Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting fire to their home and stealing 200,000 yen in cash.

Mr Hakamata initially denied doing so, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession, following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.

In 1968 he was sentenced to death.

For years, Mr Hakamata's lawyers had argued that DNA recovered from the victims' clothes did not match his, and alleged that the evidence was planted.

Although he was granted a retrial in 2014, prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin.

The case has raised questions about Japan's justice system, including the time taken for a retrial and the allegations of forced confessions.

Expectations often define success. A team could go 10-2 during the regular season and make the College Football Playoff, and leave fans underwhelmed because it was picked to win a conference or national title. Meanwhile, a team projected to win four games can create a positive buzz around the program with a. 7-6 campaign that includes a bowl win. 

While expectations vary, a team's preseason win total is the most reliable metric for judging whether a team lived up to its standard. After all, sportsbooks aren't rooting for anybody; they're only interested in making money.

While it's only March, and the real games are months away, books have begun posting win totals for the 2025 season. So what better time to play out the entire season than right now? Sure, a lot of these schools don't even know who their starting quarterbacks are, and there will be another flurry of roster movement once the spring portal opens up, but there's no time for patience!

So I played out every game on the schedule in my head for all 18 Big Ten teams, and I know how the season will end. There's no longer any need to wait. We'll just ignore that when I did this exact exercise last year, I went 9-9 on my predictions for each team. This year, I'm setting my own over/under at 8.5. Odds below via FanDuel Sportsbook.

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Western Illinois, at Duke, Western Michigan, USC, at Purdue, Rutgers, Maryland, at Wisconsin, NorthwesternLosses: at Indiana, Ohio State, at Washington

Analysis: There's plenty of buzz around the Illini as a College Football Playoff contender, and it makes sense. A team that won 10 games last year returns nearly every starter, including a third-year starting QB in Luke Altmyer. The schedule is friendly, too. I have Illinois going 9-3, so I clearly think a total of 7.5 is low. Pick: Over 7.5 (-134)

Over/under 8.5 wins

Wins: Old Dominion, Kennesaw State, Indiana State, Illinois, Michigan State, UCLA, Wisconsin, at PurdueLosses: at Iowa, at Oregon, at Maryland, at Penn State

Analysis: The Hoosiers were a major surprise last year, and while they won't collapse in 2025, it's hard to hit it that big in the portal for consecutive seasons. The odds are this team will fall back to Earth a bit, but it says a lot that Indiana fans will be mad at me for thinking their football team will go 8-4. Pick: Under 8.5 (-110)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Albany, UMass, Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan StateLosses: at Iowa State, at Rutgers, at Wisconsin, Penn State, Oregon, at USC, at Nebraska

Analysis: I didn't plan on coming in this low on Iowa, but here we are. It's not just about the quarterback situation. Iowa has been trending in the wrong direction along the lines of scrimmage in recent seasons. When you combine the questions with a schedule that isn't overly friendly, I think this projection is rather reasonable. Pick: Under 7.5 (-170)

Over/under 4.5 wins

Wins: FAU, Northern Illinois, Towson, Washington, Nebraska, IndianaLosses: at Wisconsin, at UCLA, at Rutgers, at Illinois, Michigan, Michigan State

Analysis: I don't believe the Terps were good last year, nor do I think they were as bad as their final record suggested. The schedule is much easier this season, as they won't see Ohio State, Penn State or Oregon. They also have a very soft nonconference slate. This team should get back to a bowl. Pick: Over 4.5 (-115)

Over/under 8.5 wins

Wins: New Mexico, Central Michigan, Wisconsin, Washington, at Michigan State, Purdue, at Northwestern, at MarylandLosses: at Oklahoma, at Nebraska, at USC, Ohio State

Analysis: Last year, I gave Michigan the benefit of the doubt coming off a national title. This year, I'm not. The wins over Ohio State and Alabama to end the season papered over some of the team's significant problems, and all the key players from that title team are gone now. Maybe Bryce Underwood is the Prince Who Was Promised right away, but I expect some growing pains. Pick: Under 8.5 (+148)

Over/under 5.5 wins

Wins: Western Michigan, Boston College, Youngstown State, UCLA, MarylandLosses: at USC, at Nebraska, at Indiana, Michigan, at Minnesota, Penn State, at Iowa

Analysis: A lot depends on the development of Aidan Chiles. If he taps into his potential in his second season as a starter, the Spartans could be 2025's version of Indiana. If he doesn't, it could be another rough season. Either way, there are too many tough road games on the schedule for me to assume Sparty takes a significant jump. Pick: Under 5.5 (+100)

Over/under 6.5 wins

Wins: Buffalo, Northwestern State, Rutgers, Purdue, Nebraska, Michigan State, at Northwestern, WisconsinLosses: at Cal, at Ohio State, at Iowa, at Oregon

Analysis: For those who haven't paid attention, Minnesota has failed to win seven or more regular season games only twice in the last six full (non-COVID) seasons. Last year, I made the mistake of going under on their 5.5 projection, but I won't do it again. It's not always fun or exciting to watch, but this program's consistency deserves respect. There's also a nice home schedule. Pick: Over 6.5 (-142)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Cincinnati, Akron, Houston Christian, Michigan, Michigan State, Northwestern, USC, IowaLosses: at Maryland, at Minnesota, at UCLA, at Penn State

Analysis: Nebraska is another team that could take a serious leap forward if Dylan Raiola rounds out his game and improves. He has the potential to be the best QB in the conference, which goes a long way toward winning games. I don't know if he goes that far in 2025, but I do think the Huskers take advantage of a schedule without Ohio State and Oregon on it. Pick: Over 7.5 (-122)

Over/under 3.5 wins

Wins: Western Illinois, UCLA, ULM, PurdueLosses: at Tulane, Oregon, at Penn State, at Nebraska, at USC, Michigan, Minnesota, at Illinois

Analysis: I think Northwestern will finish 2025 with a record a lot closer to its 2024 season than 2023, but even if it doesn't improve, it'll still go over this win total! Starting on the road against Tulane won't be easy, but my gut tells me Preston Stone will bring a consistent competence to the offense that didn't exist last year. I don't know if that's enough to lead to serious improvement, but four wins shouldn't be too difficult to find. Pick: Over 3.5 (-160)

Over/under 10.5 wins

Wins: Grambling, Ohio, at Washington, Minnesota, at Illinois, at Wisconsin, Penn State, at Purdue, UCLA, Rutgers, at MichiganLosses: Texas

Analysis: I'll be honest with you. I expected to go under here. My belief was that Ohio State would be like a lot of champions in the modern game: still very good, but struggling to replace key starters in an era where you can no longer horde depth so easily. Then I did the exercise, and this team won 11 games anyway! The truth is, it'll all come down to whether they can win two of three games against Texas, Penn State, and Michigan. Clearly, I think they can. Pick: Over 10.5 (+128)

Over/under 10.5 wins

Wins: Montana State, Oklahoma State, at Northwestern, Oregon State, Indiana, at Rutgers, Wisconsin, at Iowa, Minnesota, USC, at WashingtonLosses: at Penn State

Analysis: I don't know for sure who will start at quarterback for Oregon, but I'm confident the Ducks will be one of the more talented teams in the league. It also helps to avoid Michigan and Ohio State while getting USC at home. Road games against Penn State and Washington will be the big tests. Pick: Over 10.5 (-110)

Over/under 10.5 wins

Wins: Nevada, FIU, Villanova, Oregon, at UCLA, Northwestern, at Iowa, Indiana, at Michigan State, Nebraska, at RutgersLosses: at Ohio State

Analysis: This is one of those spots where if the Nittany Lions don't go over the total, it'll feel like a disappointment. There's been so much put into retaining players on the roster, as well as poaching Jim Knowles from Ohio State. There's an all-in feel to this team that they need to deliver on. I think they will in the regular season. After that? Who knows? Pick: Over 10.5 (+134)

Over/under 3.5 wins

Wins: Ball State, Southern Illinois, RutgersLosses: USC, at Notre Dame, Illinois, at Minnesota, at Northwestern, at Michigan, Ohio State, at Washington, Indiana

Analysis: After last season and with a new coach in charge, Purdue could finish below this projection at 3-9, and it'd feel like a breath of fresh air to fans. And that's precisely what I think happens! The Boilermakers should start the year 2-0, and then it's about finding home wins. I have them beating Rutgers, but would it truly shock any of us if they took down an Illinois or Indiana? Maybe even Northwestern on the road? Of course not. But if they only do it once, they finish below the total. Pick: Under 3.5 (-200)

Over/under 5.5 wins

Wins: Ohio, Miami OH, Norfolk State, Iowa, MarylandLosses: at Minnesota, at Washington, Oregon, at Purdue, at Illinois, at Ohio State, Penn State

Analysis: Rutgers has finished over its projection each of the last two seasons, going 6-6 in the regular season in 2023 and 7-5 last year. They have experience returning, including at QB in Athan Kaliakmanis -- who played well last year. All of this makes you think they should go over, but that's not how it worked out here! It's one of those odd years when you would rather have Oregon and Penn State on the road because you probably aren't winning those games anyway. Meanwhile, a lot of your coin-flip games are on the road. Oh, and there's never a good time to have Oregon, Ohio State, and Penn State on your schedule! Toss in an Illinois team coming off a 10-win season, and somebody at the Big Ten's Scheduling Department clearly has it out for the Knights! Pick: Under 5.5 (-110)

Over/under 4.5 wins

Wins: at UNLV, New Mexico, Maryland, Nebraska, WashingtonLosses: Utah, at Northwestern, Penn State, at Michigan State, at Indiana, at Ohio State, at USC

Analysis: The Bruins got off to a slow start last year, but by the time the regular season ended, they felt like a team moving in the right direction. Momentum doesn't always carry over to the offseason, but five wins doesn't seem like a ridiculous request with this schedule. Taking care of business at home will determine how good the Bruins' season is. Pick: Over 4.5 (-192)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Missouri State, Georgia Southern, at Purdue, Michigan State, Michigan, Northwestern, Iowa, UCLALosses: at Illinois, at Notre Dame, at Nebraska, at Oregon

Analysis: USC has finished the regular season with eight wins or more just twice in the last six full seasons. The Trojans have only done it once in Lincoln Riley's three seasons in charge, and that was in his first year. This is a simple fact I'm sharing. There's no need to get mad at me about it. I'm taking the over here, but I don't feel good about it at all. Pick: Over 7.5 (-118)

Over/under 7.5 wins

Wins: Colorado State, UC Davis, at Washington State, Rutgers, Illinois, PurdueLosses: Ohio State, at Maryland, at Michigan, at Wisconsin, at UCLA, Oregon

Analysis: The hope is that Demond Williams can take the Huskies to another level after finishing 6-6 in their first Big Ten regular season, but a projection of 7.5 wins feels overly optimistic to me. The Huskies play both Ohio State and Oregon -- albeit at home -- and a road trip to Michigan won't be fun, either. Plus, we saw last year that the cross-country trips weren't easy on anybody. Travel struggles included a Huskies' loss at Rutgers, so I'm not willing to assume this team beats Maryland on the road, either. Pick: Under 7.5 (-138)

Over/under 5.5 wins

Wins: Miami OH, Middle Tennessee, Maryland, Iowa, WashingtonLosses: at Alabama, at Michigan, Ohio State, at Oregon, at Indiana, Illinois, at Minnesota

Analysis: It's a make-or-break season for Luke Fickell. The embattled Badgers coach has gone 12-13 in two seasons at Wisconsin, and saw the schools' 22-year bowl streak end last year. There have been major changes since, but I don't know how impactful they'll be. Also, the schedule is assault and battery. The Badgers will be on the road for games against Alabama, Michigan and Oregon. But, hey, at least they get Ohio State at home, right!? All in all, of the nine Big Ten opponents on the schedule, eight made a bowl last season. Pick: Under 5.5 (-144)

Anthony Davis returned to the floor for the Dallas Mavericks on Monday, scoring 12 points in a 120-101 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. 

Though limited to a 28-minute ceiling, Davis mostly looked like himself against the Nets, his first action since his Feb. 8 Dallas debut. He opened the game with a clean cut and dunk, moved well defensively, and generally inspired some optimism for a team that has been devoid of any essentially since his acquisition.

These are, of course, the post-Luka Dončić Mavericks we're talking about, so there's no such thing as pure optimism. While the victory over Brooklyn and the return of a mostly healthy Davis helped Dallas (35-37) move back into the No. 10 slot in the Western Conference Play-In picture, it's worth wondering whether or not that's even a worthwhile goal for a floundering Mavericks team. They are, after all, still missing key contributors Daniel Gafford, Dereck Lively II, Caleb Martin, Dante Exum, Olivier-Maxence Prosper, and, of course, Kyrie Irving, who will miss the remainder of the season and at least a good chunk of next season with a torn ACL.

Just reaching the postseason will be an uphill battle. Their competition in Phoenix has won four of its past five games and is far healthier. The Suns, also 35-37, control the tiebreaker and therefore reclaimed that No. 10 slot by beating the Milwaukee Bucks later Monday. Getting that No. 10 seed means two road games -- one likely in Sacramento, the other in either Minnesota or Los Angeles against the Clippers -- just to get to the postseason. Waiting for them there would be an NBA-best Oklahoma City Thunder team eager to avenge last season's second-round defeat to Dallas. The odds of any sort of substantial playoff run here are, obviously, slim.

Davis isn't focusing on those odds. He sees a chance to reach the postseason, so he's playing for it. 

""I seen we were a man down forever, sometimes playing seven guys, six, eight, and if I felt like I was 100% to go play I was going to do that and I stressed that to my team and I stressed that to the organization as well tonight. So we felt I was able to play and that's what I wanted to do,"" Davis said after the win. ""I'm not the one throw in the towel and sit down.""

It's an admirable sentiment, especially coming from a player who has dealt with injuries as frequently as Davis has. He feels he has a job to do, and there is unspoken pressure that comes along with that. Jokes about his durability aside, he's not only trying to lead his team into the playoffs, but prove something to a fanbase that is in open rebellion at the moment. Davis isn't Dončić. Some fans will never forgive him for that. But those who stick around will at least see a new star doing everything in his power to help their team compete. It's a good way to win points in a new city.

It probably isn't the best way to approach the rest of the season if the Mavericks have any sort of long-term championship ambitions, though. 

Obviously, there is a real benefit in missing the postseason from a draft perspective. Dallas knows well the importance of every last slot. In 2023, it tanked viciously to land Lively. Had the Mavericks finished one slot lower, that pick would have gone to the Knicks. Dallas isn't at risk of losing this year's pick, but the Mavericks need to maximize it wherever it lands because all of their first-round picks between 2027 and 2030 are gone from previous trades. A few slots could make a world of difference, especially with the flatter lottery odds structure that the league instituted in 2019.

A few draft slots are important, but Davis is more so. We're talking about a player who aggravated a pre-existing injury in his very first game as a Maverick. The ""street clothes"" moniker isn't fully fair, but it comes from a real place. Davis is a walking injury risk. The stakes this season aren't especially high because the Mavericks are already doomed in the bigger picture. What if Davis, like Irving, suffers an injury that goes into next season while pushing for a Play-In spot the Mavericks probably shouldn't even want? What if the adductor strain that kept him out for a good chunk of this season lingers into next year?

That would be a worthwhile risk if Irving were healthy and Dallas had a chance to compete for much this season. Given the state of the rest of the team, though, there just isn't much to be gained by putting Davis back on the floor. 

It's a commendable effort on Davis' part, especially in a league in which tanking is rampant. It just creates quite a bit of risk with a pretty minimal reward for the Mavericks.

Well, we've hit the George Costanza portion of the coaching carousel. 

By that I mean:

Sean Miller has left Xavier to be the coach at Texas. It's a move that shocked — and angered — people at Xavier (understandably so). Miller was there for three seasons, took the Musketeers to two NCAA Tournaments and decided to bolt for Austin, Texas, and the promise of a bigger program in a bigger league with bigger money. 

Now Xavier is left to scramble and hire a coach just as the portal opens. Will the school look to bring in another former coach, Charleston's Chris Mack, or will athletic director Greg Christopher be so bothered by the circumstances of Miller's sneaky exit that he looks to hire outside the Xavier family for the first time in generations? One to watch, and one that could fill quickly. 

What's more, Josh Pastner agreed Monday night to be the next coach at UNLV, sources confirmed. Pastner coveted the job from the moment it opened and was able to break through a long list of candidates interviewed there. He'll have a five-year deal and the press conference will be Wednesday. Pastner's career record is 276-187. He spent the past two seasons working in television, but I spoke to Pastner as recently as February and he told me then he was eager and wanting to get back into coaching this cycle. UNLV was for sure the best job opportunity available to him. 

It's entirely possible we'll have even more job-swap action before the Sweet 16 gets going again Thursday night, so that in mind, here are the other recent hirings ... which also prompted job openings. 

» Ben McCollum leaves Drake after one year to run Iowa» Niko Medved goes home to guide Minnesota» VCU's Ryan Odom is now at Virginia» Will Wade is on the ground at NC State

I've got more in the capsules below, including other hirings that are now a week-plus old.

We're at 38 coaching flips as of Tuesday. Hitting 40-plus in the next 48 hours feels ... unavoidable.

Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts' status for Opening Day remains uncertain as he continues to deal with the illness that caused him to miss the Tokyo Series against the Chicago Cubs. 

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, however, struck a more optimistic tone with respect to Betts' status as he told reporters that Betts was able to keep solid food down and go through a workout on Monday. Per Roberts, Betts is slated to play in Tuesday's exhibition against the Los Angeles Angels. If he fares well enough, then he should be able to play on Thursday for the traditional Opening Day contest against the Detroit Tigers. 

Betts, a late scratch from Sunday's exhibition game against the Angels, told reporters, including ""Dodgers Talk,"" that he's switched medications recently, and that he feels better except for persisting stomach issues. Indeed, Betts said earlier on Monday that he'd been unable to keep down solid food and has instead subsisted off smoothies. Predictably, he's lost serious weight in the process: he's now checking in at 150 pounds after entering spring training weighing around 175 pounds.

""I don't think anybody really knows ... My body's just kind of eating itself, and so it's hard to not fuel it,"" Betts said. ""Every time, literally, every time I fuel my body, I throw it up and I don't know what to do about it.""

Betts, 32, was expected to enter the season serving as the Dodgers' starting shortstop. If he's unable to go -- either on Opening Day or for the onset of the season -- the Dodgers would ostensibly slot in veteran Miguel Rojas at the six, as they did in Tokyo. In five seasons with the Dodgers, Betts has hit .284/.372/.530 (145 OPS+) with 132 home runs and 62 stolen bases. His contributions have been worth 27.8 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. 

The Dodgers will resume their regular-season schedule on Thursday, when they host reigning American League Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal and the Tigers. The Dodgers won both games of the Tokyo Series, staking them out to an early 2-0 record.

Sacramento State is hiring former Sacramento Kings star Mike Bibby as its next coach, ESPN reporteds. Bibby, 46, played for the Sacramento Kings from 2001-08 during the franchise's heyday and most recently served as a TV analyst for NBC Sports California.

Bibby has zero coaching experience at the collegiate level. He coached at Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix, Arizona from 2014-19 and briefly coached at Hillcrest Prep High School in 2019.

Former Sac State coach David Patrick resigned in May 2024 to take a job as an assistant at LSU. The program tabbed Michael Czepil as the interim coach for the 2024-25 season. He wasn't retained after the Hornets finished 7-25 (3-15 Big Sky) and lost 83-70 in the first round of the Big Sky Tournament to Weber State.

Bibby led Arizona to the national title in 1997 before he was drafted by the Vancouver Grizzlies with the No. 2 pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. Bibby played in the NBA from 1998-2012 and was an First-Team All-Rookie selection in 1999.

Bibby's hire comes less than two months after Sac State hired Brennan Marion -- a rising Group-of-Five offensive coordinator at UNLV -- as its next coach.

In crunch time on Feb. 28, the Boston Celtics' Jaylen Brown was threatening to end the Cleveland Cavaliers' eight-game winning streak. The reigning Finals MVP had scored back-to-back buckets against the smaller Darius Garland, so he set a ball screen on the Cavs All-Star, hoping Cleveland would cede the switch. Instead, Brown's man, Dean Wade, ceded nothing. Wade cut off the ballhandler, Derrick White, then recovered back to Brown, forced him left and contested his shot. The Cavs got the stop, then extended their two-point lead and their streak.

Wade finished with only five points in 19 minutes. Unlike when he scored 20 fourth-quarter points including the game-winner against the Celtics last season, he was not the hero. There was no courtside celebration with the Kelce brothers after the buzzer, no ESPN podcast appearance days later. That offensive explosion, though, was an anomaly -- it was the third time in his career that he'd scored 20-plus in a game, and he's only topped 15 once since then. The way Wade shut the door against Boston this time was much more emblematic of his role.

""I call him White Blanket,"" Cleveland center Tristan Thompson said. ""White Blanket, you can't score on him.""

Thompson remembers when White Blanket had to shuffle back and forth between the Cavs and the G League's Canton Charge. ""Man, they had him working like a motherf---er,"" Thompson said. ""We was working him to the bone especially because we weren't good then. But he grinded. He's the prototypical work-your-ass-off-to-get-where-you're-at [player]."" Six years into his NBA career, Wade is a ""key contributor to our team,"" someone who can not just hold his ground against players like Brown, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Cade Cunningham. ""He be givin' em problems.""

The odds of anyone in Wade's position in 2019 -- an undrafted rookie on a two-way contract -- lasting in the NBA are slim. The odds of staying with the franchise that scooped you up are miniscule. Since 2017, when the league introduced the two-way contract, 829 such deals have been signed. Wade is one of six players to have signed a two-way as a rookie and remained on the roster for six years. (The others? Duncan Robinson, Lu Dort, Naz Reid, Amir Coffey and John Konchar.)

""When I was a two-way, I didn't even think about the future,"" Wade said. ""You couldn't. There was just so much going on. So the only thing I really focused on was that day: what I was going to do, workouts that day, and then get home and then see what I could do on Call of Duty.""

Because Thompson left the team in 2020 and returned three years later, Wade and Garland are Cleveland's longest-tenured players. More than once, the Cavs' communications department has had to correct media that has given the designation to Garland alone.

""I tell him he's playing with the house's money,"" Thompson said. ""He should never question anything he does on that court because he earned this.""

His six seasons in Cleveland have been a ""crazy ride,"" Wade said. ""I don't know if they just couldn't get rid of me or what, but I'm still sticking around."" One does not, however, become an integral part of the team that owns the East's best record by accident. ""He makes us better,"" Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""He makes us more versatile."" Before a knee injury in January, the 6-foot-9 Wade started 26 games this season, mostly at the small forward spot, but the coaching staff is equally comfortable using him as a smallball center. He's not a big personality, not a highlight machine and not an awards candidate. He's just the type of player who can swing a playoff series.

""I was really worried when we lost him,"" Atkinson said. ""I'm like, 'Man, this guy's kind of like the link that drives winning.' We've been able to sustain, but I'm just thrilled to have him back.""

Wade was a reliable defender in high school and college, but he wasn't this. ""He's turned into an incredible wing defender,"" Clint Kinnamon, who coached him at St. John High School in the small town of St. John, Kansas, said. ""He always had really good athleticism, but if you told me he was going to be one of the premier wing defenders in the league, I may have been shocked as a high school coach."" After his four years at Kansas State, he and his agents sold teams on his ability to guard 3s, 4s and, once he got stronger, backup 5s. He could move his feet well for his a big man, but didn't anticipate being the guy his coach would call on to guard stars of all sizes at the next level.

""I was not thinking I was going to be a real defensive stopper type of player,"" Wade said. ""I turned myself into that, but I never thought, especially coming out of college, that would be my role.""

Wade joined a Cleveland team that was coming off a 19-63 season, its first after LeBron James had left for the Los Angeles Lakers. He was on the summer league squad that, under then-coach John Beilein, reportedly endured two-a-days in which both practice sessions lasted more than two hours. ""When I got in the league, man, we were definitely in a weird spot,"" Wade said. Beilein and the Cavs parted ways during the All-Star break, 54 games into a five-year contract. This was shortly after they had traded for center Andre Drummond, whom they played in jumbo lineups next to Thompson that season and JaVale McGee the next. Wade and Larry Nance Jr. found themselves playing the 3 next to two non-shooting centers.

""It was crazy,"" Wade said. ""We had some messed-up lineups out there.""

Sometimes, for a developing player, a terrible team can be a terrific environment. ""The front office has been amazing the whole time, through a rough start,"" Wade said. ""I didn't know where it was heading the first couple years, but they promised, man: 'Stay the course, stay the course and buy in and good things are going to happen.'"" As a rookie, the Charge put Wade ""in a lot of different situations, and he was always successful,"" Nate Reinking, then their coach and now an assistant with the Cavs, said. He played a lot of center in switch-everything lineups, which meant he spent a lot of time defending small guards.

Early on, Wade paid attention to how Thompson, Nance and Kevin Love went about their routines. In Year 2, ""I put my head down and was in the weight room a lot,"" he said. He needed to be able to take bumps if he was going to be a high-level defender, and he was determined to become a high-level defender because that would get him on the court.

""I think a lot of defense, especially with the athletes and the players we have in this league, it's a mental drive thing,"" Wade said. ""If they wanted to, they could.""

Wade took a jump, and, after logging just 71 NBA minutes in his first season, logged 1,212 in his second. As he got stronger and earned the trust of his coaches, he started to see himself differently. He wanted the opportunity to guard the best players in the world. 

""I took pride in that,"" Wade said. ""I still take pride in that to this day.""

Garland said that Wade ""always has that chip on his shoulder from being undrafted and just not being a guy that people are looking at."" He is never brash publicly, but you can see the chip whenever he's matched up with a big name, wholly locked in to his assignment.

Wade played for Kinnamon for nine years, starting as a third grader. Initially, Wade was ""so shy,"" Kinnamon said, that he'd sometimes tell his mother, Trish, that he didn't want to go to the gym. Trish, who has coached volleyball, track and basketball at St. John, would ""guide him over,"" Kinnamon said, and, once he got there, it was hard to get him to leave.

From when he was young, Wade ""wanted to soak up any information that you had,"" Kinnamon said. He was ""always coachable,"" and he wanted to please his coaches. He could be too shy on the court, though, so Kinnamon had to encourage him to shoot the ball and take it to the rim. 

""He did not ever want to appear to be selfish,"" Kinnamon said. 

That was still true when Wade was in the G League. Reinking told him that he didn't have to force things or do anything spectacular, but couldn't turn down shots. 

""It was more about just building his mindset to let it fly,"" Reinking said. ""He had so much skill, but he's such a team guy.""

Wade, who has made 37% of his 3s in the NBA, said has been hearing that he has to shoot more ""pretty much my whole career,"" but less so these days: ""I'm taking the right shots now."" In high school he ""was trying to get my teammates involved, be a good teammate,"" and after that he passed up shots ""because I thought we could get better ones."" His Cavs coaches, including Atkinson, have consistently delivered the same message, he said: ""Dude, if you don't take the shots when you're open, that's the best shot we're going to get as a team, so be a team player and take those shots. We believe in you.""

Brad Korn, who joined Bruce Weber's staff at Kansas State before Wade's sophomore season, said he and Wade related to each other right away. ""Us small-town kids, I think sometimes maybe we don't dream big enough, almost,"" Korn said. ""Like we're OK with being good, but we don't know that it's OK to dream bigger."" A native of Plano, Illinois, Korn wanted Wade to understand his potential: He had a real opportunity to make the NBA, to never have a real job.

Korn worked with Wade individually for three years, but downplayed his role. ""It wasn't like I was some guru,"" he said. ""He had all the talent and ability. I just don't think he quite knew exactly how to apply it, or that it's OK that he can apply it."" In his office, which overlooked the practice court, Korn put up a sign that read ""DBAP."" It was an inside joke about a phrase that Weber would use with Wade -- ""Dean, be a player"" -- but it was also a coaching tool. When Wade made a mistake in practice, Korn would simply point to the sign.

Wade is ""a natural,"" Korn said. Yes, coaches have gone at him about being more aggressive -- though Korn himself only ever did it once, when Kansas State was trailing at halftime against its rival Kansas Jayhawks in Wade's senior year, a game it would go on to win -- but Wade's instinct to make the right plays is not a bad one, especially now that he's on a team stacked with scorers. ""I didn't have to learn how to play off the ball [in the NBA],"" Wade said, and that's one of the reasons he's found a home in Cleveland.

""We can't have it both ways,"" Korn said. He added, ""If Dean went out there and tried to score every possession or every time he touched the ball, I mean, honestly, he'd probably be in Germany.""

On and off the court, Wade is low maintenance. He's ""just a regular Joe that you can run into on the street and have a conversation with,"" Kinnamon said. Every summer, he returns to St. John, where his parents still live, and to Manhattan, Kansas, where he has a house.

Not only is he ""a perfect fit for this team,"" as Reinking put it, Cleveland is ""the perfect city for me and my family,"" Wade said. ""A quieter city, a hard-working, blue-collar kind of city. The people really embrace the team. Even when we were bad, man, they were packing that place out."" He would like to stay as long as he can.

If not for a last-minute phone call, though, Wade never would have even worked out for the Cavs. Two days before the 2019 NBA Draft, Wade was at Detroit Metro Airport, having completed what he thought was his final pre-draft workout, when his agent called and told him not to get on his flight home. Wade would instead go to Cleveland, but that flight that got canceled, so he stayed at the Westin in the airport. His bags were already checked, so he used the ""little toothbrush and toothpaste"" that was provided for him, slept a bit and took off the next morning.

""They picked me up from the airport [in Cleveland] at 7 a.m, my workout was at 8,"" Wade said. ""I went straight to the gym on like four hours' sleep, same clothes as I had the night before.""

Wade had a killer workout, then flew home to Kansas, where his family threw him a draft party he didn't ask for. ""My mom didn't tell me,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I don't want to have a draft party, I don't want to have a bunch of people here.' She invited my whole family and friends."" Wade watched some of the first round, but then ""kind of went and chilled, ate -- mom and grandma cooked everything."" Before the draft was over, the Cavs offered him a two-way. The Minnesota Timberwolves did, too, but Cleveland seemed like a cleaner path to playing time. He told everyone the news, ""and it was a blast from then on,"" he said.

That night, Wade ""knew I probably was gonna go undrafted,"" he said. He'd had a stress reaction in his left foot as a junior, and he'd broken his right foot as a senior. ""I didn't know who was gonna take a chance on, you know, a big that had foot problems in college.""

Was Wade lucky to have landed in the right spot? It seems so, as it has certainly worked out for him. But the Cavs were lucky to sign him six years ago, too. ""I don't know if I'm right, but if he doesn't get hurt his junior year, he might've been a lottery pick, honestly,"" Korn said. Kansas State got to the Elite Eight that season despite the fact that Wade barely played in the NCAA Tournament. What if he had starred on the national stage and led the team to the Final Four?

In the fourth quarter of the Cavs' win against the Milwaukee Bucks on March 9, Wade made two corner 3s and guarded Giannis Antetokounmpo on the other end. It was their 14th victory in a row (the streak snapped 16 last week), and Atkinson told reporters that having the flexibility to put Wade on the former MVP was ""very important,"" as it allowed them to have another big man roam behind him. Wade is the rare role player who can contain the ball on the perimeter, protect the rim, make open 3s and maintain advantages on offense. Everything about Cleveland suits him, but the appeal of that skill set is that it would work anywhere.

""Dean's that guy,"" Korn, who now coaches Southern Missouri State University (SEMO), said. ""He could go play for the Cavs, he could go play for the Knicks, he could go play for the Lakers, he could play for K-State, he could play for Kansas, he could play for SEMO. He's a plug-and-play guy.""

With only a month remaining before the 2024 NFL Draft, the widespread expectation is that University of Miami quarterback Cam Ward will be the No. 1 overall pick. The main question seems to be whether the Tennessee Titans will stick at No. 1 overall or decide to trade the pick.

On Monday, Ward hoped to put that discussion to rest. Miami held its Pro Day on Monday afternoon, and of course, Ward's throwing session was the main event. And after a throw to tight end Elijah Arroyo while rolling out to his left, Ward let the Titans know about his plans.

“I said I'm solidifying it today. I made sure they heard it.”Cam Ward tells us on @nflnetwork his message to Titans prez Chad Brinker and GM Mike Borgonzi in middle of pro day after dime throw: pic.twitter.com/kPXCHM5OuI

While there was another highlight throw later on in the workout, this somewhat more under-control frozen rope to Arroyo was the throw after which Ward let Tennessee brass hear what he had to say.

All 32 teams showed up at Miami's Pro Day to see Ward and Co. get in their workout, but the Titans were obviously the headliners. They had their general manager, head coach, offensive coordinator and more in the building to watch Ward throw live for the first time.

""They finally got to see me throw in person. That should be all they need to see,"" Ward said. ""At the end of the day, if they want to give me the pick or not, I'm going to be happy with whatever team I go to. I just want to play football.""

If he is indeed the top selection in the draft, Ward will be the first Hurricane picked first overall since Russell Maryland back in 1991, and the first Miami quarterback picked No. 1 since Vinny Testaverde in 1987.

Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is one of the NBA's most durable players. He has missed only six games this season and has never missed more than eight in a single season. However, freak accidents can happen in the NBA, and unfortunately, Tatum was hit with one in the third quarter of Boston's 113-95 win over the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

Tatum had the ball behind the arc and was defended by Kings big man Domantas Sabonis. Seeing the mismatch, Tatum went up for a 3-pointer. Sabonis attempted to contest him, but stuck his foot into Tatum's landing zone. Tatum landed on that foot and immediately crumpled to the floor in pain. 

I hope Jayson Tatum is OK pic.twitter.com/WrdK6qxn8N

Tatum went to the locker room from there and did not return with what the Celtics called a left ankle sprain. After the game, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said Tatum seemed ""to be doing OK"" and was icing the ankle. Tatum was not made available to reporters but was not wearing a boot on the affected foot. 

The foul on Sabonis was a flagrant-1 based on a rule that came about as the result of a similar play. In the 2017 Western Conference finals, Kawhi Leonard got hurt when Zaza Pachulia closed out into his landing zone, so when a defender steps under an airborne shooter, it is now considered a flagrant. Tatum remained in the game for his free throws but exited from there.

Fortunately for both Tatum and the Celtics, Boston has little left to play for in the regular season. Tatum has already reached 65 games, so he is eligible for an All-NBA selection. Boston, meanwhile, trails Cleveland by five games for the No. 1 seed and leads New York by seven in the loss column for the No. 3 seed. With 10 games to go before the postseason, the Celtics are basically assured the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, so they can afford to be cautious with Tatum as they assess this injury.

Still, Boston needs Tatum at full strength for the postseason, and ankle sprains can be tricky. A lower ankle sprain can be managed over the course of a few weeks. A high-ankle sprain takes longer, and then there is the severity of the sprain to consider. 

For now, all Boston can do is hope that Tatum's sprain won't linger into the playoffs.

Monday night was supposed to be a chance for the home crowd to celebrate the (1) USC Trojans, as they were heavily favored against (9) Mississippi State. However, four minutes into the game, disaster struck when JuJu Watkins fell to the floor in agony after being fouled in transition, and the mood shifted dramatically inside the Galen Center. 

Watkins was carried off of the floor with what was later reported to be a torn ACL, and while it seemed to just be an unfortunate injury, the emotions of seeing their star player injured had the USC crowd and bench upset, and Mississippi State became the outlet for them. The crowd booed loudly every time Mississippi State had the ball and the injury seemed to galvanize the Trojans as they jumped out to a 28-8 lead after the first quarter, with Kiki Iriafen stepping into the starring role. 

The game remained physical and tense throughout despite it being a blowout. USC's Malia Samuels hit the floor hard after a foul at the rim, leading coach Lindsay Gottlieb to glare over at the Bulldog bench after going out to check on her. At the end of USC's 96-59 win, the two teams met in the customary handshake line and some players had to be separated after exchanging words. 

Words are exchanged between USC and Mississippi State during handshake line following USC's win which saw JuJu Watkins injured pic.twitter.com/52otJrJk8c

It was pretty clear USC felt Mississippi State's physicality crossed a line, while the Bulldogs would defend it as hard-nosed basketball. It's hard to blame the Trojans for being upset given they saw their best player suffer a season-ending injury, and because it happened on a foul, Mississippi State became the target of their anger and frustration. 

""We don't play to hurt, we play to compete and that's just an unfortunate situation. There was no harm, and I hope us as a society, I know social media can be ugly, that you understand that the other lady that was involved that's on my team is a woman of class,"" Mississippi State coach Sam Purcell said after the game. ""She's comes from a family too of loving parents, I'm sure she is remorseful and obviously didn't want to have that happen. I hope that we understand as a society that it was a thoughtful apology and don't take it further than it needs to. On behalf of the Bulldogs, again, we're praying for her recovery because she's the ultimate competitor and we want to see her back on that court.""

Filed under:

The Titans said they'd take a ‘generational talent' at No. 1. They lied.

With just under a month until the 2025 NFL Draft we now have a pretty good idea of who the Titans are going to take with the No. 1 overall pick. All signs are pointing to Miami QB Cam Ward having his name called first, with the Titans spending ample time with Ward at his pro day on Monday, paired with the obligatory dinner with the prospect — all things that happen when a team is zeroing in on a player.

As a result Ward is now the runaway favorite to be the No. 1 pick, being given -750 odds on Fanduel, with Abdul Carter being the next-closest pick at +500. 

Selecting Ward is the obvious pick. The clear selection. It's also absolutely the wrong move, and the Titans are going to screw this up. What will ensue is a spin campaign to talk up Ward, and the Titans desperately try to move away from their now-infamous comment that the team would not pass on a “generational talent” with the No. 1 pick. Actually they'll pass on two in Abdul Carter and Travis Hunter, instead reaching for arguably the worst quarterback prospect taken with a No. 1 overall pick — maybe ever.

None of this is to say that Ward will be a bad NFL quarterback. In fact, there's every chance he could be quite good. The problem is that you don't draft “quite good” with the No. 1 pick. You have to find a transformative talent that can turn a franchise around, and Cam Ward simply isn't it — but this is patently on brand for a Titans team adept at whiffing on skill position players with their early picks. 


    Related
  

Despite having four general managers in the last two decades, the Titans can only boast early round success with three skill position players since 2005: RB Chris Johnson in 2008, RB Derrick Henry in 2016, and WR A.J. Brown in 2019. The rest is a veritable who's-who of mediocrity.

Bad teams aren't created simply by making bad draft picks, but also consistently finding mediocrity. While the Titans have been quite good at drafting linemen and linebackers to bolster their system, something has been consistently rotten with this team's skill position scouting, which leads the organization to taking big bets on players that have no business being taken as high as they do.

The biggest issue with the Marcus Mariota pick a decade ago was that Mariota was a scheme-dependent quarterback who had the physical tools, but we really had no idea if he had the ability to translate into the NFL after playing in an QB-friendly Oregon offense. That never materialized, so he struggled.

This is exactly the issue with Cam Ward as well. A player who was functionally fine, but spent his entire college career running an Air Raid in Washington State and Miami. It's an offensive system that routinely puts up big college numbers and lets a QB show off — but players routinely fail who come out of Air Raids into the pros. Now one is going to go with the No. 1 overall pick.

This quote from Ward is also setting off some major alarm bells. 

“I just think the playbooks match up not only for there, but Cleveland and New York. A lot of those three teams did the same things that we did in Miami. So I think it'll be plug and play.”

While it's clear Ward himself is trying to talk about his play in a way that he can solidify his draft spot, I also really, really hope he doesn't believe this to be true. There are no similarities between the West Coast offenses those three NFL teams run, and the Air Raid he led in Miami. It won't be “plug and play,” but take a significant amount of work to learn an NFL system. If a young QB is downplaying how difficult it's going to be, well, that concerns me.

There's also simply a raw talent issue here too. Ward would be the worst quarterback prospect taken in the Top 3 based on the NFL's scouting reports since the league posted its own talent grades in 2011.

Granted this is just one talent evaluator's rubric — but it's simply astonishing to see what an outlier Ward is among his peers who were taken with top picks in the last 15 years. There's certainly nothing to indicate that he's a “generational talent,” like the Titans assured everyone they were going to be taking with the No. 1 overall pick.

This is where this all gets tricky. Obviously quarterback is the single most-impactful upgrade the Titans can make. Hell, last year they benched Will Levis and played Mason Rudolph for god's sake. The issue is that while Ward might make Tennessee a better team immediately, they're once again losing sight of the forest for the trees. A truly generational talent, someone like Abdul Carter or Travis Hunter might not lead to more wins immediately — but they're without a doubt the best possible players. Guys who can help build a foundation for success. From there the team can look to strike in a much better QB draft as we'll see in 2026, when Arch Manning, Garrett Nussmeier, and Drew Allar will enter the NFL.

Instead the Titans are going to make the same mistake as they did a decade ago in taking Marcus Mariota. Waiting for his to blossom, then realizing it wasn't going to happen. It wasn't just that Mariota wasn't good, but it led to the Titans trying to put talent around him in 2017, hoping he could still be great. In that draft Tennessee took WR Corey Davis with the No. 5 overall pick. The next QB off the board that could have been theirs? Patrick Mahomes.

This is going to be a mess, no matter how the Titans try to spin this pick.

Let's grade the biggest men's college basketball coaching hires so far.

Only college sports has the offseason start while the postseason is still going on. Men's college basketball is feeling that in a big way right now, with tons of coaching hires and transfer portal additions happening at the same time as the 2025 NCAA tournament trims its field to the Sweet 16.

The coaching carousel is already in full swing with some of the openings already being filled by power conference teams. Will Wade was agreeing to a deal with NC State hours before his McNeese Cowboys team won their first NCAA tournament game in program history. Texas made a surprising coaching moves days after being eliminated from March Madness, while Indiana and Iowa acted quickly to fill their openings.

The coaching hires are just getting started in men's college basketball, and there's bound to be more surprising openings over the next month. Let's grade the hires made during this first wave and set early expectations for the coaches at new programs going forward.

Coaching the Indiana Hoosiers should be one of the best jobs in college basketball on paper. Indiana has tradition, it has deep NIL pockets, and it has a rabid fanbase. Anyone who could return the Hoosiers to glory would be an icon in Bloomington forever, but after 20+ years of disappointment, that's easier said than done.

The home run hire for Indiana was never going to come to fruition. The decision is hire Darian DeVries feels more like trying to hit a double. DeVries can get results: he made the NCAA tournament three times in his last four seasons at Drake in a one-bid league. He should have made the tournament in his first season at West Virginia this year but got screwed by the Selection Committee. The nice thing about hiring DeVries is he already comes with a star player: his son Tucker DeVries will certainly be following his dad to Indiana for his fifth season of college basketball. He's the type of big wing shooter Indiana desperately needed the last couple years.

The minimum for DeVries' tenure should be making the NCAA tournament every year. I think he can do that with the resources he'll have at Indiana. It's hard to predict big success when he's never won an NCAA tournament game, though much of that could be attributed to the randomness of March. Mark Pope had never won a tournament game either when Kentucky hired him, and now he's in the Sweet 16. This feels like an okay hire, if still a little underwhelming. 

Grade: B

It's going to be odd to see someone other than Fran McCaffery on the sidelines for Iowa men's basketball after a 15-year tenure. New hire Ben McCollum parlayed one great season at Drake into a Big Ten job after spending 15 years himself coaching DII Northwest Missouri State. 

Northwest Missouri State was a powerhouse under McCollum with four DII national championships. All Drake did was go 31-4 in his first season and win an NCAA tournament game over Missouri. The big question for the start of McCollum's tenure is if he can convince star point guard Bennett Stirtz to join him in Iowa City. Stirtz was a stud for McCollum at Northwest Missouri State and morphed into the best mid-major player in the country at Drake. He has real NBA draft interest, and could start a major NIL bidding war if he returns to college and tests the market. 

It's risky hiring a DII coach with one year of DI experience for a Big Ten job. If McCollum brings Stirtz with him, Iowa can compete for an NCAA tournament spot next season. Even if he doesn't, the Hawkeyes should be patient with McCollum, because his system gets great results. This feels like a high-risk, high-reward hire, but I love it for Iowa.

When Will Wade was fired from LSU back in 2022, college basketball was a totally different landscape. Wade was canned for his connections to the sport's sweeping FBI investigation, and spent the last two years rebuilding his reputation at McNeese, where he led the program to its first ever NCAA tournament victory this year with a surprising win over Clemson.

Wade's “strong-ass offers” will be totally legal these days. NC State should have plenty of resources to build a contender in a weak ACC coming off a shocking Final Four run in 2023. Wade has proven he can identify talent even at the lower levels, and he gets them to buy into a defense-first system which relies heavily on athleticism and switching principles. I trust him to get talent, and I trust him to coach it up.

The Wolfpack should be a top-5 program in the ACC year-in and year-out if the resources are there. Other programs like Indiana might have been scared of Wade's baggage, but those worries should be buried in the past. Wade gets the job done, providing both a high floor and high ceiling for NC State going forward.

Poor Xavier has now seen Sean Miller leave twice. The last time it happened, Miller was landing five-star recruits and regularly making the second weekend of the tournament at Arizona. He might still be in Tucson if the Wildcats never got entangled in the old FBI investigation. 

Miller should have elite resources at Texas just as he did at Arizona, pending what happens with revenue sharing. That makes this a promising hire. The Longhorns have never had a problem landing McDonald's All-Americans, with a lineage that stretches from Kevin Durant to Tre Johnson. Miller will get them playing defense at a high-level, and he got Xavier to take a lot more threes than usual this season, too.

Texas is always going to be considered a sleeping giant in basketball. Miller might not be a home run hire at this stage of his career, but he's still a good pick with plenty of years in coaching left at 56 years old. 

Grade: B+

Ryan Odom gave Virginia the greatest embarrassment in college basketball history when he led No. 16 seed UMBC over the Cavaliers' No. 1 seed back in 2018. Now Odom is headed to UVA after a successful stop at VCU that saw him dominate the Atlantic-10 this past season.

Virginia is still reeling from Tony Bennett's surprise retirement before the season. There was a reason Bennett hung it up at 55 years old: he didn't think Virginia could maintain its impressive results in the new era of college basketball, where NIL money is king. Can Odom get better resources than Bennett had at the end of his tenure? If not, it's going to be hard to get better results, though the ACC being down does allow for some upward mobility.

Odom just knows how to coach. He got Utah State into the tournament in back-to-back years before making the big dance in two out of his three seasons at VCU. He's been known to recruit international players, and that could be a big help again if Virginia can't win bidding wars for top transfers. Anyone would have a hard time living up to Bennett's legacy without top NIL dollars, but Odom has been successful everywhere he's been, and that makes me think he'll figure it out one way or another.

Grade: A-

Minnesota men's basketball is never going to be an easy job, but it feels like the program made the best possible hire with Niko Medved. The Minneapolis native graduated from the school in 1997 and has been building his resume as one of the sport's best mid-major coaches ever since. 

Medved made the NCAA tournament in three of his last four years at Colorado State, where he produced pros like David Roddy and Nique Clifford. Medved finally got his first NCAA tournament win this year, and he should have had another one if not for Derik Queen's buzzer-beater for Maryland. 

Medved's offensive sets were beautiful to watch at their best at Colorado State. He has a tough jump in front of him trying to compete in the Big Ten, but if anyone can do it at Minnesota, it feels like it's him. 

Grade: A

Filed under:

What teams fit for the top 10 prospects in this class, schematically?

One thing that goes underrated when it comes to the NFL Draft and draft process is how important schematic fit is. Of course, there are prospects who are more scheme-diverse (the Travis Hunters of the world), but in order to optimize those guys, being in the right scheme and correct system can turn them from a very good player to one of the best in the world.

I think the 2025 draft class is a really good example of guys who can be good in certain schemes or teams. Using the top 10 from my post-NFL Combine big board, we'll break down the best schematic fits for each guy at the top of the class, regardless of draft position.

I know this one might seem like a copout, but the Titans have a great scheme and need for a guy like Carter on their team. Carter wins with speed and violence around the corner, which can be mobilized in Tennessee where there's already a prominent interior pass rusher such as DT Jeffrey Simmons. With Harold Landry III in New England, the EDGE depth is lacking in Tennessee, which frees up an Abdul Carter-sized hole on the outside.

The Packers are in a spot where they could use more production from their cornerback spot, but a sneaky need for them is at wide receiver. They have nobody on the outside who can stay healthy or consistently catch passes. Enter Hunter, who could be the solution at both corner or receiver. I love Hunter as a corner, where his ball skills and instincts just make much more sense so he can make impact plays on defense. CB Jaire Alexander might be on his way out of Green Bay, and the Packers need a CB1. Hunter is the ideal fit there.

In what might be the dream fit of all dream fits, Jeanty to Chicago makes far too much sense. The Bears' RB room has guys who aren't exactly impact players. D'Andre Swift is a boom or bust style of back, and Roschon Johnson is more of a thumper than a home-run hitter. Jeanty can do both, a tackle-breaking machine who can be explosive as a runner and receiver. Behind a revamped offensive line, Jeanty could instantly take off in the NFL.

I think Graham can be scheme-versatile, a wrecking ball who uses leverage and technique to win on the interior despite shorter arms. However, he's at his best in a four-down defense where he can just fire off the ball and win as a penetrating three-technique. The 49ers have been looking for a player like Graham, a guy who can impact the run game and get vertical push as a pass rusher at defensive tackle. 

With new Jets' OC Tanner Engstrand coming from Detroit, I think they could be in the market to find their own Sam LaPorta, a guy who can create matchup problems by being a plus blocker and an impactful receiver as well. Warren is a monster after the catch and has a wide catch radius that'll help him in the toughest areas of the field. Jeremy Ruckert and Stone Smartt are the top two tight ends on the roster right now; not exactly a great start for the position in New York. Warren instantly adds a boost there.

I think Starks has been a victim of some draft fatigue, but he's an incredibly versatile player who went from playing on the roof at Georgia in 2023 to being more of a nickel and playing man coverage in 2024 without missing too many beats. Starks' versatility and ball production just makes too much sense in Baltimore, where he can either play the nickel with Kyle Hamilton as the deep safety, or let Hamilton go back to the nickel and let Starks play deep.

This was the first team-prospect fit I thought about when making this story. Bucs' HC Todd Bowles loves versatility from his defenders in the front seven, and Walker might be one of the most versatile defensive prospects in the entire draft. He's a hammer coming downhill, and I think he can survive on the edge despite not having ideal length at the position. Bowles can move Walker around from the outside to off the ball, very similarly to what the Commanders do with LB Frankie Luvu, and in that some of the pass rush woes the Bucs have had will be helped along with their issues off the ball.

The Panthers were one of the worst teams in the NFL at defending the run last season, especially along the edge. They didn't really address the spot too heavily in free agency, but Stewart makes a lot of sense here. While he's not a perfect prospect, his blend of speed and power along with his strength defending the run would fit nicely in Carolina. Plus, he'll be playing out wide where he can continue to develop as a pass rusher.

Johnson and the Dolphins is a fit that I think makes a whole lot of sense. After CB Jalen Ramsey, the Dolphins cornerback room is in very dire straits. With Johnson's physicality and instincts in quarters and cover 2 types of defenses, he can make a lot of plays on the ball just like he did at Michigan. Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver is a disciple of Mike Macdonald, and with Johnson having success in those kinds of defenses it makes too much sense to link the two.

Finding a great fit for Campbell can be a little tough, because while Campbell can be a good tackle, he might be a phenomenal guard on the interior. A team that could use his versatility at any spot could be the best for him; let him try being a tackle and then kick him inside to guard if it doesn't work out. 

Enter the Houston Texans, who need help almost everywhere along the offensive front. Campbell is a technically sound player with incredible core strength, and profiles as one of the best pass protectors in the class. I think adding a player like Campbell to the Texans can help fill any holes at tackle or guard, but it gives Houston an impact player up front.

Tim Sherwood is understood to have sparked Sky Sports warning email after Man City “picked up the phone”, according to one expert.

An independent commission hearing to examine 115 charges laid by the Premier League against Man City started in September and ended in December 2024.

The Premier League opened an investigation into Man City way back in 2018 and after a number of legal delays, charges were finally laid in February 2023 and the club were referred to an independent commission.

The charges against the Citizens relate to the requirement to accurately report financial information, including around the value of sponsorship deals, the submission of details of manager and player pay information and to a club's responsibility as a Premier League member to adhere to UEFA's financial regulations and to the league's own profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).

They are also accused of failing to co-operate with the league's investigation. In all, there are charges relating to every season between 2009-10 and 2022-23.

It is believed that the outcome will be revealed soon and a report last week claimed that Sky Sports ‘have urged their pundits not to ‘make snap judgements' and to ‘stick to the facts' before commenting on the forthcoming verdict'.

The report added:

‘They have warned that both sides may claim victory regardless of the outcome and have reminded the likes of Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher and Roy Keane that any verdict and potential punishment could be subject to an appeal.

‘The email asks recipients to allow themselves ‘sufficient time to digest the outcome' and to direct viewers to Sky Sports News for further information and reaction.

‘Mail Sport understands that the move is aimed at ensuring that the broadcaster is accurate, fair and balanced in its reporting and avoids any controversy in what is an incredibly sensitive matter.'

And now former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson reckons it was all triggered by comments by former Tottenham boss Sherwood recently, which Sky Sports had to apologise for live on air.

Borson told Football Insider: “This is going to be a big challenge for everybody to figure out how to cover the story just because of how difficult the decision might be to digest for the public.

“I think all they're trying to say is let's not effectively say things that are immediately contradicted by the actual decision because we're just going to look quite silly and have to potentially reverse our position on some of this stuff.

“I think this might have been triggered by something that was said recently on Soccer Saturday by Tim Sherwood.

“He made some comments on there, which they literally had to apologise for during the show.

“I suspect that was because City picked up the phone and said ‘There is a limit. There is the opportunity for fair comment in terms of discussing these matters, but there is an obligation to be fair to the club in terms of the way that it's reported'.

“I think that's what's in the background. It is a perfectly reasonable view as to fairness.”

Raducanu on feeling competitive and happy off court

Emma Raducanu has, by her own admission, never been afraid to do things ""a little bit differently"".

So it feels on brand that the British number two has reached the first WTA 1,000 quarter-final of her career without a full-time coach.

Raducanu secured her fourth win in a row at the Miami Open by beating American 17th seed Amanda Anisimova on Monday.

It is the first time the 22-year-old has strung together that many victories in one tournament since the 2021 US Open - when she sealed a fairytale triumph as a teenage qualifier.

""I'd say I'm a bit of a free spirit so I don't need restrictions or being told what to do,"" Raducanu, ranked 60th in the world, said.

""I think when I'm being really authentic, that's when I'm playing my best.""

As she prepares to play US Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wednesday's quarter-final, BBC Sport analyses how Raducanu is thriving without a full-time coach.

Emma Raducanu is set to regain her place in the world's top 50 after the Miami Open

Whether it has been winning a Grand Slam title as an unknown rookie, employing a carousel of coaches, or tailoring her schedule outside of the accepted norm, Raducanu regularly does what she thinks is right for her.

That doesn't always work out for the best, but she continues to stay true to her convictions.

Ending a short-lived partnership with Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of this tournament was another decision which was initially met by surprise.

But her run on the hard courts in Miami - a faster surface which suits her style - suggests the move has paid off.

Raducanu has played with a freedom and confidence only seen sporadically since her stunning US Open success.

""I feel when I am boxed into a regimented way then I am not able to express myself in the same way,"" Raducanu told Sky Sports.

In Florida she has been guided by Mark Petchey - a well-known figure in British tennis circles who worked with her as a teenager.

Petchey, who used to coach Andy Murray in his salad days on the ATP Tour, has been giving pointers on the practice courts and offering coaching advice from Raducanu's box.

Petchey has been working alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue and fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura.

What Raducanu describes as a ""different approach"" has brought an emphasis on having fun at the right times, with shorter, less intense practice and warm-up sessions.

""This week has been a great eye-opener to just when I'm happy and expressive and myself,"" Raducanu said.

""Having people that I've known for a very long time, since before the US Open, is the most valuable thing for this week at least.""

Raducanu's chopping and changing of coaches has been well documented - and the reasons behind their departures have varied.

In 2023, after splitting with a fifth coach in two years, Raducanu believed her ""provoking"" and ""challenging"" questions went some way to explaining the high turnover.

When she came back from wrist and ankle surgeries in 2024, the Briton turned to a trusted figure in childhood coach Nick Cavaday.

He provided stability and a solid sounding board, but the partnership ended in January when he stepped down because of a health issue.

Raducanu's father Ian secured the services of Platenik, but her results in Miami without him have left some wondering if she even needs a full-time coach.

Examples of players competing for long periods of time without a coach are rare. A recent one is Nick Kyrgios, who reached the 2022 Wimbledon final. 

Never one to miss an opportunity to be provocative, the controversial Australian responded to Raducanu's run by calling coaches ""overrated"".

""People awfully quiet that Raducanu is winning now - where all the experts at now?"" Kyrgios posted on X.

Raducanu seems committed to finding a new full-time coach - but the availability of suitable candidates is limited with a third of the season gone.

Mark Petchey has been working with Raducanu in Miami alongside her long-time confidante Jane O'Donoghue

Raducanu's representatives describe Petchey - balancing the role in Miami with his work as a television commentator - as a ""familiar face"" who is providing ""support"".

It is not clear, though, how long the arrangement will go on for.

Former British number one Tim Henman, who has advised Raducanu over the years, believes Petchey's involvement ""makes sense"" given he knows ""Emma's game"".

""It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts for,"" said Henman, who will return to the coaching box himself at this year's Laver Cup as a vice-captain.

""Emma has been fairly vocal that she is comfortable switching coaches - and that's her prerogative. 

""I started playing professional tennis at the end of 1992 and finished in 2007. I had three coaches. 

""I liked the consistency and continuity of working with a coach for a period of time. It was right for me but that doesn't mean it is right for Emma.""

Questions have regularly been raised about Raducanu's resilience, given the amount of injuries and issues she has dealt with since her US Open win.

This season has also been challenging. A back injury disrupted her pre-season before a traumatic stalking experience in Dubai and then Cavaday's exit. 

The gritty manner in which she beat world number 10 Emma Navarro in the Miami second round answered some of the sceptics. 

She also showed steel to swat aside third-round opponent McCartney Kessler and Anisimova, who were both hampered physically.

Raducanu feels she has rediscovered her ""competitive spirit"", conceding: ""I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.""

Whatever she goes on to achieve in Florida, the next challenge is sustaining her level over a longer period - something she has so far been unable to do.

Henman points to Raducanu playing more tournaments - even though she lost six of nine matches before the Miami Open - as a reason behind her improved durability.

Raducanu has competed in seven events this year - more than she ever has in the opening three months of the season.

After Miami she will move back inside the world's top 50 for the first time since August 2022.

""It is easy to look at the results but I would look more at the journey of tournament play - that's a big, big positive,"" said Henman.

""There is no doubt in my mind she's a great player and should be back knocking on the door of the top 30, seeded at Slams and the top 20 if she stays healthy.""

Australia Air Force Pilots Also Heard Chinese Navy Live-Fire Warning on Radio

Reuters

By Kirsty Needham

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), monitoring a Chinese navy warship as it circumnavigated Australia last month, heard it warn it would use live fire in its exercises on a civilian radio broadcast, defence pilots said on Tuesday.

A People's Liberation Army Navy frigate conducted the unprecedented live-fire exercise in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand in February, causing 49 commercial flights to be rerouted.

China has said it gave adequate warning about the drill under international law, but Australian and New Zealand authorities said it fell short of best practice for notifications.

Commercial airlines first heard about the live-fire drill when a Virgin Australia pilot picked up a Chinese navy broadcast on the 121.5 MHz emergency radio channel.

Ahead of a national election due by May, opposition Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton criticised the Labor government for ""a situation where our national maritime surveillance was outsourced to a Virgin airline pilot"".

At the Australian International Airshow in Avalon on Tuesday, RAAF maritime surveillance pilots said Australia's P-8A Poseidon were flying ""high duration, high frequency sorties"" and monitoring the Chinese navy warship's transmissions on UHF and VHF at the time, in details that had not previously been made public.

""The transmissions that came through are just standard warnings of their positions as well as their intent of live-fire exercises,"" said P-8A Poseidon flying officer Patrick Makeham.

He described this as ""similar to saying that we will be conducting live firing exercise in those areas"".

Air Commodore Gus Porter, director-general of RAAF air combat capability, said the P-8A aircraft were used for anti-submarine warfare and to deter aggression.

""You don't need to be on top of a task group 24 hours a day to be tracking exactly what they are doing,"" he added.

The RAAF P-8A aircraft conduct routine surveillance patrols in international waters in the South China Sea, which China has criticised.

Australia last month complained to China over what it was ""unsafe and unprofessional"" actions by a Chinese fighter jet releasing flares within 30 metres (100 feet) of an Australian P-8A aircraft.

Tennis fans have condemned the ""terrible"" and ""disrespectful"" treatment that Alex de Minaur received from the crowd in his stunning win over Brazilian young gun Joao Fonseca at the Miami Open on Monday night. De Minaur dropped the first set before coming back to win 5-7 7-5 6-3 to advance to the Round of 16.

The Aussie World No.11 had to overcome a raucous crowd that was packed with Brazilians cheering on Fonseca, who has become a fan favourite in recent months amid a meteoric rise. Spectators were going wild for Fonseca all throughout the match, but they crossed the line with some of their treatment of de Minaur.

The Aussie had to stop his service motion a number of times because fans were yelling out, with many also cheering when he made an error or served a fault. Chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani asked fans to be more respectful on a number of occasions, and appeared to grow highly frustrated when he was ignored.

A number of boos also rang out around the Hard Rock Stadium when de Minaur sealed the victory on match point. The Aussie showed his class by applauding his 18-year-old opponent as he left the court.

Taking to social media, viewers blasted the ugly scenes and said the crowd had gotten out of control. One person wrote: ""I think the support that Fonseca is getting is really cool in one way, but cheering at a fault is kinda disgusting behaviour. And it's very satisfying to see a player win when the crowd is against them. Shout out Alex de Minaur.""

Another person commented: ""The crowd is being so disrespectful, it's been incredibly hard to watch. The most disruptive ones need to be kicked out because why are they allowed to yell consistently during de Minaur's service games?""

While a third added: ""A few matches ago this was fun but it's just becoming disrespectful. Both great players but you can see the noise getting to De Minaur.""

De Minaur won widespread praise for the way he handled the crowd and Fonseca to progress. ""A lot of it was mental and staying focused in the moment,"" said on court after the match. “There's no other way. You can go out there and complain and get rattled. You can do a lot of different things. But that won't help you win the match.

""Ultimately, that's what I told myself. It's gonna be a battle not only against the player, but against the crowd. Just put your head down, do the work, and try to compete every single point.”

The Aussie is attempting to find some form amid a worrying slump that has seen him slide from World No.6. The 18-year-old Fonseca is a staggering 27-5 in his last 32 matches - including four titles - but the Demon prevailed to face 29th seed Matteo Berrettini.

It was awful. It was an incredible match and the crowd couldn't even cheer for the winner.

Crowd was pathetic for cheering every first serve fault from De Minaur.

— DjDoug4ever (@djdoug4ever) March 25, 2025

Just incredible composure by De Minaur, especially with the questionable egging on of the crowd by Fonseca in the last gameHe'll remember that win (potentially because he won't be able to beat Fonseca that way again)

— Trenton Jocz (@TrentonJocz) March 25, 2025

God, how disrespectful Brazilians are to De Minaur... they don't even shut up when he's about to serve. What a shame.

— Devonne (@Dev0nne10) March 25, 2025

This crowd at De minaur vs Fonseca is terrible

— Homachi (@Oma_with_a_H) March 25, 2025

What do you guys think of the De Minaur vs Fonseca match? Fonseca is playing lights out but goodness, it's the worse crowd I've ever seen in my whole life and Fonseca is hyping them even more. Alex definitely feels it.

Earlier on Monday (local time), 'lucky loser' Adam Walton advanced to the Round of 16 to continue his stunning run at the ATP 1000 event. The stunned Australian beat Hong Kong wildcard Coleman Wong 7-6 (8-6) 4-6 6-4 to set up a duel with American third seed Taylor Fritz in what will be the biggest match of his life.

The 26-year-old Queenslander had been knocked out in the qualifying stages, but hung around hoping to snag a place as a 'lucky loser' should any of the other players drop out. No.21 seed Hubert Hurkacz then withdrew with injury, and because the Pole had a bye in the first round, Walton replaced him and was sent straight into the second round.

He then beat Italian player Luciano Darderi, before knocking off Wong to make the last 16. ""I'm very happy right now, it's just very good fortune this week,"" Walton said. ""I got thrashed in qualifying and got the call three days later to play again, it almost feels like a new start, a new tournament. I'm just happy to be through to the last 16.""

Meanwhile, top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to beat fellow Aussie Jordan Thompson 7-5 6-4. The German World No.2 was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.

Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his haul of seven Masters 1000 titles. ""Jordan made it difficult for me for sure. He's a quality player,"" said Zverev. ""When you're in rhythm, he knows how to break it a little bit. So he did extremely well today. I'm happy with my level from 1-4 onwards.""

Grant Ellis has given out his final rose.

After being torn between his final two, Juliana and Litia, on the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor, the 31-year-old broke up with Litia, 31, and got engaged to Juliana, 28 — but not without a little drama.

“I love you very much. I want to give you everything you deserve, but I'm not your person,” Grant told Litia on proposal day. “I'm sorry that it got to this point. My emotional connection is farther somewhere else.”

“When did it change?” she replied.



“It didn't change. I do love you — I don't want you to feel like I haven't been open or honest,” he said. “I hope you don't look at me differently.”

“Well, I do, for sure,” Litia fired back, noting that Juliana is a “beautiful person” who should have “a lot of questions” about Grant based on how things played out.

As he walked Litia to her car, Grant asked if he'd been misleading. “The switch-up is crazy,” she replied. “I'm disappointed. … I just want to be so clear that I'm confused and I'm sad. And I'm mad.”

During the live portion of the show, Litia claimed that Grant said during their dates that he could “stop the show right now” because he was so sure Litia was his “No. 1 emotional connection.”

When Grant jointed her on stage, she revealed more details — hinting that Grant “said a lot” during overnights and revealing that he gave her a journal to write down her feelings during their time on the show for them to read at the end. He apologized for speaking with such confidence and speaking “too soon.” Litia shot back and said there was “no transparency” from Grant that he was conflicted.

Back in the Dominican Republic, Juliana arrived and told Grant that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.

“Through this whole journey, you've been someone who has inspired me,” Grant said. “I truly believe that you are somebody who is my best friend and I'm so grateful for our journey. … I'll be there for you as your man, as your friend, as your partner. Juliana, will you marry me?”

Juliana said “a million times yes” as she cried tears of joy.

Earlier in the episode, Grant said “I love you” to both women (he first told Litia during last week's episode) after they met his parents. He was subsequently torn over who to pick. “I went to bed last night thinking I knew what I wanted, but I woke up and realized I don't,” he told the cameras. “I feel alone and I have to make a decision. … I don't know.”

As he struggled, Grant's dad came to see him — and told him to go with his heart. “I'm just scared that when I leave here, things will be different,” Grant said, to which his dad reminded him that his fears were normal but not a reason to be scared to make a choice.

Grant's agony over his final pick has been teased all season, with host Jesse Palmer hinting that it got down to the wire. In his Us cover story last month, Grant shed light on what was going through his mind as he struggled with his decision.

“It definitely wasn't [down to] one hour,” he said of the show making it seem like he made his decision at the final moment. “There were external factors that played into me being hesitant. You don't wanna hurt people. You have a lot of weight in terms of being a lead of a different ethnic group. There's a different level of pressure that comes with being a man of color in this role — and a different expectation. It leads to some added thinking that deserves a little extra time. There were some things that really weighed and were hard for me.”

He added, “But ultimately, you go with what makes you happy and you go with what you feel is gonna be the best decision for your future.”

For Grant, he hopes his future includes two kids.

“Preferably a boy and a girl. But if I have two girls or two boys, it doesn't matter,” he said, adding that he's willing to relocate for his partner. “If things play out the way they should, I'll do whatever is gonna make us happy, whether that's me moving or us traveling or us getting another piece of property. I'm willing to go that distance.”

While he's caught some heat on social media for falling in love with both women, Grant is confident he handled things the best way he could.

“I don't live with regret. I'm very happy, and I wouldn't have it any other way,” he said at the time. “If I could rewind time, I would make the same decision.”

The Bachelor finale continues with After the Final Rose on ABC.

Bachelor Grant Ellis was joined by new fiancée Juliana Pasquarosa during the live portion of the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor.

Despite a tense proposal day — which saw Grant, 31, very torn between Juliana, 28, and Litia Garr — the couple confirmed they still going strong.

“You've got to have fun with it because life is just too serious to take seriously,” Juliana said of the backlash and social media speculation about the ending. They later revealed that they are moving to Boston — and accepted a trip to Italy from ABC.

Both Grant and Juliana's parents were in the audience to support the couple. “It's been a blast,” Juliana's dad told host Jesse Palmer. “We're excited to get the two families together, finally.”



Earlier on Monday, Bachelor Nation saw Grant propose to Juliana.

“I truly believe that you are somebody who is my best friend and I'm so grateful for our journey,” he told her, before getting down on one knee. “When you're going through the toughest times in your life, I want you to know you don't have to go through it alone. I'll be there for you as your man, as your friend and as your partner.”

Before the engagement, Grant told both Juliana and Litia, 31, that he loved them — and the two contestants dropped the L-bomb back. On proposal day, Litia was shocked when Grant ended things, accusing him of misleading her. Grant and Litia reunited at the live portion of the Monday episode, where she claimed he said he could “stop the show” early because he knew she was his No. 1.

Grant apologized as Litia declared, “Every woman deserves to have a man who's going to choose her without a shadow of a doubt.”

Prior to the finale night drama, Grant had gushed to Us Weekly about his connection with Juliana, a client service associate from Newton, Massachusetts.

“From night one, we really connected over our love of playing the piano. We always had that physical chemistry, and then we started to really develop an emotional connection,” he told Us. “Every relationship was different, but that was a relationship that really developed over time.”

While Juliana didn't have a one-on-one date until the second half of the season, he still tried to make her feel special.

“Group dates are always difficult. It's really awkward. It's not every day [in real life that] you're going on a group date,” he said. “But you make eye contact, check in and make sure you let the person know that you gave them reassurance that you're thinking about them — and hopefully your words don't get misinterpreted.”

The Bachelor franchise is set to return with Bachelor in Paradise this summer.

Despite years of experience coaching on The Voice, Adam Levine wasn't prepared for this talented battle round.

During the Monday, March 24, episode of NBC's singing competition series, viewers watched Conor James and Tinika Wyatt get paired up to perform a unique rendition of “How Deep Is Your Love” by The Bee Gees.

“Tinika is sneaky amazing. She's so good,” Adam, 46, shared in a confessional interview before his two contestants took to the stage. “Conor's sheer ability — the range, the tone, there's a million things I could say — I wish I could keep everybody, but unfortunately I can't. I think this will be a tough one.”

The Maroon 5 frontman was quickly reminded that coaching contestants on The Voice isn't for the weak.



After Conor and Tinika sang their hearts out, fellow coach Kelsea Ballerini called it her “favorite battle” of the season. Michael Bublé said he couldn't choose a winner because he loved them both so much.

And while John Legend gave a slight edge to Conor, he admitted, “It's going to be hard to say” a favorite.

When host Carson Daly made the announcement that it was time for Adam to pick his winner, the “Moves Like Jagger” singer expressed just how difficult the decision was.

“Both of you guys, it's just energy I want to be around,” he said. “Having to make this choice sucks particularly badly because I don't want to be without either one of you guys.”

“Tinika came in here and made my life hell because it would be a loss not to have you,” he continued. “It would be a horrible spot. From the bottom of my heart, you guys are both incredible.”

After careful thought and consideration, Adam picked Conor as the winner of the battle and reiterated his belief that the contestant could win the whole show.

“I had to pick Conor just because Conor has a unicorn quality to him,” Adam explained in a confessional. “The dude can sing anything and make it feel like it means something special.”

In an unexpected twist, Kelsea, 31, chose to steal Tinika in the final moments of the episode. As a result, Adam's former contestant was not eliminated from the competition after all.

“With my steal, I just wanted to feel something,” the country singer said. “Hearing her voice, I just knew. Tinika adds a level of soul to Team Kelsea that I'm very excited about.”

The Voice airs on NBC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Stream old episodes anytime on Peacock.

Jennifer Coolidge opened up about how she was stuck in a typecasting rut before The White Lotus and her new film Riff Raff.

“When I did Best in Show for the longest time, I was just offered these sort of trophy wife parts over and over,” the actress exclusively told Us Weekly. “There would be scripts at my front doorstep. And I'd pick 'em up and I'd be like, ‘Ah, I know exactly what these are gonna be.'”

Coolidge's intuition was right on the money as most of the offers coming her way had a similar theme.

“And sure enough, a lot of 'em were just sort of the same woman and a rich guy, spoiled wife being offered continually as if that was all I could do,” she confessed.



As Coolidge hoped to find variety in her projects, she found game-changing success with The White Lotus. Coolidge played Tanya McQuoid on Mike White's critically acclaimed HBO anthology series, the only character to return for both seasons 1 and 2 of the show, and a role that earned her multiple Emmys.

Coolidge then got the offer for Riff Raff, the crime comedy drama which also stars Ed Harris, Pete Davidson, Gabrielle Union, Lewis Pullman, Bill Murray and more. Coolidge portrays Harris' “self destructive” ex-wife, Ruth.

“I was so thrilled because I wouldn't have ever guessed, you know, especially with the way my career's been going,” she admitted. “I could be asked to be in Legally Blonde and in a movie like that. And then, you know, I would eventually be able to down the line be in something where it was so not Legally Blonde.”

The film follows Harris's character Vincent, a former criminal, as his idyllic life is turned upside down when his son (played by Pullman) and ex show up for a messy family reunion turned reckoning that forces him to face his past.

“Ruth was a part that I've never been offered before, someone like that, that was just really rough around the edges,” Coolidge said of the role. “I thoroughly enjoyed myself. [It was] really great getting to do just something different.”

The thriller (with hints of comedy) isn't a film Coolidge would have “normally” gotten the chance to do, she said, which made taking on the part even more attractive to the beloved star.

“I think it was the thriller side. I get cast in a lot of comedies. I really don't get offered roles like this,” she told Us. “White Lotus is comedic and dramatic at the same time, too. But I think this movie is even darker than White Lotus.”

In addition to showing off her acting range, Coolidge gushed about working with such a stellar cast.

“It was all quite intimidating, to be honest,” she said. “I've been very lucky and I've gotten to work with some really cool people. But I have to say I really did keep pinching myself when I was there filming. It never occurred to me that I would be able to work with these guys . I couldn't believe that I was able to work with these people that I've admired.”

Riff Raff is available to rent and purchase on demand now.

When it comes to playing a love interest for someone from the Wayans family, Essence Atkins is determined to catch them all.

“I just need to be Kim [Wayans'] love interest, and then I'll have the trifecta,” Atkins, 53, joked during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly. “I have been the love interest of all of them. So at this point, I feel kind of like an honorary member of the family.”

Atkins poked fun at how it also “feels a bit incestuous,” adding, “But not really. I love them so much and I love working with them. It's always such a pleasant, professional and fun experience. I would love to dispense it as medicine. Are you going through something difficult? Work with the Wayans — you'll feel better. It'll bring some healing to your soul.”



The actress currently stars on CBS' Poppa's House with Damon Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr., but it's a family affair behind the scenes with Kim Wayans and Damien Dante Wayans directing several episodes, Shawn Wayans and Michael Wayans being credited as writers and Marlon Wayans appearing in the Monday, March 24, episode as Damon Sr.'s onscreen brother.

Before Poppa's House, Atkins played Marlon's ex-wife on his short-lived sitcom and Shawn's girlfriend in Dance Flick.

“The truth of the matter is that it's always going to be an immediate yes when I hear ‘Wayans.' This is my sixth project with that family. I have met all of them at this point and worked with the majority of them,” she shared with Us. “I really wanted to work with Damon Wayans Jr. again [after Dance Flick] and I had always wanted to work with Damon Wayans, so that's really all I needed to know. It was an immediate yes.”

Poppa's House, which premiered in October 2024, follows legendary talk radio host Poppa (Damon Sr.), who has his point of view challenged at work when a new female cohost (Atkins) is hired. At home, Poppa finds himself still parenting his adult son (Damon Jr.), who is trying to pursue his passion while balancing the responsibilities associated with being a father and husband.

Atkins's Ivy has been introduced as a potential love interest for Damon Sr.'s Poppa — but she's not in a rush to see them get together.

“Initially when we were beginning the series, we thought it would happen sooner. But I think that there's something really beautiful about them becoming friends first and that they really grow in respect for one another and admiration for one another,” Atkins explained. “Also in being able to see behind the curtain of one another, they have a little bit more trepidation and a little bit more caution about leaping forward.”

Atkins noted that both Ivy and Poppa are starting to develop an “awareness” of their connection, adding, “He's gaining an awareness of like, ‘Well, what do I get? It looks good, but what does the inspection report say when you buy a home?' That's wisdom, and I think that that leads to a much more satisfying take when it actually happens. It won't feel so jumped or rushed.”

She continued: “These characters have earned this closeness. We've seen them grow on each other. We've seen them get on each other's nerves. I like the pace that we're continuing at. As far as how long it will take, I don't know. I definitely think that there'll be moments this season where you'll be rooting for it to happen.”

Poppa's House airs on CBS Mondays at 8:30 p.m. ET. New episodes stream the next day on Paramount+.

The legendary Michael Caine has thoughts about Taylor Swift.

“I think Taylor Swift is incredible, a giant star,” Caine, 92, said in his recently released book, Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life. “You know, she was a country singer to start with? And now she fills stadiums all over the world, with audiences of 100,000, and politicians are desperate for her to support them. That's extraordinary.”

Caine was interviewed by Matthew d'Ancona — he noted, “I've never done a book of interviews” — to share “life hacks” for the book, which was released in the United States on Tuesday, March 25. (Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life had its initial release in the U.K. late last year.)

Swift, 35, and her widespread success became a topic of conversation while Caine was discussing how the idea of “stardom” has changed during his years in the entertainment industry. (Anyone else dying to know which of Swift's songs Caine dubs his favorite?!)



“You can just tell how much hard work lies behind what she's achieved, too. It's no accident,” Caine said of the singer. “She has really earned her success, and it hasn't come overnight. She's down-to-earth, which is almost always part of it. Not spoiled by all the accolades and money. That's impressive.”

 

Caine agreed that “stardom is definitely different” now compared to the Golden Age of Hollywood, which included stars like John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart and Elizabeth Taylor, to name a few. (Some of these legendary stars, Caine has even worked with in the past.)

“People's attention is more divided than it used to be, there's more competition from all sorts of directions,” Caine continued. “There's not really the sense there used to be of the big cultural event of the week. So, there are definitely fewer actors and musicians whose name alone can guarantee a movie or a record will make money.”

He added: “But stardom is still stardom.”

This memoir is the eighth book written and released by Caine. The first few being trivia books before releasing his first memoir, What's It All About? An Autobiography in 1992. Following his 2023 retirement from acting, Caine decided to dip his toe in to fiction writing, releasing a mystery novel titled Deadly Game in December of that year.

Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life is out now.

Michael Caine's 70-plus years in Hollywood allowed him to form friendships with some major stars — and the actor has no qualms when it comes to sharing stories about them.

Caine's latest memoir (his eighth published book) Don't Look Back, You'll Trip Over: My Guide to Life was released in the United States on Tuesday, March 25, and features “life hacks” from the legendary star. While sharing tricks of the trade he's learned along the way, Caine couldn't help but spill the tea on his famous friends. (This book was initially released in the U.K. late last year.)

From anecdotes about working with Beyoncé to referring to the late Quincy Jones as his “celestial twin,” Caine has some pretty epic anecdotes up his sleeve.

Keep scrolling for stories from the actor about his famous friends:



Ledger worked with Caine on 2008's The Dark Knight, the second movie in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. Caine recalled the late Ledger as a “lovely guy, very gentle and unassuming,” but noted that the late star really turned it on when it became time to transform into The Joker.

“It was chilling. Absolutely floored me the first time I saw him in action – I was terrified!” Caine wrote of Ledger's portrayal, noting that the late star will be remembered as a “great actor.” Ledger died at age 28 from an accidental overdose in January 2007.

“You think of what he might have gone on to achieve, it's just heartbreaking. We were all terribly shocked, and it made doing the publicity for The Dark Knight that summer much more intense, because all the journalists wanted to talk about his death,” he recalled. “I was so pleased when he was awarded the posthumous Oscar, because it must have been at least some sort of comfort for his poor family. The truth is, we'd all hoped he would win an Academy Award and thought he should, even while we were still filming the movie.”

Caine worked with “the amazing” O'Toole in the 1959 stage show The Long and the Short and the Tall, and they struck up quite the friendship.

“We became great friends and one night he took me out on the Saturday after the show to get pissed. Which I did, as did he,” Caine recalled. “We woke up the next morning and we had no idea where we were. We were both fully clothed lying on top of a double bed.”

When they woke up, it was Monday!

Caine and Allen frequented the same restaurant and once, Farrow asked to meet the famed director.

“She said, ‘Well, if you're ever there and you see Woody Allen at another table, invite me along to dinner.' And so I did. Which is how they really met,” Caine recalled, noting elsewhere in the book that he didn't anticipate how things would end between them. (Farrow accused Allen in 1992 of molesting their adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow, which he has vehemently denied.)

Caine immediately clocked the late Jones as “a great person” when they first met. After Caine invited Jones to his birthday party, the two stars realized that they share a birth date and time.

“We call ourselves ‘celestial twins,'” Caine wrote, noting that it became “a bit of a tradition” for him and Jones to celebrate their milestone birthdays together.

“For our sixtieth birthdays in 1993, we had a great bash in L.A. Ice-T came along and challenged me to rap with him!” he recalled. “Then we had another great party for our eightieth in Vegas, with Stevie Wonder singing ‘Happy Birthday' and Chaka Khan doing the theme song from Alfie.”

Jones died in November 2024 but was still alive when Caine wrote this book.

“Those are amazing memories, to be cherished,” he wrote. “We had a sense of humor in common, and he was such easy company from the get-go. I think that's the heart of friendship, isn't it? You don't have to watch yourself and what you say, you can relax and be natural. When I say we are twins, I do mean that he feels like another brother to me. A great addition to my life, and I hope I was to his. I can't remember a bad moment in our friendship.”

Caine called the actor “special” in his book, recalling the first time they crossed paths.

“I just instinctively greeted him with a hug and announced to the whole room, ‘This is my son!' Sometimes, you sense a connection,” Caine shared. “I just liked the guy immediately, he has a big heart. It turned out he was going through some tough times back then, so I think perhaps it made an impression upon him to be embraced and treated with love. Anyway, we've been great friends ever since.”

The actor said that he always has dinner with the “multi-talented” Diesel when they're in the same place at the same time.

Caine got a chance to work alongside Beyoncé in the 2002 movie Austin Powers in Goldmember. The singer shared her big dreams with the legendary star.

“You could already tell how focused she was and how big a star she was going to be,” he recalled. “I remember the first day on set, I asked her what her ambition was, and she said, ‘I want to win an Academy Award for a movie.' Not a trace of arrogance, just clarity. She was nominated a couple of years ago. I'm sure she'll win an Oscar eventually.”

Grant's Season 29 Winner Revealed in Finale Episode","https://www.justjared.com/2025/03/24/who-won-the-bachelor-2025-grants-season-29-winner-revealed-in-finale-episode/","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:31:37 GMT","

Grant Ellis is engaged and we can reveal spoilers from the season finale of The Bachelor.

Reality Steve already dropped the spoilers before the season even started, but now ABC has confirmed the winner of the most recent season of the show.

The three-hour season finale episode aired on Monday night (March 24) and Grant popped the question during the dramatic conclusion, which was filmed in the Dominican Republic. 

Host Jesse Palmer said during the finale that in Bachelor history, it has never come down to the wire in this way with Grant being unable to come up with his decision until moments before he had to choose between the final two women.

Head inside to find out who won... 

The final two women were 28-year-old Juliana, a client service associate from Massachusetts, and 31-year-old Litia, a venture capitalist from Utah. 

Juliana (left) and Litia (right)


Litia was the first woman to arrive at the final rose ceremony, where she professed her love to Grant and said that she started falling for him in the second week. 

""I love you so much and I feel so lucky to be loved by you,"" she told him.

Grant unfortunately did not reciprocate the feelings. ""Litia, I love you, very much and I want to give you everything that you deserve, but I'm not your person,"" he said. 

""I'm sorry to have gotten to this point. My emotional connection is stronger with someone else,"" he said. 

Juliana wins and is engaged to Grant!

Juliana was next to show up at the rose ceremony and she was revealed as the final recipient of a rose... and an engagement ring!

""I just want you to know I love you and you'll make me the luckiest girl in the world if I get to spend the rest of my life with you,"" Juliana said to Grant.

Grant got down on one knee and asked Juliana to marry him. She said yes!

Elizabeth Olsen will not be making an appearance in the next two Avengers movies. 

The 36-year-old actress revealed in a recent interview that she will not be reprising her role of Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch in the upcoming films Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.

“I didn't realize this until about six years ago, but because Marvel and its influence takes up so much physical time and space in the world, it's really important for me to make choices outside of Marvel that reflect my own taste,” Elizabeth told The Hollywood Reporter while discussing her film The Assessment.

“Your taste does create the artist that you are, and that wasn't something I was thinking about when I first started working. So the opportunity to return to films like [The Assessment] is a reflection of the people I want to work with and my own personal taste,” she added.

Maria Shriver is opening up about her divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The 69-year-old journalist got vulnerable in her new memoir, I Am Maria, detailing how the split affected her. 

“My twenty-five-year-long marriage blew up. It broke my heart, it broke my spirit, it broke what was left of me,” she wrote, per People. 

“I was consumed with grief and wracked with confusion, anger, fear, sadness, and anxiety. I was unsure now of who I was, where I belonged. Honestly, it was brutal, and I was terrified,” she added.

Maria and Arnold got married in 1986, and share Katherine, 35, Christina, 33, Patrick, 31, and Christopher, 27, together. 

In 2011, Arnold admitted to having an affair with house staffer Mildred Baena, which resulted in the birth of Joseph Baena.

He was drinking an iced quad espresso in a venti cup with extra ice and six shots.

At the time, fans figured out that he was likely consuming around 384 mg of caffeine with this drink, at around 64 mg per shot.

On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Pedro said of his coffee order going viral, “I cannot begin to tell you how violating this was!”

“There's so much context to why it has become six shots of espresso. It was always a quad but then I feel like the cups got bigger and, I don't know, the shots got less strong. At some point, it became six,"" he said. “It was an incredibly private morning ritual that I never wanted anyone to know about.""

“You sip it and you get really high, and you answer emails and stuff,” he added, noting that he doesn't drink any additional coffee besides this drink.

Pedro was recently linked romantically to this major star, but a source just clarified the nature of their relationship.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it has made separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban strikes against energy facilities in the two countries.

The White House said in a statement that Washington would help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports and would continue facilitating talks on both sides in a bid toward achieving a sustainable peace.

Canada on Monday said Pakistan could interfere in its April 28 general election to counter India's ""growing global influence"". Vanessa Lloyd, the deputy director of operations at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), said Islamabad could conduct foreign interference activities against Canada.

""The government of Pakistan could potentially conduct foreign interference activities against Canada in line with its strategic aims to promote political, security and economic stability in Pakistan and to counter India's growing global influence,"" she told a press conference.

Ms Lloyd also said that New Delhi could interfere in the election.

""We have also seen that the government of India has the intent and capability to interfere in Canadian communities and democratic processes to assert its geopolitical influence,"" she said.

Canada had levelled similar allegations against the two countries last year, a charge unequivocally rejected by New Delhi.

The spy agency in April 2024 released an unclassified summary tabled as part of a federal inquiry examining potential foreign interference, alleging ""clandestine"" activities by both India and Pakistan during the 2021 and 2019 general elections. 

It alleged that in 2021, the Indian government targeted specific electoral districts believed to harbour Indian-origin voters sympathetic to the Khalistani movement or pro-Pakistan stances. 

The agency also claimed that a government proxy agent may have attempted to sway democratic processes through illicit financial support to favoured candidates, potentially remaining undisclosed to the recipients.

In a separate report, the agency accused Pakistan of covertly trying to influence politics at the federal level before the 2019 election to advance Pakistan's interests.

India called the probe ""baseless"" and said that it was Canada who was interfering in its internal affairs.

Tensions between India and Canada simmered after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged New Delhi's involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India dismissed the accusation as ""absurd.""

Besides India and Pakistan, Canada's spy agency said that China and Russia could also interfere in its polls, announced by Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday.

""The PRC (People's Republic of China) is highly likely to use AI-enabled tools to attempt to interfere with Canada's democratic process in this current election,"" Vanessa Lloyd told reporters.

Beijing is also ""highly likely"" to use social media to promote narratives favourable to its interests - and to specifically target Chinese ethnic, cultural and religious communities in Canada using ""clandestine and deceptive"" means, she said.

Russia has tried to build ""dissemination networks"" across social media and news websites that ""amplify Kremlin talking points,"" she said.

""It is possible that Russia will use these online networks to opportunistically conduct foreign information manipulation and interference operations directed at Canadians,"" Ms Lloyd said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

China's carbon intensity fell less than planned for in 2024 even as Beijing made strides in renewable energy.

Taipei, Taiwan – China's failure to meet a key carbon emissions target has raised concerns about its ability to achieve carbon neutrality, a potentially decisive factor in global efforts to avert the worst effects of climate change.

China's carbon intensity – a measurement of carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) – fell 3.4 percent in 2024, missing Beijing's official target of 3.9 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

China is also behind its longer-term goal of slashing carbon intensity by 18 percent between 2020 and 2025, as set by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in its most recent five-year plan.

Under China's “dual targets”, President Xi Jinping has pledged to reach peak emissions before the end of the decade and carbon neutrality by 2060.

China's progress is being closely watched around the world due to its paradoxical position as the world's top polluter – responsible for about 30 percent of global emissions – and the world's leader in renewable energy investment.

The country's success or failure to meet its emissions targets will have major implications for the international community's efforts to keep average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, a benchmark set by the United Nations to avert “catastrophic” effects of climate change.

The chances of the planet being able to keep below the 1.5C threshold over the long-term are already in doubt, after 2024 became the first calendar year in history where temperatures breached the limit.

Although carbon intensity is just one of the benchmarks used by Beijing, it provides important insights into how decarbonisation is playing out across the economy, said Muyi Yang, a senior energy analyst at Ember, a global energy think tank based in the United Kingdom.

“Even though the economy continued to grow, the reduction in emissions relative to that growth wasn't as rapid as intended,” Muyi told Al Jazeera.

The world's second-largest economy relied heavily on industrial growth to power itself out of the economic slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but this in turn has led to a recent surge in energy demand, Muyi said.

While China's economy officially grew 5 percent in 2024, electricity demand grew 6.8 percent year-on-year, according to government data.

Carbon emissions grew 0.8 percent year-on-year.

Record heatwaves have posed a further challenge to emission reduction efforts by disrupting energy production at hydropower dams, forcing authorities to make up the shortfall with coal power.

 



 

Despite the setbacks, Beijing has made remarkable achievements in renewable energy, according to David Fishman, a senior manager at the Lantau Group, an energy consultancy firm in Hong Kong.

China last year met 14.5 percent of its total energy demand with wind and solar power and another 13.4 percent with hydropower, according to government data.

The country also met about 75 percent of its incremental growth in energy demand – 500 out of 610 terawatt hours – with renewable energy, Fishman said, based on an analysis of government data.

The figure represents “massive amounts of clean energy” roughly equivalent to Germany's annual energy consumption, Fishman told Al Jazeera.

Much of this growth has been driven by government support, including from the highest levels of the CCP.

Xi Jinping Thought, Xi's governing ideology enshrined in the Chinese constitution, states that China must strive towards an “ecological civilisation”.

In 2021, Xi announced that “high energy consumption and high-emission projects that don't meet requirements should be resolutely taken down”.

The same year, China launched its Emissions Trading Scheme, the world's largest carbon trading market, under which firms that produce less emissions than their designated allowance can sell their unused allowances to polluters exceeding their limits.

More recently, Xi has called for China to focus on “new quality productive forces” and transition to more high-end and innovation-driven manufacturing, said Anika Patel, a China analyst at Carbon Brief.

“[China] has historically been seen as the ‘factory of the world' but with a focus on the so-called ‘old three', which are all lower-value products – appliances, clothing and toys. Now it wants to shift towards green growth and the ‘new three', which is solar panels, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries,” Patel told Al Jazeera.

The CCP will release its newest round of carbon emissions targets for 2026 to 2030 alongside its next five-year plan later this year, Patel said, which will impact the direction of both public and private sectors.

Yao Zhe, a global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, said while China is on track to reach peak carbon before 2030, whether it can leave coal fully behind in the long term is less certain.

“Achieving carbon neutrality will require many more structural changes in China's energy sector and economy as a whole. And those changes need to start soon after peak,” Yao told Al Jazeera.

“While Chinese policymakers are good at supporting the cleantech industry, they tend to defer these structural reforms to a later timeframe – possibly later than 2035 – and this is a real concern.”

A Black Sea agreement has been reached between the US and Russia, the White House says - and it also says the US ""will help restore Russia's access to the world market"" for certain products. Follow the latest here.

Talks between Russia, the US and Ukraine in Riyadh in recent days have centred on the Black Sea - particularly on a deal to secure shipping there that collapsed more than 18 months ago.

In recent days, we have covered here how Moscow was said to be keen to revive a UN-backed deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its ports without being attacked, known as the Black Sea grain initiative.

The deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain via its southern ports.

How did deal benefit Russia?

The deal also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports, but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement.

This meant Russia stopped granting safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine, and the country's grain exports subsequently slumped. 

Since then, though, Russia's priorities have changed.

Under today's ceasefire at sea, Russia would once again be able to export farm produce and fertiliser through the Black Sea, getting relief from sanctions imposed by Western countries.

The US even referred to helping Russia access the world market again for agricultural products, in its statement earlier.

Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke has also explained today that Russia is only agreeing to deals in its favour.

Russia is happy to continue fighting on land, where it is slowlg making gains, while signing up to something that protects its ships at sea - where Ukraine has been growing in confident and damaging Russian vessels.

Russia will be quite happy dragging the US through peace talks without making any meaningful concessions, says security analyst Michael Clarke. 

Today's outcome is another, like the 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire, that the US ""can boast about"" that doesn't massively change anything on the ground for Ukraine. 

""The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes and they'll present little gains for the US,"" he explains.

""But they won't address the central issue,"" he says. 

No real deal can be agreed unless Donald Trump starts putting meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin. 

""Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on.""

He also says Trump will stay interested until it ""gets difficult"", at which point he'll ""just go onto something else"".

""He's a disrupter, but when disruption becomes hard to follow through, he goes on to the next topic, and I think that's what will happen.""

Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov say it has agreed to ""ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea"".

This comes after the White House said Russia has agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea.

Ukraine and US delegations have been holding talks in Saudi Arabia today.

Umerov adds Kyiv holds that any movement by Russian military vessels outside of eastern part of the Black Sea will constitute violation of the spirit of this agreement.

""In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence.""

In similar wording to the statement issued by the White House, he adds: ""All parties agreed to develop measures for implementing the Presidents' agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Ukraine and Russia.""

Some new details are just coming out of the White House now.

They have said the US and Russia have agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea, which had been a key focus of talks this week.

Additionally, they agreed to work together on measures banning strikes on energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine.

Significantly, Washington will also help to restore Russia's access to global markets for agricultural and fertiliser exports, the White House added. Where this leaves Western sanctions against Russia is unclear at this stage.

With Ukraine, the US said it has agreed it will remain committed to returning forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

The White House statement on Russia in full:

The United States and Russia have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.

The United States will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions. 

The United States and Russia agreed to develop measures for implementing President Trump's and President Putin's agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine. 

The United States and Russia welcome the good offices of third countries with a view toward supporting the implementation of the energy and maritime agreements. 

The United States and Russia will continue working toward achieving a durable and lasting peace.
 
The United States reiterated President Donald J. Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict must stop, as the necessary step toward achieving an enduring peace settlement.

To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh. 

The United States expresses gratitude to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his leadership and hospitality in once again facilitating these important discussions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Ukraine's security agency has detained a serviceman it's accused of helping Russia.

The SBU said this ""mole"" worked to give away Ukrainian soldiers' positions during the fighting over Kursk, the Russian region Kyiv's forces invaded last summer.

Since then, Russia has taken back much of its territory, particularly in recent weeks.

""While at the front, the 'mole' was preparing coordinates for the aggressor's missile and bomb attacks on the locations of Ukrainian troops,"" the SBU said.

It said the man had been recruited by Moscow's GRU intelligence service through social media messaging app Telegram, where he had posted comments in support of Russia.

According to a US intelligence report, Russia is working on a new satellite to carry a nuclear weapon.

Such a weapon could have ""devastating consequences"" for both the US and the world, the Annual Threat Assessment by the US intelligence community added.

It also added the war in Ukraine has given Russia a chance to learn a ""wealth of lessons"" about Western weapons and intelligence.

While Moscow will not be able to achieve ""total victory"", the report added momentum remains on their side in the Ukraine war.

For context: Military analyst Michael Clarke explained in our live Q&A earlier that nuclear war is not any more likely now than it was before Russia's invasion.

This is partly because nuclear weapons wouldn't give Russia any advantage on the battlefield. You can catch up on his insight in the link below...

We're back now from our live Q&A with Michael Clarke - link in the post below.

You can catch up on a range of issues he addressed there, but we'll share some insight with you here now, given there's been so much focus on ceasefire talks in Saudi Arabia this week.

Asked if the return of a Black Sea deal would give Russia's navy safe passage through waters, Clarke broke down what discussions have focused on - and why they're likely to benefit Moscow more.

""The Russians are quite keen to do this because they want to get their stuff out,"" he said.

""At the moment, they can't get their stuff out of the Black Sea, because of the threat that the Ukrainians could pose to their ships.""

There are two issues now on the table in talks, Clarke said.

These are: 

They are both more to Russia's benefit than Ukraine's, Clarke said.

""It is a very, very limited ceasefire - which gets more limited every day - of the two elements that the Russians most want,"" he added.

""Because they're the two elements that actually benefit them more than they benefit the Ukrainians.""

And with the US going for quick negotiations, in contrast to Russia's ""running-the-clock-down"" approach, Clarke said it looks like Moscow is ""giving the American team a complete run-around"".

""They're giving them a lesson in tough diplomacy, and there are none tougher than the Russians when it comes to negotiating something on the Black Sea,"" Clarke added.

And don't overlook Turkey's role in this, he said, as they control the waterway connecting the Black Sea to the rest of the world.

What is this Black Sea deal?

Moscow is said to be keen to revive a UN-backed deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from its ports without being attacked, known as the Black Sea grain initiative.

The deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain from its southern ports.

The deal also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports, but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement.

Military analyst Michael Clarke is with us again to answer your questions on the Ukraine war - and there's plenty to get through.

He'll be covering topics including:

Click on the link below now to follow along...

Interfax news agency has reported Russian forces have claimed two settlements in eastern Ukraine.

Those are Myrne, in the Donetsk region, and Mali Shcherbaky, in the Zaporizhzhia region.

According to that report - which cites Russia's defence ministry - the two settlements in the map below are the locations taken by Moscow's forces.

Something worth noting as uproar over the extraordinary war plans leak continues - Donald Trump's key envoy was in the infamous group chat while he was in the Kremlin.

Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, visited Moscow on 13 March, when he appeared to be in the group chat on encrypted chat platform Signal.

A journalist was accidentally added to that chat on the same day, with Witkoff's name appearing among the list of other users there.

As our US correspondent James Matthews points out in the post below, Washington's allies will be wondering what other classified material is discussed in group chats.

It's likely the fact Witkoff was in Moscow when this text chain was already formed won't ease concerns.

If you're having a conversation about the state of journalism, it's bound to get a little depressing.

Since 2008, more than 250 local news outlets have closed down in Canada. The U.S. has lost a third of the newspapers they had in 2005. But this is about more than a failing business model. Only 31 percent of Americans say they trust the media. In Canada, that number is a little bit better – but only a little.

The problem is not just that people are losing their faith in journalism. It's that they're starting to place their trust in other, often more dubious sources of information: TikTok influencers, Elon Musk's X feed, and The Joe Rogan Experience.

The impact of this shift can be seen almost everywhere you look. 15 percent of Americans believe climate change is a hoax. 30 percent believe the 2020 election was stolen. 10 percent believe the earth is flat.

A lot of this can be blamed on social media, which crippled journalism's business model and led to a flourishing of false information online. But not all of it. People like Jay Rosen have long argued that journalists themselves are at least partly responsible for the post-truth moment we now find ourselves in.

Rosen is a professor of journalism at NYU who's been studying, critiquing, and really shaping, the press for nearly 40 years. He joined me a couple of weeks ago at the Attention conference in Montreal to explain how we got to this place – and where we might go from here.

A note: we recorded this interview before the Canadian election was called, so we don't touch on it here. But over the course of the next month, the integrity of our information ecosystem will face an inordinate amount of stress, and conversations like this one will be more important than ever.

President facing calls to remove senior security officials over app blunder that saw Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg added to highly-sensitive group chat by mistake

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

President Donald Trump has come under fire after it emerged on Monday that senior officials in his administration, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Vice President JD Vance, reportedly discussed a highly sensitive operation aimed at targeting Houthi positions in Yemen in a Signal group chat to which Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic, was added by mistake.

Asked about the staggering security breach, Trump said that he backs Waltz despite calls for his resignation, saying he has “learned his lesson” over the fiasco.

Hegseth has meanwhile called Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist” but he too is facing calls to step down from Democrats, who have branded the scandal “a major screw-up.”

Particularly incensed was former U.S. secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, whom Trump repeatedly threatened to jail for allegedly using a private email account while in office, who responded by saying simply: “You have got to be kidding me.”

Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are currently appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss worldwide threats and will be grilled on the leak.

U.S. consumer confidence fell for the fourth straight month as Americans' anxiety about their financial futures declined to a 12-year low amid rising concern over tariffs and inflation.

The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9. Analysts were expecting a decline to a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.

The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.

The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession in the next year held steady at a nine-month high, the board reported.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not respond to a question today about his inclusion in the Signal group chat.

Donald Trump's administration is refusing to answer any questions from a federal judge about deportation flights to El Salvador's notorious prison under the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act.

Judge James Boasberg had ordered government attorneys to answer a series of questions — including when those planes left the United States and entered El Salvador — to determine whether administration officials intentionally defied his court orders, which were delivered in court and in filings hours before the planes landed March 15.

For more than a week, the judge has pushed the administration for answers and extended deadlines for a response.

Alex Woodward has been following the case.

Senator Angus King of Maine asks Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard how it's possible war plans wouldn't be deemed classified information.

Gabbard doesn't go into detail and repeats that it wasn't classified.

Watch that moment: 

A TikTok star claims that Elon Musk's lawyers probed her over a series of critical tweets amid an announcement that she is running for Congress.

Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a Gen-Z influencer who is known as Kat Abu, has declared she's “not scared of standing up” to President Donald Trump and Elon Musk after she revealed her political ambitions in Illinois's 9th District because of a “spineless” Democratic party who are failing to intervene.

Madeline Sherratt reports.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is the latest member of the Trump administration to claim that the Signal group chat on strikes against the Houthis in Yemen did not include classified information.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said similar when asked, claiming “nobody was testing war plans.”

The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg told Kaitlan Collins last night on CNN: “That's a lie. He was texting war plans, he was texting attack plans.”

India is considering cutting tariffs on more than half of U.S. imports worth $23 billion in the initial phase of a trade deal that the two countries are negotiating, according to two government sources who spoke to Reuters.

This would represent the largest reduction in years, designed to ward off reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration.

The South Asian nation aims to lessen the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's retaliatory global tariffs scheduled to take effect on April 2, a threat that has shaken markets and left policymakers in a scramble, even among Western allies.

In an internal assessment, New Delhi projected that these reciprocal tariffs would affect 87% of its total exports to the United States, valued at $66 billion, according to two government sources familiar with the details.

As part of the deal, India is willing to lower tariffs on 55% of U.S. goods it imports, currently subjected to tariffs ranging from 5% to 30%, said both sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

In this category of goods, India is prepared to ""significantly"" reduce tariffs or even eliminate some entirely on imported goods valued at over $23 billion from the United States, one of the sources indicated.

FBI Director Kash Patel says he was only recently briefed on the Signal group chat matter and doesn't have an update on whether the FBI has launched an investigation into it.

Senator Mark Warner asks for an update by the end of the day.

Senator Mark Warner asked Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard if she participated in the group chat.

“I don't want to get into specifics...” she replied.

Warner asked: “You are not TG in this group chat?”

Gabbard replied: “I'm not going to get into the specifics... because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.”

She also said that there was no classified material shared in the group chat, to which Warner responded: “If there was no classified material, share it with the committee. You can't have it both ways.”

“Senator, I was on a Signal messaging group,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe tells Warner, confirming he was in the group chat disclosed by The Atlantic yesterday.

Ratcliffe says he was briefed by the CIA about the use of Signal “as a permissible work use.”

“My communications were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” Ratcliffe says.

Pete Hegseth shared war plans in the group chat, The Atlantic reported. (Reuters: Nathan Howard)

In any other presidency, the story would rock the United States: Washington's most senior national security advisers having a highly confidential discussion about plans for the US to launch military strikes, and every word of it being read by an astonished journalist.

But in these times of the New World of Donald Trump it was seen as yet another day — a story that might run for a few hours before blowing over.

Washington is not what it used to be. When news emerged that The Atlantic's editor-in-chief had been accidentally included in a group chat about a plan to bomb Yemen, Trump barely missed a beat.

He knew nothing about it, he told a media conference. He asked journalists for detail, but wasn't particularly fazed. Later, on social media, he re-shared a satirical headline poking fun at The Atlantic's readership numbers.

There was no apparent sense that there would be any accountability. These things happen.

The story broke when Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in The Atlantic that he knew in advance that the US was about to conduct air strikes on Yemen's Houthis on March 15.

""The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defence, had texted me the war plan at 11.44 am,"" Goldberg revealed. ""The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing.""

Goldberg wrote:

""On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz.

""Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. 

""I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump's national security adviser.""

Goldberg, as an experienced journalist, was concerned that it may have been a hoax but accepted the request, hoping it was the real Mike Waltz and that perhaps he wanted to talk about Ukraine or Iran.

One can imagine Goldberg's surprise when he became part of a group chat discussing a military operation to bomb Yemen.

The group included Vice-President JD Vance, and key officials or representatives of them, including Waltz; Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. The group also included a CIA official, who Goldberg chose not to name as that person is an active intelligence officer.

Goldberg wrote he ""could not believe that the national security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans"".

""I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior US official, up to and including the vice-president,"" he wrote.

For Goldberg, the security breach continued. After the bombing, Waltz celebrated by posting three emojis — a fist, an American flag and fire. There had indeed been fire — Yemen's health authorities say the bombing killed at least 53 people.

Witkoff was not to be outdone, and, Goldberg wrote, sent five emojis to the group: two sets of hands praying, a flexed bicep and two American flags.

After the attacks, officials shared congratulatory messages, according to The Atlantic.

For 18 senior US officials to have a casual chat on a commercial social media platform has shocked many in Washington.

It comes only days after The New York Times reported on a plan for Elon Musk to be given a tour of the Pentagon — including, according to anonymous sources, a briefing about US plans for any war with China. (The Trump administration both labelled the story fake and launched internal probes into how it was leaked.)

Although Trump's support ensured Hegseth was confirmed as secretary of defence, many concerns were raised as to whether someone who before this position had been a weekend host on Fox News was qualified to oversee the world's largest military.

The incident raises some obvious questions about the level of competence of Trump's national security team.

Messages published by The Atlantic show JD Vance and Pete Hegseth complaining about Europe.

The first questions that naturally come to mind are about how a magazine editor was invited to join — and then able to lurk in — this 18-member group with nobody asking: ""Hang on, who's that guy?""

But beyond that stunning blunder, the bigger questions are about the handling of confidential, and potentially classified, military plans by these top officials.

Anyone who's watched an American spy drama or war movie knows the US has incredibly tight protocols around where and how state secrets are discussed.

That's why Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state blew up into a damaging scandal during the 2016 election campaign — one that Donald Trump repeatedly said she should be jailed over.

And it's why Trump himself faced criminal charges — ultimately dropped — over the alleged stashing of classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago ballroom and bathroom.

Donald Trump's attacks on the judiciary pre-election, as he personally fought criminal prosecution, was one thing. But the way it's escalating from the White House is stress-testing the separation of powers.

This new revelation appears to represent a significant breach of those protocols.

It's not clear exactly what was in the messages, because The Atlantic deemed some of it too sensitive to print. Hegseth has disputed the description of them as ""war plans"".

But on the known facts, it appears at least some of the chat should have been confined to the authorised, secure channels set up for purposes like sensitive military discussion.

Signal is a more secure app than others, thanks to its encryption technology, but no app can ever be considered free of vulnerabilities.

Security and defence experts here in Washington say it looks like the Espionage Act may have been breached.

The fall-out will be felt beyond Washington.

You can imagine the chatter today in parts of Canberra.

When conversations like the group chat take place in Australia, there's an expectation it's done over secure lines. 

A similar howler in Australia would almost certainly send heads rolling.

Experts say Australia should expect Washington to be ""sceptical"" of vital intelligence-sharing alliance Five Eyes and say AUKUS might too be in trouble. 

Australia and America's other Five Eyes intelligence partners — Canada, the UK and New Zealand — were already being forced to wrestle with questions about how much they could continue to trust their long-time ally.

Incidents like this will only shake that faith further.

But will there be any accountability?

The agencies that would traditionally investigate something like this are now under the tight control of fierce Trump loyalists.

And the Trump administration's flood-the-zone strategy is likely to push the news agenda through another dizzying series of events before the week is out.

Perhaps the most America can hope for is that this shocking error — and the publicity that results from putting a magazine editor in the middle of it — serves as a wake-up call that leads to more care in future.

A file photo shows Ukrainian service members fire a shell towards Russian position in Kharkiv Region, Ukraine.

(CNN) — Lengthy talks between the United States and Russia on a potential ceasefire in Ukraine have ended without agreement on Tuesday, Russian state news agency Interfax reported, pouring cold water on expectations that the two sides would be able to present some sort of joint statement after the marathon meeting.

Interfax quoted the first deputy chairman of the the Russian Federation Council's Defence and Security Committee, Vladimir Chizhov, as telling state TV channel Rossiya-24 that the statement was “not adopted because of Ukraine's position.”

“The fact that they sat for 12 hours and seemed to agree on a joint statement, which however was not adopted due to Ukraine's position, is also very characteristic and symptomatic,” Chizhov told Russia-24, according to Interfax.

US and Russian diplomats had been widely expected to issue a joint statement on Tuesday morning. Such a statement would send a powerful signal that both Washington, DC and Moscow were serious about the ceasefire.

The US has not yet commented on the outcome of talks.

Russian and US officials met at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on Monday, the same location where the US delegation met with Ukrainian officials on Sunday.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Tuesday that Moscow was “analyzing” the results of the second round of talks between Russian and US officials. Speaking to reporters during one of his regular daily press calls, he seemed to downplay the importance of the talks, describing them as “technical.”

He also said there were currently no plans for Trump and Putin to speak, although he added that a conversation between the two leaders could be arranged “quite quickly.”

Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, says the governing body feels the mandatory tests for athletes are ""a really important way of providing confidence"".

World Athletics will introduce mandatory testing for anyone entering female competitions to verify their biological sex, insisting it is necessary to protect women's sport.

It is the latest move overseen by Sebastian Coe - as president of the governing body - to address the gender eligibility issue, two years after banning anyone assigned male at birth from female events.

Lord Coe said after a World Athletics Council meeting today that they could adopt non-invasive cheek swab tests or dry blood tests that only have to be carried out once on an athlete.

""This we feel is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition,"" he said.

The tests would seek to verify if someone has transitioned to a female after going through male puberty or if they had differences of sex development that provided testosterone advantages.

Testing providers are now being sought.

Lord Coe said: ""The pre-clearance testing will be for athletes to be able to compete in the female category.

""The process is very straightforward frankly, very clear and it's an important one and we will work on the timelines.

""Neither of these are invasive. They are necessary and they will be done to absolute medical standards.""

Sports correspondent

Sebastian Coe's mission has become - in his view - protecting the integrity of women's sport.

Having banned transgender women from women's events overseen by World Athletics, any competitors with differences of sex development will also be prohibited from competing alongside those who were female at birth.

Lord Coe believes he is trying to prevent any unfair performance advantage gained by anyone who has gone through male puberty.


And his solution to verifying eligibility is sex testing - part of the Olympics in the last century.

He insists the new swab tests for all female athletes will be non-intrusive, checking if there's any presence of the SRY gene that is typically found on the Y chromosome.


But Alun Williams, of the Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport, is part of a group of global academics expressing concern that the initial genetic test could lead to clinical examinations of bodies.

The new tests, though, could be in place in time for the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo in September and be a requirement for every female competitor.

Will the tests be adopted by other sports that have already banned transgender women from women's events?

And, ultimately, under pressure from Donald Trump, will they be widespread for 2028 LA Olympics hopefuls?

It follows US President Donald Trump, ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, saying there are only two sexes - male and female - while calling on sports to ban transgender women from women's events.

The International Olympic Committee has previously called a return to sex testing a ""bad idea"", but incoming IOC President Kirsty Coventry is not ruling it out, having also talked about protecting the female category.

""This is a conversation that's happened and the international federations have taken a far greater lead in this conversation,"" she told Sky News after her election last week.

""What I was proposing is to bring a group together with the international federations and really understand each sport is slightly different.

""We know in equestrian, sex is really not an issue, but in other sports it is.

""So what I'd like to do again is bring the international federations together and sit down and try and come up with a collective way forward for all of us to move.""

 LONDON, - Two British air force engineers were on Tuesday fined and ordered to carry out unpaid work for drunkenly breaking a statue of Paddington Bear in half before stealing it in what a judge described as ""an act of wanton vandalism"". 

 Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22, pleaded guilty to criminal damage of the statue on March 2 in Newbury in Berkshire, southern England, the home town of Paddington's creator Michael Bond. 

 The pair forcibly removed the front facade of the statue and carried it through the town to a taxi which took them back to their Royal Air Force base, Judge Sam Goozee said, adding that the statue needed 5,451 pounds of repairs. 

 Paddington, a much-loved children's literary character, has experienced a recent surge in popularity as a result of a successful series of movie adaptations, starring Ben Whishaw and Hugh Bonneville. 

 The bear even had tea with the late Queen Elizabeth in a pre-recorded comic sketch to mark her 70th year on the throne, in which she told Paddington she always kept the character's favourite marmalade sandwich in her ever-present handbag. 

 The judge told Heath and Lawrence as he sentenced them at Reading Magistrates' Court: ""Paddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike. 

 ""He represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. 

 ""His famous label attached to his duffle coat says 'please look after this bear'. On the night of March 2 2025, your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for."" 

 Heath and Lawrence were both ordered to pay 2725 pounds compensation for the repairs and to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. (Photo: PTI)


	Since plunging during the Covid-19 pandemic, international student enrollment in the US has been rebounding a relief to American universities that count on their tuition payments. Two months into the new Trump administration, educators fear that could soon change.


	Unnerved by efforts to deport students over political views, students from other countries already in the US have felt new pressure to watch what they say. 


	A Ph.D. student at the University of Rochester from South Asia said it feels too risky to speak about LGBTQ+ causes she once openly championed or even be seen near a political demonstration. With reports of travel bans circulating, she likely won't fly home for the summer out of fear she would not be allowed back into the US.


	You're here for an education so you've got to keep moving forward on that end, said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.


	But also it's very hard to, say, OK, I'm at work. I've got to zone out. I can't be thinking about the news.' 
	Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. As the US government takes a harder line on immigration, cuts federal research funding and begins policing campus activism, students are left to wonder if they'll be able to get visas, travel freely, pursue research or even express an opinion.


	It has a chilling effect, said Clay Harmon, executive director of AIRC, a membership organisation focused on recruiting and enrolling international students.


	Even if there's no direct consequence or direct limitation right now, all of this cumulatively produces an impression that the US is not welcoming, it's not open or that you may be in some kind of danger or jeopardy if you do come to the US.


	During a recent trip to India, the biggest sender of students to the US, the consensus among recruiting agencies was that far fewer of that country's students are interested in American colleges than in recent years, Harmon said.


	Some students are waiting to see how policy changes will play out, while others already have deferred admission offers for fall 2025, he said. Student social networks are active, and news about immigration-related developments in America like a Republican proposal to prevent Chinese students from studying in the US spreads quickly.


	Students in Canada, China, India and elsewhere have been seeking answers and advice on Reddit and other social media sites, wondering whether to move forward with US plans, or choose a college in the United Kingdom, Germany or elsewhere in Europe.


	International students are coveted as an antidote to declining domestic enrollment and source of full-price tuition payments. In the 2023-2024 academic year, 1.1 million international students at US colleges and universities contributed an all-time high $ 43.8 billion to the nation's economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs, according to data released by NAFSA, an agency that promotes international education.


	International graduate students also play a large role in advancing research, said Fanta Aw, who heads NAFSA.


	Aw said universities must work to remind prospective students that detentions like those of a pro-Palestinian activist Columbia University and, more recently, a scholar at Georgetown University, still are not the norm, despite the attention they receive.


	We have international students at lots of universities, she said, and news coverage has focused on consequences for international students at just a couple of colleges. So we have to also put into perspective the fact that the vast majority of students are in universities where we're not hearing anything.


	The messaging from colleges and universities on the changing political climate has varied. Some, including Northeastern University in Boston, have responded to Trump's directives with webpages to keep current and prospective students informed.


	Our global community will continue to be a welcoming place for admitted students from all corners of the world, spokeswoman Renata Nyul said via email.


	Others have gone further. Bunker Hill Community College in Boston has suspended its one- to two-week study abroad programs, citing concerns about potential travel restrictions. Administrators at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism have warned students who are not US citizens about their vulnerability to arrest or deportation.


	Brown University has advised international students and staff, including visa holders and permanent residents, to postpone travel after a Brown professor was deported to Lebanon despite having a US visa.


	Homeland Security officials later said she openly admitted to supporting a Hezbollah leader and attending his funeral.

Take X, for example. Users of what was once called Twitter span the globe, with its 600 millions-plus active accounts dotted across nearly every country. And each of those jurisdictions has its own laws.

But the interests of national regulatory efforts and that of predominantly U.S.-based technology companies often don't align. While many governments have sought to impose oversight mechanisms to address problems such as disinformation, online extremism and manipulation, these initiatives have been met with corporate resistance, political interference and legal challenges invoking free speech as a shield against regulation.

What is brewing is a global struggle over digital platform governance. And in this battle, U.S. platforms are increasingly leaning on American laws to challenge other nation's regulations. It is, we believe as experts on digital law – one an executive director of a forum monitoring how countries implement democratic principles – a form of digital imperialism.

The latest manifestation of this phenomenon occurred in February 2025, when new tensions emerged between Brazil's judiciary and U.S.-based social media platforms.

Trump Media & Technology Group and Rumble filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, challenging his orders to suspend accounts on the two platforms linked to disinformation campaigns in Brazil.

The case follows earlier unsuccessful efforts by Elon Musk's X to resist similar Brazilian rulings.

Together, the cases exemplify a growing trend in which U.S. political and corporate actors attempt to undermine foreign regulatory authority by pressing the case that domestic U.S. law and corporate protections should take precedence over sovereign policies globally.

At the core of the dispute is Allan dos Santos, a right-wing Brazilian influencer and fugitive from justice who fled to the U.S. in 2021 after De Moraes ordered his preventive arrest for allegedly coordinating disinformation networks and inciting violence.

Dos Santos has continued his online activities abroad. Brazil's extradition requests have gone unanswered due to claims by U.S. authorities that the case involves issues of free speech rather than criminal offenses.

Trump Media and Rumble's lawsuit attempts to do two things. First, it seeks to frame Brazil's judicial actions as censorship rather than oversight. And second, it seeks to portray the Brazilian court action as territorial overreach.

Their position is that as the target of the action was in the U.S., they are subject to U.S. free speech protections under the First Amendment. The fact that the subject of the ban was Brazilian and is accused of spreading disinformation and hate in Brazil should not, they argue, matter.

For now, U.S. courts agree. In late February, a Florida-based judge ruled that Rumble and Trump Media need not comply with the Brazilian order.

The case signals an important shift in the contest over platform accountability – a move from corporate lobbying and political pressure to direct legal intervention in foreign jurisdictions. U.S. courts are now being used to challenge overseas decisions regarding platform accountability.

The outcome and the broader legal strategy behind the lawsuit could have far-reaching implications not only for Brazil but for any country or region – such as the European Union – attempting to regulate online spaces.

The resistance against digital regulation predates the Trump administration.

In Brazil, efforts to regulate social media platforms have long faced substantial opposition. Big Tech companies – including Google, Meta and X – have used their economic and political influence to lobby against tighter regulation, often framing such policies as a threat to free expression.

In 2020, the Brazilian “Fake News Bill,” which sought to hold platforms accountable for the spread of disinformation, was met with strong opposition from these companies.

Google and Meta launched high-profile campaigns to oppose the bill, warning it would “threaten free speech” and “harm small businesses.” Google placed banners on its Brazilian homepage urging users to reject the legislation, while Meta ran advertisements questioning its implications for the digital economy.

These efforts, alongside lobbying and political resistance, were successful in helping to delay and weaken the regulatory framework.

The difference now is that challenges are blurring the line between the corporate and the political.

Trump Media was 53% owned by the U.S. president before he moved his stake into a revocable trust in December 2024. Elon Musk, the free speech fundamentalist owner of X, is a de facto member of the Trump administration.

Their ascent to power has coincided with the First Amendment being wielded as a shield against foreign regulations on digital platforms.

Free speech protections in the U.S. have been applied unequally, allowing authorities to suppress dissent in some cases while shielding hateful speech in others.

This imbalance extends to corporate power, with decades of legal precedent expanding protections for private interests. The case law cemented corporate speech protections, a logic later extended to digital platforms.

U.S. free speech advocates in Big Tech and the U.S. government are seemingly escalating this trend to an even more extreme interpretation: that American free speech arguments can be deployed to resist the regulation of other jurisdictions and challenge foreign legal frameworks.

For instance, in response to the European Union's Digital Services Act, U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, expressed concerns that the act could threaten American free speech principles.

Such an argument may have been fine if the same interpretation of free speech – and its appropriate protections – were universally accepted. But they are not.

The concept of free speech varies significantly across nations and regions.

Countries such as Brazil, Germany, France and others adopt what legal experts refer to as a proportionality-based approach to free speech, balancing it against other fundamental rights such as human dignity, democratic integrity and public order.

Sovereign countries using this approach recognize freedom of expression as a fundamental and preferential right. But they also acknowledge that certain restrictions are necessary to protect democratic institutions, marginalized communities, public health and the informational ecosystem from harms.

While the U.S. imposes some limits on speech – such as defamation laws and protection against incitement to imminent lawless action – the First Amendment is generally far more expansive than in other democracies.

The legal battle over platform regulation is not confined to the current battle between U.S.-based platforms and Brazil. The EU's Digital Services Act and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom are other examples of governments trying to assert control over platforms operating within their borders.

As such, the lawsuit by Trump Media and Rumble against the Brazilian Supreme Court signals a critical moment in global geopolitics.

U.S. tech giants, such as Meta, are bending to the free speech winds coming out of the Trump administration. Musk, the owner of X, has given support to far-right groups overseas.

And this overlap in the policy priorities of social media platforms and the political interests of the U.S. administration opens a new era in the deregulation debate in which U.S. free speech absolutists are seeking to establish legal precedents that might challenge the future of other nations' regulatory efforts.

As countries continue to develop regulatory frameworks for digital governance – for instance, AI regulation imposing stricter governance rules in Brazil and in the EU – the legal, economic and political strategies platforms employ to challenge oversight mechanisms will play a crucial role in determining the future balance between corporate influence and the rule of law.

A Russian negotiator said on Tuesday that Moscow would continue ""useful"" talks with the United States over the Ukraine conflict and would aim to involve the UN and other countries.

""We talked about everything, it was an intense dialogue, not easy, but very useful for us and the Americans,"" Grigory Karasin, told the state TASS news agency, adding that ""lots of problems were discussed"".

""Of course we are far from solving everything, from being in agreement on all points, but it seems that this type of discussion is very timely,"" he said.

""We will continue doing it, adding in the international community, above all the United Nations and certain countries,"" Karasin said.

He spoke a day after the US and Russian teams held 12 hours of talks in a luxury hotel in Saudi Arabia.

President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid end to the three-year war and hopes the latest round of talks in the Saudi capital will pave the way for a breakthrough.

Earlier, TASS cited a source saying that a joint statement on the talks would be published on Tuesday.

The Ukrainian negotiating team was staying in Riyadh for another day to meet with US representatives, a source in the delegation told Suspilne news, with another source also telling AFP a second meeting was likely -- a sign that progress may have been made.

A Japanese man wrongly convicted of murder who was the world's longest-serving death row inmate has been awarded $1.4 million in compensation, an official said Tuesday.

The payout represents 12,500 yen ($83) for each day of the more than four decades that Iwao Hakamada spent in detention, most of it on death row when each day could have been his last.

It is a record for compensation of this kind, Japanese media said.

The former boxer, now 89, was exonerated last year of a 1966 quadruple murder after a tireless campaign by his sister and others.

The case sparked scrutiny of the justice system in Japan, where gaining a retrial is notoriously hard and death row inmates are often informed of their impending death just a few hours before they are hanged.

The Shizuoka District Court, in a decision dated Monday, said that ""the claimant shall be granted 217,362,500 yen ($1.44 million),"" a court spokesman told AFP.

The same court ruled in September that Hakamada was not guilty in a retrial and that police had tampered with evidence.

Hakamada had suffered ""inhumane interrogations meant to force a statement (confession)"" that he later withdrew, the court said at the time.

Hakamada's legal team said the money falls short of the pain he suffered between his 1966 arrest and his release in 2014, when he was granted a retrial.

""I think the fact that he will receive it... compensates him a little bit for all the hardship,"" lawyer Hideyo Ogawa told a press conference.

""But in light of the hardship and suffering of the past 47 or 48 years, and given his current situation, I think it shows that the state has made mistakes that cannot be atoned for with 200 million yen,"" he said.

Decades of detention -- with the threat of execution constantly looming -- took a major toll on Hakamada's mental health, his lawyers have said, describing him as ""living in a world of fantasy"".

Hakamada was convicted of robbing and killing his boss, the man's wife and their two teenage children.

He initially denied the charges but police said Hakamada eventually confessed.

During his trial, Hakamada claimed innocence, saying that his confession was forced.

More than a year after the killings, investigators said they found blood-stained clothes -- a key piece of evidence that the court later said was planted by investigators.

Hakamada now lives with his sister with help from supporters.

Hakamada was the fifth death row inmate granted a retrial in Japan's post-war history. All four previous cases also resulted in exonerations.

Japan is the only major industrialised democracy other than the United States to retain capital punishment, a policy that has broad public support.

Japan's justice minister said in October that abolishing the death penalty would be ""inappropriate"" even after Hakamada's acquittal.

 By Nacho Doce and Charlie Devereux 

 AMIL, Spain, - The wildfires that used to burn each summer in the woods above the Spanish village of Barro have diminished to almost none since Lucia Perez started grazing wild horses there. 

 ""There used to be fires every year but since 2019 when we started coming here we've had one small fire in the first year and nothing since,"" said Perez, 37, explaining how by clearing the undergrowth between the trees the horses help stop fires igniting and spreading. 

 Fire prevention is one of several roles wild horses play in preserving the northwestern region of Galicia's delicate ecosystems, scientists say. But Europe's largest herd of wild horses has dwindled to less than half the 22,000 that roamed its mountains, forests and heathlands in the 1970s. 

 On the Serra da Groba heath 80 km southwest of Barro, a herd of wild horses feasts on the yellow flowers of gorse, ""selectively clearing"" a plant that is especially combustible, said Laura Lagos, a researcher at the University of A Coruna. 

 This allows other plants such as purple-flowering heather and white asphodels to thrive, she said. It also helps preserve the heather around peat bogs, abundant in sphagnum mosses, one of the most effective ecosystems for capturing carbon. 

 A 2021 study by the University of A Coruna, in which Lagos took part, found that grazing heathlands by wild horses was best for preventing wildfires while promoting plant biodiversity and capturing carbon, when compared to other potential uses of the land such as planting long-term pine forests, short-term Eucalyptus forests or grazing by domestic animals. 

 ""Studies show that where wild horses graze the heath's biodiversity increases,"" Lagos said. ""They are a fundamental part of the ecosystem. They benefit both the flora and the fauna associated with these open spaces."" 

 Grazing by sheep and cows can also prevent fires, but the horses have particular physiological characteristics that allow them to thrive in Galicia's terrain, including moustaches that appear designed to protect their lips from the prickly gorse. 

 ""They seem specially adapted to eat gorse and are hardy - a cow can't live year round on the heath,"" Lagos said. 

 NEOLITHIC ROCK CARVINGS 

 Drier, hotter weather due to climate change is increasing the frequency of wildfires in Galicia. The region lost 96,900 hectares through fires between 2001 and 2023, according to Global Forest Watch. 

 This has coincided with the proliferation in Galicia of the Eucalyptus tree, a pyrophyte species that depends on fires to help it release and spread seeds. Eucalyptus trees also reduce pasture for the horses as only ferns grow under them. 

 Brought from Australia to Galicia by a missionary in the 19th century, they have spread thanks to demand for their wood from local pulp mills and now account for 28% of all trees in Galicia, according to a local government study. 

 In September, the village of San Colmede was spared from a fire that ripped through 270 hectares of Eucalyptus and scrub in the surrounding hills thanks to grazing by animals and by the native oaks, sweet chestnuts and birches that grow near the village and burn more slowly, acting as a shield, said firefighter Cesar Leiros. 

 ""We saw the village surrounded by fire but thanks to native trees, the clearing we do, and the clearing our animals do, the village was saved,"" Leiros said. 

 Rock carvings depicting wild horses being hunted by men are evidence of their existence in Galicia dating back to the Neolithic period. 

 In time, humans and horses developed a relationship. Known as ""besteiros"" in the Galician dialect, people would look out for the health of the free-roaming horses in exchange for occasionally domesticating one or selling it for meat. 

 They would round up the horses once a year in events known as the ""rapa das bestas"" or ""shearing of the beasts"" to be deloused, vaccinated, and have their manes cut to make it harder for wolves to catch them. 

 These evolved into festivals, with the most famous in Sabucedo drawing thousands of tourists who come to see the horses wrestled to the ground to be treated. 

 'ECOLOGICAL JEWEL' 

 Perez, who works in a school, runs a smaller rapa with her stonemason husband Niko Souto, 41, in the village of Amil. They don't make a profit, she said. The proceeds help pay for fencing to stop the horses wandering onto roads or farmland. 

 Costs, including vet fees, insurance, fencing, microchipping and GPS equipment for tracking, are multiplying, Souto said. 

 The horses are classified as livestock and Javier Alvarez-Blazquez, a retired lawyer who owns ten horses in the Serra da Groba, wants new legislation that recognises their unique circumstances. 

 The Galician regional government should help besteiros cover some of the costs of looking after them, he said. The sale of a foal can generate 60 euros but it doesn't compensate for expenses - excluding insurance and erecting fencing - of about 100 euros a year per horse, he said. 

 Increasing the number of horses could even save the government money, said Melina Barrio, an economist at the University of Alcala. She estimates that each horse carries out clearing to prevent fires that would cost between 8,000 and 10,000 euros per year if humans did it. 

 Galicia's regional government acknowledged the role wild horses play in preventing forest fires and preserving ecosystems, but said that the current legislation was adequate for their conservation because the horses can generate an income by being sold or through tourism from the rapa festivals. 

 ""Although these animals are bred in the wild, in reality they have an owner and there is an economic benefit,"" the government said in an emailed statement. 

 ""In this sense, it is logical to consider horses as livestock, in accordance with European and Spanish legislation on the matter, and therefore they are not exempt from complying with obligations relating to health, animal welfare or herd control,"" it said. 

 Besteiros receive some help on costs, such as with the implanting of microchips for identification, the government added. 

 Carlos Souto, Niko's father, said the horses were descending from the hills more frequently in search of pasture as Eucalyptus plantations spread, meaning they needed more minding. 

 From visiting his horses once a week he is now going every morning, while Niko and Lucia go in the evening after work. 

 Niko said the horses were becoming used to their presence and their behaviour was changing - they were becoming less wild. 

 Alvarez-Blazquez said without the besteiros, the horses would die out, killed by cars or local farmers angry at the horses transgressing onto their crops and tree plantations. 

 ""We are guardians doing it as a hobby. Our only aim is to preserve this animal that we believe is an ecological jewel,"" he said.

Those who have taken to Istanbul's streets see the arrest of its mayor Ekrem Imamoglu as politically motivated, as he was formally arrested and jailed on the same day the Republican People's Party (CHP) was expected to vote him in as their presidential candidate for the 2028 elections.

Tuesday 25 March 2025 08:56, UK

Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered on the streets of Istanbul to protest against the arrest of the city's mayor - as he was due to be selected as an opposition candidate to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Ekrem Imamoglu, 54, was detained on corruption charges on 19 March - and was formally arrested and jailed five days later.

Those who have taken to the streets see Mr Imamoglu's detention as politically motivated, as he was sent to jail on the same day the Republican People's Party (CHP) was expected to vote him in as their presidential candidate for the 2028 elections.

Mr Erdogan's government has denied these claims, describing the demonstrations as ""street terror"", a ""disruption of public order"", and ""vandalism"".

They are thought to be the largest protests since the Gezi Park demonstrations in 2013, when around three million people took part.

Police used tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets as they tried to disperse crowds. More than 1,100 people have been detained since 19 March and 123 police officers have been injured, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said.

He added that materials including acid, firebombs and knives were seized by officers.

Why was Istanbul's mayor arrested?

According to state prosecutors, Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested on suspicion of ""establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data, and rigging a tender"".

They also questioned him on terrorism charges, alleging that he took part in an ""urban consensus initiative"" aimed at increasing the influence of Kurdish figures in municipal Turkish politics.

The prosecutors say the scheme was linked to the People's Democratic Congress (HDK), which is part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a proscribed terrorist group in Turkey, the UK, and the US.

Mr Imamoglu was detained alongside one of his aides and the mayors for Istanbul's Sisli and Beylikduzu districts.

It came four days before the CHP was due to hold its primary elections for the 2028 Turkish elections, in which Mr Imamoglu was their sole candidate. Although only 1.5 million delegates were eligible to vote, the party reportedly set up ""solidarity"" ballot boxes allowing others to show him their support.

According to CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, at least 13 million people submitted votes for him, in addition to the party members.

The day before his detention, Istanbul University revoked his degrees - in business administration and human resources management.

University bosses claim this was due to irregularities stemming from the fact he had transferred from a private university in northern Cyprus.

However, his supporters were quick to point out that this would prevent him from running for the presidency - as a university degree is among the essential criteria.

During a court hearing on Saturday, Mr Imamoglu described the claims against him as ""unimaginable accusations and slanders"".

""I strongly reject all allegations,"" he said, before being denied bail and moved to a prison west of Istanbul.

Speaking after the decision to charge his colleague, CHP leader Mr Ozel said: ""The only crime of Ekrem Imamoglu, who has been elected by 16 million Istanbulites three times, is to have defeated Recep Tayyip Erdogan and he has been arrested because he would win the next election.""

Mr Erdogan's office has denied these allegations - and accused the CHP of trying to ""disturb the peace and polarise our people"".

Why is he important? 

Mr Imamoglu was elected mayor of Istanbul in March 2019 - having served as mayor of Beylikduzu, a western district of the city, for five years previously.

It represented a huge blow for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan whose Justice and Development (AK) Party had controlled Istanbul for 25 years.

AK challenged the result, claiming irregularities, and demanded a re-run, which took place in June and which Mr Imamoglu also won.

Mr Imamoglu won a second five-year term as mayor in last year's mayoral election - with more than 50% of the vote.

On Sunday, Turkey's interior ministry said Mr Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a ""temporary measure"".

This was also seen by demonstrators as symbolic of the curbing of Turkish democracy and its rule of law.

What is the wider political situation in Turkey? 

Mr Erdogan came to power in 2003.

He served as prime minister until 2014 when he oversaw Turkey's move from a parliamentary to presidential system and became the country's first directly-elected president.

He has been re-elected twice - in the 2018 and 2023 elections. The current constitution would prevent him from running again but many believe he will amend the rules to stay in office.

During his tenure he has expanded presidential powers and reversed previous bids to make Turkey a more secular society - instead advocating for conservative, pro-religious positions.

World leaders and human rights organisations have voiced increasing concerns about Turkish democracy.

Human Rights Watch says Mr Erdogan's government has ""set back Turkey's human rights record by decades"".

They cite the ""targeting of perceived government critics and political opponents"", ""undermining the independence of the judiciary"" and ""hollowing out democratic institutions"".

Amnesty International claims he is responsible for ""baseless investigations, prosecutions and convictions of human rights defenders, journalists, and opposition politicians"".

The group says that anti-terrorism and disinformation laws have been used to ""curtail freedom of expression"" and ""unlawfully restrict freedom of assembly"".

Amid protests this week, public gatherings have been banned, parts of Istanbul's public transport network suspended, and authorities have ordered social media platform X to block more than 700 accounts, including those of news organisations, journalists and Turkish political figures.

At least eight reporters and photojournalists have been detained, according to the Disk-Basin-Is union, in what it called an ""attack on press freedoms and the people's right to learn the truth"".

Following the earthquakes in Turkey in February 2023, in which 15 million people were impacted and at least 50,000 people killed, 257 people were arrested for criticising the government response.

Mr Erdogan and his ministers have repeatedly denied allegations of autocracy.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

Ever since FBI Director Kash Patel published his personal article about his Hindu background on X, he created a widespread conversation about how his cultural roots shaped his leadership approach.

The article proved to be a quick hit, especially within the Indian American community and among the pro-MAGA crowds, for providing a rare look into a man's personal values whom the pro-American world knew for his rise in politics and his steadfast position against the “deep state”.

The piece, titled ‘FBI Director Kash Patel: A Hindu Warrior in Washington's Political Battlefield,' was published by India Tribune, a Chicago-based news website.

“Kashyap ‘Kash' Patel, 45, a Hindu and the son of Indian immigrants, now holds the most powerful law enforcement position in the United States: Director of the FBI,” the article begins with.

The article also reiterates Patel's family's history: how his father, Pramod Patel, fled Uganda in 1972 during the oppressive regime of Idi Amin and sought refugee first in India, and finally made his way to the States. His mother, Anjana Patel, originally from Tanzania, also moved to New York.

The FBI director was raised in a traditional Hindu household. “Kash's upbringing was rooted in the values of Hinduism—hard work, respect, and education—values that have influenced his worldview. His parents taught him to respect all religions, embodying the message of universal tolerance famously delivered by Swami Vivekananda in his 1893 speech at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago,” the India Tribune article reads.

Patel has promised to “restore justice and fairness, aiming to fix an FBI that has been criticized for its role in an American criminal justice system”

He underscored the importance of dharma (righteous duty), karma (action with accountability), and seva (selfless service), values that he believes guide his work in public service.

On the same day, Patel conducted his first official interview as FBI Director with Fox News, addressing some of the nation's most pressing security concerns. “I feel violent crime is out of control,” he stated.

While speaking with Trey Gowdy on Fox News ‘Sunday Night in America', Patel expressed how the FBI focuses on “sex trafficking, fentanyl and heroin overdoses, and violent crime in the form of gang murders and homicides and rapes.”

Rumours Swirl After Army Chief's Meetings, Terror Warning","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-coup-rumours-swirl-after-army-chief-general-wakar-uz-zamans-meetings-terror-warning-muhammad-yunus-8006623","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:52:03 GMT","

Social media is abuzz with rumours of a coup in Bangladesh after recent political developments and the deployment of military personnel and security forces across the country, especially in Dhaka. But neither Professor Muhammad Yunus nor Army Chief Waqar Uz Zaman have responded to the rumours, which seem to have gained traction over the last 24 hours.

General Wakar Uz Zaman is believed to be at the centre of these reported developments as Bangladesh's interim leader Md Yunus continues to face protests. 

Reports of Bangladesh army meetings have reinforced speculation that the Army Chief has had enough when it comes to the political situation in the country. The Army Chief has also warned against terrorist attacks and called for increased vigilance and security in the country.

General Zaman's meetings over the weekend with his top aides and comments from the ruling dispensation have led to political analysts assessing some friction between the government and the army chief. Sources say in the meetings, the Army Chief discussed security measures amid rising extremism in the country. 

However, Nasimul Haque Gani, Bangladesh's Interim government's Home Secretary, said talk of a declaration of emergency swirling around is ""gossip"".

Days ago, reports emerged in India about the Army Chief himself facing a coup, almost, from some of his own men with pro-Pakistani sentiments. But for now, General Zaman seems to have a firm grip on the army.

The Army Chief has, several times, hinted about failing law and order and a security build-up in Dhaka.

Asaduzzaman Fuad, the General Secretary of the student-led Aamar Bangladesh Party, accused the Army Chief of conspiring with President Mohammed Shahbuddin to install a new interim government.

""You can see the Army Chief holding certain so-called meetings and indulging in a new conspiracy. To see how, under the President, a new interim government can be formed. This president is a slave dog of Sheikh Hasina. If you try and run the country with Shahabuddin, lakhs of Abu Syeds will lay down our lives and blow up the cantonment. Don't engage in any controversy with Bangladesh,"" said Mr Fuad. Abu Syed, a student activist, died during pro-reform protests in July 2024, which escalated into a violent uprising and forced the exit of then prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her exile in India.

Talk of Asaduzzaman Fuad's arrest added fuel to possibility of a military takeover to rein in hardline forces in the country. However, the AB Party has denied the rumours of the arrest.

A video of the Army Chief's speech last month is viral once again amid speculation of a military coup. ""Later you will say I did not warn you, so I am warning you. If you cannot forget your differences and work together, if you keep mudslinging at each other, fight each other and kill each other, the country's and this community's freedom will go in vain,"" General Zaman said in that speech.

""I am telling you today otherwise you will say that I did not warn you. I am warning all of you. I have no other intentions, I have only one intention. I want to take leave after placing the country and people in a good place. I have had enough for the last seven to eight months.

Canada's spy service on Monday said India and China are likely to try to interfere in its upcoming general election, a charge that came amid its worsening relations with the two countries.

Addressing a press conference on the April 28 snap election, Vanessa Lloyd, the deputy director of operations at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), said that ""hostile state actors"" were increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to meddle in the polls, which were announced by the new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, on Sunday.

""The PRC (People's Republic of China) is highly likely to use AI-enabled tools to attempt to interfere with Canada's democratic process in this current election,"" she said.

China is also ""highly likely"" to use social media to promote narratives favourable to its interests - and to specifically target Chinese ethnic, cultural and religious communities in Canada using ""clandestine and deceptive"" means, Ms Lloyd said.

""We have also seen that the government of India has the intent and capability to interfere in Canadian communities and democratic processes to assert its geopolitical influence,"" she added.

The two countries, which have denied previous allegations of interference, have so far not responded to new charges.

In January, India rejected ""insinuations"" levelled by a Canadian commission report of interference in Ottawa's elections by certain foreign governments.

In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also hit back at Canada's interference in India's internal affairs.

""We reject the report's insinuations on India and expect that the support system enabling illegal migration will not be further countenanced,"" the statement read.

India's comments on a Canadian Commission's report:🔗 https://t.co/MksX55h7kr pic.twitter.com/58jzrx1X9P

Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail had alleged that New Delhi used proxy agents to provide ""clandestine financial support"" to candidates from three political parties in a federal election.

Ms Lloyd also said Russia and Pakistan could interfere in the Canadian general election.

Russia has tried to build ""dissemination networks"" across social media and news websites that ""amplify Kremlin talking points,"" she told reporters.

""It is possible that Russia will use these online networks to opportunistically conduct foreign information manipulation and interference operations directed at Canadians,"" she said. 

She also said that Islamabad could conduct foreign interference activities against Canada ""in line with its strategic aims"" to promote political, security and economic stability in Pakistan and ""to counter India's growing global influence"".

Tensions between India and Canada have simmered since former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's September 2023 allegation of New Delhi's involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

India dismissed the accusation as ""absurd.""

The row deepened when India expelled six Canadian diplomats and recalled its envoy to Ottawa after Canada attempted to question Indian officials as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar case.

Canada's relations with China have also worsened in recent years. Beijing this month announced tariffs on more than $2.6 billion worth of Canadian agricultural and food products, retaliating against levies Ottawa slapped on Chinese electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products last year.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

By 



      Rachel Treisman
    


As fallout from the Signal scandal continues, the leaders of several intelligence agencies — some of whom were part of the group chat that inadvertently shared war plans with a journalist — are set to testify before Congress this week.

The country's top two intelligence officials, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, are among the five officials expected to appear as witnesses in a pair of hearings in the intelligence committees of the Senate on Tuesday and the House on Wednesday.

The others are FBI Director Kash Patel, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse and Timothy Haugh, head of the National Security Agency and Central Security Service. 

The previously scheduled hearings, to be livestreamed on YouTube, were planned to focus on the latest edition of an annual assessment of worldwide threats to U.S. national security, mainly from China, Russia and Iran. But they are also likely to address a security concern that originated closer to home.

The hearings begin just a day after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, revealed that a top Trump administration official had added him to a group chat — on the encrypted messaging app Signal — about the U.S.' highly sensitive plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen earlier this month.

Gabbard and Ratcliffe were among the 18 individuals who participated in the text chain, a group that Goldberg said also included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Michael Waltz.

The National Security Council confirmed the authenticity of the message thread on Monday, saying it was ""reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain."" President Trump denied any knowledge of the incident when asked on Monday, and Hegseth told reporters that ""nobody was texting war plans.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized the security breach, with several Democrats calling for the participating officials to be investigated and disciplined. This week's hearings give Congress a chance to press intelligence leaders directly.

The incident raises questions about the Trump administration's handling of sensitive information.

Goldberg told NPR that he was not vetted before being added to the chat, where he was exposed to ""operational military information"" with details including targets, weapons and attack sequencing.

Such conversations are supposed to take place in what's known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), a secure room that top-ranking officials have in their offices and homes.

National security experts have voiced alarm that they instead used a publicly available messaging app. In fact, a 2023 Department of Defense memo specifically cited Signal as an example of an ""unmanaged"" messaging app that is not authorized to transmit non-public DOD information.

Democrats in Congress had roundly criticized many of Trump's security and intelligence picks for their perceived lack of experience during the nomination process — and are now calling for further investigation.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have publicly called for an investigation into what they respectively called ""this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach"" and the ""damage it created.""

""Everyone on the public WAR PLANS group text should immediately lose their security clearances and be fired,"" tweeted California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""Their idiocy just put a giant target on America. We are not safe.""

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters, ""We're very concerned about it, and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.""

While Republican lawmakers have largely downplayed the incident, several have been openly critical.

Rep. Don Bacon, R.-Neb., told CNN he thinks there should be accountability for what he called a ""security violation.""

""Everyone should know better than putting top secret war plans on an unclassified phone,"" he said.

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., tweeted that classified information should ""not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters.""

""Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again,"" he added.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump expressed confidence in his national security team Tuesday while Democrats in Congress demanded answers after an explosive report revealed top Trump administration discussing sensitive information about U.S. war plans in a Signal group chat with a journalist present.

The stunning security breach was revealed by The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in a first-hand account detailing how Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, mistakenly invited him into a chat on the app Signal that included 18 administration officials including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

Unaware the reporter was in the chat, the Trump officials plotted U.S. airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi sites in Yemen that took place March 15. The conversations culminated with Hegseth, hours before the airstrikes, sharing secret plans ‒ including targets and attack sequencing ‒ in the chat.

The inadvertent leak, by officials using the publicly available encrypted Signal messaging app, raises alarming questions about the potential mishandling of national security information, which federal law dictates should only be shared through the government's own approved secure platforms.

Here is what we know:

FBI Director Kash Patel said he was briefed about the Signal incident Monday night and again on Tuesday morning. 

“I don't have an update,” Patel said in response to Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner's question of whether the FBI had launched an investigation into the potential leak of classified information. 

Warner had asked Gabbard, seated to Patel's left in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, to confirm she was one of several senior officials a part of the group chat. 

“I'm not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said repeatedly, adding, “because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.” 

CIA Director John Ratcliffe, another reported member of the Signal chat, confirmed to Warner he was a member of the virtual group 

Trump officials used the chat to discuss preparations ‒ and concerns ‒ about plans to strike Houthi sites in Yemen in response to the Iran-backed militant group's repeated attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea that go back more than two years.

Vance told the group that he worried the planned airstrikes could undercut Trump's position on foreign policy affairs that impact Europe more than the US. At one point he said, ""I just hate bailing Europe out again.”

“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,"" Vance said in the chat. ""There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

It is unclear why Goldberg, a longtime Washington-based reporter and edit-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the chat of Trump officials.

Goldberg said he received a connection request from a Signal user with name Mike Waltz on March 13. Two days later, he was added to a chat called “Houthi PC small group.”

No one realized that Goldberg, whose username appeared as ""JG,"" had been added, Goldberg wrote.

Goldberg said he was initially suspicious about the chat, wary that it could be a hoax designed to entrap a reporter and skeptical top national security officials would be using a phone app to discuss such sensitive material. He said he realized it was authentic when the Yemen airstrike plans revealed by Hegseth came to fruition.

""I didn't think it could be real,"" The Atlantic article's headline said. ""Then the bombs started falling.""

Trump, in a phone interview Tuesday with NBC News, stood by Walz in his first substantive remarks on the stunning security breach. ""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" the president said.

Trump told NBC that Goldberg's presence in the chat had ""no impact at all"" on the military operation.

“It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,"" Trump said when asked what he was told about how Goldberg was added to the Signal chat.

Trump expressed confidence in his national security team despite the details revealed in The Atlantic's story, calling the situation ""the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.""

Warner wasted no time bringing up The Atlantic's scathing story in his opening remarks during the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing Tuesday morning on global threats to the United States. 

Warner, vice chairman of the committee, condemned the reported group chat of senior officials – which included Gabbard and Ratcliffe, who sat facing Warner and the committee as witnesses for the hearing. 

“Putting aside that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” Warner said, “it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check – security hygiene 101 – who are all the names? Who are they?” 

Added, by accident, to the chat was Goldberg. The Virginia senator called the error reckless and sloppy, and said it was emblematic of issues across the Trump administration.  

“If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer, and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired,” Warner said. “I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error.” 

Trump was charged with mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House when his first term concluded. A federal judge dismissed the indictment last summer and special counsel Jack Smith dropped his appeal to continue pursuing the federal criminal charges after Trump's presidential election victory last November.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth blamed the media on Monday for reports he shared military plans to an unclassified Signal chat. Speaking to reporters traveling with him as he landed in Hawaii for his first trip to the Indo-Pacific Hegseth said “nobody was texting war plans”.

President Donald Trump said Monday he knows “nothing” about his top national security officials inadvertently texting war plans about upcoming military strikes on Yemen to a group in a secure messaging app that included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Top national security officials for President Donald Trump, including his defense secretary, texted plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic, the magazine reported in a story posted online Monday. The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic.” 



Trump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach.

President Donald Trump said Monday he knows “nothing” about his top national security officials inadvertently texting war plans about upcoming military strikes on Yemen to a group in a secure messaging app that included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief.



The material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported.



It was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.



Just two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

The National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, it included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence. 



Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.



Hegseth in his first comments on the matter attacked Goldberg as “deceitful” and a “discredited so-called journalist” while alluding to previous critical reporting of Trump from the publication. He did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain. 



“Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he began his first trip to the Indo-Pacific as defense secretary. 



Trump on Tuesday in a brief interview with NBC News' Garrett Haake downplayed the incident as “the only glitch in two months” of his administration “and it turned out not to be a serious one.”



White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday said in post on X that no war plans were discussed and that “No classified material was sent to the thread.”



Leavitt said on Monday the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.”



Earlier Monday, Trump told reporters: “I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time.” He added that The Atlantic was “not much of a magazine.” 



By early evening, the president jokingly brushed it aside. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic' Where No One Will Ever See Them.”



Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, but it is not classified and can be hacked. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted messaging and voice call app is more secure than conventional texting. 



Leavitt said the White House counsel's office has provided guidance to Trump's top officials on a number platforms to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.







The sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth's office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information. 



Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted operational plans on an unclassified app.

The administration's handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.



“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.



“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.



He said American lives are “on the line. The carelessness shown by Trump's Cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”



Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.



Himes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday's previously scheduled committee hearing.



Some Republicans also expressed concerns.



Sen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday, “We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”



Reed said he would be speaking with Wicker about what the committee will do to “follow up” on the Signal leak. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants to learn more about what happened.



“Obviously, we got to to run it to the ground, figure out what went on there,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.



Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson offered a notably forgiving posture. 



“I think it would be a terrible mistake for there to be adverse consequences on any of the people that were involved in that call,” Johnson said. “They were trying to do a good job, the mission was accomplished with precision.”







The handling of national defense information is strictly governed by law under the century-old Espionage Act, including provisions that make it a crime to remove such information from its “proper place of custody” even through an act of gross negligence.



The Justice Department in 2015 and 2016 investigated whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law by communicating about classified information with her aides on a private email server she set up, though the FBI ultimately recommended against charges and none were brought.



In the Biden administration, some officials were given permission to download Signal on their White House-issued phones, but were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the Democratic administration.



The official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to communicate what they internally referred to as “tippers” to notify someone when they were away from the office or traveling overseas that they should check their “high side” inbox for a classified message.



The app was sometimes also used by officials during the Biden administration to communicate about scheduling of sensitive meetings or classified phone calls when they were outside the office, the official said.



The use of Signal became more prevalent during the last year of the Biden administration after federal law enforcement officials warned that China and Iran were hacking the White House as well as officials in the first Trump administration, according to the official.



The official was unaware of top Biden administration officials — such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan — using Signal to discuss sensitive plans as the Trump administration officials did.



Signal's encryption protocol is open source, meaning that it's freely available for anyone to inspect, use or modify. The encryption protocol is also used by another popular chat service, social media company Meta's WhatsApp platform.



Some of the toughest criticism targeted Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, said on social media that Hegseth, “the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in history, is demonstrating his incompetence by literally leaking classified war plans in the group chat.”







In the chain of messages, Vance questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of “a moderate to severe spike in oil prices” and if the timing of the operation might be a “mistake.”



“I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,” Vance argued. “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”



Vance also made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the U.S. by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.



“If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in a back-and-forth with Hegseth.



“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,” Hegseth replied. He added, “I think we should go.”



The vice president's communications director, William Martin, released a statement downplaying the debate. He said Vance “unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy.” 



Leavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

Former President Biden and Secretary of State Clinton drew their criticism.

Multiple Trump administration officials who allegedly held classified discussions on an open messaging platform have in the past condemned the mishandling of classified records by others, including former President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have called for ""consequences"" for individuals who improperly shared classified materials, regardless of their intention. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth lambasted Biden for ""flippantly"" mishandling classified documents and suggested that if he had behaved similarly, he would have expected to be ""court-martialed.""

The condemnatory language these senior administration officials have used about prior breaches of protocol in handling sensitive materials adds a layer of irony to what experts are calling an unconscionable misuse of classified information.

John Cohen, a former national security official in both Republican and Democratic administrations, said, ""from a security perspective, there is no scenario that justifies this type of information being discussed over a non-government controlled communication platform.""

""Communicating sensitive, operational information in this manner increases the likelihood of inappropriate disclosure which places military personnel at risk,"" said Cohen, who is also an ABC News contributor. ""There will also be questions about whether doing so violated statutes governing the safeguarding and retention of government information.""

More recently, many of these senior administration officials had much to say about the yearlong investigation into Biden's handling of classified materials. The investigation did not result in any charges.

In January 2023, Hegseth, than a ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-host, appeared on Fox News and called Biden's actions ""nefarious, sloppy and dumb.""

""If the top man in the job was handling classified documents this flippantly for that long, why was that the case? Was it really that he didn't know? When you take something out of the SCIF [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility] if you're a senator, you know exactly what you're doing. You had to sneak it out,"" he said. The report included photos of boxes, including one damaged one that contained classified materials, including documents about Afghanistan that was found in the garage of Biden's home in Delaware ""near a collapsed dog crate, a dog bed, a Zappos box, an empty bucket, a broken lamp wrapped with duct tape, potting soil, and synthetic firewood.""

In January 2023, Rubio, also appeared on Fox News, where he said, ""Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting -- it's a problem, I don't care who did it.""

During her tenure as secretary of state, Clinton drew controversy by using a private email server for official public communications rather than using official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. The way many officials reacted has come back to haunt them.

In 2016, Hegseth told Fox News, ""If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now... because the assumption is in the intelligence community, if you are using unclassified means, there is likelihood that foreign governments are targeting those accounts.""

Reacting to a Politico article on Clinton, Waltz, who apparently added Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, to the Signal chat, criticized the Department of Justice for its handling of the situation.

""Biden's sitting National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sent Top Secret messages to Hillary Clinton's private account. And what did DOJ do about it? Not a damn thing,"" Waltz said.

In January 2016, Rubio also appeared on Fox News, demanding that Clinton to be held accountable.

""Nobody is above the law … people are going to be accountable if they broke the laws of this country,"" he said.

In August 2022 Stephen Miller, now Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy who was also in the Signal chat group, also posted his thoughts on X reacting to the Clinton email scandal.

""One point that doesn't get made enough about Hillary's unsecure server illegally used to conduct state business (obviously created to hide the Clintons' corrupt pay-for-play): foreign adversaries could easily hack classified ops & intel in real time from other sides of the globe,"" he said.

Only two weeks ago, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced a crackdown on leaks within the intelligence community.

""Any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such,"" she said in a press release.

The Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a Signal group chat with top Trump officials addressing secret war plans. Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest from the White House.

President Donald Trump is not planning to fire national security advisor Mike Waltz in the wake of The Atlantic's reporting of an apparent national security breach, Fox News has learned.

""He's not getting fired,"" Trump told Fox News. The president said the incident was a ""mistake,"" though there was ""nothing important"" in the Signal text thread. 

The president described Waltz as a ""good guy"" and added that the ""attack was a success,"" referring to the U.S. operation against the Houthis in Yemen that was discussed on the text chain between senior Cabinet officials. 

A source close to the president previously told Fox News that Waltz's job is safe and that he is not on the chopping block. 

Fox News is told Waltz has no plans to resign and is sticking to his schedule Tuesday. He will be talking to his Russian counterpart about a Black Sea ceasefire deal and has plans to speak to Trump as usual later Tuesday.

Waltz is also telling colleagues that he has never met or talked to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, Fox News has learned.

TRUMP OFFICIALS ACCIDENTALLY TEXT ATLANTIC JOURNALIST ABOUT MILITARY STRIKES IN APPARENT SECURITY BREACH

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a new statement on Tuesday. The National Security Council earlier said The Atlantic's report referenced what appeared to be an ""authentic message chain."" 

""Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin,"" Leavitt wrote, before offering three ""facts about his latest story."" Leavitt said no ""war plans"" were discussed, no classified material was sent to the thread and that the White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for the president's top officials to communicate ""as safely and efficiently as possible."" 

""As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread,"" Leavitt said. ""Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump.""

A senior White House official earlier revealed to Fox News how Goldberg may have been added to the Signal text chain with Cabinet members.

The official said that he had never met and had never spoken to Goldberg. Somehow, Goldberg's number was added to one of the members of the list, the senior official said, noting that Signal is allowed in multiple agencies. 

It appears that Goldberg's number was added to a contact card by one of the Trump administration staffers, Fox News has learned. The chat had Cabinet officials plus some of those officials' staffers.

WILL CAIN SHARES HIS TAKEAWAY ON THE ATLANTIC'S STORY ON THE TRUMP ADMIN'S 'WAR PLANS' TEXT

Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are calling for Waltz's ouster over the breach. 

""This is an outrageous national security breach and heads should roll. We need a full investigation and hearing into this on the House Armed Services Committee, ASAP,"" Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., wrote on X. 

""We can't chalk this up to a simple mistake — people should be fired for this,"" Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., told Axios. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth blasted The Atlantic article, telling reporters on Monday that ""nobody was texting war plans."" 

Hegseth billed Goldberg as a ""deceitful and highly discredited journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.""

Goldberg appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday morning to discuss the contents of the text chain. The reporter said Vice President JD Vance ""asserted his disagreement"" with Trump in front of other Cabinet members believed to be on the text chain and ""articulated a view that the president didn't understand the consequences or stakes."" 

""I think it's notable that the vice president of the United States is telling members of the Cabinet that I don't think the president understands,"" Goldberg said. ""I just think it's noteworthy, just my journalistic perspective, that the vice president is, is being so, so blunt about that. But it's a very it's a substantive policy disagreement on some levels."" 

A person on the chat labeled ""SM,"" believed to be Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, pushed back in the chat and the conversation seemed to defer to the president's ultimate judgment. 

Goldberg further categorized the chat as ""obviously very focused on getting Europe to pay for the strikes on the Houthis and a lot of resentment directed at Europe for not having the capacity to defend shipping lanes that are affected by the Houthis.""

Goldberg made the point to MSNBC that lower levels of the armed forces must adhere to cybersecurity and social media rules. 

""And you can go to jail,"" Goldberg said. ""You can go to Leavenworth for mishandling what we would consider to be minor classified information.""

He also defended The Atlantic, as administration officials have categorized it as a failing publication. 

""We're a profitable magazine. We have more than 1.2 million paid subscribers. We have tremendous web traffic. And we are completely self-funded at this point. It's going really great,"" Goldberg said.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration's top intelligence officials are facing Congress this week to offer their first testimony in office about the threats confronting the United States and tackle urgent questions about the security breach that unfolded when war plans were mistakenly leaked to a journalist.

In the first, by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia denounced what he called a pattern of “careless, incompetent behavior” by the Trump administration with regard to the handling of sensitive information.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling” that no one thought to check the participants on the group chat, said Warner, the panel's top Democrat.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are among the witnesses appearing Tuesday before the Senate panel and again Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing is taking place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Republican administration, including Ratcliffe, Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” Goldberg reported. The strikes began two hours after Goldberg received the details.




“Horrified” by the leak of what is historically strictly guarded information, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, said he will be demanding answers in Wednesday's hearing.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration. 

Former FBI Director Christopher Wray routinely has said he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career when the United States faced so many elevated threats at once, but the concerns he more regularly highlighted had to do with sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism.

“We have to change to the dynamic threat landscape that is changing constantly not just in America but abroad,” Patel said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, citing the elevated threat from “narco-traffickers.” But, he added, “we're not going to forget or ignore national security — never.” 

The hearings are also unfolding against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine. 

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with President Donald Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”

Top U.S. intelligence officials face Congress one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a Signal group chat that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials are facing Congress for back-to-back hearings this week to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

Other news we're following today:



As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.

One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.

“That's what Signal was supposed to be for,” then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.

Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.

While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.

Frank Bisignano, a self-professed “DOGE person,” is facing the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday for his confirmation hearing to serve as commissioner of the beleaguered Social Security Administration.

Bisignano was asked by several Democratic lawmakers during the hearing whether the Trump Administration plans to privatize Social Security or cut recipients' benefits.

When asked by one lawmaker, “Do you think social security should be privatized?” Bisignano responded: “I've never heard a word of it, and I've never thought about it.”

The agency has taken center stage in the debate over Department of Government Efficiency cuts to taxpayer services.

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, asked Ratcliffe and Gabbard whether the chat mentioned targets, weapons, specific units or timing of the strike on Yemen.

“I don't remember a mention of specific targets,” Gabbard said. “I believe there was discussion around targets, in general.”

“I think that's consistent with my recollection,” Ratcliffe said when Kelly asked him the same question.

Democrats have asked for an investigation into the leak, which Ratcliffe and Gabbard have said contained no classified information.

Senate Democrats are calling for further investigations and possible resignations following news that top national security officials texted military plans to a group chat that included Jeff Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, told CIA Director John Ratcliffe that the leak was an “embarrassment” and asked whether it was “just a normal day at the CIA?”

“Don't insult the intelligence of the American people,” Bennet told Ratcliffe before asking how Goldberg was added to the chat. “Did he invite himself to the Signal thread?”

“I don't know how he was invited,” Ratcliffe said in response. “Clearly, he was added to the Signal group.”

The video of the joke German group chat, posted on Tuesday to social media, is chasing clout from the fallout over a story published by The Atlantic about top U.S. security officials texting war plans to a group chat that included a journalist.

In the satire, five government bureaucrats message with “Chef” — German for “boss” — in a chat that spans from the rare good weather to the intricacies of Tuesday's transition between the old and new parliamentarians. 

Naturally, Germany's infamous bureaucracy — which the texters are proud of — plays a starring role.

The chat closes with the colleagues lamenting their lives in civil service and sending emojis that included a superhero and a hand's nails being painted — a nod to Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, and his use in his chat of the emojis for a fist, an American flag, and fire.

Four protesters interrupted the hearing in Congress to decry former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's ardent support for Israel. 

One blew a shofar, and another shouted, “I am a proud American Jew!” and then “Let Palestinians live!”

Police quickly grabbed the protesters, but their shouts could still be momentarily heard in the Senate hallway.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said on Tuesday he would defer to the White House on whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or National Security Adviser Michael Waltz should face repercussions over war plans that were texted in a group chat that included a journalist. 

“But I think we should be critical,” he said. 

“The fact that classified information was put on an unclassified system, I think the secretary of defense needs to answer for that,” Bacon added.

He dismissed the need for an Armed Services committee investigation.

Bacon also called the White House's saying that no war plans were shared “baloney.”

“They ought to just be honest and own up to it,” Bacon said.

Bacon served nearly thirty years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, specializing in electronic warfare and intelligence.

“My communications to be clear in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe told lawmakers during a Senate hearing on global security threats.

Democrats have said the leaked military plans in a Signal group message that included a journalist show a sloppy disregard for security, but Ratcliffe said no rules were violated.

During heated questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said there's a difference between “inadvertent” releases of information and intentional leaks.

“There was no classified material that was shared,” Gabbard said.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said China has heavily invested in stealth aircraft, hypersonic weapons and nuclear arms and is looking to outcompete the U.S. when it comes to artificial intelligence.

Noting Russia's large nuclear arsenal, she called the country a “formidable competitor.” She added that while Iran is not currently seeking to build a nuclear weapon, it has become a critical supplier of weapons to Russia.

And North Korea, she said, remains committed to pursuing military capabilities that would allow it to strike U.S. forces in the region or the U.S. homeland.

Gabbard's remarks came during her testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee during a hearing on worldwide threats to the U.S.

“These actors are in some cases working together in different areas to target U.S. interests,” Gabbard told lawmakers.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, blasted Pentagon and intelligence officials for engaging in the chat, which he said revealed secret information about U.S. plans to strike Yemen.

Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the leak “sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior.” 

Warner said that if a lower ranking officer had texted similar secret plans, “They would be fired.”

The comments came at the start of a Senate hearing featuring testimony from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel.

The Arkansas Republican delivered an opening statement in which he ticked through a litany of challenges facing the United States from a report on worldwide threats.

Cotton asked, “Are our intelligence agencies well-postured facing against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is ‘no,' at least not yet.”

Cotton said that after years of “drift,” the intelligence community “must recommit” to what he said is its core mission of “collecting clandestine intelligence from adversaries.”

Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the committee, called the report “one of the most complicated and challenging” during his 14 years on the panel.

The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has told the leaders of America's intelligence community that it has become too bureaucratic and political to keep up with emerging national security threats.

“As the world has become more dangerous, our intelligence agencies have gotten more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we have been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said in his opening statement.

At the hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are likely to face questions after it emerged that Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other national security officials texted war plans to a group chat that included a reporter.

The federal lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in New York by the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent members of Columbia's faculty. The groups allege the Trump administration violated free speech laws and federal procedures when it cut $400 million in funding for Columbia over allegations of antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.

Tolerating that at Columbia risks turning other colleges into “servile arms of the government, advancing only the political preferences of the latest president in order to secure federal funding,” the lawsuit says.

The Education Department did not immediately comment.

Columbia on Friday agreed to several demands from the administration as a condition for restoring its federal funding. It put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhauled its rules for protests and student discipline, measures that the suit calls an unprecedented intrusion on the school's autonomy.

The Atlantic editor-in-chief's account of being added to a Signal group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised questions about how highly sensitive information is supposed to be handled.

The National Security Council has since said the text chain “appears to be authentic” and that it is looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain.

Signal is an app that can be used for direct messaging and group chats as well as phone and video calls.

It uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services that prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls.

In a social media post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “war plans” were not discussed and that no classified material was sent to the thread.

She said the counsel's office has provided guidance on different platforms that Trump's top officials can use to communicate “safely and efficiently.”

Leavitt reiterated that the National Security Council is looking into how a telephone number for Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, was added to the thread.

She said U.S. military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen were successful, “terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump.”

Since plunging during the COVID-19 pandemic, international student enrollment in the U.S. has been rebounding — a relief to American universities that count on their tuition payments. Two months into the new Trump administration, educators fear that could soon change.

Unnerved by efforts to deport students over political views, students from other countries already in the U.S. have felt new pressure to watch what they say.

Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. As the U.S. government takes a harder line on immigration, cuts federal research funding and begins policing campus activism, students are left to wonder if they'll be able to get visas, travel freely, pursue research or even express an opinion.

Some students are waiting to see how policy changes will play out, while others already have deferred admission offers for fall 2025, he said. Student social networks are active, and news about immigration-related developments in America — like a Republican proposal to prevent Chinese students from studying in the U.S. — spreads quickly.

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas says the news that several top Trump national security officials texted war plans in a group chat that included a journalist on a secure messaging app will come up.

But Cotton said on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” that he'd like to keep the focus on the subject for the hearing, which is threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the officials set to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

When Ash Lazarus Orr went to renew his passport in early January, the transgender organizer figured it would be relatively routine.

But more than two months on, Orr is waiting to get a new passport with a name change and a sex designation reflecting who he is. The delay has prevented him from traveling overseas to receive gender-affirming care this month in Ireland since he refuses to get a passport that lists an “inaccurate sex designation.”

Orr blames the delay on President Donald Trump, who on the day he took office issued an executive order banning the use of the “X” marker as well as the changing of gender markers.

“This is preventing me from having an accurate identification and the freedom to move about the country as well as internationally,” said Orr, who is among seven plaintiffs — five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs — who have sued the Trump administration in federal court over the policy.

Whether to return to the federal workforce is a decision confronting thousands of fired employees after two judges this month found legal problems with how Trump is carrying out a dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government. One ruling by a California federal judge would reinstate 16,000 probationary employees.

On Monday, the Trump administration sought to stop giving fired workers any choice by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the rehiring orders. It was not clear how quickly the nation's high court could rule on the emergency appeal, which argued that U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, went beyond his legal authority.

Although it is unknown how many federal workers are taking up the offers to return to work, some employees have already decided to move on, fearing more reductions down the road.

Others who were asked to return were immediately put on administrative leave, with full pay and benefits, or offered early retirement. For those who chose to return, some say the decision came down to their dedication to the work and a belief that what they do is important.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week, their first opportunity since being sworn in to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration.

The Trump administration on Monday invoked a “state secrets privilege” and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law — a case that has become a flashpoint amid escalating tension with the federal courts.

The declaration comes as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg weighs whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process.

Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm “diplomatic and national security concerns.”

Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that national security adviser Mike Waltz, a former congressman from Florida, should not resign after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, reported on text messages he received this month via the Signal app from top officials detailing U.S. military plans in Yemen.

“Should Mike Waltz resign? Absolutely not. He's exceptionally qualified for the job. He is trusted, trustworthy. Was an extraordinary legislator, but he is, he was made for that, that job, and I have full confidence in him,” Johnson said today on Capitol Hill.

Johnson added he has been told that the administration is determining how Goldberg's number was included and that officials will “improve the process.”

Pressed about discussing classified information on the messaging app, Johnson said it would be a ""terrible mistake"" for those involved to face ""adverse consequences.""

“They were trying to do a good job. The mission was accomplished with precision. I think that's what matters in the end,"" he said.

A decade ago this month, America found out that Hillary Clinton used a private email server to communicate while serving as secretary of state — and later that a handful of the messages had classified markings.

The revelations dogged her 2016 presidential campaign, leading to a lengthy FBI investigation and Trump's promise to put her in prison — “lock her up!” his rally crowds chanted — if he won. He was the victor, but he didn't pursue a tough-to-win prosecution of Clinton.

Now, two months into Trump's second presidency, the top officials in his administration were discussing sensitive military operations using a commercial, encrypted cellphone app called Signal, The Atlantic reported today.

Sharing the article on X, Clinton was quick to suggest more than a whit of hypocrisy in the actions of Trump's national security officials — some of whom harshly criticized her for mishandling classified information and not properly following federal document-preservation laws.

Attorney General Pam Bondi defended a Trump administration decision over deportation flights and directly took aim at U.S. District Judge Boasberg during a Fox News interview tonight.

""Judge James Boasberg is trying to control our entire federal policy, our foreign policy, everything we do, one single district judge,"" Bondi told host Sean Hannity.

""I'm fairly confident we will be successful, and this judge will be knocked down in his ruling, his very poor ruling,"" she added.

The comments come after an appeals court hearing this afternoon in a case that centers on the Trump administration deporting immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act after Boasberg temporarily blocked the flights.

Bondi predicted yesterday that the Supreme Court ""will get involved"" in the case and also criticized Boasberg.

Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment.

The Trump administration is refusing to disclose the details of deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act by invoking the state secrets privilege, according to a new court filing tonight.

The administration's filing included declarations from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Rubio said in his statement that disclosing further information about the deportation flights “threatens significant harm to the United States' foreign affairs and national security interests.”

He added that doing so could cause “foreign state governments to face internal and international pressure,” making them and others less likely to “work cooperatively with the United States in the future.”

The court filing is in response to a deadline of tomorrow set by the judge in the case on whether the administration was invoking the state secrets privilege in this case.

In his first public comments since The Atlantic story broke today, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth came out swinging. But rather than address the alleged classified information shared on an unclassified app, Hegseth took aim at journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote the story.

Asked how information about war plans was shared with a journalist and whether the information was classified, Hegseth went after Goldberg, calling him a ""so-called journalist.""

Asked why military details were shared on Signal and how he found out a journalist was on the chain, Hegseth said: “I've heard I was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that.”

He then walked away from reporters.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., faces mounting pressure from Trump and some of his allies in Congress to impeach judges who are blocking his agenda.

But legislation introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., could provide Johnson with an off-ramp, allowing his members to voice their support for Trump on the issue while avoiding politically perilous impeachment votes that are all but doomed to fail.

Issa's bill, the “No Rogue Rulings Act,” would bar district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, the sort of rulings that have hampered Trump's fully enacting his plans on issues from deportation to federal agency cuts two months into the new administration. Johnson, a former constitutional attorney, threw his support behind the bill over the weekend.

“We have a major malfunction in our federal judiciary, and practically every week another judge casts aside the tradition of restraint from the bench and opts to be the Trump resistance in robes,” Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, told NBC News today.

Republican leaders have grown privately alarmed about the massive fundraising disparity their candidate, Randy Fine, faces in a special House election in a deep-red Florida district and have swooped in to help resuscitate his campaign at the eleventh hour.

House GOP leaders have in recent days been calling donors to plead for financial help in the race to fill the seat previously held by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security adviser, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. In addition, Fine, a state senator, has made personal pleas to Florida-based lobbyists and donors for a quick infusion of cash, according to two sources familiar with those conversations, ahead of the April 1 election.

While party leaders in both Washington and Florida are ultimately confident that Fine will pull off a victory, Republicans say they're frustrated that they need to intervene in a district that Trump won by 30 percentage points last year.

Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., who leads the House GOP's campaign arm, said Fine “needs to do better” on his fundraising. But Hudson was confident Republicans would hold onto the seat, and said he did not expect the National Republican Congressional Committee to spend in the race.

Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden. Rosie O'Donnell. Trump has a long list of foes, and this weekend he added another: a painting of himself.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump blasted a portrait of him that has been hanging in the Colorado state Capitol and demanded its removal.

“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump claimed in a lengthy post last night.

He added that he “would much prefer not having a picture than having this one.”

Today, he got his wish.

For Democrats, reaching male voters became a political necessity after last fall's election, when young men swung significantly toward Trump.

But for some — like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore — it's also a personal goal. The first-term governor, who has spoken about his own struggles as a teenager, recently announced plans to direct his “entire administration” to find ways to help struggling boys and men.

“The well-being of our young men and boys has not been a societal priority,” Moore said in an interview. “I want Maryland to be the one that is aggressive and unapologetic about being able to address it and being able to fix it.”

Moore's not the only Democrat vowing to help boys and men.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in a statement that he will retire today as the Postal Service's top official.

""After nearly five years as America's 75th Postmaster General, and after informing the Governors in February of my intention to retire, I have today informed the Postal Service Board of Governors that today will be my last day in this role,"" DeJoy said.

DeJoy said that he has been working closely with his deputy, Douglas Tulino, in preparation for the transition, noting that Tulino will serve as interim postmaster general until the board of governors names a permanent successor.

""The Governors have hired a search firm in support of those efforts, which are well underway,"" DeJoy added.

NBC News reported last month that the board is preparing for a possible takeover of the USPS. Trump told reporters last month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would be ""looking"" at the Postal Service, which has been a target of Republican criticism for years.

Trump announced this afternoon that he is nominating Susan Monarez, the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to permanently lead the public health agency.

The White House withdrew the nomination of Dr. Dave Weldon, a Republican for congressman from Florida, shortly before his Senate confirmation hearing three weeks ago.

“Dr. Monarez brings decades of experience championing Innovation, Transparency, and strong Public Health Systems,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that Monarez will “work closely” with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if she is confirmed.

The White House said it was reviewing how the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine was accidentally added to a group text in which people who appeared to be members of the Trump administration discussed plans to launch airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen.

“At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the National Security Council said in a statement.

The statement was in response to an article published today by The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, a veteran national security and foreign affairs journalist. Goldberg reported he had been added to a group chat called “Houthi PC small group” on March 13 via Signal, an encrypted messaging service widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications.

Trump said in remarks from the White House Roosevelt Room this afternoon that the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai is opening a steel plant in Louisiana. 

Trump said that Hyundai is announcing a $5.8 billion investment in American manufacturing by building a new steel plant in the state, which he said would produce more than 1,400 jobs. 

""This will be Hyundai's first-ever steel mill in the United States, one of the largest companies in the world, by the way, supplying steel for its auto parts and auto plants in Alabama and Georgia, which will soon produce more than 1 million American made cars every single year,"" he said. ""The cars are coming into this country at levels never seen before.""

The automaker's factory was part of a broader investment in the U.S. Trump claimed that the announcement is a ""clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work."" South Korea had requested an exemption from the tariffs the administration has imposed on other major trading partners.

India said its overseas nationals must “comply with local laws and regulations” after reports last week that a Georgetown University graduate student from India had been taken into custody and targeted for deportation by the Trump administration.

“When it comes to visa and immigration policy, it is something that lies within the sovereign functions of a country,” Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, told reporters on Friday. 

The Department of Homeland Security has accused Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow who teaches at Georgetown, of making pro-Hamas and antisemitic comments, which his lawyer denies, calling Suri's detention “beyond contemptible.”

Suri's deportation has been blocked by a federal judge in Virginia who has ordered that he not be removed from the country without court approval.

The judge presiding over the Alien Enemies Act case today denied the government's request to lift his hold on deportations under the rarely used wartime law, despite President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on him and his order. 

Denying the government's order to vacate his rulings, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that the Venezuelan nationals the administration wants to deport under the law should likely be given the opportunity to challenge allegations that they're members of the Tren de Aragua gang first.

The decision came just hours before a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments that the deportations should be allowed to continue while it considers the government's appeal of Boasberg's ruling.

Former Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, announced this morning that he's launching a nonprofit group called the Dignity of Work Institute. 

The Democrat, who lost his re-election bid in November for a fourth Senate term, said in a post on X that the group's goal is to create an economy where people are rewarded for their work. 

""Whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge, work for tips or a salary, care for a child or for an aging parent, your work has dignity,"" he said. ""Today I'm launching the Dignity of Work Institute to create an economy where Americans' work is valued, where they benefit from the wealth they create, and where everyone can afford a decent living. Let's make workers the winners in our economy.""

In a video launching the group, Brown argued that Americans aren't rewarded for their work appropriately as corporate profits increase and wages remain flat.

""While workers are more productive than ever, costs keep rising and it's impossible to get ahead. The system is rigged,"" he said. 

Former acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, who served under Biden, will sit on the group's advisory board.

The campaign for Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, said today it raised more than $17 million in the latest reporting period.

Crawford's latest haul will bring her overall fundraising total to $24 million, which the campaign says is a record-high for any judicial candidate in U.S. history.

The April 1 contest will determine the court's ideological balance for the second time in two years, and likely the future of several issues related to abortion rights, unions and congressional maps. 

The race is already the most expensive state Supreme Court campaign ever. More than $80 million had been spent as of Friday, according to WisPolitics.com. The majority of that has been spent by outside groups or disseminated through the state's political parties.

The Crawford campaign released its totals early; the deadline for the latest reporting period (from Feb. 4 to March 17) is tonight. Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate in the technically nonpartisan race, has not yet announced his latest fundraising haul

Schimel received an endorsement last Friday from Trump and has been the beneficiary of millions of dollars spent in the race by groups affiliated with Elon Musk. 

In a statement, Crawford tied her fundraising total to the role those groups have played in the race.

“I'm grateful for the historic outpouring of grassroots support across Wisconsin from folks who don't want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court,"" Crawford said in the statement. ""I'm humbly asking Wisconsinites for their vote on April 1 as we fight back against Musk and Schimel's corruption and extremism.”

Pete Hegseth will make his first trip to Asia as defense secretary this week, visiting key U.S. allies the Philippines and Japan, the Pentagon said.

In the Philippines, which is facing growing military aggression from China in the South China Sea, Hegseth will meet with his Philippine counterpart as well as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., local media reported. In Japan, he will meet with Japanese leaders and U.S. forces and participate in a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the fiercest battles in World War II.

“These engagements will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our alliances and partnerships toward our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. 

Before arriving in the Philippines, Hegseth will travel to Hawaii to meet with leaders of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam to tour military facilities.

There are no winners in a trade war between the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, the Chinese premier told a group that included seven U.S. executives and a pro-Trump senator. 

“China always welcomes companies from all over the world, including the United States, to share development opportunities in China, and will actively address their legitimate demands, treat domestic and foreign companies as equals, and continue to foster a sound business environment,” Premier Li Qiang, China's No. 2 official, said at a meeting yesterday in Beijing.

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump returned to the White House, emphasized Trump's call for China to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors and to end their “devastating” impact on Americans, a spokesperson for Daines said. Trump has cited the fentanyl crisis as justification for tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.

The Chinese premier's comments echoed those made over the weekend by Chinese ambassador to the U.S. Xie Feng, who told a U.S.-China relations forum by video link that ""weaponizing tariffs would be a boomerang that only backfires,"" according to the Chinese embassy website.

Trump posted on social media that he plans to implement “secondary tariffs” on Venezuela that would require any country purchasing oil or gas from them to face a 25% tariff on goods imported to the United States.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, a mild-mannered moderate, issued a fiery statement slamming Elon Musk and the Trump administration for recent actions curtailing the Social Security Administration, which include the removal of workers and office closures.

“The Trump Administration's callous indifference to the millions of Americans who rely on the monthly Social Security checks they have earned — and the millions more Americans who are relying on social security for their planned retirements — is the most direct assault on this vital program in its almost 100 year history. It is disrespectful, destructive, and dangerous,” King said.

“Social Security is not social media; this ‘move fast and break things' approach they seem to be following is a betrayal of the public trust,” King said in a statement. “The President has said repeatedly, during the campaign and since, that he would protect social security — but what's happening now in his name is anything but protection, and he should put a stop to it.”

Musk's actions on Social Security have sparked an elevated level of concern among Republicans, who have looked the other way on various other “DOGE” activities. It's particularly salient in King's home state of Maine, where the agency initially issued — then rescinded — an order that would make it harder for parents to register newborns for Social Security numbers at hospitals.

King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, added: “When the Trump White House and its corporate-suite cabinet sends reckless DOGE computer engineers into the Social Security networks, threaten cuts to the committed workforce who carefully manage this system, make it harder for citizens to interact with that workforce, or scoff at older Americans justifiably worried about late payments — as one of his billionaire cabinet members did just this week — this dismissive public stance frightens the very people who literally built this country, and who deserve a hell of a lot better.'

President says national adviser Mike Waltz had ‘learned a lesson'; senate intelligence committee chair criticizes handling of classified information

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Democratic senator Mark Kelly of Arizona pressed Gabbard and Ratcliffe on whether the information on the Signal chat was classified or not.

“Decisional strike deliberations should be conducted through classified channels,” Ratcliffe said, answering Kelly's question as to whether or not launching a strike on another country counts as classified information.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dodged questions about her involvement in the Signal group chat to which an Atlantic journalist was added.

“Senator, I don't want to get into this,” Gabbard said when Senator Mark Warner asked if she had participated in the chat.

She has repeatedly said there was no classified information in the conversation.

Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel declined to say whether the bureau would investigate claims that cabinet members improperly leaked national security information in the chat.

“I was just briefed about it late last night, this morning. I don't have an update”, said Patel.

Warner asked for an update “by the end of the day”.

Senator Angus King pressed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on why climate change was not included as a national security threat in the report.

“We recognize environmental changes and their potential impact on operations, but our focus remains on the direct threats to people's health, wellbeing, and security,” Gabbard said.

King rebutted by saying that climate change exacerbates mass migration, famine, displacement, and political violence.

Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, should resign amid Monday's leak.

Wyden called the Signal chat “obviously reckless, obviously dangerous, both the mishandling of classified information and the deliberate destruction of federal records or potential crimes that ought to be investigated immediately”.

“I'm of the view that there ought to be resignation, starting with the national security adviser and the secretary of defense, Director Radcliffe and Director Gabbard,” Wyden said.

Democratic senator Mark Warner grilled Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen.

Gabbard claims that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

Ratcliffe said that, when he was confirmed as CIA director, he was briefed by agency officials about “the use of Signal as a permissible work use” and “a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration”.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, delivered the intelligence community's annual threat assessment, listing China's military, Mexico's drug trade and Russia's nuclear weapons among some of the most alarming threats to the country's national security.

Before FBI director Kash Patel began his remarks, a protester yelled “Stop funding Israel!”

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, called the protester a “lunatic”.

Democratic senator Mark Warner went on to describe the leaking of the Yemen war plans in a Signal group chat as part of a pattern of actions taken by the second Trump administration that weakens US national security.

“I can just say this. If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired, as I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error,” said Warner, the Senate intelligence committee's vice-chairman.

He outlined a litany of grievances against the Trump administration, from its cancellation of foreign aid to its firing of probationary federal employees.

“No, the Signal fiasco is not a one-off. It is, unfortunately, a pattern we're seeing too often repeated. I fear that we feel the erosion of trust, from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners, [which] can't be put back in the bottle overnight. Make no mistake, these actions make America less safe,” he said.

The committee's Republican chair, Tom Cotton, largely confined his opening remarks to warning of the threats posed from traditional enemies such as Iran and China, while implying that the intelligence community had lost its focus under Joe Biden.

“Given these threats, we have to ask, are our intelligence agencies well postured against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is no, at least not yet. As the world became more dangerous in recent years, our intelligence agencies got more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions rather than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we've been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said.

News that the Atlantic's top editor was added to a group chat where US national security officials discussed their plans to bomb Yemen is looming over the Senate intelligence committee's annual hearing into global threats facing the United States.

Among the guests at the hearing are two reported members of the group chat, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, the CIA director. As the hearing began, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee, condemned the leak.

“Yesterday, we stunningly learned that senior members of this administration, and according to reports, two of our witnesses here today, were members of a group chat that discussed highly sensitive, likely classified information that supposedly even included weapons packages, targets and timing, and included the name of an active CIA agent,” Warner said.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me, all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101.”

Warner called Monday's leak “one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information”. He also called it a “pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information”.

“The erosion of trust from our workplace, from our companies, and from our allies and partners can't be put back in the bottle overnight,” he added.

Democratic senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, began his remarks by condemning the reckless use of a messaging app to discuss a sensitive military strike in Yemen.

“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” he said, “it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody bothered to even check security hygiene 101. Who are all the names? Who are they? Well, it apparently included a journalist.”

The Senate intelligence committee has started its “World Wide Threats” hearing.

The hearing comes a day after the controversial leak of deliberations by JD Vance and other top-level Trump administration officials over a strike against the Houthis in Yemen via a messaging app.

Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, director of the FBI, are appearing before the panel.

US President Donald Trump has commented on the group chat security leak, dismissing it as a leak to NBC News.

Trump, told NBC News in a phone call that it was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, adding his national security advisor Michael Waltz had “learned a lesson”.

It is unlikely this will placate critics of the president who see this leak as a serious breach of national security.

Yesterday, Donald Trump said he was unaware of the alleged US data breach, but he did share a joke his close ally Elon Musk made on X in a post on his Truth Social platform.

The UK's deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has reacted to the alleged US data breach.

Rayner told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that she “doesn't have much more to add” in response to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly accusing Europe of “free-loading” off the US.

Rayner said, “I don't recognise that there is a challenge between the UK and US relations, they are as strong as they've always been.”

Rayner added that “people say things in private messaging” and insisted it was “for the vice-president to decide and to clarify what he means by those conversations”.

My colleague Peter Beaumont has noted five things US adversaries could learn from today's White House leaks.

“Friendly and hostile governments alike will also have learned that what Vance, Hegseth and others say in public – in disparaging Europe, for example – they say in private, too.

“Any notion that the Trump administration's bark is worse than its bite should be thoroughly disabused by the contempt expressed by Vance for Europe and by the transactional nature of the conversation.”

Downing Street has rejected suggestions that Britain is a “freeloading” country that expects the US to meet its defence needs.

At the lobby briefing this morning, prime minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson spoke at length about the contribution the UK makes to joint military operations with the Americans, following the extraordinary leak of messages showing the contempt President Trump's most senior allies have for Europe's record on defence.

But the spokesperson also refused to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical, JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary.

At the lobby briefing this morning, asked if Britain was a pathetic freeloader, the PM's spokesperson replied:

You can see, from the way in which the UK has worked closely with the US, supplying regional security and defence, our commitment to working with the US on matters of regional security.

You'll know the UK provided air-to-air refuelling support for recent strikes against Houthi key rebel targets [the raid discussed in the messages inadvertently shared with Godlberg].

We also continue to support the US-led coalition against Daesh with routine combat air patrol over Iraq and Syria.

And we'll continue to work with the US and other allies to ensure stability and security in the Middle East.

Asked again if Britons were freeloaders, the spokesperson repeated the point about the UK working with the US closely in the Middle East.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them. The briefing will take place at 10 a.m. ET.

The hearing comes a day after The Atlantic magazine reported that top national security officials for Trump, including his defense secretary, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat that included the magazine's editor-in-chief in a secure messaging app.

Here's the Latest:

Senate Democrats are calling for further investigations and possible resignations following news that top national security officials texted military plans to a group chat that included Jeff Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, told CIA Director John Ratcliffe that the leak was an “embarrassment” and asked whether it was “just a normal day at the CIA?”

“Don't insult the intelligence of the American people,” Bennet told Ratcliffe before asking how Goldberg was added to the chat. “Did he invite himself to the Signal thread?”

“I don't know how he was invited,” Ratcliffe said in response. “Clearly, he was added to the Signal group.”

Four protesters interrupted the hearing in Congress to decry former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's ardent support for Israel.

One blew a shofar, and another shouted, “I am a proud American Jew!” and then “Let Palestinians live!”

Police quickly grabbed the protesters, but their shouts could still be momentarily heard in the Senate hallway.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said on Tuesday he would defer to the White House on whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or National Security Adviser Michael Waltz should face repercussions over war plans that were texted in a group chat that included a journalist.

“But I think we should be critical,” he said.

“The fact that classified information was put on an unclassified system, I think the secretary of defense needs to answer for that,” Bacon added.

He dismissed the need for an Armed Services committee investigation, simply because the facts were apparent.

Bacon also called the White House's saying that no war plans were shared “baloney.”

“They ought to just be honest and own up to it,” Bacon said.

Bacon served nearly thirty years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, specializing in electronic warfare and intelligence.

“My communications to be clear in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information,” CIA Director John Ratcliffe told lawmakers during a Senate hearing on global security threats.

Democrats have said the leaked military plans in a Signal group message that included a journalist show a sloppy disregard for security, but Ratcliffe said no rules were violated.

During heated questions from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said there's a difference between “inadvertent” releases of information and intentional leaks.

“There was no classified material that was shared,” Gabbard said.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said China has heavily invested in stealth aircraft, hypersonic weapons and nuclear arms and is looking to outcompete the U.S. when it comes to artificial intelligence.

Noting Russia's large nuclear arsenal, she called the country a “formidable competitor.” She added that while Iran is not currently seeking to build a nuclear weapon, it has become a critical supplier of weapons to Russia.

And North Korea, she said, remains committed to pursuing military capabilities that would allow it to strike U.S. forces in the region or the U.S. homeland.

Gabbard's remarks came during her testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee during a hearing on worldwide threats to the U.S.

“These actors are in some cases working together in different areas to target U.S. interests,” Gabbard told lawmakers.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., blasted Pentagon and intelligence officials for engaging in the chat, which he said revealed secret information about U.S. plans to strike Yemen.

Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the leak “sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior.”

Warner said that if a lower ranking officer had texted similar secret plans, “They would be fired.”

The comments came at the start of a Senate hearing featuring testimony from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel.

The Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has told the leaders of America's intelligence community that it has become too bureaucratic and political to keep up with emerging national security threats.

“As the world has become more dangerous, our intelligence agencies have gotten more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions than gathering facts. As a result of these misplaced priorities, we have been caught off guard and left in the dark too often,” Cotton said in his opening statement.

At the hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are likely to face questions after it emerged that Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other national security officials texted war plans to a group chat that included a reporter.

The Arkansas Republican delivered an opening statement in which he ticked through a litany of challenges facing the United States from a report on worldwide threats.

Cotton asked, “Are our intelligence agencies well-postured facing against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is ‘no,' at least not yet.”

Cotton said that after years of “drift,” the intelligence community “must recommit” to what he said is its core mission of “collecting clandestine intelligence from adversaries.”

Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the committee, called the report “one of the most complicated and challenging” during his 14 years on the panel.

The federal lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in New York by the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, which represent members of Columbia's faculty. The groups allege the Trump administration violated free speech laws and federal procedures when it cut $400 million in funding for Columbia over allegations of antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.

Tolerating that at Columbia risks turning other colleges into “servile arms of the government, advancing only the political preferences of the latest president in order to secure federal funding,” the lawsuit says.

The Education Department did not immediately comment.

Columbia on Friday agreed to several demands from the administration as a condition for restoring its federal funding. It put its Middle East studies department under new supervision and overhauled its rules for protests and student discipline, measures that the suit calls an unprecedented intrusion on the school's autonomy.

The Atlantic editor-in-chief's account of being added to a Signal group chat of U.S. national security officials coordinating plans for airstrikes has raised questions about how highly sensitive information is supposed to be handled.

The National Security Council has since said the text chain “appears to be authentic” and that it is looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain.

Signal is an app that can be used for direct messaging and group chats as well as phone and video calls.

Signal uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services that prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls.

In a social media post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “war plans” were not discussed and that no classified material was sent to the thread.

She said the counsel's office has provided guidance on different platforms that Trump's top officials can use to communicate “safely and efficiently.”

Leavitt reiterated that the National Security Council is looking into how a telephone number for Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief, was added to the thread.

She said U.S. military strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen were successful, “terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump.”

Since plunging during the COVID-19 pandemic, international student enrollment in the U.S. has been rebounding — a relief to American universities that count on their tuition payments. Two months into the new Trump administration, educators fear that could soon change.

Unnerved by efforts to deport students over political views, students from other countries already in the U.S. have felt new pressure to watch what they say.

Educators worry it's a balancing act that will turn off foreign students. As the U.S. government takes a harder line on immigration, cuts federal research funding and begins policing campus activism, students are left to wonder if they'll be able to get visas, travel freely, pursue research or even express an opinion.

Some students are waiting to see how policy changes will play out, while others already have deferred admission offers for fall 2025, he said. Student social networks are active, and news about immigration-related developments in America — like a Republican proposal to prevent Chinese students from studying in the U.S. — spreads quickly.

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas says the news that several top Trump national security officials texted war plans in a group chat that included a journalist on a secure messaging app will come up.

But Cotton said on Fox News Channel's “Fox & Friends” that he'd like to keep the focus on the subject for the hearing, which is threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the officials set to appear on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

When Ash Lazarus Orr went to renew his passport in early January, the transgender organizer figured it would be relatively routine.

But more than two months on, Orr is waiting to get a new passport with a name change and a sex designation reflecting who he is. The delay has prevented him from traveling overseas to receive gender-affirming care this month in Ireland since he refuses to get a passport that lists an “inaccurate sex designation.”

Orr blames the delay on President Donald Trump, who on the day he took office issued an executive order banning the use of the “X” marker as well as the changing of gender markers.

“This is preventing me from having an accurate identification and the freedom to move about the country as well as internationally,” said Orr, who is among seven plaintiffs — five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs — who have sued the Trump administration in federal court over the policy.

Whether to return to the federal workforce is a decision confronting thousands of fired employees after two judges this month found legal problems with how Trump is carrying out a dramatic downsizing of the U.S. government. One ruling by a California federal judge would reinstate 16,000 probationary employees.

On Monday, the Trump administration sought to stop giving fired workers any choice by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the rehiring orders. It was not clear how quickly the nation's high court could rule on the emergency appeal, which argued that U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, went beyond his legal authority.

Although it is unknown how many federal workers are taking up the offers to return to work, some employees have already decided to move on, fearing more reductions down the road.

Others who were asked to return were immediately put on administrative leave, with full pay and benefits, or offered early retirement. For those who chose to return, some say the decision came down to their dedication to the work and a belief that what they do is important.

Trump and Vance are scheduled to have lunch in the White House private dining room at 12:30 p.m. ET, according to the White House. Later, Trump is expected to sign executive orders at 2 p.m. ET.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week, their first opportunity since being sworn in to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and on Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration.

The Trump administration on Monday invoked a “state secrets privilege” and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law — a case that has become a flashpoint amid escalating tension with the federal courts.

The declaration comes as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg weighs whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process.

Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm “diplomatic and national security concerns.”

Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.

The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's top intelligence officials face Congress for back-to-back hearings this week, their first opportunity since being sworn in to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.

Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration. 

Former FBI Director Christopher Wray routinely has said he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career when the United States faced so many elevated threats at once, but the concerns he more regularly highlighted had to do with sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism.

“We have to change to the dynamic threat landscape that is changing constantly not just in America but abroad,” Patel said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, citing the elevated threat from “narco-traffickers."" But, he added, “we're not going to forget or ignore national security — never.” 

The hearings are also unfolding against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine. 

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with President Donald Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”

Washington — Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.

As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named ""Pete Hegseth"" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about ""weapons packages, targets, and timing"" of the attack shortly before it took place.

The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be ""authentic"" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.

""At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,"" a National Security Council spokesman said.  ""The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.""

When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.

""I don't know anything about it,"" the president responded. ""I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.""

In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president ""continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz."" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz ""has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.""

Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified. 

""Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,"" Hegseth said. 

Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X that no ""classified"" material or ""war plans"" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.

In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name ""Mike Waltz"" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled ""Houthi PC small group,"" which he took to be a reference to a ""principals committee,"" or group of high-ranking officials. 

The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, according to Goldberg.

Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been ""part of a disinformation campaign"" or an effort to embarrass journalists. 

""I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,"" Goldberg wrote. 

The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would ""suffer the consequences"" of additional strikes. 

On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name ""JD Vance"" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security. 

""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,"" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. ""I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""

Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: ""VP: I understand your concerns — and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what — nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.""

On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because ""the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility."" 

""What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,"" Goldberg wrote. 

Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET. 

""So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,"" he wrote.

He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others: 

""The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,"" Goldberg continued. ""No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left — or, more to the point, who I was.""

At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.

""Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.""

Goldberg told CBS News: ""People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me — they like convenience. They're just like you and me — they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.""

CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.

""By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans — and that could put our own troops in harm's way,"" Vinograd said. 

The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.

Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, ""represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.""

""Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,"" Reed said in a statement. ""I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.""

At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.

""The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,"" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed ""top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.""

GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that ""we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.""

""This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,"" Bacon said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news","Top US officials appeared to message a journalist Houthi strike plans","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4v3ndg28jo","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 03:22:29 GMT","

The Trump administration is facing political uproar after the White House confirmed that a journalist had been inadvertently added to an unsecure group chat in which US national security officials planned a military strike in Yemen.

The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a Signal message group which apparently included Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.

He said he had seen classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck. 

The report sparked a firestorm of criticism from opposition Democrats and concerns among several Republicans.

Goldberg said he had been added to the message chain, apparently by accident, after receiving a connection request from someone who appeared to be White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz. 

""If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn't somebody who supported the Houthis, because they were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people who were involved in that operation,"" he told PBS in an interview. 

President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday afternoon that he was not aware of the Atlantic article.

""The attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. 

""President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.""



The defence secretary also defended the military operation discussed in the chat, citing its success. When pressed by reporters, Hegseth criticised Goldberg as a ""deceitful and highly discredited"" journalist and resisted questions about the content of the messages. 

House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said the breach had been a mistake, but argued that the chat showed ""top level officials doing their job, doing it well"".

Democratic lawmakers demanded an investigation, casting the episode as a national security scandal.

""This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said his panel planned to investigate the matter.

""It's definitely a concern,"" he added. ""It appears that mistakes were made.""

Atlantic editor-in-chief Goldberg writes in his article that he received a connection request on 11 March on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be Waltz's.

Goldberg said he was then added to a chat entitled ""Houthi PC small group"".

He had initially wondered if the messages in the chat might be a hoax until four days later, Saturday 15 March, when he was sitting in a supermarket car park, watching Signal communications about a strike.

When he checked X for updates about Yemen, he wrote, he was stunned to see reports of explosions in the capital city of Sanaa.

A Houthi official posted on X at the time that 53 people had been killed in the US air strikes.

Signal is generally used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and to send disappearing messages.

A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the 18-person chat, Goldberg reported.

Accounts labelled ""JD Vance"", the name of the vice-president; ""Pete Hegseth,"" the defence secretary; and ""John Ratcliffe,"" director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chain. 

Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared in it, including Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

At one point during the communications over the strikes, the account labelled ""JD Vance"" seemed to disagree with Trump, Goldberg reported.

""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,"" the Vance account wrote at approximately 8:15 on 14 March.

""There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. 

""I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. 

""But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""

In a statement to the BBC on Monday, Vance spokesman William Martin said the vice-president ""unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy"". 

""The president and the vice-president have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement,"" Martin said.

The National Security Council confirmed much of the Atlantic report.

Spokesman Brian Hughes told the BBC: ""At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic. We are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.

""The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy co-ordination between senior officials.""

Goldberg reported that the officials had also discussed the potential for Europe to pay for US protection of key shipping lanes.

""Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes,"" the account associated with Waltz wrote on 14 March.

The message continued, saying that at Trump's request, his team was working with the defence department and state department ""to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans"".

At one point in the thread the Vance account griped that the strikes would benefit the Europeans, because of their reliance on those shipping lanes, adding: ""I just hate bailing Europe out again."" 

The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: ""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.""

It is a significant move given that the Haqqani network is accused of carrying out some of the most high-profile and deadly attacks in Afghanistan during the US-led war in the country.

Some of the key reactions to reports that a journalist was inadvertently added to a chat with high-level Trump officials discussing air strikes in Yemen.

The Trump administration has been clamping down on students who have attended pro-Palestinian protests.

The Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday morning meet for its ""Worldwide Threats"" hearing, an annual intelligence community oversight hearing with testimony from the heads of the intel agencies, and the first opportunity for top Trump Administration officials to testify about the threats facing the United States and what the government is doing to counter them.

The hearing comes hours after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, reportedly texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg.

The National Security Council said the text chain, which appeared to take place on messaging app Signal, “appears to be authentic.”

The group chat reportedly included two of the officials scheduled to testify at Tuesday's hearing: Director of National Intelligence Tusli Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, NBC News reported. Senators said they expect questions regarding The Atlantic's reporting. 

Ahead of the hearings, here's what we know about the reported group text, and where things stand. 

The material in the text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” Goldberg reported.



It was not immediately clear if the specifics of the military operation were classified, but they often are and at the least are kept secure to protect service members and operational security. The U.S. has conducted airstrikes against the Houthis since the militant group began targeting commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea in November 2023.

Just two hours after Goldberg received the details of the attack on March 15, the U.S. began launching a series of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.

Vice President J.D. Vance in the chain of the messages questioned whether Americans would understand the importance of strikes that came with the risk of “a moderate to severe spike in oil prices” and if the timing of the operation might be a “mistake.”

“I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,” Vance argued. “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”

Vance also made the case that Europe would benefit much more than the U.S. by the action aimed at decimating the Houthis and securing Red Sea shipping lanes.

“If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said in a back-and-forth with Hegseth.

“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,” Hegseth replied. He added, “I think we should go.”

The National Security Council said in a statement that it was looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain in the Signal group chat. In addition to Hegseth, it included Vance, Gabbard and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, who was also in the group chat.

President Trump initially told reporters he was not aware that the highly sensitive information had been shared, 2 1/2 hours after it was reported. He later appeared to joke about the breach. He amplified a social media posting from Elon Musk spotlighting a conservative satirical news site article with the cutting headline: “4D Chess: Trump Leaks War Plans to ‘The Atlantic' Where No One Will Ever See Them.""

In a statement late Monday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the president still has the “utmost confidence” in Waltz and the national security team.

Hegseth, in his first comments on the matter, did not shed light on why Signal was being used to discuss the sensitive operation or how Goldberg ended up on the message chain.

“Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said in an exchange with reporters after landing in Hawaii on Monday as he makes his way to the Asia Pacific on his first overseas travel as defense secretary. 

""You're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist whos made profession of pedaling hoaxes time and time again,"" Hegseth added.

The sharing of sensitive information comes as Hegseth's office has just announced a crackdown on leaks of sensitive information, including the potential use of polygraphs on defense personnel to determine how reporters have received information.

Sean Parnell, a spokesman for Hegseth, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on why the defense secretary posted war operational plans on an unclassified app.

The administration's handling of the highly sensitive information was swiftly condemned by Democratic lawmakers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called for a full investigation.

“This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a floor speech Monday afternoon.

“If true, this story represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a statement.

He said American lives are “on the line.""

""The carelessness shown by Trump's Cabinet is stunning and dangerous,"" he said. ""I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.”

Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he was “horrified” by the reports.

Himes said if a lower-ranking official “did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation. The American people deserve answers,” which he said he planned to get at Wednesday's previously scheduled committee hearing.

Some Republicans also expressed concerns.

Sen. Roger Wicker, the Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday, “We're very concerned about it and we'll be looking into it on a bipartisan basis.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he wants to learn more about what happened.

“Obviously, we got to run it to the ground, figure out what went on there,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.

Some of the toughest criticism targeted Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, said on social media that Hegseth, “the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in history, is demonstrating his incompetence by literally leaking classified war plans in the group chat.”

The handling of national defense information is strictly governed by law under the century-old Espionage Act, including provisions that make it a crime to remove such information from its “proper place of custody” even through an act of gross negligence.

The Justice Department in 2015 and 2016 investigated whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law by communicating about classified information with her aides on a private email server she set up, though the FBI ultimately recommended against charges and none were brought.

In the Biden administration, some officials were given permission to download Signal on their White House-issued phones, but were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the Democratic administration.

The official, who requested anonymity to speak about methods used to share sensitive information, said Signal was most commonly used to communicate what they internally referred to as “tippers” to notify someone when they were away from the office or traveling overseas that they should check their “high side” inbox for a classified message.

The app was sometimes also used by officials during the Biden administration to communicate about scheduling of sensitive meetings or classified phone calls when they were outside the office, the official said.

The use of Signal became more prevalent during the last year of the Biden administration after federal law enforcement officials warned that China and Iran were hacking the White House as well as officials in the first Trump administration, according to the official.

The official was unaware of top Biden administration officials — such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan — using Signal to discuss sensitive plans as the Trump administration officials did.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcchicago.com', 'title': 'NBC Chicago'}"

Oops, something went wrong

By Echo Wang and Alexandra Alper

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cerebras Systems executives were hoping the Trump administration would wave through a national security review that has left the AI chipmaker's IPO in limbo for months, five sources familiar with the matter said.

Instead, the company's highly anticipated listing has been delayed further as executives wait for the White House to fill key appointments and to wrap up the review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential.

The most recent delay, which has not been previously reported, is the latest example of how bets that U.S. President Donald Trump would be a boon for dealmaking have not panned out for Wall Street so far.

CFIUS, which is led by the Treasury Department, reviews foreign investment in American companies for national security risks. The sticking point for California-based Cerebras is CFIUS's review of a $335 million investment by Abu Dhabi-based cloud computing and AI company G42. The UAE company's past ties to China have drawn scrutiny in Washington before, but its stake in Cerebras appeared poised for approval late last year.

Cerebras, a smaller competitor to industry leader Nvidia in the booming AI chip market, faces risks in going public without clarity on G42's investment, two of the sources said. Investors like certainty, and without it, raising money on the open markets becomes more complicated.

With the change at the White House just two months ago, key political positions remain unfilled, including the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security, who oversees CFIUS. While career and political staff currently in place have the authority to approve the deal, the inclusion of G42 made it politically risky over its past ties to China's Huawei, several CFIUS attorneys said.

CFIUS staffers might be even less inclined to risk a controversial approval on big, politically sensitive deals after seeing billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency cut thousands of workers in a bid to slash federal payrolls and root out disloyalty, national security lawyers said.

Career staff also need to establish trust with the new administration on delicate national security issues, said Jim Secreto, a former Treasury and Commerce official in the Biden administration.

“With a new administration, CFIUS staff naturally want to brief incoming policymakers and get their sign off before moving forward with a high-profile case,” he said. “That's a delicate and difficult dance, especially with an administration who has been so openly hostile to nonpartisan technical experts they refer to as the 'deep state,'"" he added.

Cerebras and the Treasury Department declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. It is not unusual for presidents to take months to fill non-cabinet-level positions at key agencies.

G42 declined to comment on the CFIUS process. ""G42's progress in the U.S. and in key European markets reflects the growing confidence in our role collectively building the Intelligence Grid for responsible AI,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.

TOUGH ON CHINA

The easier regulatory environment envisioned by bankers and CEOs when Republican Trump took office from former Democratic President Joe Biden is not panning out as well as many had hoped, corporate executives and dealmakers say.

The Biden administration expanded CFIUS enforcement and created new rules governing U.S. investment in Chinese high-tech companies, and the Trump administration is unlikely to scale any of that back, Jason Chipman, a partner at law firm WilmerHale, wrote in a February analysis.

""Indeed, it is more likely that the new Trump team will build on Biden's efforts to aggressively evaluate inbound and outbound investment, particularly with regard to China,"" he said.

While Trump laid out new parameters last month that ""fast-track"" foreign investments in U.S. companies, they further restrict those coming from China, particularly in strategic sectors like tech.

That is bad news for companies like G42, which is a major investor in and the largest customer of Cerebras. It had close ties with China's Huawei before Microsoft gave it $1.5 billion. To get the investment cleared, it had to cut Huawei off and sign a national security agreement with the U.S. last year.

Despite the holdup, Cerebras executives remain confident that the deal will eventually go through and intend to proceed with the IPO once it receives approval, according to three people familiar with their thinking.

Cerebras and G42 jointly filed to notify CFIUS of the investment. They later amended the filing, stating that the shares G42 would acquire are non-voting securities, which they argued should not be subject to CFIUS review.

Last September, the companies requested to withdraw the filing altogether, and CFIUS is now considering that request, according to Cerebras' IPO filing.

Cerebras, valued at about $8 billion following G42's investment commitment in May last year, has since nearly doubled its valuation, one of the people said. If the investment wins approval, G42 would end up with a stake of more than 5% in the company.

Cerebras is currently building a series of AI data centers for G42, and its technology has been used to train the Arabic large language model that Microsoft is using in its Azure AI platform.

            Samsung Electronics co-CEO Han Jong-Hee died from cardiac arrest on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson for the South Korean tech giant. Han was 63.
    


            Born in 1962, Han had overseen Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile devices businesses since 2022, according to the company. He was named Samsung Electronics vice chairman and CEO in 2022. Han's co-CEO, Jun Young-Hyun, was appointed to the position last week.
    


            The spokesperson told CNN that Jun, who has been leading the semiconductor business, would be the company's sole CEO after Han's death.
    


            In an internal message seen by CNN, Samsung paid tribute to Han, saying he had dedicated more than 37 years of his life to leading Samsung's TV business to become a global leader. As the head of its electronics and appliances businesses, he also contributed to the company's growth amid a “challenging business environment.”
    


            “Our deepest condolences are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time,” the message said.
    


            The electronics giant has run into significant headwinds in recent years. Its logic semiconductor business trails contract chipmaking industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) both in terms of ramping up production of cutting-edge chips and securing major customers.
    


            On the memory side of the chip business, which has long been a strength for Samsung, analysts say it has fallen behind South Korean rival Hynix in the market for high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which has contributed to a slump in its share price. HBM chips are essential for the graphic processing units created by the likes of Nvidia.
    


            During an annual meeting with investors last week, which he chaired, Han apologized for the performance of Samsung stock and warned of a difficult 2025 because of uncertainties around the economic policies of major economies, according to Reuters. He added that Samsung would seek “meaningful” mergers and acquisitions deals this year to support the company's growth.
    


            “There are some difficulties in doing semiconductor M&As due to regulatory issues and various national interests, but we're determined to produce some tangible results this year,” he was quoted as saying.
    


            Han joined the company in 1988 after earning a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Inha University. Prior to running Samsung's electronics and devices division, he was in charge of the display operation.
    


            Han was “central” in rolling out Samsung's LED TVs, which, along with other innovations of his, helped the company “continually demonstrate technology leadership,” Samsung said in a company biography published last week.

Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD has reported annual revenue for 2024 that has leapfrogged rival Tesla.

The Shenzhen-based firm says revenue rose by 29% to come in at 777 billion yuan ($107bn; £83bn), boosted by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This topped the $97.7bn reported by Elon Musk's Tesla.

BYD has also just launched a lower-priced car to rival Tesla's Model 3, which has long been the top selling EV in China.

It comes as Tesla faces a backlash around the world over Musk's ties to US President Donald Trump, while Chinese carmakers have been hit with tariffs in Western countries.

BYD sold around the same number of EVs as Tesla last year – 1.76 million compared to 1.79 million, respectively.

But when sales of the Chinese company's hybrid cars are taken into account it is much bigger, selling a record 4.3 million vehicles globally in 2024.

On Sunday, BYD announced a new model to take on Tesla.

Its Qin L model has a starting price in China of 119,800 yuan, while a basic version of Tesla's Model 3 is priced at 235,500 yuan.

It comes as Chinese consumers are cutting spending in the face of economic challenges, including a property crisis, slowing growth, and high local government debt.

Last week, BYD's founder Wang Chuanfu announced new battery charging technology, which he said could charge an EV in five minutes.

That compares with around 15 minutes to charge a Tesla using its supercharger system.

In February, BYD announced that its so-called ""God's Eye"" advanced driver-assistance technology would be available free in all its models.

Shares in the firm, which is backed by veteran US investor Warren Buffett, have jumped by more than 50% so far this year.

A backlash against Musk and his carmaker has gathered momentum since he was appointed head of the Trump administration's Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been tasked with slashing federal government spending.

Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, including giving his backing to far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election and criticising UK politicians such as Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Meanwhile, China's EV manufacturers have been targeted with tariffs in large parts of the world, including the US and the European Union.

Liberal Democrat MPs met with management and union representatives in Oxford.

The release of five Mintz Group staff members comes as China tries to attract foreign investments.

Alice Guo's star was on the rise in the Philippines - until alleged links to a scam operation led to her downfall.

The new InstaVolt Superhub in Winchester is located near the A34 and junction 9 of the M3.

India and China are natural competitors but developments in strained ties can help with easing diplomatic tensions.

            Spinning bright red handkerchiefs and dancing in step to folk music, more than a dozen human-like robots took to China's biggest stage in January, making a splashy debut at the annual Lunar New Year gala.
    


            The remarkable performance, watched by more than a billion people, is a high-profile reminder of how far Chinese humanoid robots have come. Over the past two months, videos of the country's humanoid robots pulling off moves such as bike rides, roundhouse kicks and side flips have blown up the internet, often amplified by state media as a key potential driver of economic growth.
    


            Even though very few of the humanoids are in mass production, competition with Elon Musk's Tesla, one of the acknowledged frontrunners in the field, is heating up. The promise of an “I, Robot” future, where machines handle household chores and serve as caregivers, has drawn nearly every major tech company in both the United States and China to bet on humanoids or robotics.
    


            Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have invested in American humanoid maker Figure AI. Meanwhile, Meta is planning major investments in humanoids, according to a Bloomberg report last month.
    


            Musk, whose Optimus humanoid has sparked global interest since its debut in 2022, predicted last month that the project alone could generate more than $10 trillion in revenue.
    


            While it may take another five to 10 years for humanoid robots to make a real societal impact, they could eventually become the next widely adopted consumer electronics, according to Xi Ning, chair professor of robotics and automation at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            “Everybody will need them, like automobiles, like cellphones, and the potential market volume will be huge,” he told CNN.
    


Goldman Sachs projected last year that the global humanoid robot market will be worth $38 billion by 2035. In five years, they estimate that 250,000 humanoid units, mainly for industrial use, will be shipped, while consumers will be buying about one million units a year in about a decade.
    


            Beijing, which is looking to replicate China's success in the electric vehicle (EV) market, wants to be at the forefront of that growth.
    


            It's eager to position the country as a global tech powerhouse and build on the momentum of recent Chinese achievements in the field - such as AI startup DeepSeek's reasoning model that stunned the world in January - especially as the US tightens tech restrictions on Beijing.
    


            Despite entering the race later than American rivals including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Figure AI, experts say Chinese firms are rapidly closing the gap. With their preternatural ability to optimize supply chains and cut costs, Chinese firms are also accelerating the mass production of humanoids.
    


            China already dominates the space for industrial robots, deploying more of them every year since 2021 than all other countries combined, according to the International Federation of Robotics, a Germany-based non-governmental organization.
    


            Compared to humanoids, industrial robots typically feature less advanced technology and perform less sophisticated tasks. They're widely used in industrial settings for manufacturing or transportation.
    


            As with EVs, Tesla was one of the few big-name frontrunners for humanoids when Musk introduced the project in 2021 and showcased an Optimus prototype a year later. Since then, Beijing has publicly thrown its weight behind the humanoid robotics industry with increasing funding drives and government support.
    


            In a 2023 policy document, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology identified the humanoid robotics industry as a “new frontier in technological competition,” setting a 2025 target for mass production and secure supply chains for core components.
    


            “China started relatively late, but it has its own advantages like a huge market and a relatively complete supply chain for the technology, which enables them to easily develop similar kind of robots at lower price,” said Xi at the University of Hong Kong.
    


            Over the past three years, various local governments – including major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen – have announced plans to establish or have launched investment funds dedicated to developing robotics, totaling at least 73 billion yuan ($10 billion), according to a tally by CNN.
    


            Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping chaired a high-profile meeting with the country's top business executives. Among those seated in the front row was Wang Xingxing, CEO of Unitree, the company behind the viral dancing robots, an indication of Beijing's growing focus on this emerging sector.
    


            Aside from Unitree, other major domestic players include Shenzhen-based UBTech, Chinese EV giant BYD-backed Agibot, Beijing-based Robotera and Shanghai-headquartered Fourier Intelligence, as well as EV maker XPeng.
    


            Experts say China still trails the West in certain key technologies, even as it dominates the supply chain.  About 56% of the humanoid robot supply chain companies are based in China, according to a Morgan Stanley research report last month.

            But China still needs to achieve a breakthrough in “core technologies,” such as processor chips, high-precision sensor and robot operating systems, to reduce its reliance on foreign technology, said Zhang Dan, chair professor of intelligent robotics and automation at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
    


            Artificial intelligence chips underpin humanoids' operating systems, guiding their thinking, perception and motion. Many humanoid developers depend on AI chip giant Nvidia's products. At its annual developer conference last week, the company unveiled a new AI foundation model for humanoid robots.
    


            Citing national security concerns, the former Biden administration steadily tightened export restrictions on advanced chips that could power China's military. Beijing has sought to develop its domestic chip supply chain as part of its self-sufficiency drive.
    


            Additionally, European, American and Japanese companies continue to dominate higher-end components such as sensors, as well as motors and screws that power robotic motions with higher precision and stability, according to a Morgan Stanley report last month.
    


            To overcome those shortcomings, Chinese suppliers are actively trying to do business with Tesla. Many of them have sent component samples for Tesla's review, according to P.K. Tseng, a senior research manager at TrendForce, a market analysis firm.
    


            “After Chinese supply chain manufacturers supply components to Tesla, they refine them based on testing feedback and then offer the improved versions to domestic manufacturers,” he said.
    


            Over time, this creates a cycle of continuous technological advancements, enhancing the quality of the whole domestic humanoid robotics industry, he explained.
    


            While technological gaps remain, China has emerged as a price disrupter in the nascent industry.
    


            Shenzhen-based Engine AI released its PM01 model late last year for just 88,000 yuan ($12,175), while Unitree's G1, capable of executing a roundhouse kick, followed at 99,000 yuan ($13,697).

            At an event last year, Musk estimated Tesla's Optimus to be priced between $20,000 to $30,000. Lowering prices for humanoids would mark a major step to their eventual commercialization and wider adoption.
    


            Beyond startups, established EV players like BYD and XPeng have also ventured into the humanoids space. Experts said years of cutthroat competition and a price war in China have honed their ability to scale production rapidly while driving cost down.
    


            Since the manufacturing complexity of humanoid robots shares similarities to those of electric vehicles, particularly in components like sensors and batteries, EV makers have an advantage in this space, according to Brady Helwig, associate director for economy at Special Competitive Studies Project, a US thinktank.
    


            Late last year, XPeng unveiled its humanoid robot, Iron, with plans for mass production by the end of 2025. Around the same time, BYD launched a recruitment drive to develop its own version, having invested in other domestic humanoids makers.
    


            As the country's demographic crisis worsens, the Chinese leadership sees humanoid robots as a potential solution to offset the shrinking working force, Helwig said. China's population has shrunk for three consecutive years.
    


            “If humanoid robots were able to be scaled and deployed widely across the economy, this is the kind of wild card that could really help alleviate that gap,” he said.

From left, Nimble Needle employees Courtney Kuriger, Marci Slotin, Eloise Boylan, Carolyn Stovall, Aleena Ke, Mindi Sard, owner Jan Rogers and social media manager Emmie Rogers stand behind a wall of thread at the shop's expanded location. The COVID-19 pandemic saw an explosion in people interested in needlepoint.

Each week Appen Media asks a staff reporter to profile a business, nonprofit or commerce group they find interesting. The selection can be from anywhere in the Metro Atlanta area. The decision is up to the reporter and is made entirely independent of the sales department. Other profiles include:

SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. — The Nimble Needle, a full-service shop tucked behind Sandy Springs City Hall off Johnson Ferry Road, is bucking the belief that needlepoint is a dying art.

Owner Jan Rodgers said the COVID-19 pandemic saw a resurgence in needlepoint with Americans stuck at home with a desire to shut out the noise in an uncertain and accelerating world.

Some people enjoy the repetitive and relaxing nature of needlepoint, using the artform to relax after getting home from work or as an activity away from cellphones with friends.

There's an online world of social media influencers and writers promoting and celebrating needlepoint as a practice in mindfulness and a hobby away from screens.

Popular reality TV shows like “Bridgerton” and an endorsement from megastar Taylor Swift have cemented needlepoint's comeback with young women around the world.

“This is actually our third location; we started over by the Punchline [off Hilderbrand Drive] and then we were in this center up by the dry cleaners, the location was about half this size,” Rodgers said. “We moved here just over three years ago.”

The Nimble Needle just celebrated its 16th anniversary March 11 as a locally owned and operated business.

A couple parked cars sit outside of the Nimble Needle at 206B Johnson Ferry Road within the City Springs downtown district, just a couple blocks from Sandy Springs City Hall.

Rodgers said she bought the shop from the original owner Stacy Brown in 2018.

“I had worked for Stacey the years that she was open,” Rodgers said. “Not full-time, I was actually a sales rep most of the time, but I worked for her some of the time and taught a lot of classes.”

Things were going so well in 2022 that the shop needed to expand and find more space for its weekly help sessions, classes hosted by special guest artists, hundreds of canvasses and thread.

“I bought it about a year and a half before COVID, and actually it wasn't bad for our business because people were stuck at home looking for things to do,” Rodgers said. “People started painting, doing puzzles and stitching.”

The Nimble Needle employs 16 women.

“Plus, a data entry person and a social media person,” Rodgers said. “And my husband actually left his job two years ago … he does the website and a lot of the data entry too.”

Tim Rodgers, Jan's husband, worked in the IT industry before stepping away and helped create the shop's first website.  

Emmie Rodgers, one of Jan's daughters, is the Nimble Needle's social media manager.

She said there's been a wave of young women interested in needlepoint during and after the pandemic. 

Emmie Rodgers said sometimes men show up to classes, often brought along by their girlfriends, but needlepoint is really something that anyone can pick up if they want to. 

Jan Rodgers said the Nimble Needle's social media presence has made a real difference bringing more people into the shop. 

Some customers have been stitching for decades and others just picked up a canvas after watching a recent wave of TikTok videos promoting the hobby as an alternative to cell phone and social media addiction. 

The blending of different generations at the Nimble Needle, including teenagers and grandmothers, makes its community rare.

A look at the front of the Nimble Needle, a full-service needlepoint shop off Johnson Ferry Road within City Springs, shows a table covered in canvasses with every color of thread imaginable covering the walls. The owner said the shop hosts workshops, beginner classes and specialty instruction throughout the week.

Rodgers said the back of the shop at 206B Johnson Ferry Road was originally supposed to be the classroom, but it wasn't big enough for most of them. Instead, the Nimble Needle hosts workshops and classes around three large wooden tables in the front of the shop.

“We teach beginner classes … how to paint canvasses … finish your stitch piece into an ornament,” Rodgers said. “Then, we have national teachers who come in for what they call embellishment classes where they take a canvass and tell you what kind of stitches to use on it.”

There's usually one or two classes open to the public on weekends.

Because needlepoint is an artform, businesses avoid large corporate competition with an emphasis on the community of artists, experienced stitchers and beginners.

Needlepoint is an intricate art form, requiring a dedication to detail, patience and a willingness to learn. The number of different stitches, ranging in complexity, can be intimidating for novices, but local shops like the Nimble Needle exist to provide all ability levels with some guidance.

“Canvasses are stitch painted, so there's a dot of paint on every intersection of the canvass,” Rodgers said. “All the canvasses that you see on the wall are hand-painted; They are starting to print some canvasses, but it's a kind of kludgy process as far as trying to get lines straight, so ink ends up on every intersection of canvass.”

Despite all the advancements in human technology, needlepoint artists still prefer methods used by the ancient Egyptians more than 3,000 years ago. 

Rodgers said the technology isn't quite there yet to make printed canvasses as viable as traditional, painted ones. She said once you've made a stitch, it's difficult to know what's underneath, which makes each drop of paint crucial to the look of the final product, whether it be a pillow, wall hanging or belt.

Twice a week on Monday mornings and Wednesday evenings, the shop hosts a help session.

“Marcie Slotin teaches the help classes,” Rodgers said. “It's just bring whatever you're working on, and she will help you learn new stitches and try new threads.”

People from around the Metro Atlanta, the state of Georgia and the Southeast patronize the Nimble Needle in Sandy Springs.

Rodgers said there's an existing needlepoint shop in midtown Atlanta and Savannah just got a new one, but there are not a lot of options close by. She said the 15 miles between the two Metro Atlanta shops sometimes takes an hour to navigate. 

All of the new people interested in needlepoint puts a smile on Rodgers' face.

“We give out some beginner information, and we have to constantly remake that,” she said. “We're seeing a lot of new stitchers and younger ones, which is good for the future.”

Smartwatch brand Garmin has announced an integration with Clippd, a unique data-driven performance platform that helps golfers understand where and how they can improve their game. 

The agreement seamlessly integrates Garmin's on-course and range session information into the Clippd consumer golf technology platform, giving players a more complete picture of their game. 

On-course data is supplied through Garmin's smartwatches that provide shot detection – and enhanced by those who pair their watch to CT10 sensors for automatic club tracking.

Commenting on the partnership, Susan Lyman, Garmin Vice President of Consumer Sales and Marketing, said: “We're excited to work with Clippd to provide our customers even more ways to work on their golf game. This integration helps users to easily visualise all parts of their game and identify the areas where they can make the biggest improvements.” 

Clippd offers performance metrics that present a compelling way to understand and measure golfing skill – both overall and in each portion of the game. These metrics give golfers and golf coaches a more precise and immediate way to comprehend and track skill level shot-by-shot and at a point in time. These metrics include: 

Piers Parnell, Clippd CEO, said: “We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Garmin, a leader in GPS technology and wearables. This will enable us to integrate Garmin's golf data into our performance software, providing golfers with a more comprehensive and accurate picture of their game. We are proud to be the first company to integrate Garmin's golf data into our platform, and we believe this agreement will transform the way golfers track and analyse their performance, enabling them to get better faster.”

Clippd is the first company to tap into the Garmin Golf Premium API, which launched earlier this year and grants third party applications access the golf performance metrics of Garmin customers who consent to share their data. The Garmin Golf Premium API allows companies to seamlessly integrate their platforms with Garmin devices to capture scorecard, on-course and range session data to provide insights that can help improve golf performance.

Ashworth Golf has launched its Autumn/Winter apparel 2025 collection to the trade, with the company reverting back to its heyday where lifestyle and golf became intrinsically linked, making Ashworth the must-have brand for over 20 years.

love.golf, the pioneering group golf programme for women, marked its 10-year anniversary with a special coaches' conference in London. 

Toro continues to push the boundaries of innovation in golf course maintenance with the introduction of Intelli360, a cutting-edge fleet management tool designed to bring around the clock efficiency and connectivity to course operations.

COVINGTON, Ky. — Incentive programs in the city of Covington are set up to attract small businesses and help support them as they get up and running.

The city say it's been successful in giving Covington a small business-friendly reputation.

The owner of a chocolate shop is taking advantage, saying he couldn't find something like this anywhere else.

Paul Picton has taken an interesting career path, going from selling jet engines for years to now, to selling chocolate.

“I was always traveling around, and I would bring chocolate home. And when I left the corporate world, after a few weeks I ran out of chocolate, and so I started making it at home. And the more I made it, the more people were encouraging me to bring it to a bigger audience,” said Picton, owner and co-founder of the Maverick Chocolate Company.

Maverick Chocolate has been in Cincinnati's Findlay Market for 11 years. It also had a store in Norwood, but Picton said the business was recently “essentially kicked out” of that space. He knew he wanted a small business-friendly community to be the new home for his sweet treats.

“Covington is one of the few communities around that offers any kind of incentives for small business,” Picton said.

He's taking advantage of two Covington small business incentive programs. The first helps with up to $6,000 in rent during the first year.

Patrick Duffy, business retention and expansion manager for Covington's Economic Development Department, explained.

“We want them to focus more on growing their business and expanding their business, and less about the rent, making their rent every month,” Duffy said.

The second program aims to help prop up one of Covington's best assets: its historic buildings, by also offering up to $6,000 to help fix them up. This one is for building owners, who are often but not always business owners as well. 

In Maverick Chocolate's case, it applies, because besides the chocolate shop, Picton bought a building that will become a chocolate factory. He said the 60-year-old building was an eyesore, and he's looking forward to using the funds to “pretty it up.” 

“We have a really rich history here in Covington, so it helps us preserve that, and honestly, these old buildings need some work. They're great, they're really strong bones, but sometimes they just need a little love to make them more inviting,” Duffy said. “What we want to do is help them pay for their project, up to 50% of the project, up to $6,000, to help them revitalize their storefront, and do it in a historically appropriate manner.”

There's been four rounds a year of these incentives since 2017. The latest featured the West Sixth Brewery, a CPA and Maverick Chocolate.

“When you transition into a new space, there's always some growing pains. It takes time for people to know where you are, and so a rent subsidy really helps in the first year as you're trying to reestablish or establish in the first place,” Picton said.

Duffy said it's helping with the overall revitalization of the city.

“It's bringing a lot of diversity of businesses, and it really makes Covington a place where people want to not only work, but enjoy their leisure time,” he said. “The small business owners are what make up our identity as a city. And they really give us a lot of our character.”

The programs are all reimbursement-based. Once a business signs a lease, they can submit their invoice for rent and Covington will reimburse half the rent up to $500 per month for the first year, totaling $6,000. The facade grant will also reimburse up to half the cost of a project up to $6,000.

Council slows down action","https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2025/03/25/springfield-mo-business-license-process-could-change-to-aid-property-tax-collection/82638159007/","Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:52:01 GMT","

A month ago, City Council approved an ordinance allowing cars with expired tags to be towed. Monday night, the sponsors of that earlier plan pitched another proposal, this time aimed at cracking down business owners that don't pay pay their property taxes. After a contentious debate, council opted to take a different route, referring the proposal to a committee to review, delaying a vote on implementing the plan.

The proposal was another piece of public safety legislation authored by Mayor Ken McClure, who is less than a month away from leaving the post he's held for the past eight years, and Councilman Craig Hosmer. The pair co-sponsored the ordinance, which would require applicants seeking occupational licenses to be up to date on their personal property taxes.

The amendments to the current ordinance would require that an applicant include paid receipts for ""all personal property taxes due Greene County for property held in the name of the applicant for the previous calendar year."" For those who might not owe taxes that year, a statement of non-assessment would have to be included.

City Attorney Jordan Paul said such a requirement has been found to be allowable under state and federal laws and that a similar requirement is already in place in St. Louis and Kansas City.

Greene County Assessor Brent Johnson addressed council and noted that while the city has issued roughly 11,000 business licenses, he has only received a little more than 4,000 business assessment lists from within city limits for the year. He said business assessment lists are similar to personal property assessment — owners list their assets, which for businesses include any equipment, furniture, vehicles, and any other tangible property that is used for the business.

If that list is never filled out and returned, taxes cannot be billed. Johnson also noted it is a matter of education — some business owners do not know that they are required to fill out assessments or what assets would have to be assessed.

Unlike the requirement of an individual property tax receipt for vehicle registration, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said the county has no effective mechanism to crack down on businesses that are not declaring the property they own nor paying their taxes. While collections from property taxes do not make up a large portion of the city's budget, these tax revenues do fund Springfield Public Schools, Springfield-Greene County Library District, and other tax entities.

Hosmer and McClure's proposed change would require those who want to renew or receive a new business license to show they have paid their business' property taxes. Hosmer said this would be a similar process to what the state already uses for vehicle registration, ensuring all business owners are held to the same standards. He highlighted SPS' need for the revenue, particularly as discussions of job cuts have surfaced more recently.

Councilman Abe McGull was the one to suggest referring the proposal to the Plans and Policies Committee prior to voting on it. He emphasized that he was not against the goal of the ordinance and ensuring everyone pays their fair share but rather wanted the details to be more fleshed out and allow time for public feedback.

""When you send things through committee, all those things are hashed out, everybody in the community is aware of it,"" he said. ""But you're asking us, in two weeks, to pass this major piece of legislation that's going to affect a lot of people, the small businesses and stuff like that, and they may not even know about it. Not everybody watches the city council meetings.""

The towing ordinance passed by council Feb. 24 in a 5-3 vote also had not gone through committees prior to being presented to council for a vote. Hosmer questioned why committee work was brought up for an ordinance specifically dealing with businesses and not for the general public.

""It's a privilege to do business in the city of Springfield, and we should make people pay their fair share, businesses and individuals both,"" Hosmer said. ""So, I think it's imperative that we go ahead and do this, and I don't think it should be sent to committee, because the last time my bills got sent to committee, they never seem to come back.""

Councilwoman Monica Horton and Councilman Brandon Jenson, both of whom voted against the towing ordinance, noted that the discussion was not about showing favoritism to businesses but ensuring all questions are answered prior to making legislative decisions. Horton noted there is no rush to put the issue to a vote.

""We might have had a unanimous vote on the towing amendment, if it had went to committee and we had fleshed out some of the issues that came before us to the public,"" she said. ""I think that, you know, because we're having this type of tug of war here, I think that there is some value-add and some benefit to flesh this out a little bit better, instead of doing this sloppily.""

Jenson said that when he was onboarded, he was told that there should be no ordinance that comes before council without going to committee prior. He recently referred Right to Counsel to committee. While there is nothing that requires ordinances to go before committee, City Code does state that it is council policy ""to encourage the referral of council bills involving policy issues and substantive changes to the appropriate city council committee."" Likewise, there is no legislation or strict rules about how long an ordinance, program or topic can remain in committee or what must come out of the process.

""I am surprised that the sponsors of this bill, who gave me that instruction, now have brought two ordinances forward that have a substantial impact on people in our community without following the process that I was told is critically important to good policy,"" he said.

Ultimately, the referral passed 7-2 with McClure and Hosmer opposed. Hosmer said he does not have another future ordinance planned regarding property tax enforcement. With upcoming April 8 election, the issue will be taken up by a new mayor and possibly new council members.

When the towing ordinance was passed last month, Springfield Police Department declared there would be an educational period before enforcement began. With that period over, SPD may begin towing vehicles with inadequate registration starting Wednesday, March 26. Police Chief Paul Williams had previously said initially officers will go after cars that are a year or more expired.

Both Johnson and Icet said they have noticed effects already since the ordinance passed. Johnson said the assessment office is seeing large lines, which are not typical for this time of year, particularly with individuals getting their assessments for the past several past years.

Icet said over the few weeks that the new towing ordinance has been in place but not yet enforced, the collector's office has seen roughly a 30% increase in the taxes collected from the same period last year, totaling roughly $230,000 more. He said this increase is more than what he would anticipate in a normal year and attributed the change to council's action.

A new Chick-fil-A restaurant will open in Selden next week. 
The chain's newest eatery occupies a 5,500-square-foot pad site building in the College Plaza shopping center at 949 Middle Country Road. 
The Selden Chick-fil-A will be the chain's 11th on Long Island, following others in Smithtown, Commack, Huntington Station, Port Jefferson Station, Farmingville, Hicksville, Farmingdale, Levittown, Westbury and Garden City.  



The Chick-fil-A in Selden is owned and operated by franchisee Stan Abrahamsen, who also owns the Chick-fil-A in Port Jefferson Station. It opens Tuesday, April 1. 
“As a longtime Suffolk County resident and the local owner-operator of Chick-fil-A Port Jefferson, I'm honored to continue serving my neighbors and making a positive impact in the community that I call home,” Abrahamsen said in a company statement. “At Chick-fil-A Selden, my focus is on building a welcoming, service-driven culture and helping my team members grow — both personally and professionally.” 
The all-in cost to open a Chick-fil-A franchise ranges from $585,500 to $3.3 million. The average annual gross sales for a Chick-fil-A restaurant is $8.1 million, according to Sharpsheets.com.  



The Selden Chick-fil-A will employ about 120 full- and part-time employees. 
Steve Gillman of The Shopping Center Group represented Chick-fil-A, while Nick Andreadis served as in-house representative for the landlord, Brixmor Property Group, in the Selden lease transaction.

As the company engages major studios and throws its own short film festival (with Universal, Disney and talent agency execs in attendance), its executives see a future unconstrained by legal or labor guardrails.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	When OpenAI unveiled technology called Sora last year that lets people instantaneously generate hyper-realistic videos — like a movie trailer of an astronaut traversing a barren desert planet — in response to a text prompt of just a few words, it wasn't the quality of the footage that caught Hollywood folk off guard as much as the rapid growth of the technology initially thought to be years away from being able to be plugged into the production pipeline.


	Questions swirled as studios execs chattered about AI's place in the entertainment industry: what production processes can it streamline; to what degree can it cut costs; what are the legal and labor guardrails?

					This Director Couldn't Get An Interview With Sam Altman. So He Deepfaked Him In a Documentary		
			









	Since then, OpenAI has been engaging with studios about Sora, hammering home its applications as it works out kinks with independent filmmakers and undergoes safety testing. Now, the company is pitching Hollywood as it ventures toward widespread adoption of its technology.

	Rohan Sahai, who leads the Sora product team, tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview that there's been considerable interest from the entertainment industry, without specifying the contours of the conversations. He sees utilization of the tools across most stages of production as the tools improve.


	“For some of these bigger production companies, the ones who are forward looking, they see where things are going and try to think about how to change their whole workflows to make the best fit at this moment in time,” he says.


	The current legal landscape mostly limits adoption to the previsualization process, like conception and storyboarding, that don't directly involve the final product. Widespread utilization of AI tools in the movie­making process will depend largely on how courts land on novel legal issues raised by the technology. Still, workers in the industry are already losing jobs, with concept artists, voice actors and animators at the forefront of that displacement. AGBO, the production company run by Avengers directors Joe and Anthony Russo, is making a significant push into the space, most recently hiring AI expert and former Apple exec Dr. Dominic Hughes to serve as its chief scientific officer in a bid to streamline production processes. 


	Among few considerations holding back further deployment of AI is the specter of a court ruling that the use of copyrighted materials to train AI systems constitutes infringement. Another factor is that AI-generated works aren't eligible for copyright protection, limiting exploitation since they'd enter the public domain.

	











	OpenAI is optimistic about a future in which its technology isn't constrained by legal or labor guardrails as it continues to fight lawsuits from creators. Its conversations with Hollywood reflect that confidence. 


	“We are taking a broader stroke here in terms of what we want people to do with these models in terms of creating and storytelling,” Sahai says. Rather than “honing in on a certain part of the [production] pipeline,” he adds the company is taking a holistic view at selling Hollywood on the technology since “long term, people are going to realize it's so much more powerful than simply tapping into a VFX” workflow.


	“We are deeply engaged with the industry as a whole to get their feedback, including studios,” OpenAI said in a statement.


	On March 19, the ChatGPT maker screened 11 short films made with Sora by independent filmmakers at Brain Dead Studios, a hip movie theater in West Hollywood on Fairfax Avenue, in a bid to showcase its technology. Those movies displayed the limitations of the tools while hinting at their potential.


	None of the titles incorporated extensive dialogue between characters. Narratives were sparse to nonexistent, with more than one person commenting after the screenings some of the films were closer to commercials than short films. Characters appeared to be sitting on air at one point in a movie about the misadventures of knights.


	Still, the possibility that Sora can streamline the VFX workflow, an area of production known for especially slim margins, was evident. The titles selected for the screening featured an array of shots generated by the tool exhibiting why it's captivated Hollywood: a fish bejeweled in eyes; an ocean vista kissed by a string of setting suns; a silhouette of a man swallowed by a vortex of newspapers. Some VFX artists are already leaning into AI, working around certain legal constraints by training open source systems on their own works.

	











	Verena Puhm, an AI filmmaker, said she started her short film about a dairy farm in a dystopian future meant to be a critique on mass production and exploitation with 15 hours left before the application window closed. She said her project is intended to raise “a bit of awareness about what we're consuming.”


	OpenAI no longer discloses the sources of data used to train its systems. Artists, authors and publications have sued the Sam Altman-led company over allegations it illegally pilfered their work without consent and compensation. Courts ruling against fair use — a legal doctrine that permits utilization of copyrighted works without a license — could have major implications for the AI leader. Last week, hundreds of major Hollywood figures signed a letter pushing back against OpenAI and Google‘s appeals to the U.S. government to allow their AI models to train on copyrighted works.


	In attendance at the screening was an executive at Universal Pictures as well as Disney, who came in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the studio. A UTA employee at the agency's Entertainment Marketing division was also in the crowd.


	Alton Glass, a Directors Guild of America member who attended the screening, said “workflows are going to shift” with the advent of AI. He stressed, “opportunity will come from that.”


	Adoption of AI in Hollywood has been slow but is steadily progressing. Last year, Lionsgate announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with Runway that will see the New York-based AI startup train a new generative AI model on content owned by the studio, which will be used to assist with behind-the-scenes production processes. Under the no-cash deal, Runway will have access to a portion of the studio's titles to create a model designed exclusively for Lionsgate's use, with the hope that it can plugged into different parts of the production pipeline, such as the storyboarding process and in helping with the design of VFX work, according to a person familiar with the deal. This was followed by Blumhouse partnering with Meta on a series of short films produced with the help of Movie Gen, which creates video and corresponding audio, as it tests the AI waters and James Cameron joining Stability AI's board of directors.

	











	“They're looking for case studies,” says Rob Rosenberg, former Showtime Networks executive vp and general counsel. “They're looking for proof of concept that they can turn around and say we reduced production costs by X percent.”


	Sora was made available for public use in December after undergoing safety testing by experts in misinformation, hateful content and bias. Filmmakers, visual artists and designers were also provided access for feedback on improvements. Since then, creators have been unveiling AI-generated projects to mixed reception, with some criticizing aesthetics that they say approach the uncanny valley and others hailing the near-instantaneous creation of movie-ready visuals and effects. 


	Similar to how OpenAI is engaging with independent filmmakers as it rolls out Sora, Meeka Bondy, chair of Perkins Coie's entertainment practice and HBO's former senior vice president for legal affairs, says AI companies courting Hollywood are looking to show creators that their tech isn't the boogeyman it's been represented as by some critics. She adds, ‘It highlights their visibility, but I also think it gives them legitimacy. If James Cameron is doing it, the though is that they're not trying to replace” production crew.


	The narrative advanced by OpenAI to encourage adoption of its AI tools has revolved around the “democratization” of the entertainment industry. With the tools, creators face lower barriers to filmmaking that, some may say, will help realize bringing their ideas to the screen. Earlier this month, it was announced that James Lamont and Jon Foster, the writing team behind Paddington in Peru, are reteaming for an AI animated film Critterz. The title is a feature-length adaptation of the short film of the same name from Vertigo Films, which is joined by AI creatives at Native Foreign in the project. That short, written and directed by OpenAI creative specialist Chad Nelson, emerged as among the first AI films to combine visuals generated by OpenAI's Dall-E tool with traditional animation techniques and was later remastered with Sora. The producers said they hope to “set a new benchmark for generative storytelling pairing human-driven creativity and traditional animation techniques with the latest AI technology.”

	











	But these talking points, which underscore the opportunity presented to some creatives who've been able to advance their careers with the AI tools, gloss over those who have lost and will continue to lose work due to the technology. Concept artists and workers in VFX, among other positions that are seen as under fire by AI, are taking stock of potential displacement down the road if the tech advances at the pace it has been.


	A study commissioned last year by the Concept Art Assn. and the Animation Guild surveying 300 leaders across the entertainment industry found that three-fourths of respondents indicated that AI tools supported the elimination, reduction or consolidation of jobs at their companies. Over the next three years, it estimated that nearly 204,000 positions will be adversely affected. At the forefront of the displacement: sound engineers, voice actors, concept artists and employees in entry-level positions, according to the study. Visual effects and other postproduction work stands particularly vulnerable.


	Sora has limitations — technological and legal — that will restrict its applications in the entertainment industry. Still, it has very real potential in production in ancillary industries, including advertisement and the video work commissioned by corporations, that present fewer labor constraints to adopting the technology. Among the considerations on the technology's impact on Hollywood will be downstream effects for creatives that depend on such work for the primary source of their income. It's expected to have a similar impact on soundstages and equipment rental companies since the technology will likely encourage fewer production crew.

Right out of high school, Kevin McAllister began working at the Webster Hall Deli in 1987. The owner, William R. Lee, taught McAllister “everything he [knows].”

“[He] taught me how to do cooking, and we used to make egg salad, tuna salad and all those things,” McAllister said. “Cooking is easy. You just gotta pay attention. That's all cooking is — paying attention to what you're making and just loving what you do.”

McAllister worked at the deli for 17 years before taking over. In 2004, he renamed it Kevin's Deli. A framed photo of McAllister and Lee still hangs on the wall of the deli today.

McAllister is now the owner and sole worker at Kevin's Deli. Students voted Kevin's Deli the best Black-owned business in The Pitt News' annual “Best Of” survey. Located inside Webster Hall, he serves classics like buffalo chicken salad and Reubens, as well as breakfast options. According to McAllister, his steak hoagie is “the best in the city.”

“No one's touching my steak hoagie,” McAllister said. “Everything I make is good. You're going to like everything, because it's not just a worker working here, it's the owner, and when it's the owner, he makes everything good because he don't want no bad remarks on them.”

McAllister has formed relationships with a number of customers. During a typical day, he sits and talks with an 89-year-old woman who comes in for coffee each day as they wait for the lunch rush. Another customer recently started running McAllister's Clash Royale for him in exchange for a free coffee maker.

“I don't want just a customer, I want friends,” McAllister said. “That's the way I look at business.”

On the deli counter, McAllister has a number of trinkets — a Pikachu figurine, Hot Wheels and a Rubik's cube.

“People do my Rubik's cube for me,” McAllister said. “Every time the one customer comes in, he does it in seconds. I'm like, ‘Wow. You know, customers are cool.'”

McAllister decorated the walls of the deli with tokens from customers — paintings of the Pittsburgh skyline from former residents of Webster Hall, a bulletin board filled with foreign currencies, and posters signed by Pitt sports teams. McAllister said he loves people, and that for him, interaction is “everything.” The deli is even where McAllister met his wife of 34 years.

Working in a college neighborhood, McAllister's customers are constantly coming and going. Every year, McAllister receives Christmas cards from one past regular and his family. They even bring him cookies sometimes. Another former customer and his family send letters yearly updating him on the family's doings. Both the Christmas cards and letters are taped up on the wall behind the deli counter. 

“Every four years, I get new customers because a lot of college kids work and live around here and go to school around here, so I meet them and become good friends with them, and then they're off to life, and I gotta find new ones,” McAllister said.

Jessica Stanislaw, a property manager with Webster Hall, has worked around the corner from Kevin's Deli for 11 years and enjoys the “fantastic breakfast sandwiches.”

“We have a great relationship,” Stanislaw said. “We are proud to have Kevin as part of our Webster Hall community. We make sure to include him in our leasing tours.”

Stanislaw believes Kevin's Deli was voted “Best Of” because McAllister's personality “can't be beat.”

“He is friendly to everyone and brings a nice vibe to Webster Hall and the surrounding community,” Stanislaw said.

Manny Basnet, a senior media and professional communications major, first heard about Kevin's Deli from a friend who frequented the place. His first impression of the deli was centered around McAllister's personality.

“He was really nice, and just made me feel really welcomed,” Basnet said. “And I thought that it was pretty odd for just someone making food to be that hospitable towards me, and it was a really pleasant experience.”
Now, Basnet goes semi-regularly, and his favorite menu item is the steak hoagie with fries. He said he thinks Kevin's Deli won “Best Of” because of McAllister's welcoming personality.

“When it comes to what separates food places, whether it's a restaurant or just a grab-and-go place, I think there's a lot of places that have really good food, but my favorite places are always ones that give me a good experience, not just good food.”

To McAllister, winning “Best Of” meant he was “not a prick or a-hole,” as he tries to do good things and be kind.

“I lead with kindness always,” McAllister said. “If you don't have enough money, you can eat here. I don't say that to everybody, but if someone comes in and says they only have $5, I'm not going to turn them away. Not going to do it every day, but I'm not going to turn them away the first day.”

Saudi Arabian bottled-water business Berain Water has a new investor.

Hassana Investment Company has acquired a 40% stake in Berain from local investment group Mohammed Abdulaziz Al-Rajhi & Sons Investment Company, also known as Rajhi-Invest.

Financial terms were not disclosed. Hassana Investment Company is the investment manager of Saudi Arabia's General Organization for Social Insurance, the government agency concerned with social insurance in the country.

According to a statement hosted on regional business news service Zawya, Berain has three factories located in Jeddah and Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital. Berain sells packaged-water products in a range of sizes.

In the statement, Ahmed W. Alqahtani, the CIO of regional markets at Hassana, was quoted as saying: “This transaction is aligned with Hassana's long-term investment strategy to acquire well-performing businesses in the consumer sector with a stable and attractive cashflow profile underpinned by strong market fundamentals. We are pleased to partner with Rajhi Invest and we look forward to building a long-term partnership based on mutual benefit.”

Rajhi-Invest group CEO Mohamed A. El Samman said the “strategic partnership” with Hassana was “a decisive step towards realising our vision for Berain”.

He added: “We are looking forward to this partnership and anticipate a powerful synergy that will drive transformative growth for Berain across the Saudi FMCG landscape.”

SNB Capital advised Rajhi-Invest on the deal. Zaid Ghoul, MD and head of investment banking at SNB Capital, confirmed the deal via a post on LinkedIn.

Linklaters worked with Hassana Investment Company on the transaction.

In a statement, Linklaters said the deal “marks the beginning of a long-term partnership between Rajhi-Invest and Hassana”.

According to GlobalData, Just Drinks' parent, the size of Saudi Arabia's packaged water market in volume terms was 3.88bn litres last year. The data and analytics group forecasts growth of 3.9% this year to 4.03bn litres.

The Ladies European Tour has launched further statistical analysis in partnership with Upgame, the market leading golf analytics app, for both the LET and LET Access Series.

Starting today [March 25] and available on LET's website and app, Upgame will have a dedicated page to show strokes gained from each tournament. The new feature is the first time that Upgame has provided a bespoke webpage for a major golf tour, showcasing strokes gained insights. This will allow for improved performance analytics, data-driven decision making, and customisation of training for LET members, in addition to more digital content for engaged fans. 

Since 2023, players have been able to record shots and view how they have performed in relation to intended targets. In turn, both players and fans have been able to access enhanced data points like shot patterns, benchmarks, and strokes gained analytics, all helping to enhance performance while digitally enriching the LET product around the world.

Some interesting strokes gained data captured by Upgame in 2024 has given some good benchmarks for players to target. To finish in the top 10 of the LET Order of Merit, the top 10 players outperformed the rest of the LET players by 1.87 strokes overall, excelling on approach shots with a gain of 0.85 strokes, and showcasing strengths off the tee (0.47 strokes), short game (0.20 strokes), and putting (0.34 strokes).For players competing on the LET Access Series in 2025 and looking to achieve full LET status they should look to the top seven average of the 2024 season which had a raw strokes gained of -0.99. 

Alexandra Armas, CEO of the LET, said: “This is a great addition to what already seems to have been a hugely beneficial tool for our golfers and fans across the globe. These advanced statistics allow our elite women athletes to benchmark their performance on a specific course against others in the field, giving a clear picture of how they compare and where they need to focus. Through this enhanced digital output, it's a further step towards developing the women's game to be played at the highest level.” 

Sameer Sawhney, founder of Upgame, commented: “We are delighted to be working with the LET as the first global golf tour to have a bespoke Upgame performance insights page which displays enhanced Strokes Gained statistics for all players, media and fans. We look forward to developing the platform further to showcase even more of the unique metrics captured, such as dispersions to targets and target lines.”

Upgame is used globally by 40 national federations and more than 100 collegiate organisations, with thousands of players and coaches utilising the app to their advantage.

Oops, something went wrong

By Tom Wilson and Elizabeth Howcroft

LONDON (Reuters) -Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial crypto venture will launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin, it said in a statement on Tuesday, after raising more than half a billion dollars from selling a separate digital token.

The stablecoin, called USD1, will be fully backed by U.S. Treasuries, dollars and other cash equivalents and is designed to keep a value of $1, World Liberty said in the statement.

Dollar-pegged stablecoins such as Tether and USDC have ballooned in recent years and now act as a key cog in the multi-trillion dollar crypto trading industry, helping move funds between different cryptocurrencies or into regular cash.

Stablecoins in circulation currently total over $237 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko.

The tokens have become lucrative for their issuers in recent years as interest rates spiked. Tether, the issuer of the world's biggest stablecoin, made over $13 billion in profits last year.

Zach Witkoff, World Liberty's co-founder, said ""sovereign investors and major institutions"" would be able to integrate USD1 ""into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.""

USD1 will be ""fully backed by a reserve portfolio audited regularly by a third-party accounting firm,"" World Liberty said, without giving details of the accounting firm, or the date of its launch.

Founded two months before his victory in the U.S. presidential election, World Liberty's creation was announced by Trump, his three sons and the wealthy real estate businessman Steve Witkoff, who is the father of Zach and now Trump's Middle East envoy.

Trump, who campaigned on promises to be a ""crypto president,"" has pledged to overhaul U.S. rules on crypto and reverse a crackdown on the sector that took place under former President Joe Biden.

His crypto business interests, which include a so-called meme coin launched in January, have drawn criticism from government ethics experts and political opponents over potential conflicts of interest.

BITGO AND BINANCE

The World Liberty venture, which aims to allow people to access financial services without intermediaries like banks, said last week it has raised $550 million selling a crypto coin known as $WLFI.

Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of New York payments infrastructure firm Borderless.xyz said USD1 would face stiff competition from incumbents such as Tether and U.S. firm Circle, the issuer of USDC.

""While launching a stablecoin is easy, building an ecosystem that adopts it is a far harder task,"" he said. ""Is the President competing with other American businesses or will they find ways to partner?""

USD1's reserves will be held in custody by California-based BitGo, World Liberty said. BitGo's prime brokerage service will support USD1 by ""providing institutional clients with access to deep liquidity and trading,"" it added.

USD1 will be launched on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains - digital ledgers that underpin the movement of crypto coins. World Liberty plans to launch USD1 on other blockchains in the future, it added.

Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, launched its so-called Smart Chain in 2020. It is the world's fourth-largest blockchain by the value of assets held on it, according to CoinGecko.

Binance's founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao was last year sentenced to four months in a U.S. prison, after pleading guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering.

Binance paid a $4.3 billion fine after U.S. prosecutors said it had welcomed criminals and failed to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups.

A spokesperson for Binance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about how the partnership came about.

				Greenkeeping & Agronomy 

Toro continues to push the boundaries of innovation in golf course maintenance with the introduction of Intelli360, a cutting-edge fleet management tool designed to bring around the clock efficiency and connectivity to course operations.

“As an all-in-one digital solution, Intelli360 exemplifies Toro's commitment to advancing turfcare technology,” says Jon Cole, Divisional Business Manager at Reesink Turfcare, Toro's exclusive distributor in the UK for golf and sports fields equipment and irrigation products. “By leveraging the capabilities of connected equipment and intuitive data management, it will redefine golf course maintenance.”

Building on the foundation of Toro's myTurf Pro, Intelli360 takes things one step further and provides a centralised platform that streamlines fleet management, machine repairs and resource allocation – providing course managers with the real-time insights required for proactive decision-making.

With Intelli360, golf clubs gain complete visibility of their equipment, no matter where it is on the course. An interactive map feature enables users to easily track machine location, operating status and maintenance needs 24/7. 

The intuitive dashboard can be accessed through any web-enabled device, allowing course managers to conveniently create work orders, schedule labour and manage parts inventory remotely.

“From labour and operations to weather conditions and irrigation, there's an application for just about everything, but having all that data at your disposal can be a lot to manage, which is why Toro created Intelli360,” continues Cole. “This provides the solution that connects the systems and equipment golf course professionals depend on every day.”

And with ongoing support and functionality improvements continuously being developed by Toro, users can expect a product that gets better with time and adapts to evolving industry needs. 

New features are already on the horizon, including the ability to find and order inventory parts for planned maintenance, get instant notification of equipment faults for faster repairs and the much-welcomed integration to Toro IntelliDash.

The latter, in particular, will be a key component of Intelli360 – bringing essential information about a course's agronomic conditions, weather and evapotranspiration forecasts, irrigation data and much more.

Toro's research and development teams are constantly raising the bar of turfcare technology. Intelli360 sets a new standard for connected fleet and course management, combining real-time data, intuitive design and seamless integration of tools to shape the future of golf maintenance.

				Retail 

Ashworth Golf has launched its Autumn/Winter apparel 2025 collection to the trade, with the company reverting back to its heyday where lifestyle and golf became intrinsically linked, making Ashworth the must-have brand for over 20 years.  

The collection is aimed at green grass retailers looking to benefit from exceptional margins by offering a golf clothing range that cannot be found elsewhere.

The 2025 collection features a year-round polo shirt range, midlayers, layering pieces and a waterproof range. Polos come in patterns, prints and plain designs, all of which carry subtle details that elevate the look of the pieces. 

There are a mix of fabrics, with the emphasis on performance. There is a nod to the heritage of the brand with the Signature Golfman (AM1102), which has the iconic Golfman logo as a repeat pattern, and the classic striped polo including the La Quinta (AM1201) and the Striped Tech Jersey (AM1011).

There are three soft, comfortable traditional midlayers, perfect for the cooler months. The Comfort Stretch (AM2042) is lightweight and luxurious, with a ¼-zip in contrast colours. The French Terry (AM2040) is also a ¼-zip and made from a specially blended fabric that has moisture wicking loops on the inside and a smooth texture to the exterior. The Peached Tech (AM2039) is classic, timeless Ashworth; understated, stylish and sophisticated. In contrast, the Bamboo Hoodie (AM2001) offers a modern take on midlayers. It is wonderfully soft thanks to the blend of bamboo, spandex and cotton.



In outerwear there are two full-zip vests; the Tech Stretch (AM4072) is made from a premium polyester and the Quilted Scuba (AM4004), which is also available as a jacket (AM4003), features thermal quilted panels packed with polyester down. The Tech short sleeve midlayer ¼-zip (AM4075) is a practical, windproof, waterproof (to 3,000mm) top that is the perfect extra layer when the weather is changing. 

The Ashworth Waterproof Half Sleeve ¼-zip top reflects the increasing popularity of this type of design on Tour.  Players prefer the freedom this garment gives in the swing, but rely on the excellent Waterproof (10,000mm) and breathable (10,000mm) qualities this fabric delivers. The Ashworth Waterproof Rain Jacket and Trousers are made from the same high-performance fabric. These waterproofs are lightweight, stretchy and incredibly quiet. The trousers are also packable for easy storage, as well as benefiting from waterproof zippers for easy on and off.  

All of these garments can be crested. The embroidery service now includes a printed embroidery system whereby a 3D-effect club or corporate crest can be printed directly onto an outer fabric.  This is ideal for cresting on waterproofs and water repellent jackets as it does not compromise performance. 

To book an appointment to view the range or place an order contact the UK HQ on 01228 210551 or speak to your regional Ashworth sales representative.

AIG Women's Open hosts Royal Porthcawl Golf Club has won an award from Wales Golf in the year they are about the host the biggest female sporting event ever held in Wales. The club has been recognised with the Visit Wales Croeso Award for Tourism as they prepare to welcome the world's top women golfers to the South Wales links course at the end of July.  This accolade is designed to celebrate a golf club that offers an outstanding customer experience and helps shape Wales' reputation as a world-class golfing destination. 

They received it at the Wales Golf Awards ceremony at Ryder Cup venue Celtic Manor, at the Twenty Ten Clubhouse. Other award winners included former Wales Golf President Jeff Harries, who received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his decades of work refereeing and supporting Wales Golf events at home and abroad. 

North Wales club Hawarden has gone from facing disaster to being named the Wales Golf Club of the Year supported by Howden, thanks to an impressive turnaround and commitment to sustainability over the last five years. 

Llantrisant and Pontyclun achieved a remarkable double, winning awards for the Junior Golf Club of the Year supported by Dot Golf and Volunteer of the Year supported by Chemical Corporation for Junior Leader Gavin Evans. 

Llandudno/Maesdu Golf Club added another award to their collection with the Sustainability Project of the Year supported by Citation, while Radyr PGA Professional Richard Bentham received the PGA Development Professional of the Year supported by Toptracer. Two players who have graduated onto the professional tours, James Ashfield and Darcey Harry, claimed the PING Golfer of the Year awards, while former professional Neil Roderick claimed the men's senior PING Men's Senior Player of the Year. Ann Lewis earned the PING Women's Senior Player of the Year award for the second year running. 

Wales Golf Chief Executive Hannah McAllister said: “Congratulations to all the winners, once again it took a very high standard to receive one of these awards with plenty of very tight competition. I would also like to thank our sponsors for supporting golf in Wales and these awards in particular.  From dedicated volunteers and rising stars to remarkable clubs, counties, and those with a lifetime of service, these awards showcase what makes our sport so special. This event is a chance to recognise those who have gone above and beyond, whether through their extraordinary achievements or their unwavering dedication to growing and inspiring the Welsh golfing community.”

He added: “This is a very exciting year for golf in Wales as we prepare to host the AIG Women's Open for the first time. All the world's top players will be here in the summer and we hope to use that to give women and girls golf a massive boost.  We have a £1 million legacy fund from Welsh Government to boost facilities and programmes around Wales, which will make a long-term impact – just as happened after Wales hosted the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor.”

Business owners have welcomed Liverpool City Council's decision to suspend controversial parking restrictions near Everton's new stadium.

An Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (Etro), including heavy restrictions on street parking, was introduced earlier this year within a half-hour walking radius of the Bramley-Moore Dock stadium.

On Monday, the council agreed to pause the restrictions until August in areas where businesses have been most heavily impacted.

Paul Blair, who owns the Hot Water Comedy Club, led a petition against the restrictions. He said that while businesses welcomed the council's decision, they were still feeling the impact of the seven weeks the rules have been in place.

""They've obviously seen an impact in sales and customers,"" said Mr Blair, who also owns Blackstock Market.

""There's been loads of concern about it moving forward, especially if they started to implement it every day in August, which is a huge concern.

""Hopefully there will be a proper economic impact assessment done and we're listened to before changes are made.""

The council said it had received more than 5,000 responses as part of a public consultation.

Business owners in the streets around the stadium said they were very worried about the council's initial plans to enforce traffic restrictions all year round, rather than only on matchdays. 

Some even claimed the rules could force them out of business.

Mr Blair said more than 200 companies had been affected by the restrictions and complained about what he regarded as a lack of communication. 

""Nobody knew about it,"" he said.

""These businesses operate every day. We have staff every day. We have about 5,000 customers a week and they were literally impacted straight away.

""It's just lack of foresight, lack of any economic impact assessment.""

Fraser Smith, managing director of the Downland bedding company which is based about 30 minutes from the stadium, said the council's concessions were ""fantastic news on face value"".

But he sounded a note of caution.

""It is only a temporary measure - we'll have to see what happens in August. But for now it's good news for all the businesses that are affected by this.""

Mr Blair said he was pleased with the way the local community had come together over the last few weeks.

He said he was hopeful that now there is an open line of communication with the council, any future changes will be discussed and agreed with residents and businesses before they introduced.

The council's cabinet member for transport and connectivity, Dan Barrington, said the restrictions were part of an ""experimental traffic order"" so changes could be made once it was live.

""It's given us this space to be able to listen to concerns from people, particularly as it went live, and we've taken that into consideration,"" he said.

""We really want to get the best situation for everyone in the area,"" added Barrington.

""It's complex and complicated - the whole reason we did this as an experimental traffic order was because we knew ultimately there would need to be tweaks and changes.""

Emanuel will become executive chairman of the newly-named WME Group, Mark Shapiro will lead it as president and managing director, while Whitesell exits to launch a new Silver Lake-backed venture.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


Endeavor is private once more, as the $25 billion deal by Silver Lake closed Monday morning.


	With the take-private complete, a slew of changes are in order. For starters, the newly-private businesses will go by WME Group, retiring the Endeavor name for public-facing purposes.




	Ari Emanuel, who founded Endeavor in 1995 and most recently served as CEO of the public venture, will shift to a new role as executive chairman.


	Mark Shapiro, who had been president and COO of Endeavor, will become president and managing partner, working in conjunction with Christian Muirhead and Richard Weitz, the WME co-chairs who will be co-chairmen of WME Group.

	And as widely expected, former Endeavor executive chairman Patrick Whitesell will exit to launch a new venture backed by Silver Lake that will “invest in and scale properties and IP across sports, media, and entertainment.” When the take-private was announced a year ago, it was noted that Whitesell's employment agreement included a provision for a new company backed by $250 million from Silver Lake.


	Emanuel will continue as chairman and CEO of TKO Group Holdings, the public company that owns UFC and WWE, and Shapiro will continue as president and COO of TKO.


	WME Group will include the WME agency, marketing firm 160over90, IMG licensing, and the unscripted studio Pantheon Media Group (formerly named Asylum Entertainment).


	“This remarkable moment— and the even more exciting future it launches—is thanks first and foremost to Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, and to the relentless and ambitious strategic vision they have shared for more than twenty years to build Endeavor into a global powerhouse across talent, brands, and IP spanning entertainment, media, and sports,” Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban said in a statement, adding that his firm has never sold a share in the company. “Silver Lake is proud and honored to be their partners since 2012 as they have continued to build the company. Over this period, revenue has grown by twentyfold. Silver Lake has previously invested on six separate occasions to support Endeavor and now, with this latest investment, it is the single largest position in our global portfolio.”


	“Mark Shapiro is an impressive, hard charging, creative, and determined leader who is driving and orchestrating massive value creation,” he added. “We look forward to continuing our work and partnership with him and the rest of the management team — including Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead at WME Group and Dana White, Andrew Schleimer, and the collective TKO leadership — all of whom are industry best.”

	











	“Our ability to deliver landmark partnerships, career-defining business opportunities, and enduring cultural moments is amplified by this transaction and the formation of WME Group,” Shapiro added. “The Silver Lake team has proven time and again that they are all-in on representation and content, and our clients, partners, and employees will thrive under our new structure.”


	“I am grateful to Egon and the team at Silver Lake for the trust they have placed in me as a founder and entrepreneur,” Emanuel added. “Together, we have created and enhanced a foundation unlike any other to accelerate value creation for clients and partners across WME Group and TKO, which I am excited to continue to build and grow.”


	“Everything we built at Endeavor would not have been possible without the partnership of Egon and the entire Silver Lake team,” Whitesell said. “Our industry is in the very early stages of generational transformation. I have never seen a more promising time for bold and ambitious entrepreneurs, creatives, and athletes.”


	“Silver Lake is enormously pleased and energized to partner and invest with Patrick in support of his new platform,” Durban added of the Whitesell venture.

The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.

But there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.

""It's the sound of money!"" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.

In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.

We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.

Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.

Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.

More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.

So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.

Each machine makes about $5 (£3.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.

Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.

At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.

""We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,"" he says.

Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.

It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.

British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.

Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.

Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.

""Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,"" Daniel says.

The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.

Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.

The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.

Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.

Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. 

So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.

""Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.""

He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.

""Getting power has changed my life,"" he smiles. ""The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.""

Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.

Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.

Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.

""Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,"" says Lucy.

The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.

""No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,"" says Tumba.

""Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,"" Lucy adds.

""We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.""

Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.

But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.

Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.

Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.

Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.

The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.

Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.

North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.

But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.

The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.

They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of ""untapped hydro potential"" she says.

""A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,"" she explains.

The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.

Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.

The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.

But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.

History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.



In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.

Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.

For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.

Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be ""mined, minted and made in the USA"" is to be achieved.

The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.

But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.

Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.

But they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.

Videos posted on social media show the smoking ruins of market stalls and charred bodies.

The two countries are on opposite sides in the war in their giant neighbour, DR Congo.

It would be responsible for licensing marine renewable energy, including offshore wind.

Decorated test pilot James O'Connell was in a ""good frame of mind"" prior to the crash, the BBC is told.

The States wants to spend £1.3m but says an offshore windfarm could be worth £1.3bn over 35 years.

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.

Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the ""premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.""

Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity.""

“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ... More high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin as traders pare back bets on Donald Trump's bitcoin and crypto policy.

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.

Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beashear yesterday signed House Bill 701, which offers greater protections for users who self-custody their Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

To self-custody Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency means that a user has full control over the private key needed to authorize transactions. It's more like having cash in a wallet than using a debit card to authorize your bank to send someone money.

Users who prefer that freedom also carry sole responsibility for protecting their holdings. A man in Wales has spent 12 years trying to get permission to excavate a landfill to retrieve a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin worth $696 million at today's price.

But if that's the risk users are willing to take, the state of Kentucky wants to protect their rights.

Crucially, the new law received unanimous support at 91-0 in the House during a vote on Feb. 28 and again in the Senate on March 13 with 37-0, before being approved by the governor.

This new law will guarantee the rights of individuals to hold and manage cryptocurrencies in their self-hosted wallets. This should mean those in Kentucky can gain total control over their cryptocurrency, without any issues of interference.

As such, this means local governments will not be able to enact discriminatory laws that unfairly target crypto mining.

The law also clarifies that neither mining nor staking rewards are classified as securities. And operating blockchain nodes and staking will be exempt from Kentucky's money transmitter regulations.

Kentucky is also reviewing House Bill 376, which proposes the creation of a crypto reserve for the state. This would allow investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets with a market cap of $750 billion.

This new Kentucky law comes as a growing number of states are moving towards greater embrace of cryptocurrency.

A third of states are currently exploring crypto for public funds, with 19 states in ongoing legislative considerations.

Notably Utah passed a bill, on January 28, that will authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds to ""qualifying digital assets."" This is as long as they meet the main requirement of having over $500 billion in market capitalization, averaged over the past 12 months.

New Mexico is another example of Bitcoin support with Senator Anthony L. Thornton introducing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB275) on February 4, proposing a 5% allocation of public funds to Bitcoin.

At time of publishing there are 16 states actively being tracked by the Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

It's worth noting that while there is interest here, most are capped at 10%, and there are still the majority of states that are not looking into crypto at this stage.

And some states—like Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania—have already rejected the efforts to convert tax dollars into Bitcoin.

 Crypto investors welcomed Trump's return to the White House, but after a record-breaking rally, tariff turmoil and global retaliation dragged Bitcoin below $80K. 

Since US President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Bitcoin (BTC) has swung from a record high of $109,000 to below $78,000 as major tariff announcements from the US and retaliatory moves from trade partners shaved off chunks of cryptocurrency market value and rattled global markets.

“The back-and-forth on tariffs, with Trump sometimes tough and sometimes accommodating, has left markets in a limbo state, where few people are willing to be decidedly bullish but just as few are willing to part with their assets, fearing to be left on the side-lines at the next rally,” Justin d'Anethan, head of sales at Liquify, told Cointelegraph.

By mid-March, investors began regaining confidence as White House messaging pointed to a more measured approach. But mixed signals remain, and with a second wave of “reciprocal tariffs” looming on April 2 — dubbed Liberation Day — market jitters haven't fully subsided.

Trump's trade war saga has rattled global markets but evolved to a softer stance by late March.

Bitcoin hovered above $100,000 until Jan. 26, when Trump threatened 25% tariffs on all Colombian imports after Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused to accept US military aircraft carrying deported migrants. Petro accused Trump of mistreating immigrants and retaliated with tariffs of his own.

Colombia quickly reversed course — agreeing to accept deportees — after facing pressure over its dependence on US trade. Bitcoin reclaimed $100,000 shortly after. But market sentiment was further shaken by the sudden rise of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, whose budget-built model sparked fears of disruption in the tech sector and contributed to risk-off sentiment across markets.

On Feb. 1, Trump signed an executive order to impose 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports and 25% on Canadian and Mexican goods, effective Feb. 4, citing national emergency over immigration and fentanyl. China, Canada and Mexico all threatened retaliation.

Bitcoin tumbled below $93,000, rebounding only after Trump agreed to a 30-day pause on the Canada and Mexico tariffs on Feb. 3. But the Chinese tariffs took effect as scheduled on Feb. 4 — and that was the last time Bitcoin traded above $100,000.

Bitcoin remained volatile through mid-February. On Feb. 10, Trump announced the removal of steel and aluminum tariff exemptions, raising all metal tariffs to 25%, effective March 12. He then unveiled a “reciprocal tariffs” plan to match foreign import taxes.

Bitcoin held steady around $93,000 and briefly rallied to $99,000. But on Feb. 21, the momentum collapsed following the Bybit hack — the largest crypto breach in history — sending Bitcoin back below $90,000.

On Feb. 25, Trump added to bearish pressure by ordering a review of potential tariffs on imported copper, citing national security. Bitcoin dipped below $80,000 for the first time since November.

March kicked off with Trump issuing another order reviewing tariffs on lumber and timber. But crypto briefly rallied after the White House unveiled plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and digital asset stockpile — including XRP, SOL, and ADA.

On March 4, Trump followed through with 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and doubled Chinese tariffs to 20%. All three countries vowed to retaliate. The next day, Trump granted a one-month exemption on tariffs for US automakers importing from Canada and Mexico. A day later, the White House extended the tariff pause on many imports that qualify under the USMCA, while still threatening reciprocal tariffs on April 2.

Trump credited Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for “unprecedented” border cooperation. Canada also signaled easing tensions. Bitcoin see-sawed on the $90,000 mark but eventually dipped below on March 7, and it has not reclaimed that level at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, Trump finalized the steel and aluminum hikes. Then on March 13, he threatened 200% tariffs on European wine, champagne and spirits if the EU moved forward with a 50% tax on American whiskey as a retaliation against steel and aluminum tax.

By mid-March, the administration's tone began to soften. On March 18, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said tariffs would be tailored to each country's trade practices and could be avoided entirely if partners lowered their own barriers.

Financial markets, rattled for weeks, began to recover. On March 24, Bitcoin rose to $88,474 on reports that Trump's next round of tariffs would be more targeted than initially feared.

“In the week leading up to Trump's reciprocal tariffs on April 2, expect market volatility, corporate lobbying for exemptions, preemptive price hikes, and global diplomatic efforts to mitigate the impact,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research said in a written analysis shared with Cointelegraph.

“After the tariffs take effect, anticipate inflation spikes, supply chain disruptions, and mixed job outcomes, with potential stock market shocks and retaliatory trade measures from partners like China and Canada possibly slowing US economic growth.”

Meanwhile, Liquify's d'Anethan said investors should continue monitoring traditional market developments, especially with Bitcoin's rising correlation with traditional indexes.

“With BTC's correlation to the S&P 500 and other traditional assets, it wouldn't be silly to discount tariffs and geopolitical maneuvering,” he said.

With April 2 approaching, crypto markets remain fragile — and investors are bracing for what “Liberation Day” might bring. Trump recently hinted while speaking to reporters that tariffs on automobiles, aluminum and pharmaceuticals are under consideration.

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a notable surge, gaining 3% in the last 24 hours, climbing from $84,000 to $88,600, following reports that upcoming US tariffs on major trading partners will be less severe than initially anticipated. 

However, altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have outperformed Bitcoin's surge in the 24-hour time frame, being the top gainers in the ten largest cryptocurrencies list. 

Bitcoin And Top Altcoins Experience Significant Gains

Scheduled for announcement on April 2, President Donald Trump had previously indicated that he would impose both reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs on countries including Canada, China, and Mexico. 

However, anonymous sources within the White House, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have suggested that the president may opt for a narrower approach, focusing solely on reciprocal tariffs. 

According to the reports, this shift in strategy appears to signal a tempering of the administration's approach to a “potential trade war”, which has historically led to increased volatility in both the cryptocurrency and equity markets.

Dan Greer, CEO of Defi App, a decentralized finance platform, noted the correlation between Bitcoin's recent price increase and the news of the tariff adjustments. “This surge in Bitcoin's price coincides with reports that the Trump administration is considering narrowing the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2,” he stated.

The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has extended to the broader cryptocurrency market, with nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization experiencing gains on Monday. 

Ethereum rose by 4%, XRP by 2%, Solana, DOGE and Cardano led the pack with increases of 8%, 7.8% and 4.5% respectively. The stock market reflected this optimism, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices rising 2% over the past 24 hours.

Expert Insights On BTC's Recent Fluctuations

Greer highlighted that this development has alleviated some market uncertainties, leading to increased investor confidence across both cryptocurrency and equity markets. 

The crypto sector, which has faced mixed reactions since Trump took office, has been grappling with the implications of his fluctuating tariff policies. These policies have introduced a considerable degree of economic uncertainty, prompting many investors to retreat from riskier assets.

The anticipated tariffs—expected to raise the prices of foreign goods—could lead to inflation, further complicating the economic landscape. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $109,000 in January, has seen a decline, dropping to $78,000 earlier this month amid fears that aggressive economic policies could trigger a recession.

Colin Closser, investor relations manager at crypto wallet company Exodus, expressed his understanding of the crypto market's reaction to Trump's policies. “I expect markets to show emotion and volatility during times of change and stress in the United States, and you can see that volatility in Bitcoin this morning,” he remarked.

Since the spike, Bitcoin has seen a bit of a pullback towards the $86,930 level, with the most notable support floor between $83,000 and $84,000.

Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 7% as majors staged a relief rally on Tuesday driven by talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being more measured than initially expected.

As per reports, President Donald Trump's planned ""reciprocal tariffs"" set for April 2 may be more targeted than previously threatened, with some countries exempt and existing metal levies possibly not stacking.

The tariffs unsettled markets in February, shocking stocks and cryptocurrencies alike with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 17.6% to below $80,000 from its January peak.

Last week, the Federal Reserve raised inflation forecasts and lowered growth projections, likely due to Trump's trade stance, but described the tariff-driven inflation as temporary while maintaining plans for two rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets.

This, along with the possibility of milder tariffs, has boosted market optimism, and memecoins are leading the charge. DOGE, pepecoin (PEPE), mog (MOG), floki (FLOKI), among others, are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with the meme sector up 5.6% on average, per CoinGecko data.

That has beaten a 3% run in bitcoin, Solana's SOL and XRP, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index up 2.7%.

Memecoins jump or act as beta bets when ether (ETH) or bitcoin rise because they're highly speculative assets with amplified sensitivity to broader crypto market trends.

Retail traders often see relief in majors as a signal of bullish sentiment across the crypto ecosystem — chasing higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities like memecoins, which are typically cheaper and can deliver rapid gains in relatively shorter periods.

Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence (AI) majors are stable after Alibaba's Joe Tsai said he sees sign of a bubble forming in the ecosystem, the category is up 4.5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

“I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” Tsai said during an HSBC conference in Hong Kong. “I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec. There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.”

Investment in AI appears to be occurring ahead of current demand, Tsai believes.

NEAR protocol, the largest AI token by market cap, is flat in trading today, but up 14% in the last week as the market continues to positively digest news that Coinbase and the biggest names in AI were working together to collaboratively develop AI agent technology.

Story's IP token also continues to do well, up 8% on-day, as the project continues to secure notable Hollywood and Korean popstar intellectual property to monetize on its chain. Story has pitched its project as a way for rights holders to survive the AI revolution by easily creating frameworks to license their content for AI training.

Oops, something went wrong

Cryptocurrency is a hot topic these days, and its price is closely followed along with other markets. But are there real-world applications for cryptocurrency beyond trading it? There are, and you can start with something as mundane as paying your bills.

Discover Now: 7 Luxury SUVs That Will Become Affordable in 2025

Find Out: Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On

Here's what you need to know about how to pay your bills with cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency is defined as a digital currency that is decentralized and designed to be used over the internet a large crypto platform. Its value rises and falls based on trading, much like the stock market, as opposed to traditional currencies that are backed by a government.

You buy and sell crypto on an online exchange, using an app like Coinbase. There are several different cryptocurrencies. Some of the most popular include bitcoin, dogecoin, litecoin, and ethereum. You can buy or sell crypto using U.S. dollars or most other currencies.

The price of each cryptocurrency will fluctuate daily, and this volatility is one of the drawbacks of crypto. Make sure you understand the cost of the type of crypt you're buying. For example, as of March 22, one bitcoin was trading at $84,009.65, and one dogecoin was trading at 17 cents.

You'll need a wallet to hold your cryptocurrency. Since crypto is not physical currency, like bills and coins, you will need a virtual wallet, into which your private crypto keys will be deposited when you purchase crypto.

There are hardware (cold) and software (hot) crypto wallets. Hardware wallets are physical devices, similar to a USB drive or a hardware ‘safe. Trezor, Blockstream, and Ledger are companies that make hardware crypto wallets. Makers of hardware wallets tout their security as keys are stored on a secure device as opposed to on an app.

Software wallets are provided by crypto apps like Coinbase, Binance, and Trust Wallet. These app-based wallets are easier to use and more convenient than hardware wallets as you can buy, sell, and trade crypto on your phone.

These apps offer different features related to bill paying; for example, Coinbase offers a debit card which you can use to set up automatic payments for bills like utilities and subscriptions.

Several crypto apps are specifically designed for paying bills. BitPay and CoinGate are two examples. Binance has BinancePay for bill payments.

Now that you have purchased crypto and stored it on your wallet, it's time to use it to pay your bills. Not all vendors accept crypto as payment directly now, but more and more companies are moving toward it as it increases in popularity.

Check with the company you are paying to see if they will accept crypto payments directly, If not, you may need to use a third-party platform to facilitate the transaction. Some of these charge a transaction fee, so be sure to compare the costs of the different methods that are available to you.

Depending on the company or organization you are paying, you may be able to pay these bills with crypto, either directly or through a third-party payment platform:

Rent or mortgage

Utilities

Car payment

Subscriptions

Utilities

Credit card bills

You may not be able to pay all your bills with crypto today, or it may not be cost-effective to do so. But given the increasing popularity of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, the day when virtual currencies are used to pay for nearly everything may not be far off.

Yes. Many companies can accept crypto payments directly, and for those that don't, you may be able to use a third-party payment processor to pay bills with crypto.

The app or wallet you use to buy and store crypto should have an option for you to sell your crypto and specify the currency you want to receive in exchange.

You can pay directly with cryptocurrency if the receiving business accepts it, or you can use a third-party payment processor that accepts crypto and pays the recipient in dollars or another currency.

Most U.S. banks do not accept cryptocurrency as payment, but this is changing. As digital currency becomes more popular, banks are beginning to offer crypto-related services and will likely accept crypto in the future.

Tabit Insurance has announced the capitalization of its $40 million insurance facility.

The fundraise, announced Monday (March 24), was provided entirely in bitcoin, which Tabit says is an industry first.

“The company's regulators and auditors can verify the funding in real time, marking a distinctive and novel approach to transparency for the insurance industry,” Tabit said in a news release.

With the market currently “priced at attractive levels” and alternative capital sources increasingly serving as a source of capacity, Tabit says its use of bitcoin “provides an innovative source of capital” for the insurance sector.

The release added that while the capital is held in bitcoin, the company said its insurance policies and premiums are all denominated in U.S. dollars.

“Our approach to capital allocation underscores our confidence in providing a steady hand to our partners,” said William Shihara, co-founder of Tabit. “By combining traditional balance sheet strength with carefully chosen assets like bitcoin, we're able to stay responsive to market shifts and better serve the insurance community. This solution offers a regulated dollar return which we're excited to earn on an alternative asset class such as bitcoin.”

According to the release, the $40 million in capital is verifiable on the blockchain “in the manner of proof of reserves,” offering greater transparency than would be found with quarterly disclosures and allowing for constant oversight by regulators in Barbados, where Tabit is based.

In other digital asset news, PYMNTS wrote last week about the risks businesses face by turning to stablecoins. As that report said, the lack of standardized disclosures around reserve compositions can mask the true backing of stablecoins. Reserves comprised of less liquid or higher-risk assets may not be able to deliver the stability users were expecting, especially during periods of market volatility.​

“The short answer is … Stablecoin deposits aren't protected by any government-backed institutions. Some coins, like USDC, claim to be backed 1:1 with reserves like cash or short-term treasuries, but the reality is much more complex. Some stablecoins also include commercial paper or other financial instruments in their reserves,” Lissele Pratt, co-founder at Capitalixe, said in an interview with PYMNTS.

“The risk of this is that it falls on the issuer. If something goes wrong, like with TerraUSD for instance, users are left holding the bag, and regulators usually step in too late to prevent significant losses. This is why trust in the issuer is crucial, but as recent events have shown, trust can be a fragile thing,” Pratt added.

A newly launched reserve of 10 million Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), valued at approximately $1.83 million, has been established to advance the cryptocurrency's use in real-world payments.

What Happened: The initiative, spearheaded by House of Doge, a newly formed organization dedicated to expanding Dogecoin's adoption through business partnerships and integrations, aims to position DOGE as a mainstream payment tool for consumers and merchants alike, Decrypt reported on Monday.

Unlike traditional reserves such as the strategic Bitcoin reserve, which are primarily used as financial hedges, this Dogecoin reserve will serve as a liquidity pool to ease and support transactions across a global network of businesses.

""House of Doge is laying the groundwork for a robust payments ecosystem designed to deliver liquidity and reliability,"" said Michael Galloro, a board-elect member of House of Doge. ""The reserve helps ensure that Dogecoin can be used practically for daily purchases by smoothing transaction processing times.""

The reserve is intended to address blockchain-related delays, which House of Doge sees as a barrier to the widespread use of digital assets in retail payments.

Beyond liquidity, the organization plans to implement loyalty programs and offer incentives to merchants that accept DOGE.

An official announcement of its first major partnership is expected in the near future.

Dogecoin has been gaining increased recognition in financial markets.

Asset managers like Grayscale and Bitwise have recently filed for Dogecoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), reinforcing the meme coin's growing legitimacy.

A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) wallet valued at $250 million has sprung back to life after an eight-year hiatus, triggering a wave of speculation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

What Happened: A Bitcoin wallet, initially valued at around $3 million in 2017, has recently become active after eight years of dormancy. The wallet now holds a staggering $250 million worth of Bitcoin.

Such occurrences usually set off a storm of speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Some members have suggested that the wallet's owner may have rediscovered their private keys, leading to the sudden activity.

Previously, a dormant Bitcoin whale holding $29.3 million also became active after several years of inactivity. In 2024, several Satoshi-era whales suddenly resumed activity, including a wallet containing 2,000 Bitcoins mined in 2010 that made a transfer for the first time in 14 years.

Earlier on Sunday, a massive $252 million was transferred to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert data. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,334.

Why It Matters: The sudden resurgence of dormant Bitcoin whales can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. The movement of such large amounts of Bitcoin can create waves in the market, potentially leading to price volatility.

This could potentially signal selling pressure, which may affect Bitcoin's price. The re-emergence of these whales, coupled with the recent transfer of $252 million to an unknown wallet, underscores the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Defunct Japanese crypto exchange Mt. Gox made waves early Tuesday, moving large amounts of bitcoin (BTC) to two wallets, according to on-chain data tracking platform Arkham Intelligence.

The address associated with the exchange transferred 893 BTC ($78.11M) to its hot wallet, labelled 1Jbez and 10,608 BTC ($927.48M) to a change wallet identified as 1DcoA during Tuesday's early Asian trading hours when the cryptocurrency traded above $87,000 in the spot market.

The latest action is the exchange's third significant on-chain movement of funds in four weeks. 

The exchange moved over $900 million in BTC on March 11 and over $1 billion in BTC on March 6. However, the latest coin shuffling has not impacted the spot price so far, as seen early this month.

That's in stark contrast to mid-last year, when Mt. Gox's transfer of coins spurred fears of creditor liquidations, causing price volatility.

However, last October, the exchange extended its complete creditor payout deadline by a full year to Oct. 31, 2025, citing ongoing verification and processing requirements for claimants.

 The recent trade tensions could present an opportunity for American hardware manufacturers to help ramp up onshore Bitcoin mining, according to a US Bitcoin mining supplier. 

US President Donald Trump's trade war with China and efforts to ramp up on-shore Bitcoin mining will be a boon for US mining rig manufacturers, which currently only hold a small sliver of market share compared to their major Chinese counterparts. 

The United States accounts for over 40% of the Bitcoin network's global hashrate but still leans heavily on China-made mining rigs. China-based Bitmain reportedly holds as much as a 90% market share in the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. 

“Trump's continued focus to support the US BTC mining industry highlights the urgent need to address US reliance on foreign technology,” Auradine's chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, told Cointelegraph in a recent interview. 

US Bitcoin firms hit a major supply problem last year, with thousands of Bitcoin (BTC) miners held at ports of entry by the US Customs and Border Protection. 

One of the firms affected believed it was due to a mistaken belief that the chips were illegally imported Chinese radio frequency devices. It took months before they started being released. 

Gupta said that US-China trade tensions have also disrupted the flow of foreign Bitcoin miners. 

“These trade tensions have increased supply chain disruptions with many hardware shipments facing delays and uncertainties,” Gupta said.

The US was already competing with China to win the high-end chip manufacturing market, but the recent trade tensions have only “intensified” these challenges for US-based crypto miners, he added. 

China-based Bitmain is said to hold the majority of the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. It expanded its production line into the US last December to improve supply chain efficiency.

Gupta said his firm could also stand well-positioned amid Trump's plan to ramp up onshore manufacturing as a “dramatic increase in demand” for electricity would, in turn, “put a tremendous deal of pressure on the electric grid” — making it more important for Bitcoin miners to operate off-grid. 

Auradine recently announced the launch of its new Teraflux AH3880 hydro-cooled Bitcoin miner, competing with the likes of Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan.

Asked whether a further uptick in Bitcoin mining activity in the US could hurt Bitcoin decentralization, Gupta said that securing the Bitcoin network with more energy-efficient solutions in the US would be a “net positive” for Bitcoin but said there could be risks if the increase outpaces technology in sustainability and decentralization. 

Over 95% of the network's hash power already comes from the US and China alone, according to the Hashrate Index.

BlackRock has launched a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. 

The iShares Bitcoin ETP is 100% physically backed by bitcoin, and its securities are held directly through Coinbase. It aims to give European investors exposure to bitcoin without the complexities of trading or holding it themselves.

The new ETP leverages the technology integration between Coinbase and BlackRock. At the end of each day, Coinbase transfers the bitcoin in the trading wallet into segregated, offline, cold storage wallets.

BlackRock launches its first European bitcoin product, a physically backed bitcoin ETP. The move brings the world's largest asset manager into the European bitcoin landscape.

Asset management giant BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin product in Europe: a physically backed bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP).

The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading Tuesday on Germany's Xetra exchange and Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam. The ETP will trade under the ticker IB1T on Xetra and Euronext Paris and as BTCN on Euronext Amsterdam.

JUST IN: $11.5 trillion Blackrock is launching a #Bitcoin ETP in Europe 🇪🇺 pic.twitter.com/dZ8z3N3tGv

The new product comes after BlackRock debuted a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. last year. The U.S. ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has attracted over $50 billion in assets and has become the largest spot bitcoin ETF globally. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has voiced scepticism of bitcoin but appears to have warmed up to bitcoin amid client demand.

By launching a European bitcoin ETP, BlackRock is giving institutional investors in the region exposure to bitcoin's price performance in a familiar and regulated wrapper. Crypto ETPs have existed in Europe for years but lag U.S. bitcoin ETFs in assets.

BlackRock's bitcoin ETP carries a management fee of 0.25%, reduced to 0.15% through a temporary fee waiver until year-end 2025. The ETP uses Coinbase for custody.

As the largest asset manager globally with over $10 trillion under management, BlackRock brings significant scale and distribution power. The move signals growing mainstream embrace of bitcoin as an emerging institutional asset class.

Bitcoin (BTC) options worth billions of dollars will expire on Deribit on Friday. The impending settlement, though big, may not yield significant market volatility, the exchange told CoinDesk.

More than 139,000 BTC option contracts, worth $12.13 billion, representing nearly 45% of the total active BTC contracts across all expiries, are due for settlement this Friday, according to data source Deribit metrics. 

More than 65% of the total open interest is concentrated in call options that provide buyers with an asymmetric bullish exposure, while the rest is in put options offering downside protection.

Quarterly expiries of such massive magnitudes are known to breed market volatility, but that may not be the case this time, going by the continued decline in the bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (DVOL). The index has dropped from an annualized 62% to 48% in the weeks leading up to the expiry, suggesting subdued volatility expectations.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the annualized perpetual futures basis of around 5% on the exchange, signalling a calmer funding environment.

""Despite the size of the expiry, the overall setup—low DVOL, moderate basis, and balanced options positioning—points to a relatively subdued expiry unless external catalysts emerge,"" Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

Options skew, which measures the difference between implied volatility (pricing) for calls relative to puts, shows downside concerns in the lead-up to Friday's expiry.

That said, the broader outlook remains constructive.

""3-Day Put-Call Skew is Slightly Positive indicating some immediate downside protection demand while 30-Day Put-Call Skew is slightly Negative indicating a more bullish outlook over the medium term,"" Strijers said.

Also expiring Friday are ether (ETH) options worth $2.8 billion.

According to WallStreetBulls, tariffs have the potential to significantly enhance a tax-free, US-made cryptocurrency boom, potentially unleashing trillions in liquidity. This perspective suggests that increased tariffs might create an environment conducive to US-based crypto growth, impacting major cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and Solana. However, any actual impact on market liquidity or crypto valuations would depend on specific policy implementations and market responses. [WallStreetBulls, March 25, 2025]

XRP and Solana saw the highest inflows among altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the week ending March 21, with $6.71 million and $6.44 million.

Despite Ethereum's losses, the digital asset market ended a five-week streak of net outflows, bringing in $644 million. Bitcoin led the recovery, attracting $724 million in inflows—its largest since January. The bulk of this came from the U.S., where BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) played a significant role, contributing to the country's total inflows of $632 million. Switzerland recorded $15.9 million, Germany saw $13.9 million, and Hong Kong added $1.2 million. Meanwhile, Canada and Sweden experienced net outflows.

Ethereum's poor performance weighed on the altcoin market, with other assets also seeing losses. Sui and Polkadot each had $1.3 million in outflows, while Tron lost $950,000. However, Solana's strong inflows come amid anticipation of the first Solana futures ETF in the U.S., which could eventually pave the way for a spot Solana ETF.

XRP also benefited from regulatory developments. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, a case that had been ongoing for years. This decision likely increased investor confidence in XRP, contributing to its strong inflows for the week.

Bitcoin ETFs have been a major focus of the market, particularly with the SEC's shifting stance on spot ETFs. Initially, futures-based Bitcoin ETFs gained approval due to the regulated nature of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which eased concerns over market manipulation. However, a lawsuit from Grayscale challenged the SEC's rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs, forcing regulators to reconsider. This led to the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that has significantly impacted investor sentiment.

Bitcoin's strong inflows helped stabilize the digital asset market despite Ethereum's ongoing struggles. While the altcoin sector as a whole was dragged down by Ethereum's losses, XRP and Solana stood out as exceptions, benefiting from legal and market developments.

Bitcoin could surge to $110,000 before pulling back to $76,500, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.

Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, believes Bitcoin may have already hit its local bottom and is now rebounding. He pointed to the Federal Reserve's dovish stance and President Trump's flexible position on tariffs as factors boosting confidence. He also highlighted a drop in selling pressure, with U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recording net inflows of around $744 million last week, including $537 million from BlackRock alone, according to Farside Investors.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Bitcoin's rise past $85,000 has been seen as a bullish signal. Analyst Emmanuel Cardozo expects liquidity conditions and discussions about a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve to drive Bitcoin toward $110,000. However, he also warned that a correction to $76,500 remains possible due to market volatility.

With Bitcoin trading around $87,000, investors are watching central bank policies and liquidity trends closely. While the outlook remains positive, market corrections could still happen as traders navigate price fluctuations.

Chris Kuiper, director of research at Fidelity's digital assets unit, has opined that both Bitcoin and gold are driven by the same market forces (liquidity and inflation expectations).

He noted that Bitcoin had ""barely managed"" to make a new high in gold terms in December. The leading cryptocurrency barely budged compared to the double top that was recorded during the previous bull market.

Kuiper then added that gold surged nearly 70% over the period from 2019 to 2020. After the yellow metal eventually peaked, Bitcoin rallied by more than 100%. 

The Fidelity executive does not believe that the same scenario will necessarily play out this time around. ""We will see if this time is similar or different,"" he added.

Kuiper views gold as a more established market for major players where the market forces get sniffed out first. Bitcoin is more retail-focused, and it tends to experience ""final euphoric bull runs."" 

This is supposed to explain why Bitcoin is severely underperforming gold as of now. 

As reported by U.Today, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity, recently stated that gold and Bitcoin were actually on the same team.

Blackrock is entering the crypto space with a European-listed Bitcoin ETP rooted in Switzerland—combining institutional-grade access with Swiss structuring.

On Tuesday, Blackrock launched the iShares Bitcoin ETP, providing European investors with access to Bitcoin without the need to directly trade or hold the cryptocurrency.

The securities are backed by Bitcoin held by Coinbase, which is also responsible for the custody solution and the process controls safeguarding the private keys. For the iShares Bitcoin ETP, the Bitcoins are transferred daily from the trading wallet to segregated offline wallets («cold storage»).

Lower fee through year-end



«There's a lot of Switzerland in the iShares Bitcoin ETP. BlackRock Switzerland played a key role in its development,» said Dirk Klee, Country Head for Switzerland.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 25 basis points, with a temporary reduction to 15 basis points in effect through the end of the year. The underlying Swiss special purpose vehicle (SPV) is exempt from Swiss stamp duty on both purchases and sales. 

Building a bridge

Blackrock took its time before launching the iShares Bitcoin ETP. Ultimately, it was the evolution of the cryptocurrency space in recent years—combined with growing client demand—that prompted the firm to move forward.

«We believe ETPs can play a key role in building a bridge between crypto and traditional finance, due to their efficiency and ease of use,» said Klee. For investors with appropriate governance frameworks and sufficient risk tolerance, a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios is justifiable, he added.

According to a recently published Bloomberg piece, BlackRock has brought a new cryptocurrency product to the European market as it has launched a Bitcoin ETP (exchange-traded product) there.

BlackRock brings Bitcoin ETP to Europe

BlackRock's fund iShares, which launched the spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT in January last year, now plans to list a new Bitcoin ETP ticker name IB1T on Xetra and Euronext Paris. The new product will also be listed in the Netherlands on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN, said Bloomberg, citing BlackRock's statement.

BlackRock the world's largest asset manager, is launching a Bitcoin exchanged-traded product in Europe https://t.co/3TCf3G5FFH

The new Bitcoin product for exchanges will offer a temporary fee discount of 10% with a lower expense ratio until the end of 2025. This is the very first step taken by BlackRock to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the U.S. after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF.

IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF, holding roughly half a million Bitcoin valued at approximately $48 billion. When it was launched in January last year, it quickly gained traction and began attracting billions of U.S. dollars every month.

Even though, there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years, the local market is much smaller compared to the U.S. - $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. 

The largest crypto ETP in Europe is so far run by CoinShares International Ltd, with $1.3 billion in Bitcoin under management, and it charges a 0.25% fee. So far, until the end of the year, BlackRock will be offering a much cheaper fee of 0.15%.

As for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., last week, they witnessed almost $800 million in netflows, with BlackRock scoring the largest one of 6,342.47 BTC worth $535,582,902.

As Bitcoin proxy BlackRock IBIT's correlation with the Nasdaq nears 70%, historical trends point to the likelihood of a soon-to-come divergence in performance.

Bitcoin's (BTC) correlation with the Nasdaq appears to be inching closer to a level that has only been reached twice before right before BTC price crashed 20%, data from Singapore-based blockchain firm Matrixport reveals.

In a recent X post, Matrixport revealed that the 30-day realized correlation between Bitcoin proxy IBIT and the Nasdaq is likely due to such factors as the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions.

“This correlation reflects the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season, along with ongoing uncertainty and the negative overhang from tariff discussions. As a result, Bitcoin is trading in line with the tech sector.”

Matrixport

Despite the current trend, Matrixport cautions that such high correlations typically do not last for long, noting that “such high correlations have historically been short-lived, suggesting that a divergence in performance between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq may be on the horizon.” The last two times the correlation reached this level, Bitcoin's price dropped by more than 20%, according to data from crypto price aggregators.

While the latest correlation activity could point to Bitcoin potentially decoupling from the Nasdaq's influence in the near future, there's still no clear timeline or certainty that such a divergence will happen.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds returned to weekly inflows as BTC settled back above the crucial $85,000 support level, which analysts believe is necessary for the next leg higher. 10x Research's Markus Thielen noted in a March 23 report that Bitcoin's reversal indicators have turned bullish, with the 21-day moving average now at $85,200.

 It comes on the same day Oklahoma's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act passed the State House of Representatives, bringing a reserve one step closer to potential enactment. 

Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has signed a measure known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law, enshrining protections for crypto users, as two other US states' Bitcoin reserve legislation advanced.

Crypto advocacy group the Satoshi Action Fund said in a March 24 statement to X that House Bill 701 protects the “right to self-custody, run a node, and use of digital assets” without “fear of discrimination.” 

First introduced to the Kentucky House by Rep Adam Bowling on Feb. 19, HB701's description says it safeguards the right to use digital assets and self-custody wallets and bans local zoning changes that discriminate against crypto mining. 

Source: Satoshi Action Fund

At the same time, the legislation provides guidelines for running a crypto node, excludes crypto mining from money transmitter license requirements, and specifies that mining and staking are not considered offering or selling a security.

The bill passed Kentucky's House of Representatives on Feb. 28, with all 91 representatives voting in favor, and passed the state Senate on March 13, with all 37 senators voting in favor. It was then signed into law by Beshear on March 24. 

The legislation mirrors similar legislation signed into law by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt in May 2024.

Kentucky has also introduced a bill to establish a Bitcoin reserve, allowing the State Investment Commission to allocate up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC); the bill is still under review. 

Meanwhile, Oklahoma's House Bill 1203 (HB 1203), known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, has passed the State House of Representatives 77 to 15, according to the crypto advocacy group, the Oklahoma Bitcoin Association.

The bill was introduced to the Oklahoma House of Representatives on Jan. 15 by state Representative Cody Maynard and passed the Government Oversight Committee with a 12–2 vote on Feb. 25.

It must now pass through the Senate before the Oklahoma governor can veto or sign the bill into law. Oklahoma State Senator Dusty Deevers also filed legislation on Jan. 8 that would allow residents in the state to receive salaries in Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin legislation tracker group Bitcoin Laws said in a March 24 X post that Oklahoma has now moved into equal second place with Texas in the State Bitcoin reserve race.

Arizona remains in the lead after two strategic digital asset reserve bills cleared Arizona's House Rules Committee on March 24 and headed to the House floor for a full vote.

Bitcoin Laws speculates that because Republicans dominate the Oklahoma Senate and the governor is Republican, the bill “has a good chance to pass into law.” 

Missouri's Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs is also in the process of evaluating the state's Bitcoin reserve bill, according to Bitcoin Laws.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Han Jong-Hee, a senior Samsung Electronics executive credited with elevating the company's television business, died Tuesday, the company said. He was 63.

Han, a co-chief executive who oversaw the company's consumer electronics and mobile devices businesses, died at a hospital after being treated for a heart attack, Samsung said.

Han joined Samsung in 1988 and spent most of his career in TV-related divisions, during which the company became the world's leading TV manufacturer. He was appointed co-vice chairman and CEO in 2022.

Samsung, one of the world's largest technology companies, has dual strengths in components and finished consumer products. The company had separate CEOs for its two major business divisions, the other being computer chips, which are all under the broader leadership of third-generation corporate heir and chairman Lee Jae-yong.

Jun Young Hyun, the semiconductor chief executive, will now take over Han's duties as the company's sole CEO, Samsung said in a regulatory filing.

Reducing the amount of agricultural sprays used by farmers — including fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides — could cut down the amount of polluting runoff that ends up in the environment while at the same time reducing farmers' costs and perhaps even enhancing their productivity. A classic win-win-win.

A team of researchers at MIT and a spinoff company they launched has developed a system to do just that. Their technology adds a thin coating around droplets as they are being sprayed onto a field, greatly reducing their tendency to bounce off leaves and end up wasted on the ground. Instead, the coated droplets stick to the leaves as intended.

The research is described today in the journal Soft Matter, in a paper by recent MIT alumni Vishnu Jayaprakash PhD '22 and Sreedath Panat PhD '23, graduate student Simon Rufer, and MIT professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi.

A recent study found that if farmers didn't use pesticides, they would lose 78 percent of fruit, 54 percent of vegetable, and 32 percent of cereal production. Despite their importance, a lack of technology that monitors and optimizes sprays has forced farmers to rely on personal experience and rules of thumb to decide how to apply these chemicals. As a result, these chemicals tend to be over-sprayed, leading to runoff and chemicals ending up in waterways or building up in the soil.

Pesticides take a significant toll on global health and the environment, the researchers point out. A recent study found that 31 percent of agricultural soils around the world were at high risk from pesticide pollution. And agricultural chemicals are a major expense for farmers: In the U.S., they spend $16 billion a year just on pesticides.

Making spraying more efficient is one of the best ways to make food production more sustainable and economical. Agricultural spraying essentially boils down to mixing chemicals into water and spraying water droplets onto plant leaves, which are often inherently water-repellent. “Over more than a decade of research in my lab at MIT, we have developed fundamental understandings of spraying and the interaction between droplets and plants — studying when they bounce and all the ways we have to make them stick better and enhance coverage,” Varanasi says.

The team had previously found a way to reduce the amount of sprayed liquid that bounces away from the leaves it strikes, which involved using two spray nozzles instead of one and spraying mixtures with opposite electrical charges. But they found that farmers were reluctant to take on the expense and effort of converting their spraying equipment to a two-nozzle system. So, the team looked for a simpler alternative.

They discovered they could achieve the same improvement in droplet retention using a single-nozzle system that can be easily adapted to existing sprayers. Instead of giving the droplets of pesticide an electric charge, they coat each droplet with a vanishingly thin layer of an oily material.

In their new study, they conducted lab experiments with high-speed cameras. When they sprayed droplets with no special treatment onto a water-repelling (hydrophobic) surface similar to that of many plant leaves, the droplets initially spread out into a pancake-like disk, then rebounded back into a ball and bounced away. But when the researchers coated the surface of the droplets with a tiny amount of oil — making up less than 1 percent of the droplet's liquid — the droplets spread out and then stayed put. The treatment improved the droplets' “stickiness” by as much as a hundredfold.

“When these droplets are hitting the surface and as they expand, they form this oil ring that essentially pins the droplet to the surface,” Rufer says. The researchers tried a wide variety of conditions, he says, explaining that they conducted hundreds of experiments, “with different impact velocities, different droplet sizes, different angles of inclination, all the things that fully characterize this phenomenon.” Though different oils varied in their effectiveness, all of them were effective. “Regardless of the impact velocity and the oils, we saw that the rebound height was significantly lower,” he says.

The effect works with remarkably small amounts of oil. In their initial tests they used 1 percent oil compared to the water, then they tried a 0.1 percent, and even .01. The improvement in droplets sticking to the surface continued at a 0.1 percent, but began to break down beyond that. “Basically, this oil film acts as a way to trap that droplet on the surface, because oil is very attracted to the surface and sort of holds the water in place,” Rufer says.

In the researchers' initial tests they used soybean oil for the coating, figuring this would be a familiar material for the farmers they were working with, many of whom were growing soybeans. But it turned out that though they were producing the beans, the oil was not part of their usual supply chain for use on the farm. In further tests, the researchers found that several chemicals that farmers were already routinely using in their spraying, called surfactants and adjuvants, could be used instead, and that some of these provided the same benefits in keeping the droplets stuck on the leaves.

“That way,” Varanasi says, “we're not introducing a new chemical or changed chemistries into their field, but they're using things they've known for a long time.”

Varanasi and Jayaprakash formed a company called AgZen to commercialize the system. In order to prove how much their coating system improves the amount of spray that stays on the plant, they first had to develop a system to monitor spraying in real time. That system, which they call RealCoverage, has been deployed on farms ranging in size from a few dozen acres to hundreds of thousands of acres, and many different crop types, and has saved farmers 30 to 50 percent on their pesticide expenditures, just by improving the controls on the existing sprays. That system is being deployed to 920,000 acres of crops in 2025, the company says, including some in California, Texas, the Midwest, France and Italy. Adding the cloaking system using new nozzles, the researchers say, should yield at least another doubling of efficiency.

“You could give back a billion dollars to U.S. growers if you just saved 6 percent of their pesticide budget,” says Jayaprakash, lead author of the research paper and CEO of AgZen. “In the lab we got 300 percent of extra product on the plant. So that means we could get orders of magnitude reductions in the amount of pesticides that farmers are spraying.”

Farmers had already been using these surfactant and adjuvant chemicals as a way to enhance spraying effectiveness, but they were mixing it with a water solution. For it to have any effect, they had to use much more of these materials, risking causing burns to the plants. The new coating system reduces the amount of these materials needed, while improving their effectiveness.

In field tests conducted by AgZen, “we doubled the amount of product on kale and soybeans just by changing where the adjuvant was,” from mixed in to being a coating, Jayaprakash says. It's convenient for farmers because “all they're doing is changing their nozzle. They're getting all their existing chemicals to work better, and they're getting more product on the plant.”

And it's not just for pesticides. “The really cool thing is this is useful for every chemistry that's going on the leaf, be it an insecticide, a herbicide, a fungicide, or foliar nutrition,” Varanasi says. This year, they plan to introduce the new spray system on about 30,000 acres of cropland.

Varanasi says that with projected world population growth, “the amount of food production has got to double, and we are limited in so many resources, for example we cannot double the arable land. … This means that every acre we currently farm must become more efficient and able to do more with less.” These improved spraying technologies, for both monitoring the spraying and coating the droplets, Varanasi says, “I think is fundamentally changing agriculture.”

AgZen has recently raised $10 million in venture financing to support rapid commercial deployment of these technologies that can improve the control of chemical inputs into agriculture. “The knowledge we are gathering from every leaf, combined with our expertise in interfacial science and fluid mechanics, is giving us unparalleled insights into how chemicals are used and developed — and it's clear that we can deliver value across the entire agrochemical supply chain,” Varanasi says  “Our mission is to use these technologies to deliver improved outcomes and reduced costs for the ag industry.”

A low-profile yet fast-growing technology solution provider based in Cary, North Carolina is making waves in the hotel industry. Inn-Flow, a company providing integrated back-office management software for the hotel industry, has secured a $45 million growth capital investment from Mainsail Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm specializing in vertical SaaS. The funding marks the company's first institutional investment and sets the stage for major expansion across product, people, and market reach.

Founded in 2009 by John Erhart, a hospitality industry veteran with deep roots in hotel ownership through his family's company, CMC Hotels, Inn-Flow began as a solution to streamline operations within the family business. The platform officially launched to the broader industry in 2014, quickly gaining traction among hotel owners and operators seeking better tools to manage increasingly complex operations.

Fast forward to today, and Inn-Flow has evolved into a comprehensive, cloud-based platform designed specifically for hotel management companies. The software offers a suite of integrated modules covering accounting and bookkeeping, payroll, labor management, procurement, sales tracking, bank reconciliation, and business intelligence. These tools empower hotel operators to automate routine tasks, improve decision-making, control labor costs, and scale more efficiently.

In 2024 alone, Inn-Flow reportedly processed over 920,000 invoices, managed $2.7 billion in payables, and reconciled nearly 5,000 bank accounts across its customer base. It also supported over 100,000 labor-management users, tracking nearly 15 million labor hours and overseeing payroll volume in excess of $200 million. These metrics underscore the platform's growing impact on operational performance and financial visibility within the hospitality sector.

“This investment is a major milestone for our team and our customers,” said John Erhart, Founder and CEO of Inn-Flow in a statement. “We are committed to providing a robust, user-friendly platform that enables hotel owners and management companies to simplify their operations and grow their businesses profitably. Mainsail's experience in scaling vertical SaaS companies will help us take Inn-Flow to the next level.”

The investment will reportedly be used to accelerate product innovation, enhance customer experience, and expand the company's team, including the planned hiring of at least 20 new employees in the Cary area over the next 18 months. Mainsail's strategic support will also help Inn-Flow expand its presence in new market segments and further differentiate its platform in an increasingly competitive space.

As part of its expansion strategy, Inn-Flow will reportedly roll out new product offerings in the coming months, including solutions for facilities management, mobile access, and advanced business intelligence. These new capabilities aim to help hoteliers operate more efficiently, stay ahead of the technology curve, and ultimately drive higher profitability.

The hotel industry's push toward digital transformation—fueled by rising labor costs, leaner teams, and increased demand for automation—has created fertile ground for platforms like Inn-Flow. With a strong foundation, loyal customer base, and now, significant financial backing, the company is well-positioned to become a dominant force in hotel back-office technology.

From a family-owned hotel solution to a national leader in hospitality SaaS, Inn-Flow's journey is a compelling case study in how industry insiders can drive innovation by solving problems from the inside out.

Wall Street rallied on Monday, buoyed by the hopes that Trump might soften his tariff stance. The S&P 500 snapped out of a four-week losing streak, rising 1.8%, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index outperformed with a 2.3% rise, led by technology stocks.

Shares of Tesla TSLA, which have fallen for nine straight weeks, gained nearly 12% on Monday. Meta Platforms META and NVIDIA NVDA each climbed more than 3%. ETFs in the tech space saw smooth trading yesterday. Some of the leading ETFs are Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF ELON, YieldMax MARA Option Income Strategy ETF MARO, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Global X Blockchain ETF BKCH, and VanEck Vectors Digital Transformation ETF DAPP.

According to Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal during the weekend, Donald Trump's administration could hold back from implementing some of his wide-ranging tariff plans and exclude a set of sector-specific tariffs that are on track to be imposed in April. This has eased some concerns over a potential rise in inflation and recession fears. 

On Monday afternoon, President Trump said he may give ""a lot of countries breaks"" when it comes to reciprocal tariffs, which are expected on April 2.

Promising Tech Growth Outlook

The Fed rate cut has resurfaced. In the latest meeting, the central bank kept its interest rates steady and signaled two rate cuts for this year. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for further initiatives when interest rates are low.

The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence (AI) technology will continue to drive tech stocks. The expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector (read: Tech Sector ETFs Set to Rule Under Trump's Second Term?).

The sector outlook remains solid. The global digital shift has accelerated e-commerce for everything, ranging from remote working to entertainment and shopping, thereby bolstering strength in the sector. The rapid adoption of cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, machine learning, digital communication, blockchain and 5G technology will continue to fuel a rally.

If these were not enough, the technology sector has a solid Zacks Sector Rank, being in the top 32%, which suggests continued outperformance in the coming months.

Let us dig into the details of the above-mentioned ETFs.

Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ELON) – Up 22.4%

Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF seeks long-term capital appreciation. It offers unique investment opportunities and is the first of its kind.

Many businesses struggle to stand out in crowded markets and achieve significant growth due to ineffective brand differentiation and inefficient marketing strategies. This results in wasted resources and missed opportunities for expansion. Rival solves this problem by providing challenger marketing strategies that help businesses build strong, differentiated brands and implement effective go-to-market plans, enabling them to break through in competitive markets and drive sustainable growth.

Rival, a startup that develops technology to enable millions of users to create and share 3D content, has emerged from stealth today and announced it has raised $4.2 million in the pre-seed round, led by Speedinvest and with participation from New Renaissance Ventures and high-profile angels. The valuation was not disclosed to TFN. 

Operating in stealth mode allowed Rival to develop its groundbreaking technology away from competitors' scrutiny while refining its approach. This strategy enabled the company to perfect its 2D-to-3D conversion technology before revealing it to the market, giving it a significant competitive edge in the rapidly evolving spatial computing landscape.

With the new funding, the company plans to grow its team with more ML/AI engineers and expand its presence in the U.S. market.

Rival Technologies was founded in 2023 by Alexander Oppermann and Konrad Melzer (who previously developed security software for the German FBI) alongside a team of former Google, Meta, and Amazon engineers. Based in London, the startup aims to grow the spatial computing market by addressing the shortage of content for the expanding range of headsets.

Alexander Oppermann, CEO of Rival, told TFN: “Rival started as a small side project where we tried to produce 3D content for ourselves and our friends playing Population:One. After seeing how difficult it was to produce and distribute user-generated VR content, we developed the idea to build tools and a platform to help the creator economy transition to VR.”

The spatial computing market faces a paradox: while hardware capabilities advance rapidly with devices like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, adoption lags due to insufficient compelling content. This content gap presents both a challenge and a massive market opportunity, with spatial computing expected to grow from approximately $110 billion in 2023 to $1.7 trillion by 2033. Rival's approach tackles this bottleneck by democratising 3D content creation.

Rival has created a platform that lets users browse immersive 3D short-form content in their spatial computing headset, similar to TikTok or Instagram Reels. Beyond uploading conventional 3D content, users can transform any 2D video into an immersive 3D experience using the startup's first-of-its-kind 2D-to-3D foundational AI model. This technology leverages recent breakthroughs in AI-driven image processing, using sophisticated depth estimation algorithms and neural rendering techniques to create realistic 3D representations with appropriate textures and lighting.

Oppermann told TFN: “Our product is built from the ground up around AI. To enable user-generated content, you must solve both production and distribution — it's difficult, and no one else is doing that. Content production and editing are especially challenging compared to 2D. AI will drastically change the trajectory of spatial computing—we're one of the first to build it for this space.”

While spatial computing hardware advances rapidly, limited content availability slows mass adoption. Rival's 3D AI technology catalyses the unlock of spatial computing's potential, enabling users to create, share, and explore immersive content.

Their comprehensive platform approach sets Rival apart in the 2D-to-3D conversion space. Rather than just providing conversion tools, Rival is building an entire ecosystem for creating, sharing, and experiencing 3D content. “There are several players, including YoutubeVR, whose products overlap with parts of what we do, but no one is building the entire value chain from tools to distribution to enable user-generated content in VR,” noted Oppermann.

“Rival will become the essential infrastructure for the spatial computing era, making 3D creation accessible to millions of everyday users. We're building a platform that removes technical barriers, enabling a new generation of creators to shape immersive digital experiences. Our technology solves the critical content gap currently limiting spatial computing's potential,” added Oppermann.

As spatial computing evolves, Rival's technology could enable applications ranging from immersive educational experiences to virtual shopping environments where products can be viewed in 3D. The technology could also support professional visualisation in architecture, medicine, and industrial design.

Oppermann concluded, “We will relentlessly release tech to truly enable users to produce AR/VR content, and bring millions of VR users currently scattered across the many games and hardware platforms together”

Victor Huerbe, Principal with Speedinvest's Marketplaces & Consumer investment team, says: “Spatial computing is at an inflection point, but the biggest gap is content. Rival is solving this with AI that makes 3D creation effortless, unlocking a whole new wave of immersive experiences.

“Alex, Konrad, and the team move fast, and they've quietly built something game-changing. We backed them because they're not just iterating on existing tools, they're building the foundation for how we'll create and consume 3D content in the future.”

March 24, 2025



Source: HII

HII, America's largest shipbuilder and all-domain technologies and solutions provider, has sold more than 700 REMUS uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs) to customers globally.

The REMUS UUV family delivers critical advantages across modern naval operations, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, and electronic warfare. These autonomous systems can operate independently or be teamed with crewed platforms — such as Virginia-class nuclear submarines — expanding operational reach while reducing detection risk and personnel exposure.

More than 700 REMUS UUVs have been sold in over 30 countries, including 14 NATO members.

Over 90% of the vehicles delivered in the past 23 years remain operational, demonstrating the platform's durability and adaptability to evolving technologies.

HII is currently manufacturing small uncrewed undersea vehicles (SUUVs) for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish System program. The contract, potentially growing to 200 vehicles over five years, is valued at more than $347 million. Based on the REMUS 300, the Lionfish System is a highly portable SUUV with open architecture, and modular payload options. In early 2022, REMUS 300 was the first Defense Innovation Unit competitive selection to transition to a program of record, selected as the U.S. Navy's Lionfish next-generation SUUV.

REMUS UUVs have been deployed in diverse operational environments, including mine clearance in the Persian Gulf, NATO exercises in the North Sea, and undersea surveillance in the Indo-Pacific. With advanced sonar and sensor technologies, these systems enhance situational awareness and provide naval forces with a tactical edge in contested environments.

In mine countermeasures missions, REMUS is instrumental in ensuring safe passage for naval and commercial vessels. The U.S. Navy has deployed REMUS in strategic waterways, including the Persian Gulf, the Baltic and Black Seas, while NATO allies have used the platform in joint exercises across the Mediterranean, the North Sea, and above the Arctic Circle.

“HII's investment in advanced undersea autonomy is yielding promising returns, most notably in demonstrating to our customers how this technology can be integrated to support their evolving and critical mission needs,” HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said. “From mine countermeasures to anti-submarine warfare, REMUS continues to safeguard strategic waterways and enhance maritime security for the U.S. and its allies. The platform's longevity and adaptability reflect HII's dedication to providing reliable, cutting-edge solutions for global partners.”

Tempe, Arizona-based Align Technology, Inc. ALGN is a leader in medical devices, renowned for its Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners. With a market cap of $12.4 billion, Align has revolutionized orthodontics and digital dentistry with its innovative solutions.

Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally categorized as ""large-cap stocks,"" and Align fits this description perfectly. Its valuation highlights its strong presence in the healthcare sector, driven by cutting-edge products and advancements in dental technology.

Despite its notable strengths, ALGN stock has tanked 48.6% from its 52-week high of $331.64 touched on Apr. 11, 2024. Meanwhile, ALGN has plunged 20.2% over the past three months, significantly underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's ($DOWI) 1.7% dip during the same time frame. 

Align's performance looks even grimmer over the longer term. ALGN stock has plummeted 31.6% over the past six months and 46.7% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming Dow's marginal 89 bps uptick over the past six months and 7.9% gains over the past year.

To confirm the bearish trend, ALGN has remained consistently below its 200-day moving average since late April 2024 and 50-day moving average since early February 2025. 

Align Technology's stock prices observed a marginal uptick in the trading session after the release of its mixed Q4 results on Feb. 5. Driven by slight improvement of its Clear Aligners' sales and a solid 14.9% year-over-year growth in Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services' revenues to $200.9 million, the company's overall topline increased 4% year-over-year to $995.2 million. However, this figure fell short of the Street's expectations by a small margin.

Meanwhile, the company observed a notable surge in SG&A expenses and incurred $33.2 million in restructuring and other charges which led to a 16% year-over-year decline in income from operations to $144.2 million. However, after adjusting for non-recurring items and accounting for the impact of share repurchases, Align's non-GAAP EPS inched up 83 bps year-over-year to $2.44 which surpassed the consensus estimates by a thin margin.

Meanwhile, Align has notably underperformed its peer Hologic, Inc.'s HOLX 23.8% decline over the past six months and a 17.8% drop over the past year.

Despite its lackluster performance, analysts remain optimistic about Align's prospects. Among the 13 analysts covering the ALGN stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” Its mean price target of $258.25 suggests a 51.6% upside potential from current price levels.

Online fraud costs businesses $40 billion annually, while false declines result in $443 billion in lost sales yearly. With Burbank technology (CPoI), a merchant-friendly solution, these financial losses can be significantly reduced, offering a promising return on investment.

Justin Pike, founder of Burbank, noted: “Burbank's Card-Present over Internet (CPoI) is the world's first PCI-certified technology enabling card-present transactions online. Unlike solutions using stored credentials or wallets, CPoI lets consumers simply tap their card to their mobile device and enter their PIN — just like in stores. This enables a full liability shift, drastically reduces fraud, and eliminates false declines, costing merchants over $443 billion yearly. The SDK integrates directly into apps or via QR codes, enabling seamless deployment for app- and web-based retailers.”

To launch this groundbreaking online payment technology, Burbank secured £5M in seed funding, led by Mouro Capital, with participation from Anthemis (supported by Foxe Capital), Portfolio Ventures, and others. This funding will be primarily used to expand our team, enhance our technology, and accelerate the global rollout of Burbank's platform. This innovation enables tap-and-PIN payments in online transactions, bringing the same security and trust as in-store payments to e-commerce. The company's valuation was not disclosed to TFN.

With backing from major industry players, Burbank is positioned for rapid scaling. The funding will accelerate global partnerships with acquirers and payment providers eager to integrate the technology. At a recent live demonstration before payment executives and industry leaders, Burbank completed the world's first online card-present transaction, a significant milestone in digital payments.

Burbank, a Welsh fintech company founded in 2021 by Justin Pike, operates from its headquarters in Cardiff, Wales. Pike, who serves as CEO, previously founded MyPinPad, developing the original technology behind PCI standards SPoC and MPoC. He also pioneered cloud-based HSM deployment and has over a decade of experience in payment innovation.

Talking with TFN, Justin Pike explained: “Burbank emerged from market necessity and personal insight. During COVID, my mother-in-law, uncomfortable with online shopping, asked why she couldn't simply ‘tap her card on her phone' like in stores. This question, combined with rising online fraud and inadequate authentication systems, inspired me to develop CPoI. This online tap-and-PIN payment method brings card-present security to digital transactions.”

Burbank aims to transform e-commerce by reducing fraud and eliminating false positives in online transactions. Their innovative Card-Present over Internet (CPoI) technology aligns in-store and digital payments, allowing consumers to tap their payment card against their mobile device and enter their PIN, enhancing security and reducing fraud risks.

Pike said, “We're thrilled to bring this payment evolution to the world. Payment experiences should be consistent across all channels. In-store tap-and-PIN is globally trusted and familiar, and now we're bringing that same process online. It's simple, secure, and scalable—exactly as it should be.”

Through this technology, Burbank aims to revolutionise online commerce by mitigating fraud and establishing new standards for secure transactions. The company prioritises delivering a frictionless customer experience while maintaining the highest level of online shopping protection.

While many companies strive to improve online payment security, Burbank is the first to deliver a PCI-certified, fully card-present online experience, making it category-defining. Traditional fraud prevention tools and authentication technologies often function as add-ons to a flawed system. CPoI replaces that system entirely.

Burbank's advanced platform combines unparalleled convenience with robust security, empowering businesses to innovate in customer experience and unlock new revenue opportunities. By merging ease of use with cutting-edge security, Burbank's technology helps companies deliver exceptional customer interactions that drive growth and set new market standards.

The company's flagship solution, Card-Present over Internet (CPoI), enables Card-Present payments in online channels for the first time. This reduces fraud, processing fees, and chargebacks while eliminating false positives, offering a compelling value proposition. The groundbreaking technology integrates directly into mobile applications, delivering a simple yet robust payment experience with bank-grade security and exceptional scalability.

Pike concluded: “Burbank plans to scale globally through white-labelled partnerships with acquirers, PSPs, and payment gateways. Our go-to-market model focuses on enterprise adoption.” 

Manuel Silva Martinez, General Partner at Mouro Capital, explained the investment: “I'm thrilled to support Justin and his team of payments experts. Burbank offers a simple, seamless integration through a single while-label SDK, which securely integrates into existing technology stacks and supports multiple schemes on iOS and Android. It's what the market needs.”

Ruth Foxe Blader, General Partner at Foxe Capital, added, “CPoI is the first protocol that legally shifts liability away from the merchant. It's a massively scalable approach, with global demand.”

The Financial Express



By Ashok Pandey

On February 28, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani of the Delhi High Court delivered a crucial judgment concerning the use of smartphones in schools. While some have interpreted it as complete relaxation of existing restrictions, a closer analysis reveals that the ruling reinforces structured policies that some schools already practice. Equally, the judgment nudges schools to devise a comprehensive policy that is transparent and fair. Let's analyse what this judgment means for educators, students, and parents.

Most schools prohibit the open use of smartphones within their premises. Schools have arrangements for safe deposit of smartphones, particularly for students who need them for safety reasons. But managing this process efficiently adds an administrative burden, requiring a careful balance between student safety and operational feasibility.

The ruling also prohibits smartphone use in classrooms, common areas, or school vehicles, and certainly not that's detrimental to studies. Schools have always feared misuse and asked what is the necessity of bringing smartphones to schools at all? While the judgment does not support a complete ban, it emphasises structured regulation, leaving it to schools to frame policies that align with their educational priorities.

Another aspect that requires clarity is whether these guidelines apply equally to all students, from a four-year-old to a 17-year-old? Should primary schoolchildren be allowed to bring smartphones under the same conditions as senior students?

The judgment is best understood as a framework rather than a green light for unrestricted use. Schools should treat it as an opportunity to reaffirm and refine their existing policies, ensuring clarity in communication with students, teachers, and parents. While the ruling does not explicitly prohibit smartphones, it does not endorse unrestricted access either.

Globally, education systems have been grappling with similar concerns regarding smartphone use in schools. According to the UNESCO's Global Education Monitoring Report (2023), technology, including smartphones, should only be used in classrooms when it demonstrably enhances learning outcomes. The report also highlights concerns that excessive smartphone use can distract students and negatively impact academic performance.

By the end of 2023, approximately 30% of education systems worldwide had implemented bans on smartphone use in schools, and the number rose to 40% by 2024. Countries like France and the Netherlands have enforced strict policies regulating smartphone usage, ensuring that technology remains a tool for learning rather than a distraction. Sweden, on the other hand, decided recently to reintroduce physical textbooks after experiencing unintended consequences of a digital-only approach introduced since 2009.

These international trends suggest that the Delhi High Court's ruling is not an isolated development but rather part of a global movement towards structured and regulated smartphone use in schools. Given the considerations in the judgment, schools should take steps to clarify existing policies, frame age-appropriate policies, engage with parents, and explore alternative communication methods.

The Delhi High Court ruling is not a seismic shift but a structured reinforcement of practices already in place.

Han Jong-hee, co-CEO of the South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 63 from a heart attack. This sad news was confirmed by the company, which noted that Han died while receiving treatment for cardiac arrest at the hospital. As of now, Samsung has not revealed who will succeed him.


Han Jong-hee was a seasoned veteran with over thirty years of experience at Samsung, beginning his career in the display division. Just three years ago, he was appointed co-CEO of the company, where he played a pivotal role in transforming Samsung Electronics into a leading player in the TV market, surpassing competitors like Sony Group Corp.

In addition to his success in the television sector, Han headed Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile device divisions, which stand in competition with Apple's smartphone offerings. Recently, he took significant strides to incorporate AI technology into Samsung's Galaxy devices. Under his guidance, the company began integrating AI chips into various home appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners.

Han's untimely passing comes at a crucial moment for Samsung, as the company faces heightened competition from SK Hynix Inc. in the AI memory sector and navigates sluggish demand in consumer electronics. Last week, during Samsung's annual shareholder meeting, Han expressed that 2025 could pose challenges for the company, but hinted at plans for mergers and acquisitions to spur growth.

Han Jong-hee shared the leadership of Samsung with co-CEO Jun Young-hyun, who oversees Samsung's semiconductor business, while Han managed all other areas of the company.

The V3 is an older DeepSeek platform

DeepSeek released updates to its V3 model that promise to deliver better programming capabilities, underscoring the Chinese AI startup's intent to remain a step ahead of competitors.

The V3-0324 update — posted on Hugging Face this week without a formal announcement — claims to address real-world challenges while setting benchmarks for accuracy and efficiency.

In January, DeepSeek surged past ChatGPT to become the most popular free app on Apple's US app store. Its achievements, including an R1 model that seemingly performed as well as OpenAI's best, stunned the industry and sparked a selloff in US markets. 

The V3 is an older DeepSeek platform. The startup's AI services have ignited a debate about whether cutting-edge platforms can be built for far less than the billions that US firms are pouring into datacenter construction.

Australian cell therapy company Chimeric Therapeutics (ASX:CHM) has announced that the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has allowed the issuance of a patent application covering the company's CHM CDH17 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology.

The allowed patent application 17/050,299, entitled 'Compositions and Methods for Retrieving Tumour-related Antibodies and Antigens', provides intellectual property protection for Chimeric's CHM CDH17 CAR-T therapy, which targets CDH17, a protein highly expressed on gastrointestinal cancer cells associated with poor prognosis and metastasis.

The company said the allowed patent is expected to provide protection until at least 2039.

The technology is currently in a first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical trial at leading US cancer centres, including the Sarah Cannon Research Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and UChicago Medicine.

Preclinical studies published in Nature Cancer have shown CHM CDH17 CAR-T's capability to eradicate tumours across multiple cancer models while sparing healthy tissue.

Chimeric CEO Dr Rebecca McQualter said, ""The allowance of this US patent significantly strengthens our intellectual property portfolio and provides critical commercial protection in the world's largest healthcare market. It highlights our commitment to developing pioneering CAR-T therapies and is a pivotal milestone in advancing CHM CDH17 CAR-T therapy toward commercialisation for gastrointestinal cancer patients.""

The Trump Administration on Monday named a new nominee to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, following the withdrawal of its previous candidate, Dr. David Weldon.

Susan Coller Monarez currently serves as acting director at the CDC, and could be elevated to lead the agency if confirmed by the Senate.

WHY IT MATTERS
Monarez has spent nearly two decades in various roles across the government, in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security and in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

Among her HHS roles, Monarez served at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Health Resources and Services Administration – where she was founder of the HRSA Center of Innovation – and most recently as deputy director at Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.

At ARPA-H, Monarez developed and launched more than $2 billion in programs and projects targeting public health and care delivery challenges, and led ""agency data innovation strategy and data systems architecture design, including pioneering generative AI end-to-end enabled capabilities,"" according to her LinkedIn.

She has led the development of AI and machine learning projects focused on several key challenges for public and population health, according to her CDC bio: affordability and accessibility, expanding access to behavioral and mental health interventions, tackling the opioid epidemic, addressing health disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality and improving the country's organ donation and transplantation programs.

THE LARGER TREND
Earlier this month, the White House withdrew the nomination of its initial pick to lead the CDC, former Florida congressman Dr. David Weldon, when it became apparent that he could not garner enough support from fellow Republicans to be confirmed in the Senate.

The GOP-controlled Senate health committee said on March 13, just minutes before it had been scheduled to start, that it would cancel a planned hearing on Weldon's nomination after several Republicans aired concerns about his vaccine-skeptical views.

ON THE RECORD
""Americans have lost confidence in the C.D.C. due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement,"" President Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, in announcing the new nomination. ""As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future.""

Monarez holds a PhD, but would be the ""first nonphysician to lead the agency in more than 50 years,"" according to the New York Times.

Other population and public health leaders have applauded the nomination.

""She has a strong reputation as a solid researcher and expert in infectious diseases,"" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told the Times. “She clearly understands public health and the role governmental public health plays. I believe the public health community can work with her in a positive manner.”

""Susan has a long, distinguished history as a data-driven, effective civil servant,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health told CNN. “I am thrilled to hear she'll be leading CDC.""

""Dr. Monarez understands the critical roles of technology and data in the needed transformation of public health in the US,"" said Lisa Bari, CEO of Civitas Networks for Health, in a LinkedIn post. ""Changes are clearly planned for the future of the CDC, HHS in general, and other HHS agencies. Dr. Monarez and the other agency heads who have been nominated, I'm hopeful that they will work together to create a stronger and more efficient HHS, resulting in better health and outcomes for all Americans.""

In Carson City, Nev., home health care workers will be at the statehouse on Tuesday asking lawmakers for a big raise, citing growing demand as the state's population rapidly ages.

It's the second such request in two years. A campaign in 2023 delivered a $16 minimum wage for home caregivers, who are employed by private agencies that are funded through Medicaid. Prior to that, their wages had been stuck between $10 and $12 an hour for more than a decade.

""It was just ridiculous,"" says Regina Brown-Ross, a home care worker and union organizer with SEIU Local 1107. ""People can't function on $12 an hour.""

In 2025, getting by remains a struggle for many caregivers, even on $16 an hour. Home care workers, who are mostly women and people of color, often lack health insurance. Like other low wage workers, they must contend with rising food and housing costs.

So now they're asking for $20 an hour, hoping that lawmakers will approve the request as part of the state's next budget bill.

Two years ago, the $16 minimum wage for caregivers was championed by Democrats, who still control both chambers of the Nevada legislature, but was eventually signed into law by Republican Governor Joe Lombardo.

Today, the workers also want the state to approve more hours of coverage for their clients, many of whom only qualify for part-time care.

""A lot of the clients — they don't have enough hours and they need more help,"" says Brown-Ross.

This would also be a benefit to the caregivers: If they could be paid for more hours with each client, they wouldn't need to take on so many, relieving them of long drives between clients.

Their push for higher wages is shining a spotlight on a struggle that caregivers across the country face as demand for their services soars.

Already, there's evidence that the previous wage bump in Nevada, which took effect in January 2024, has reduced turnover. Before their wages rose to $16, half of home care workers in the state didn't last a year in their roles. In the four months after the new minimum took effect, turnover fell to almost nothing, according to Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services.

Since then, the ranks of home health agencies and SEIU Local 1107 have grown. Since 2023, more than 1,300 home care workers have voted to unionize in 12 consecutive elections, adding muscle to their latest fight.

Irma Nunez, a longtime caregiver who took part in the lobbying effort in 2023, says that at the time, they had a receptive audience among state lawmakers when they shared stories of bathing and feeding patients and helping them go to the bathroom. The need for in-home help struck a chord.

""People told us personal stories about their dads, moms, grandparents, family members,"" she says. ""They knew what we were talking about.""

To make ends meet, Nunez used to pick up as much work as she could, taking on multiple clients, driving from house to house, working a couple hours here, a couple hours there, seven days a week.

The bump she received in January 2024, from $11 to $16 an hour, allowed her to reduce her workload slightly and take better care of her own health. But $20 an hour would provide her a better safety net, she says, and allow her to start saving a bit for her own retirement.

The push for higher caregiver wages has been cheered on by some of the seniors and people with disabilities who rely on the care, like Nunez's longtime client Thomas Draa.

A high school science teacher, Draa was in a car crash 20 years ago that left him unable to use his legs. Since then, he's needed help getting out of bed, washing, dressing, and getting in his van to go to school.

That help hasn't always been reliable. ""We had people coming and going, or not showing up to get me up, and I wouldn't go to school that day,"" he says.

Then came Nunez. For the past 12 years, she's been at his house every day, arriving at 4:30 a.m. so Draa can make it to school by 6 a.m., an hour before the students arrive.

She returns in the afternoon to get him back into his house and back into bed. ""I wouldn't be able to go to school or work if it wasn't for Irma,"" Draa says.

""I always thought it was just crazy,"" he says of caregivers' wages. ""They make such a little amount of money, for what an important job it is.""

Brown-Ross started working as a caregiver after a decades-long career as a singer, performing around the world in solo shows and as a backup singer to the likes of Gladys Knight, Ray Charles and Smokey Robinson.

But while touring in China in the early 2010s, she suffered damage to her voice.

""I couldn't sing my phrases. I couldn't hold a note. It was the most devastating time for me,"" she recalls.

She needed to find a job, and soon one came calling: Her mother-in-law had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Determined to keep her at home, Brown-Ross began taking care of her, eventually getting certified as a caregiver and formalizing the arrangement through a state program that allows family members to be paid for their work. She was hired by an agency and paid the going rate, then $12 an hour.

""To go from working with Ray Charles and Gladys Knight, making money, to being a home care worker … was difficult for me,"" says Brown-Ross.

It wasn't just the meager wages. It was the lack of respect for caregivers and recognition of their work.

""They deserve to have dignity in their own profession,"" she says.

Brown-Ross's mother-in-law died in 2018. Since then, she's taken on other clients, including an elderly cousin who fought in World War II, a teenager with autism, and a woman with disabilities.


                Regina Brown-Ross sings inside her home on January 24th, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. As a caregiver, her focus is on helping her clients maintain dignity, independence, and quality of life, often incorporating music therapy.

Recently, she's started to rehabilitate her own voice, and is getting back into singing — finding parallels between her two careers.

""I loved bringing joy to my audiences and taking them on a journey, helping them to feel better,"" she says. ""I bring that same premise to my home caregiving. I help them to do the things that they're no longer able to do for themselves.""

Sacramento County's Department of Health Services seeks to gain more grant funding to provide health care for homeless people. Staff will present at the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday about their mobile and street medical service called Wellness Without Walls.

These mobile clinics have a variety of healthcare services, including HIV treatment, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and substance counseling, according to Sacramento County Department of Health Services' website. 

In partnership with the department's primary health services and sexual health promotion unit, the program was created to eliminate barriers to accessing health care. Homeless residents don't always have transportation needed for a doctor's visit, or they fear losing their belongings while away at a clinic. These mobile clinics attempt to bridge the gap of accessing health care, the resolution states.

“These programs not only address immediate health concerns but also build trust within the unhoused community, encouraging individuals to seek ongoing care,” the resolution states.

Originally established in 2014, there are currently three mobile clinics and one dental clinic, the department stated. These mobile clinics have primary care services for clients as young as 4 years old. They also have wound care equipment and labs and medical referrals. The Department of Health Services stated that this program has served more than 2,000 patients since its launch.

The Department of Health Services wants to expand services through providing additional locations in Sacramento County, according to the presentation prepared for the Board of Supervisors. Many of the mobile clinics work in silos and Medi-Cal resources can be restrictive, with clients facing difficulties meeting criteria. The agency added the program has faced obstacles with getting care for uninsured clients. Consistency with client follow-up has also been met with difficulty.

Wellness Without Walls holds pop-up medical clinics throughout the county. Tuesday, the day of the presentation to the Board of Supervisors, the a clinic will be 9 a.m. - noon at 1492 Northgate Blvd. Upcoming locations can be found at https://bit.ly/4jivLR9

For all the talk about this problem, the industry has struggled to make big headway. But there are solutions — here are a few steps that make a substantial difference.

Rampant burnout across the healthcare industry is at crisis levels, and shows no sign of improving dramatically anytime soon. While the number of physicians reporting at least one symptom of burnout has dropped slightly from its highs during the pandemic, it remains at nearly 50%. 

For all the talk about this problem, the industry has struggled to make big headway. But there are solutions. Working with large companies in this space, as well as smaller practices, I've come to see steps that make a substantial difference.

The key is to embrace fundamentals of a wellness culture in ways that work for the unique challenges and needs of healthcare workers.


					Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.				

Holistic wellness

One key is to set aside the idea that wellbeing is only about exercise, mental health therapy, and stress relief activities like meditation. 

To be clear, all those are important. Recent lists of the most stressful jobs have included surgeons, anesthesiologists, and physicians, along with medical assistants, sonographers, and nurses.

But wellbeing is more holistic. Researchers have concluded that there are eight different dimensions: occupational, physical, emotional, social, financial, intellectual, spiritual, and environmental. To help boost wellness across any workforce, employers should offer resources to help people improve in all these ways.


					Choosing the right software translates directly into better client management, operational efficiency and growth for your spa franchise. Discover which tool is best for your business.				

This can be very impactful. For example, a study published recently in the American Journal of Health Promotion found that “relationships and social connections” are one of the most valued forms of wellness that healthcare providers and students value highly. Providers placed it third after physical and emotional health; students placed it second after emotional health, and above physical health.

Fostering an environment in which people are able to develop meaningful connections goes a long way toward improving social wellbeing. And sometimes, people choose to engage in physical activities together, covering multiple dimensions at once.

Flexibility where possible

Another important step is to embrace the new era of workplace flexibility. This can be done without sacrificing patient care. For example, many administrative tasks can be done at off hours and remotely without sacrificing HIPAA compliance.

When people have flexibility to choose when and where they get some of their work done, they feel much better about their jobs. The vast majority of people say flexibility also improves their mental health and reduces stress. 

This benefit also allows them to include wellness activities at the times that work best for them. When people are able to choose the time of day and type of activities they engage in, they can see better results, and are more likely to stay consistent.

A trust-based culture

Flexibility and a wide array of resources to improve wellbeing are only useful if employees feel they can put these opportunities to use. When they worry that their workplaces may look down on them for working out or meeting with a financial adviser during typical work hours, they're less likely to do so. 

The same goes with getting their administrative work done. If a healthcare professional feels that this work only “counts” if others see them do it, they're less likely to take care of it at a more convenient time.

This is why turning all of this potential into real change requires a trust-based culture. Research already shows that trust is crucial for improving healthcare delivery. A study published in November in the journal Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine found that, “A doctor who is a good team leader fosters a workplace culture of trust, collaboration, and transparency, whilst holding everyone accountable for their actions.”

This culture should extend to all aspects of work — and to all personnel. A recent study looked at non-patient-facing employees in a health system. It found that during the Covid pandemic, when they were trusted to work from home, some found their work much more healthy and less stressful. “A non-patient-facing assistant stated that, when employees began to work remotely, the environment lost its ‘anxiety-building, oppressive, rigorous' energy,” the study found.

These steps can prove transformative. When organizations in the sector enact these changes, they see concrete results — and build the kinds of environments in which top healthcare professionals want to work.

Evinova, a clinical trial technology company, is partnering with Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative (QLHC) to integrate Evinova's remote patient monitoring (RPM) offering into I-SPY 2.2, a platform trial that provides a framework to study multiple novel therapeutic treatment arms for women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. 

A platform trial is a clinical trial design that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple interventions or treatments against a common control group within a single, ongoing protocol that could lead to efficient and adaptable research. 

Evinova's RPM module will be used to warn healthcare professionals of early symptoms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), a possible adverse event for one treatment arm in the study.

Evinova's RPM allows for real-time monitoring of patients' health status and treatment intake between clinical visits and notifies healthcare providers of the potential onset or worsening of symptoms related to a potential toxicity, specifically ILD. 

With this data, healthcare providers can triage patients requiring further clinical evaluation and intervene quickly based on guidelines.

According to Evinova, this could potentially reduce the likelihood of progression to high-grade ILD and dose reduction, hold or interruption of treatment.

""One of the primary goals of I-SPY 2.2 is to get better treatments to patients faster and with fewer side effects,"" Dr. Laura Esserman, founder of the I-SPY trials and QLHC, said in a statement.

""New bispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates have the promise of eliminating traditional chemotherapy, but they too are associated with potential serious side effects. One of those complications is ILD, but early identification may be the key to preventing it from becoming a serious complication. Evinova makes it possible for us to monitor people using the drug every day, from the comfort of their home.""

Cristina Duran, president of Evinova, said that with real-time alerts to both patients and sites, Evinova's RPM solution for toxicity monitoring will give care teams the ability to review and take proactive actions based on guidelines.

""At Evinova, we're passionate about accelerating better health outcomes through technology like RPM that enables global life science leaders to overcome critical research challenges and deliver a better clinical trial experience for both sites and patients,"" Duran said.

THE LARGER TREND 

In 2023, AstraZeneca launched Evinova with the aim of bringing digital health solutions already in use globally by the pharma company to clinical research organizations, trial sponsors, and care teams and patients. 

The company uses established digital technology solutions to streamline clinical trial design and delivery in order to reduce time and costs in medicine development. The venture also dives into digital remote patient monitoring and therapeutics.

Other companies involved in remote patient monitoring include Sibel Health, a spin-out of Northwestern University, which closed a $30 million Series C equity financing round in March and received its seventh FDA clearance. 

Sibel Health's FDA-cleared ANNE One platform contains advanced wearable sensors, AI-enabled data analytics, and an integrated mobile software and cloud platform. It also offers wireless monitoring of patients' vital signs and can be used for patients 12 years and older. 

In 2024, Doccla, a provider of virtual ward and remote patient monitoring services, secured £35 million ($38.6 million) in an oversubscribed Series B funding round. 

That same year, CoachCare secured a $48 million strategic growth investment.

CoachCare works with individual practices and hospital systems to provide a remote patient monitoring service for patients with acute and chronic conditions, and it offers connected devices for providers to capture patient data. The company also provides a virtual health platform for follow-ups and chronic care management.

HCA Healthcare Announces $1.84 Million HCA Healthcare Foundation Grant to United Way

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, today announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, will give $1.84 million to Mile High United Way to launch United for Healthy Starts, a national collaboration between four United Ways to help increase access to social, economic and educational support services for families. The effort is led by Mile High United Way in Denver and includes United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, United Way Miami and United Way of Greater Nashville.


“It's a privilege to help champion the overall health and well-being of families through United for Healthy Starts,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of the HCA Healthcare Foundation. “Meaningful community impact can be made when organizations come together to support and learn from one another. We are excited and expect to see a positive influence from this United Way initiative across the country, as we work together to help give communities healthier tomorrows.”




United for Healthy Starts aims to increase access to services to improve social, economic and overall health outcomes for families. Through this new grant, the initiative is designed to help families have strong, healthy starts through home visitation and wrap-around services tailored to the needs of each family supported. By establishing a national, collaborative learning community, United for Healthy Starts will also work to help create new nonprofit partnerships, with the intention of strengthening service delivery and innovation and achieving a scalable impact beyond the grant.




""We are thrilled to continue this longstanding collaboration between two historic anchor institutions committed to improving the lives of families – HCA Healthcare and United Way,” said Christine Benero, Mile High United Way president and CEO. “Through United for Healthy Starts, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are truly putting a stake in the ground for mothers and young children, especially those facing barriers to healthy outcomes. This important grant in the Denver, Dallas, Nashville and Miami communities will help our work to develop new innovations in home visitation and support, and we hope the learnings will allow us to bring this model to more communities in the future.”




HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have a long history of working with and supporting United Way. In 1981, HCA Healthcare co-founder Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. co-founded the first chapter of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society in Nashville, Tennessee and later received its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. Over the last 30 years, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have given more than $17 million in support of United Way's work to help improve communities nationwide.




The HCA Healthcare Foundation's Healthier Tomorrow Fund supports evidence-informed programs that address high-priority needs and advance community health by supporting efforts to pilot, replicate and scale meaningful, measurable initiatives in communities where HCA Healthcare has a presence. Since its inception, the fund has committed more than $17 million in grants to nonprofits across the country.

Oops, something went wrong

Healthcare companies are pushing the status quo by innovating in areas like drug development and digital health. Despite the rosy long-term prospects, short-term headwinds such as COVID inventory destocking have harmed the industry's returns - over the past six months, healthcare stocks have collectively shed 5.9%. This performance was discouraging since the S&P 500 held steady.

A cautious approach is imperative when dabbling in these businesses as regulation is another unpredictable element that can affect their earnings potential. On that note, here are three healthcare stocks that may face trouble.

Market Cap: $369.3 billion

Born from a 2013 spinoff of Abbott Laboratories' pharmaceutical business, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets medications for autoimmune diseases, cancer, neurological disorders, and other complex health conditions.

Why Do We Think Twice About ABBV?

Constant currency growth was below our standards over the past two years, suggesting it might need to invest in product improvements to get back on track

Inability to adjust its cost structure while its revenue declined over the last two years led to a 10.6 percentage point drop in the company's adjusted operating margin

Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were less profitable, as its 2.5% annual earnings per share growth trailed its revenue gains

AbbVie's stock price of $209.00 implies a valuation ratio of 17x forward price-to-earnings. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why ABBV doesn't pass our bar.

Market Cap: $5.61 billion

With a nearly 170-year history dedicated to vision care and eye health innovation, Bausch + Lomb (NYSE:BLCO) develops and manufactures a comprehensive range of eye health products including contact lenses, pharmaceuticals, surgical devices, and consumer eye care solutions.

Why Does BLCO Fall Short?

Sales trends were unexciting over the last five years as its 5% annual growth was below the typical healthcare company

Incremental sales over the last five years were much less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 23.5% annually while its revenue grew

Short cash runway increases the probability of a capital raise that dilutes existing shareholders

At $15.93 per share, Bausch + Lomb trades at 20.8x forward price-to-earnings. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including BLCO in your portfolio, it's free.

Market Cap: $3.33 billion

Pioneering the shift from bulky, short-term heart monitors to sleek, wire-free patches, iRhythm Technologies (NASDAQ:IRTC) provides wearable cardiac monitoring devices and AI-powered analysis services that help physicians detect and diagnose heart rhythm disorders.

Why Does IRTC Worry Us?

Earnings per share fell by 7.5% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew, partly because it diluted shareholders

Negative free cash flow raises questions about the return timeline for its investments

Unfavorable liquidity position could lead to additional equity financing that dilutes shareholders

iRhythm is trading at $106.42 per share, or 63.9x forward EV-to-EBITDA. If you're considering IRTC for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.

The Trump trade may have passed, but rates are still dropping and inflation is still cooling. Opportunities are ripe for those ready to act - and we're here to help you pick them.

Get started by checking out our Top 9 Market-Beating Stocks. This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 175% over the last five years.

Stocks that made our list in 2019 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+2,183% between December 2019 and December 2024) as well as under-the-radar businesses like Axon (+711% five-year return).

PALM BEACH, Fla., March  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a significant part of healthcare and is being used in almost all sectors, including diagnostics. The integration of AI has increased the growth and development of the healthcare industry. In diagnostic testing, AI is used to analyze medical images (CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, MRIs, and DXAs), large patient data, vital signs (pulse rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and respiration rate), medical history, and laboratory test results. AI provides several advantages in diagnostics, such as accuracy, efficiency, reduced human errors, and cost savings. Healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions and develop personalized treatment options. The AI in the diagnostics market is growing due to reduced healthcare costs, reduced healthcare burden on professionals, and enhanced patient satisfaction. A recent report from Towards Healthcare, said: “The global AI in diagnostics market is to value at US$ 1.74 billion in 2025 is to touch US$ 5.24 billion by 2030. In 2023, North America led the AI in diagnostics market with a 53% share, while Asia Pacific is set to experience the fastest growth. The software segment dominated by component and is expected to show the highest CAGR. In diagnosis, neurology held the largest market share, while radiology is predicted to grow at the quickest pace during the forecast period. AI in diagnostics is advancing accuracy and efficiency in medical evaluations, driving its global expansion across various sectors.”   Active healthcare/tech companies active in the markets include: Avant Technologies Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Tempus AI, Inc. (NASDAQ: TEM), Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC), Talkspace (NASDAQ: TALK), BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BFRG).

Towards Healthcare continued; “The global AI in diagnostics market was estimated at US$ 1.12 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to US$ 12.65 billion by 2034, rising at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.64% from 2024 to 2034. The demand for AI in diagnostic testing has increased significantly due to the various benefits AI provides. One of the major benefits is reduced human error, which improves overall diagnostic results that can be used by professionals to develop appropriate treatment options. Preventive care has become a really necessary step for improving health. Growing infectious diseases and chronic conditions have increased the burden on healthcare resources and professionals. It is estimated that the healthcare cost will rise up to US$ 176 billion without effective interventions, which is going to increase the demand for preventive care in the future. With the help of AI in diagnostics, this can be reduced as AI can play a significant role in preventive care. Preventive care involves analyzing medical records, medical history, lifestyle, genetics, and other aspects to identify future health risks. However, it is a very time-consuming and tedious process. Healthcare workers are prone to errors when analyzing such a large amount of data, which can lead to misinterpretation. The use of AI can mitigate all these challenges and help in analyzing health risks with data analytics in less time with more accuracy and efficiency.”

Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI) and Ainnova Begin Designing Clinical Trial Protocol for Company's Vision AI Platform - Avant Technologies, Inc. (“Avant” or the “Company”) and its partner, Ainnova Tech, Inc., (Ainnova), a leading healthcare technology company focused on revolutionizing early disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI), today announced that the Company has started designing its clinical trial protocol ahead of a pre-submission meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The pre-submission meeting is to request guidance on the clinical testing needed for its Vision AI platform in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, and Ainnova's clinical trial will culminate in the submission of an FDA 510(k) to obtain clearance from the regulatory agency to market its technology.

Ainnova has hired an ophthalmologist, who is assisting in drafting the requirements for the clinical trial protocol that the Company's Contract Research Organization (CRO), Fortrea, has requested. Upon completion of the protocol, Ainnova will work with its CRO to prepare and send all the documentation to the FDA for its upcoming pre-submission meeting. A clinical trial protocol is a detailed, written plan that outlines the objectives, design, methodology, and organization of a clinical research project, ensuring the safety of participants and the integrity of data collected. The Company expects its pre-submission meeting with the FDA to occur in mid-May 2025.

Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC), the Company formed by the partnership between Avant and Ainnova to advance and commercialize Ainnova's technology portfolio, including its Vision AI platform and its versatile retinal cameras, has the global licensing rights for this portfolio, so the success of Ainnova's interactions with the FDA are paramount to marketing the technology portfolio in the United States.

For medical device applicants like Ainnova, the FDA's pre-submission program is useful to determine a clear regulatory pathway for the successful launch of the device, including the number of patients and the number of clinics needed to generate the necessary clinical data for the FDA to make an informed decision on Ainnova's Vision AI platform. For Avant, the pre-submission meeting will help define a precise budget for the strategic partnership's entire FDA process.

A new report shows decelerating growth for Medicare Advantage plans.

The annual 2025 Medicare Advantage competitive enrollment report by healthcare advisory firm Chartis and consulting firm HealthScape Advisors said the market is undergoing a period of correction, following rapid growth in the early 2020s.
 
The Medicare Advantage market grew by 1.3 million beneficiaries, or 3.9%, in 2024. This is down from 7% growth in 2023 and 9.4% in 2022. 

Despite the numbers, the market remains strong, the report said. Health plan leaders are optimistic and generally more positive than when they were surveyed last year, according to the report. The MA market has continued growth and favorable economics compared to other market segments, they said. Also, the Trump administration has signaled support for the program and less administrative burden is expected for plans.

Ninety-one percent expect the same or better performance in 2026, compared to 74% the year prior.

Special needs plan enrollment increased 10% from 2024 to 2025.

WHY THIS MATTERS

This year, Medicare Advantage overtook original Medicare as the plan of choice for people 65 years and older, those with disabilities or end stage renal disease who need healthcare coverage.

Currently, 51% of those on Medicare have a Medicare Advantage plan, compared to 49% of those who have original Medicare, according to the report. Last year, there was a 50% split in enrollment for each.

This compares to five years ago, when 60% of seniors had original Medicare and 40% were in a Medicare Advantage plan.

MA growth has skyrocketed in the last five years due in part to the aging demographics of baby boomers. However, this year is expected to be the peak annual age-in for Medicare overall, according to the report.

This year was the highest on record for overall Medicare growth.

An interesting trend is that for the first time, original Medicare enrollment has not declined, despite MA gaining the upper hand in market share. Original Medicare grew by about 200,000 beneficiaries this year.

THE LARGER TREND

MA plans have faced recent headwinds of declining payment rates, medical cost pressures, regulatory burden and less favorable star ratings.

Several plans exited the market including Premera and Blue Cross Blue Shield Kansas City and others reduced their service areas, such as Aetna and Humana, according to the report. Prior to the annual enrollment period, many for-profit health plans signaled their intent to slow growth or even contract membership due to the pressures. This has resulted in a flattening of MA plans available nationally, the report said.

For-profit insurers control nearly three-quarters of the Medicare Advantage market. Meanwhile, Blues, nonprofit and provider-sponsored health plans continue to see marginal market share erosion, despite notching overall enrollment growth, the report said.

 NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation's leading healthcare providers, today announced that the HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, will give $1.84 million to Mile High United Way to launch United for Healthy Starts, a national collaboration between four United Ways to help increase access to social, economic and educational support services for families. The effort is led by Mile High United Way in Denver and includes United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, United Way Miami and United Way of Greater Nashville.



“It's a privilege to help champion the overall health and well-being of families through United for Healthy Starts,” said Joanne Pulles, vice president of community engagement at HCA Healthcare and president of the HCA Healthcare Foundation. “Meaningful community impact can be made when organizations come together to support and learn from one another. We are excited and expect to see a positive influence from this United Way initiative across the country, as we work together to help give communities healthier tomorrows.”



United for Healthy Starts aims to increase access to services to improve social, economic and overall health outcomes for families. Through this new grant, the initiative is designed to help families have strong, healthy starts through home visitation and wrap-around services tailored to the needs of each family supported. By establishing a national, collaborative learning community, United for Healthy Starts will also work to help create new nonprofit partnerships, with the intention of strengthening service delivery and innovation and achieving a scalable impact beyond the grant.



""We are thrilled to continue this longstanding collaboration between two historic anchor institutions committed to improving the lives of families – HCA Healthcare and United Way,” said Christine Benero, Mile High United Way president and CEO. “Through United for Healthy Starts, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation are truly putting a stake in the ground for mothers and young children, especially those facing barriers to healthy outcomes. This important grant in the Denver, Dallas, Nashville and Miami communities will help our work to develop new innovations in home visitation and support, and we hope the learnings will allow us to bring this model to more communities in the future.”



HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have a long history of working with and supporting United Way. In 1981, HCA Healthcare co-founder Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. co-founded the first chapter of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society in Nashville, Tennessee and later received its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. Over the last 30 years, HCA Healthcare and the HCA Healthcare Foundation have given more than $17 million in support of United Way's work to help improve communities nationwide.



The HCA Healthcare Foundation's Healthier Tomorrow Fund supports evidence-informed programs that address high-priority needs and advance community health by supporting efforts to pilot, replicate and scale meaningful, measurable initiatives in communities where HCA Healthcare has a presence. Since its inception, the fund has committed more than $17 million in grants to nonprofits across the country.

Health insurer Humana and independent primary care network Aledade are expanding their partnership, extending services to rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) with an eye toward achieving and sustaining value-based care.

The expanded collaboration will provide upfront resources, support and a timeframe for success for FQHCs and rural health clinics in 26 states. Aledade said this will give them an opportunity to share savings in Medicare Advantage.

Dr. Farzad Mostashari, Aledade's co-founder and CEO, said the expansion responds to the ""unique and evolving needs"" of its health centers.

""It recognizes the challenges that health centers must address to provide high quality, preventive care to high needs populations and demonstrates our commitment to addressing healthcare disparities,"" he said.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Humana Insurance President George Renaudin said the expanded agreement is important because it allows for expanded access to quality healthcare in areas such as rural communities, which historically have experienced shortages of hospitals and clinics.

""We are pleased to strengthen our relationship with Aledade, who shares a strong commitment to value-based care and its proven positive impact on health outcomes,"" he said.

Aledade partners with more than 300 health centers nationwide and collaborates with primary care organizations across both urban and rural settings. Nearly two-thirds of these health centers are located in areas designated as health professional shortage areas by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration.

In 2023, all eight of Aledade's Accountable Care Organizations that were exclusively made up of health centers earned shared savings, the company said. Together, they achieved a 6.12% savings rate, which resulted in $423 in shared savings per beneficiary.

THE LARGER TREND

Humana's financial results for Q4 and for full-year 2024 show a 10% revenue increase, but that's about the only bright spot as the insurer was hit by significant losses in Q4.

Rising healthcare utilization and insufficient CMS rate increases have impacted Humana's profitability, with shares down 50% from their 2023 peak, numbers showed.

For the quarter, Humana posted a $693 million loss, more than in the previous quarter, when it lost $541 million. Profits were also down: They stood at about $1.2 billion for the year, about half of its 2023 total, when it raked in $2.5 billion in profit.

Humana shares plunged in October after the insurer disclosed a sharp reduction in the number of members enrolled in high star Medicare Advantage plans, prompting it to challenge the results.

Ant Group Unveils Major Upgrades to Its Full-Suite AI Solutions in Healthcare for Hospitals, Doctors and Users

HANGZHOU, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ant Group has announced major upgrades to its comprehensive suite of AI solutions for the healthcare sector, aiming to enhance the capabilities of hospitals and doctors, and collaboratively benefit users through advanced AI innovations.


Empowering Hospitals with Secure and Efficient AI Integration



As industries increasingly adopt AI technologies, hospitals are leveraging latest innovations, including large models, to streamline operations and enhance patient care. To better support its healthcare service partners and with its extensive industry knowledge and technical expertise, Ant Group has collaborated with IT industry leaders to integrate its advanced healthcare large model into various types of All-in-One Large Model Machine for Healthcare. This solution allows hospitals to deploy AI models on-premises, ensuring efficient and secure use of AI to optimize daily operations and improve patient services. To date, the solution has already been adopted by seven leading hospitals and healthcare institutions across Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo.




Being built on advanced foundation models including DeepSeek R1/V3, Alibaba's Qwen, and Ant Group's self-developed BaiLing, Ant Group's healthcare large model is equipped with medical reasoning and multimodal interaction capabilities, and has consecutively won first place in several categories, including medical knowledge Q&A, in the MedBench evaluation of medical models.




The all-in-one machines also benefit from Ant Group's privacy-preserving computation solution, which safeguards data privacy and ensures traceability, enabling secure and mutually trusted collaboration between hospitals and other stakeholders.




Beyond the backend technological support, Ant Group is also helping hospitals develop user-facing applications. Angel, an AI agent developed in collaboration with public medical institutions in China's Zhejiang Province, has served over 1,000 medical facilities, handling more than 30 million user interactions. Additionally, Ant Group has supported local basic medical insurance services across China in developing Yibaoer, an AI agent designed to assist users with medical insurance-related inquiries.




Upgraded AI Doctor Assistant for Advanced Research



In January 2025, Ant Group completed the acquisition of Haodf, a leading healthcare platform focused on online doctor consultations. This acquisition strengthens Ant Group's commitment to innovating AI-powered healthcare solutions. Together, Ant Group and Haodf launched the AI Doctor Assistant to support the platform's 290,000 doctors with tasks such as patient education and medical record management.




The assistant has now been upgraded to support scientific research by integrating DeepSeek, helping doctors quickly locate relevant research articles and providing comprehensive summaries. It also offers AI-assisted diagnoses based on patient records and medical reports, citing relevant research articles to support doctors in their decision-making process.




Enhanced AI Healthcare Manager for Individual Users' Personalized Services



In September 2024, Ant Group launched the AI Healthcare Manager within the Alipay app. Available through voice and text conversations, this healthcare manager connects users to over 30 services, including doctor mapping, medical report interpretation, in-hospital navigation, and personalized medical advice. Since its launch, the AI Healthcare Manager has assisted 40 million users.




The latest upgrade brings more detailed and personalized health advice. New features include health status self-detection and medical report analysis, offering users a comprehensive approach to managing their well-being.




Since 2014, Ant Group has been supporting the digital and intelligent transformation of China's healthcare sector to fulfill the growing demands of its population, helping medical institutions, doctors and health insurers provide more efficient, accessible, and personalized services for all users.




Ant Insurance, Ant Group's online insurance brokerage platform, has supported leading insurers in providing more accessible insurance services. In 2024, insurers in China processed 7.25 million health claims through Ant Insurance, marking a 55% year-over-year increase, driven by ongoing innovations in product offerings and user experience.




Five years ago, with the introduction of China's Medical Insurance Code—the e-certificate for basic medical insurance—Chinese citizens no longer needed to carry a physical medical insurance card when visiting hospitals or drugstores. By the end of 2024, over 700 million people had activated their e-certificates via Alipay.




About Ant Group



Ant Group aims to build the infrastructure and platforms to support the digital transformation of the service industry. Through continuous innovation, we strive to provide all consumers and small and micro businesses equal access to digital financial and other daily life services that are convenient, sustainable and inclusive.

Oops, something went wrong

A collaboration with hospital systems and their leaders, OnDefend's new Ransomware Defense Validation service reimagines defense strategies through proactive and continuous security control validation.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 25, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OnDefend, a leader in preventative cybersecurity testing and advisory services, today announced the launch of its Ransomware Defense Validation (RDV) service. Developed with direct input from prominent healthcare Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and launched in collaboration with major healthcare systems, RDV addresses the pressing need for organizations to proactively defend against ransomware threats.

The healthcare community faces a new pandemic—a cyber one—and the risks to patient safety, data security, and operational continuity have never been greater. As a managed service, RDV, powered by BlindSPOT, OnDefend's proprietary Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platform, equips organizations to regularly test and validate the effectiveness of their prevention, detection, and response security controls against known and emerging threats.

Data collected from OnDefend's global security testing services found:

24% of malicious emails bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs).

7 out of 10 attack simulation engagements identify exploitable security tool failures.

5 out of 10 incident emulations identify notification delays or failure to meet Service Level Agreements (SLA) between the response vendors.

A Collaborative Approach to Solving an Industry-Wide Challenge

RDV originated from conversations between OnDefend's security teams and healthcare leaders who shared concerns about common security control failures and the lack of regular visibility and validation.

""Cybersecurity isn't about setting up defenses and hoping for the best. It's about constantly testing, adapting, and staying ahead of threats. If you're not testing your security, the attackers will do it for you,"" said Larry Whiteside Jr., former CISO at Spectrum Health and Women's Care OBGYN.

These discussions highlighted the need for a proactive solution tailored to the unique challenges of healthcare cybersecurity, going above and beyond current healthcare standards and regulations.

How Ransomware Defense Validation (RDV) Works

RDV is delivered by OnDefend as a managed service using BlindSPOT to safely simulate real-world ransomware attacks on a healthcare systems' defenses to prove their:

Secure Email Gateways (SEGs): effectively filter malicious emails from reaching employee inboxes.

Threat Detection Tools (EDR, SIEM): effectively identify and alert security teams to real-world attack activity.

Threat Response Teams (SOC,MDR,NDR): immediately respond and neutralize real-world cyber threats in real-time.

""Ransomware Defense Validation provides security leaders with critical visibility into their defensive investments, ensuring they are resilient against the cyber threats targeting their industry,"" said Chris Freedman, CEO of OnDefend. ""The goal of this managed service is to validate security tools and hold monitoring vendors accountable, all while empowering our customers to demonstrate they are achieving the return on investment they deserve.""

RDV Outcomes & Industry Impact

Early access customers who implemented RDV found their security teams' overall posture improved, showcased continuous risk reduction, proved return on investments, and are prepared to safeguard essential healthcare operations.

This service is now available to healthcare organizations nationwide.

Medicaid, a federal health insurance program for low-income children and adults, is facing dual challenges at both the state and federal level.

Nationally, Republicans in Congress are pushing to cut about $880 billion in spending on healthcare and energy over 10 years. The nonpartisan policy institute Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said this will be impossible to do without cuts to Medicaid, which covers about one in five Americans.

It is not yet clear what form those cuts could take, but proposals have included changing payments into fixed or per capita amounts, reducing the matching rate for Medicaid expansion population and adding work requirements. 

The Trump administration has promised cuts would not reduce benefits and has said taxpayers lose as much as $521 billion annually to fraud, most of which they claimed came from entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Meanwhile, Maine state lawmakers last week failed to pass the supplemental budget with the two-thirds majority required to immediately address the $118 million shortfall in the state's Medicaid program.

Most House Republicans did not vote for the measure, saying they wanted to see more reforms to the program. In response, the state said it would need to temporarily pause payments to certain healthcare providers.

On Thursday, Democrats, who hold the majority, advanced a budget over Republican opposition that bails out the Medicaid program, but only for the next year. The budget does not include anticipated $100 million increases in MaineCare costs in fiscal year 2027, the Portland Press Herald reported. Maine's governor signed the budget late Friday afternoon.

Alex Carter, policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, told The Maine Monitor that the state Medicaid deficit would be “just a small symptom — the tip of the iceberg — of what we would see if such massive cuts were made to federal Medicaid spending.”

So what does Medicaid actually cover in Maine?

First and foremost, it is important to note that Maine's version of Medicaid is called MaineCare. The program is jointly funded by the state and federal government. 

There are some services — such as hospital visits, nursing facility stays or home health services — that states are required to cover under Medicaid, and then there are additional services states can opt into. For example, Maine has opted to also provide coverage for older adults in residential care who are spending down their income to reach the threshold for Medicaid, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

Thirty-two percent of the state's total budget was spent on MaineCare in the 2023 fiscal year, according to the DHHS.

As of December, MaineCare had nearly 400,000 members enrolled in its various programs, which include Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and additional state-specific categories.

Nearly a fourth of those enrolled in MaineCare are part of the expansion of eligibility that Mainers approved by referendum in 2017 and Gov. Janet Mills adopted when she took office in 2019.

One possible way Congress could cut Medicaid would be to reduce financial support to states for this expansion population. Right now, Maine's federal funding match rate for the expansion population — about 94,000 Mainers — is 90 percent.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that if Congress reduces that matching rate for people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, Maine would lose $117 million in federal money, forcing state leaders to cover the cost or remove 25,000 people from Medicaid.

Last year, about two-thirds of Maine's nursing home residents and about half of Maine children were covered by MaineCare.

Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association, said MaineCare makes up about 18% of the hospital business across the state — although it ranges widely. 

Eighteen percent doesn't sound like a lot, said Michaud, “but it is in our world.”

Lisa Harvey-McPherson, vice president of government relations for Northern Light Health, said revenue from MaineCare payments is different for each hospital in the system and ranges from 12 to 64 percent.

“Some provider types in Maine are almost fully reliant on MaineCare, like nursing homes and community behavioral health services,” she said. “We rely on community services to provide care to our patients throughout the state of Maine.”

Nearly half of all births at hospitals across the state were covered by MaineCare, according to a three-year average from 2021 to 2023 by the Maine Hospital Association. For rural hospitals, that increased to 55 percent, Michaud said.

MaineHealth said 13 percent of its total revenue is from MaineCare payments, and 43 percent of behavioral health patients are on MaineCare.

Katie Fullam Harris, chief government affairs officer, added that MaineHealth is “exceedingly concerned” about any reductions in eligibility or payments to providers.

“Maine's healthcare infrastructure is teetering on the edge of real challenge right now,” she said. “There's no room to absorb additional costs.”

Jill Tedesco, Field Nurse at BrightStar Care of Stroudsburg, has been named a 2024 Frontline Honors honoree by Home Health Care News.

To become a Frontline honoree, an individual is nominated by their peers. The candidate must be:

Home Health Care News recently caught up with Tedesco to discuss their time in the home health & home care industry.

HHCN: What drew you to this industry?

Tedesco: I was drawn to home healthcare for a couple of reasons. First, after working in the hospital for a short period of time, I quickly realized that I need more time to spend with patients. When working on a unit, the amount of patients who require nursing does not allow the nurse to provide “quality time” with each patient. I felt as though I was always rushed. Home healthcare provides me the opportunity to really get to know my clients/patients and create a bond that's so important to not only the client, but to myself as well. Another reason I was drawn to home care is the flexibility in scheduling. I have school-aged children, so having this flexibility is so important.

HHCN: What's your biggest lesson learned since starting to work in the industry?

Tedesco: Personal boundaries are something that I am still in the process of learning. When it comes to my schedule, I tend to put myself last. I am no good to anyone else if I'm not taking care of myself. I have made a promise to myself, and my family, to take off three days a month (Sundays) and to work no later than 4pm. Rome wasn't built in a day, but I'm trying my best.

HHCN: What's your favorite part about your job?

Tedesco: The friendships that I create with my clients and the flexibility in scheduling.

HHCN: What do you want the general public to better understand about your job and the industry you serve?

Tedesco: Home care is a critical component to the healing process. When a client is discharged from the hospital, there is so much fear and uncertainty about how they will get by at home when they are no longer in the hospital receiving 24/7 care from nurses and doctors. Home care helps to bridge that gap and create a safe environment at home for clients who, in some cases, are unable to care for themselves independently. A home care nurse provides wound care, organizes medications, administers medications, schedules appointments and, most importantly, we are a liaison and/or advocate between the client and their physician.

HHCN: What's something that you wish other people in your organization — particularly leaders who don't work on the front lines — understood better about your job?

Tedesco: My job is so much more than just the administration of medication and communicating with physicians. Most of the time with elderly clients, my visit is the only exposure they have to the outside world. Taking my time with each client is very important for their emotional well-being. I am a firm believer that the process of healing is not only physical, but emotional as well.

The Mount Sinai Health System on Monday announced its new Center for Artificial Intelligence in Children's Health, which will explore new ways to develop, test and embed AI directly into pediatric healthcare to enable earlier diagnoses, preventive approaches and personalized treatment plans.

WHY IT MATTERS

To accelerate AI research and personalized treatment in children's health, Mount Sinai said it will create an integrated data infrastructure and advance multimodal AI research and leverage computer-augmented imaging, multi-omics research, rare disease identification and pharmacogenomics to enhance health economics and care delivery.

""While AI has advanced at a remarkable pace in many areas of medicine, pediatric medicine has unfortunately lagged due to stricter privacy considerations, more complicated regulatory pathways and limited data infrastructure,"" said Benjamin Glicksberg, a digital health and clinical informatics expert, in a statement.

Glicksberg, who will also serve as associate professor of artificial intelligence and human health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, will lead the center. He'll focus on enabling the health system to offer more precise diagnostics and personalized treatments for young patients, according to Dr. Brendan Carr, Mount Sinai's chief executive officer and Dr. Kenneth L. Davis Distinguished Chair.

The Center, established under The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, will also spearhead clinical trials at Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital to enhance AI-driven diagnostics, predictive modeling and real-time monitoring.

""The Center for AI in Children's Health underscores Mount Sinai's commitment to pioneering AI-driven technologies that will enable Mount Sinai to deliver world-class care to our children,"" Carr said in a statement.

""Our kids are our future, and under Dr. Glicksberg's leadership, the Center for AI in Children's Health will advance children's health outcomes for generations to come,"" added Dr. Girish Nadkarni, Mount Sinai's Windreich Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health chair, which is co-sponsoring the new Center.

THE LARGER TREND

Health systems have been using AI imaging tools to improve patient access and treatment and to predict diseases.

Pediatrics researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia developed a deep-learning model to enhance their understanding of disease progression and made the AI available to others for tumor analysis. 

The model can learn patterns and make predictions or classifications faster than previous approaches, CHOP researchers said.

The ""approach could redefine how we understand complex tissues at the cellular level, paving the way for transformative breakthroughs in healthcare,"" Kai Tan, the study's lead author and a professor in the Department of Pediatrics at CHOP, said in December.

ON THE RECORD

""This new Center is dedicated to addressing these challenges by safely developing, testing, and embedding AI directly into child healthcare – enabling earlier diagnoses, preventive measures, computer-augmented imaging for complex conditions, expedited drug discovery and highly personalized treatment plans,"" said Glicksberg in a statement.

""By harnessing the power of advanced data science and clinical expertise, we aim to usher in a new era for child healthcare – delivering faster diagnoses, personalized treatments and transformative outcomes,"" added Nadkarni.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 25, 2025) – Hospitals can be overwhelming places for children and are often filled with unfamiliar sights, sounds and experiences. But specialists in the Child Life program at UK HealthCare's Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) work to make the environment less intimidating.  

Recently, the Child Life program expanded to three additional within KCH: the Pediatric Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic, the Center for Advanced Surgery and the pediatric specialty clinics located at Kentucky Children's Richmond Road. 

Previously, the Child Life Program only had dedicated specialists in the inpatient acute, progressive and critical care units of KCH, as well as the neonatal intensive care unit and the cardiac care unit. Specialists also assist patients in the Makenna David Pediatric Emergency Center, the DanceBlue Hematology Oncology Clinic and the Children's Sedation and Procedure Unit.  

Through play, education and emotional support, the Child Life Program helps young patients and their families navigate medical challenges with confidence. Their work goes beyond distraction; it empowers children to understand their medical experiences and cope with them in healthy ways.  

“Every interaction with a Child Life specialist has the potential to change a child's hospital experience for the better,” said Jennifer Guilliams, director of Child and Family Life at KCH. “There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Our specialists meet each patient where they are, using play, education and emotional support tailored to their unique needs. With this expansion, more young patients will receive the reassurance and care they deserve, delivered by an extraordinary team committed to making a difference.”

Child Life Specialists, Ashlee Amerine (Center for Advanced Surgery), Ashley Semones (KCH Richmond Road clinics) and Lyndsay Overton (Children's Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic) shared with UKNow their roles in Child Life program, the strategies they use to ease fears and the impact they have on young patients. 

UKNOW: Describe your roles in the Child Life program. 

Ashlee Amerine: I often tell my families I'm like the “teacher” of the hospital. My role is to help patients and families understand why they are here, teaching them about a diagnosis or a surgery they might be having. My role is also to provide support and normalization to their environment to help aid in coping. I help out with procedures such as IV starts or anesthesia inductions as well as providing support and positive coping to patients as they separate from their parents to go off to surgery. My job is to help make their experience a little less scary, and a little more fun. 

Ashley Semones: I help to prepare, educate, support, distract and play with kids to help reduce stress and anxiety. I know child development very well. There is so much power in play. 

Lyndsay Overton: My role is to help explain to patients and families what is going to happen while they are with us in the Pediatric Infusion & Diagnostic Clinic. Many of these patients and families have been coming for years and know our nursing staff well. These patients have chronic conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, lupus and many others. The patients might come a few days in a row, once a week, once a month or once every six months. It depends on what the doctor's plan of care is for them. The treatments can take an hour or sometimes all day. I help with IV placements, lab draws, port access/de access and dressing changes to help patients cope, and give activities, games, toys and craft kits to do to help pass the time. 

UKNOW: What inspired you to pursue a career in Child Life? 

Ashlee Amerine: I always loved working with children and had a draw to working in the health care field. I originally thought I may want to be a physician's assistant, but then changed my path after learning about child life. A family friend is a certified child life specialist in Minnesota and told me about the profession and it felt like it was meant to be for me.  

UKNOW: What unique challenges do children face in specialized medical settings that child life can help address? 

Ashlee Amerine: Children often have misconceptions within the health care environment because most of what they are experiencing is new and unfamiliar. Child life specialists can help children understand through developmentally appropriate language, preparation of pictures and even using medical equipment to play out a procedure they may be having. Helping children understand what will be happening to their bodies can help ease fears. As child life specialists we can also work to normalize the environment such as bringing in familiar toys to play with or help celebrate their birthday.  

UKNOW: What prompted the expansion of Child Life services into specialized areas of care? 

Lyndsay Overton: When the Diagnostic & Infusion Clinic opened in 2023, the request for child life services came from staff, families and patients who had received previous treatments at KCH. The KCH Leadership team advocated for this service for these patients and families who have frequent visits. 

UKNOW: How does your approach change when working with children in specialized medical fields? 

Ashley Semones: Meeting every child and family where they are in a developmentally appropriate way. Doing a child life assessment to figure out what works best for each child and family. Every child is different and has unique things that impact their coping and their journey. 

UKNOW: What strategies do you use to support parents and siblings of children undergoing complex medical treatments? 

Lyndsay Overton: I always try to approach meeting every patient and family with open eyes and ears. I think to myself that maybe I can find something that some other of our medical team missed to better this patients experience. Common strategies are medical play, comfort positions and nonpharmaceutical management techniques. 

UKNOW: Can you share a success story where Child Life interventions made a significant impact in a specialized setting? 

Ashley Semones: I spend half my day with KCH Richmond Road clinics and half my day with Easter Seals (a local nonprofit for children and adults with special health care needs). For the clinics, organizing the Halloween trick-or-treat trail and clinic Christmas market were wonderful holiday events. For Easter Seals, watching kids take their first steps, learn to talk, and daily hugs and smiles. Kids are so amazing, and I am so proud of these kids.

March is Child Life Month, a time to recognize the profound impact of child life specialists on young patients and their families. Their work extends far beyond the walls of a hospital room, turning fear into confidence, uncertainty into strength and hospital stays into opportunities for healing and growth. Through their dedication, every child feels seen, heard and supported when it matters most.

Child life specialists rely on community support to bring comfort and joy to young patients. Learn more about how to support the Child Life Program through monetary or in-kind donations.

FRAMINGHAM — The state Department of Public Health will hold a public hearing April 9 at the Memorial Building in response to MetroWest Medical Center's plans to reduce the level of its maternity services at Framingham Union Hospital.

Tenet Healthcare Corp., the Dallas-based publicly traded company that owns Framingham Union, recently announced plans to shift the status of the hospital's maternity services from a Level IIB Special Care Nursery to a Level I Well Baby Nursery.

Level II nurseries treat babies born greater than 32 weeks or those that are full term and require close monitoring of problems that are expected to soon be resolved. The ""IIB"" designation means the hospital can provide some respiratory assistance for short periods of time.

Level I nurseries provide care only for healthy full-term babies or babies born close to their due date, typically 35 weeks or later.

The plan has been criticized by city officials and nurses at Framingham Union Hospital.

The Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents about 300 nurses at Framingham Union, opposes a reduction in services. The Daily News spoke with nursing staff about the move during a gathering outside of the hospital on March 11.

Ginnie Ford, a nurse in the unit since 1978, explained that mothers with more needs will have to be transferred to either UMass Memorial Health in Worcester or to a hospital in Boston.

""We need this (not to change). Most of our patients are low income,"" she said during the March 11 gathering. ""Our mammas are really high risk."" She explained that while Tenet said the unit won't lose any staff, it's already flexing the numbers down.

""Tenet could hire more OBs (obstetricians); when I started there were 32 OBs, now there's two,"" Ford added.

Mayor Charlie Sisitsky, who requested the hearing be held in Framingham, expressed concern about the discontinuing of more specialized maternity services in a letter to the DPH. He wrote that he was told by the CEO of Tenet that about 50 out of 500 deliveries each year require an advanced level of maternity services.

""We are further concerned that discontinuing the specialized maternity services may deter women from seeking maternity care at all from MWMC,"" he wrote. ""This could have a cascading effect on overall maternity services and would eventually lead to lower delivery numbers that MWMC could then claim that any maternity services could no longer be justified.""

In a statement to the Daily News about the closure, a Tenet spokesperson wrote that the hospital will still be able to create ""a memorable and patient-centric"" birthing experience for lower-risk deliveries while having the ability to transfer higher acuity patients to a facility that offers more specialized care.

In a Facebook post about the hearing, Sisitsky wrote: ""We are thrilled that the DPH has agreed to hold the hearing here in Framingham.""

""This decision reflects our commitment to ensuring that local voices are heard,"" the mayor continued. ""We encourage all residents to attend and engage in this important conversation about the future of maternity care in our community.""

The DPH's public hearing will take place on Wednesday, April 9, at Nevins Hall in the Memorial Building, 150 Concord St. Nevins Hall can hold more than 1,100 people and is equipped with technology for presentations and live broadcasts.

While no time has been provided, the city posted on Facebook that a time would be added later this week.","{'href': 'https://www.metrowestdailynews.com', 'title': 'MetroWest Daily News'}"

Francine Soliz, of Coarsegold, has faced her own challenges in finding a health care provider, and felt that her concerns were sometimes overlooked – experiences that fueled her passion to pursue a career in health care.

“I don't want to be seen as another number on a chart. I want to be cared about as a patient, and it wasn't until my mom started having her health issues that I decided I wanted to be a provider,” said Soliz.

Francine Soliz

Soliz is a psychology student on a pre-medical track that will prepare her to enter medical school after graduation. With the help of the Health Careers Opportunity Program at Fresno State, she hopes to become a physician who can make a difference.

The Health Careers Opportunity Program supports students who aspire to give back to their communities as doctors, dentists, pharmacists, physician assistants, optometrists and other health care professionals.

The program connects students with advisers, conferences, student organizations, research opportunities and professional development workshops. It is housed within the Center for Access to Science for All in Fresno State's College of Science and Mathematics.

“The program has shown me what it is to have a community and enabled me to get the research experience that I need,” Soliz said. “I was also able to join the Latinx Center of Excellence Aspiring Physicians program last summer and that really inspired my passion for public health.”

Soliz gained insight into women's care by participating in the EMBRACE Prenatal Care Study at the Central Valley Health Policy Institute. The study looks for solutions to preterm birth and health disparities.

Soliz interviewed women at different clinics throughout their pregnancies and postpartum to analyze their mental health, social support and satisfaction with care.

“This was the first experience where I felt so deeply connected to my community members, and I saw the inequalities between the type of provider you get based on the type of insurance that you have. And it really got me thinking, ‘maybe I can be a solution to these problems.'”

Soliz is currently working on research through the Bulldogs Involved in Tobacco Endgame Research program. She and her team are actively collaborating with the Latino Coordinating Center and the Fresno County Tobacco Free Coalition to study the relationship between food insecurity and the increased use of flavored tobacco products.

The team created a survey and conducted outreach to elementary and high school students to gather data. Their outreach will extend to students from Fresno State and neighboring community colleges. 

Soliz and her team will present their findings at the 46th annual Central California Research Symposium in April.

Alejandra Prado, an academic coordinator for Health Professions Pathways, has worked closely with Soliz since 2023 and describes her as an energetic student who brings a positive and welcoming attitude to the Health Careers Opportunity Program.

“I think her work ethic and the opportunities that she seeks out say a lot about what she wants to do with going into a health profession,” Prado said. “Her ability to engage those around her is just amazing and it's going to take her far when she interacts with her future patients.”

With help from funds donated on Day of Giving, Fresno State's annual online giving campaign scheduled this year for Wednesday, March 26, the program will continue to provide resources and guidance for students like Soliz who are engaged in addressing the growing health needs of communities.

After becoming a physician, Soliz hopes to become a psychiatrist. Her goal is to ensureothers feel heard and supported in their health care journeys. 

“Not only has the Health Careers Opportunity Program connected me to amazing opportunities, but they've also provided emotional support,” Soliz said. “I don't think I would be who I am today without them.”

Fresno State's annual 24-hour, online Day of Giving will be Wednesday, March 26. The College of Science and Mathematics relies on private financial support, such as funds raised from the Day of Giving, to support experiential learning activities for students. Visit fresnostate.dayofgiving.edu to learn how to support the College of Science and Mathematics today.

Long Beach, California-based Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH provides managed healthcare services to low-income families and individuals under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces. Valued at a market cap of $17.1 billion, the company participates exclusively in government-sponsored healthcare programs. 

Companies worth $10 billion or more are typically classified as “large-cap stocks,” and Molina fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the healthcare plans industry. The company operates with a cost-efficient business model, focusing on streamlined healthcare delivery to maintain strong profit margins. With a broad geographic presence across multiple U.S. states, the company continues to expand its reach while leveraging strategic acquisitions and operational efficiency to strengthen its market position.

Despite its notable strength, this healthcare company has dipped 26.2% from its 52-week high of $423.92, reached on Mar. 27, 2024. It has gained 5.9% over the past three months, lagging behind the SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF's XHS 8.7% uptick over the same time frame.

In the longer term, MOH has fallen 24.6% over the past 52 weeks, considerably underperforming XHS' 7.3% rise over the same time frame. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of MOH are up 7.4%, compared to XHS' 9.5% return.

To confirm its recent bullish trend, MOH has been trading above its 50-day moving average since late February. However, it has remained below its 200-day moving average since late April, with some fluctuations.

On Feb. 5, MOH released its mixed Q4 results, and its stock plummeted 10.1% the following day. While adjusted earnings rose 15.3% year-over-year to $5.05 per share, it fell 13.1% short of Wall Street expectations. Rising medical care costs, lower investment income, and weaker-than-expected membership growth further weighed on investor sentiment and led to its earnings miss. However, on the brighter side, higher premium revenues and new contract acquisitions resulted in a 16% increase in its revenue to $10.5 billion, which met analyst estimates. 

For fiscal 2025, MOH expects adjusted EPS to be at least $24.50, representing an approximately 8% growth compared to the previous year. 

MOH has lagged behind its rival, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated's UNH 5.4% gain over the past 52 weeks but has outpaced UNH's 2.1% rise on a YTD basis. 

Despite MOH's recent underperformance relative to its industry peers, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from the 14 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $343.46 suggests a nearly 9.9% premium to its current levels.

My Ayur Health: Transforming Healthcare Through Ayurveda Innovation.

Virginia, United States, March 25, 2025 -- In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, the demand for holistic and natural healing methods has seen a dramatic rise. My Ayur Health, https://myayurhealth.com/, co-founded by Nandhakumar Raju and Dr. Mishra, is at the forefront of this transformation, offering an innovative platform that integrates the timeless wisdom of Ayurveda with cutting-edge technology. The platform aims to make Ayurvedic medicine accessible and affordable to people worldwide, addressing a critical gap in the healthcare ecosystem. By providing a comprehensive marketplace for virtual consultations, personalized health assessments, and natural remedies, My Ayur Health is redefining how people approach their health and well-being.



The Timeless Wisdom of Ayurveda Ayurveda, often referred to as the ""Science of Life,"" is one of the world's oldest medical systems, originating in India over 5,000 years ago. It emphasizes a holistic approach to health, focusing on the balance between mind, body, and spirit to achieve overall well-being. Unlike conventional medicine, which often focuses on treating symptoms, Ayurveda seeks to identify and address the root cause of ailments. With its reliance on natural remedies, dietary guidance, and lifestyle modifications, Ayurveda has proven to be effective in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, stress, and digestive disorders. Despite its proven benefits, access to qualified Ayurvedic practitioners and authentic treatments remains a challenge for many, particularly in the modern era where fast-paced lifestyles often compromise holistic health practices.

Challenges in Modern HealthcareThe global healthcare system is grappling with numerous challenges, from rising costs to the growing prevalence of chronic diseases. Allopathy, the predominant system of medicine, while highly effective for acute and emergency care, often falls short in addressing the long-term management of chronic conditions. Additionally, the reliance on synthetic drugs has led to widespread concerns about side effects and over-medication. In developing nations, accessibility to quality healthcare remains a significant hurdle, while in developed countries, the focus on quick fixes often overshadows the importance of preventive and holistic care. These challenges have highlighted the need for alternative approaches that prioritize prevention, affordability, and accessibility, a gap that My Ayur Health aims to fill.
		



Nandhakumar Raju: Visionary Leadership and ContributionAs a co-founder of My Ayur Health, Nandhakumar Raju has played a pivotal role in shaping the platform's vision and mission. Recognizing the untapped potential of Ayurveda in addressing global healthcare challenges, Nandhakumar has worked tirelessly to create a platform that bridges the gap between traditional healing practices and modern healthcare needs. With over two decades of experience in the technology sector and an MBA in Healthcare Management, he combines deep technical expertise with a strategic understanding of the healthcare industry. Additionally, his current role at a top multinational healthcare technology organization has given him valuable insights into the complexities and opportunities in the global healthcare landscape.

Nandhakumar's vision goes beyond just creating a platform; it's about fostering a community that values holistic health and well-being. His extensive background in technology and entrepreneurial leadership has enabled him to design and implement innovative solutions that enhance user experience and operational efficiency. By leveraging his expertise, Nandhakumar has introduced cutting-edge digital solutions to My Ayur Health, making Ayurvedic consultations and treatments accessible to people across the globe, eliminating geographical barriers, and streamlining user interactions.

In addition to his technical acumen, Nandhakumar is deeply committed to enhancing healthcare accessibility. He has driven efforts to onboard certified Ayurvedic practitioners, ensuring the platform maintains the highest quality standards. His strategic partnerships have expanded My Ayur Health's offerings to include personalized health assessments, virtual consultations, and dietary recommendations.Dr. Mishra: A Visionary Co-Founder and Healthcare PioneerDr. Bibhu R. Misra, a pioneering co-founder of My Ayur Health, is a distinguished leader in integrative and holistic healthcare with an extensive background in chiropractic care, rehabilitative medicine, clinical research, and pharmaceutical sciences. His ability to bridge modern medical science with Ayurvedic principles makes My Ayur Health a cutting-edge platform that blends evidence-based Western medicine with time-honored Eastern healing traditions.

Transforming Lives: Accessible and Affordable HealthcareMy Ayur Health has emerged as a beacon of hope for individuals seeking a natural and holistic approach to healthcare. The platform's user-friendly interface allows individuals to connect with experienced Ayurvedic doctors for virtual consultations, making expert advice accessible from the comfort of their homes. This accessibility is particularly beneficial for people in remote areas who may not have access to qualified practitioners.

Valued at a market cap of $16.8 billion, The Cooper Companies, Inc. COO is a specialty medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets contact lens wearers. The San Ramon, California-based company's products are primarily designed for solving vision challenges like astigmatism, presbyopia and ocular dryness. 

Companies valued at $10 billion or more are typically classified as “large-cap stocks,” and COO fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the medical instruments & supplies industry. With a strong global presence in over 100 countries, the company benefits from steady demand and a recession-resistant business model. It drives growth through continuous innovation and strategic acquisitions, expanding its product portfolio and market reach. 

Despite its notable strength, this vision care company has slipped 25.2% from its 52-week high of $112.38, reached on Sep. 16, 2024. Moreover, it has declined 9.4% over the past three months, considerably lagging behind the broader Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's XLV 5.6% gain over the same time frame. 

In the longer term, COO has declined 16.3% over the past 52 weeks, underperforming XLV's 1.2% rise over the same time frame. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of COO are down nearly 8.6%, compared to XLV's 7% uptick. 

To confirm its bearish trend, COO has been trading below its 200-day moving average since mid-December, 2024, with slight fluctuations, and has remained below its 50-day moving average since late October, 2024, experiencing some fluctuations. 

On Mar. 6, COO released its Q1 earnings results, leading to a 6.6% drop in its stock price the following day. The decline came as the company reported revenue of $964.7 million, which, despite growing 3.6% year-over-year, fell 1.6% short of analyst expectations. A key factor contributing to this revenue miss was a decline in CooperVision's Asia-Pacific revenue on a reported basis. However, on a positive note, adjusted earnings rose 8.2% year-over-year to $0.92 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $0.91. This earnings beat was supported by an increase in both adjusted gross and operating profit margins, reflecting improved efficiency and cost management.

Looking ahead, for fiscal 2025, the company expects adjusted EPS between $3.94 and $4.02, and anticipates revenue in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, representing organic growth of 6% to 8%. 

The Cooper Companies' underperformance looks even more pronounced when compared to its rival, Alcon Inc. ALC, which gained 10.5% over the past 52 weeks and 8.8% on a YTD basis. 

Despite COO's recent underperformance relative to its broader sector, analysts remain moderately bullish about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from the 16 analysts covering it, and the mean price target of $110.36 suggests an ambitious 31.3% premium to its current levels.

When Jim Blocher got a colonoscopy at the Columbus Free Clinic, his doctor found a polyp the size of a lime.

Blocher, at age 67, was uninsured and decades overdue for a colonoscopy. Despite his age and a family history of cancer, he didn't think about the procedure. He'd only come into the clinic, which partners with the Ohio State University as part of the Charitable Healthcare Network, to continue some medication. Once there, a provider asked whether he'd received a colonoscopy yet.

""Well, if it's free, you know, it can't hurt,"" Blocher said.

When he agreed to one in 2022, at no cost to himself, they found the polyps in his system, including the lime-sized one, were precancerous.

Without that provider and the clinic's No Cost Colonoscopy program, where uninsured and other in-need patients pay nothing for the expensive but necessary procedure, Blocher could have fallen to the same fate as many of his family members and died of cancer.

Colon cancer is the third leading cancer in both men and women in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society.

""That, in and of itself, is a call to action for us to educate our patients as to why this is important to do, because it's not something that is readily apparent until it's too late,"" said Matthew Yoder, one of the many OSU medical students that help run Columbus Free Clinic.

The clinic has performed 134 colonoscopies since its inception in 2022, and removed nearly 250 polyps. Roughly 70% of the patients who have received colonoscopies through the program had polyps of some kind. Once removed, the clinic found that approximately 50% of those polyps were precancerous.

""We stopped cancer in 50% of those patients, which is wild,"" Yoder said. ""It just continues to show us the importance of why we need to tell our patients you need to get screened in one way or another.""

But there are many barriers, especially for the population the free clinic primarily serves, including transportation and supplies for the bowel cleanse prior to a colonoscopy. The clinic does their best to take care of that, providing transportation to appointments, reminder calls and drinking water for the bowel preparation before the colonoscopy.

If patients are interested in getting a colonoscopy this Saturday, March 29, you'll need a referral from the Columbus Free Clinic or another clinic within the Charitable Healthcare Network to the colonoscopy program.

A volunteer will reach out to you if you've been referred, and if you're eligible, you'll be set up with an appointment on the Thursday before the colonoscopy, where you'll receive bowel preparation medications. You can speak directly with a gastroenterologist about the bowel prep process before your Saturday procedure.

You can call 614-259-7707 for more information on the colonoscopy clinic.

""It's a program that can really benefit people,"" said Blocher, who is a staunch advocate for the clinic more than two years later. ""Better safe than sorry.""

If you're interested in donating to Columbus Free Clinic, you can find more information here.

SingHealth has established a new joint centre with Duke–NUS Medical School that focuses on research, education, and commercialisation of AI in healthcare.

The newly launched Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Institute (AIMI) under the SingHealth Duke–NUS Academic Medical Centre aims, among other things, to empower healthcare professionals to develop and apply AI-driven solutions.

One of the institute's focus areas is promoting bench-to-bedside AI research by providing access to resources, grants and local and global expertise in healthcare AI. 

It will also support AI governance efforts to regulate the use of AI in the health ecosystem and push for ethical treatment of healthcare data. 

AIMI will also back the commercialisation and licensing of AI innovation and spin-off of AI-driven startups and foster local and global collaborations.  

Furthermore, AIMI will provide training programmes, mentorships, and conferences to promote the education of healthcare professionals and the public on health AI. As part of this, the institute is set to launch its first online training series providing foundational insights into the unique considerations and applications of AI in healthcare.

""Beyond technology, we aim to cultivate future leaders who will drive AI advancements through strategic collaborations and education,"" Liu Nan, Duke–NUS Medical School associate professor and co-director of AIMI.

THE LARGER TREND

Just last month February, SingHealth entered into a new memorandum of understanding with Royal Philips for a range of AI integrations. They will work together on three major projects: embedding AI in digital image workflows, next-generation data analytics, and AI-driven smart ICU. 

Alongside launching AIMI, SingHealth also announced its two-year partnership with the United States-based Coalition for Health AI (CHAI), a non-profit promoting guidelines and best practices for responsible AI use in healthcare. 

A first international collaboration for CHAI, the partnership with SingHealth will develop AI guidelines, white papers, publications and policy recommendations featuring global best practices and regulatory insights ""to strengthen governance around AI use in Singapore's healthcare system.""

The partners will also collaborate to create educational materials and set up workshops to enhance AI literacy and responsible AI use among clinicians, developers, and consumers. 

Additionally, they are expected to host a global summit in Singapore, gathering key stakeholders to discuss AI governance, ethics, and implementation.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., developing innovative therapies for patients suffering with diseases caused by insulin resistance, including obesity/overweight and type 2 diabetes (T2D), today announced that its executives will be speaking at the following upcoming healthcare conferences:

1. https://www.cooley.com/events/2025/2025-03-27-medinvest-biotech-pharma-investor-conference2. https://glp-1-based-therapeutics.com

About CiriusCirius is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for patients suffering with diseases caused by insulin resistance, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity/overweight. Its lead product candidate, azemiglitazone potassium (0602K), is a potential best-in-class small molecule being developed as a once-daily oral therapy designed to selectively inhibit the mitochondrial target MPC, which plays a central role in selecting mitochondrial energy substrates. MPC Inhibition reprograms mitochondrial metabolism, reducing insulin resistance in cells and organs throughout the body. This markedly improves glycemic control in T2D, body composition in obesity, liver function and fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and outcomes in cardiometabolic disorders.

About Azemiglitazone Potassium (0602K)Azemiglitazone potassium has completed 7 US clinical trials including a 52-week placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in subjects with MASH with and without T2D, and a 28-day placebo-controlled Phase 2a study in subjects with T2D. In those clinical studies it markedly lowered HbA1c and insulin levels, and reduced liver injury and MASH – including on top of existing GLP-1 therapy.  Preclinical studies also demonstrate increased lean muscle mass and function, together with marked metabolically beneficial shifts in adipose tissue phenotype (""bad fat"" to ""good fat""), including increased brown adipose tissue (""brown fat""). Selectively targeting MPC – while avoiding PPARg activation – 0602K harnesses the real-world proven efficacy of 1st generation insulin sensitizers, such as pioglitazone, but without their side effect concerns. Directly correcting a major underlying pathophysiology of chronic metabolic disease, 0602K has the potential to become a cornerstone of therapy.  Coupling this potent pharmacology with that of the GLP-1s could particularly benefit patients with T2D, obesity/overweight and other diseases.

La plateforme maintient un taux d'utilisation actif hebdomadaire de 86% et a des partenariats avec des leaders de l'industrie, notamment agilon health, InnovaCare Health, Millennium Physician Group et Privia Health. Navina a récemment été reconnue comme Best in KLAS 2025 pour le flux de travail numérique des cliniciens.

Le financement sera utilisé pour accélérer l'expansion de Navina sur le marché de la santé américain, améliorer sa technologie IA propriétaire et améliorer les résultats pour les patients grâce à une intelligence clinique proactive dans les interactions en ambulatoire.

Navina, ein führendes Unternehmen im Bereich KI-gestützter klinischer Intelligenz, hat eine Finanzierungsrunde der Serie C in Höhe von 55 Millionen Dollar gesichert, die von Growth Equity der Goldman Sachs Alternatives geleitet wurde, wodurch die Gesamtfinanzierung auf 100 Millionen Dollar ansteigt. Die KI-Plattform des Unternehmens bedient derzeit über 10.000 Gesundheitsfachkräfte in 1.300 Kliniken und unterstützt die Versorgung von mehr als drei Millionen Patienten.

Die Plattform hat eine wöchentliche aktive Nutzungsrate von 86% und hat Partnerschaften mit Branchenführern wie agilon health, InnovaCare Health, Millennium Physician Group und Privia Health. Navina wurde kürzlich als Best in KLAS 2025 für den digitalen Workflow von Kliniken ausgezeichnet.

Die Finanzierung wird verwendet, um die Expansion von Navina auf dem US-Gesundheitsmarkt zu beschleunigen, die proprietäre KI-Technologie zu verbessern und die Patientenergebnisse durch proaktive klinische Intelligenz in der ambulanten Versorgung zu optimieren.

Goldman Sachs Alternatives' Growth Equity division is leading a $55 million Series C funding round in Navina, an AI-powered clinical intelligence platform, bringing the company's total funding to $100 million. While this investment demonstrates GS's continued execution of its alternative investment strategy, the amount represents a minuscule fraction of Goldman's $180.4 billion market capitalization.

This investment aligns with Goldman's strategic expansion into growth-stage technology companies, particularly those positioned at the intersection of AI and healthcare transformation. Navina has established meaningful market traction with 10,000+ healthcare professionals across 1,300 clinics and relationships with notable healthcare organizations.

For Goldman Sachs, this represents business-as-usual activity for its Alternatives division, which encompasses private equity, growth equity, and venture investments. The deal size isn't material enough to impact GS's financial performance or stock valuation, but it does reflect the firm's ongoing diversification beyond traditional investment banking.

The healthcare AI sector offers substantial growth potential as the U.S. healthcare system transitions toward value-based care models that prioritize outcomes over volume. Goldman's participation signals institutional confidence in both Navina's technology and the broader market opportunity, though returns will materialize only over a multi-year horizon typical of growth equity investments.

Investment will fuel the advancement of its AI-powered clinical intelligence platform, transforming patient care and value-based care outcomes 

NEW YORK, March 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Navina, a market leader in AI-powered clinical intelligence, today announced the successful completion of a $55 million Series C funding round, bringing the total funding to $100 million. The round is led by Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, with participation from existing investors, including Vertex Ventures Israel, Grove Ventures and ALIVE.







This significant investment will accelerate Navina's expansion across the U.S. healthcare market, enhance its proprietary AI technology, and further drive improvements in patient outcomes by bringing proactive clinical intelligence to every outpatient interaction.

""This investment is a powerful validation of Navina's vision to improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics by breaking down data barriers with AI,"" said Ronen Lavi, co-founder and CEO of Navina. ""We're thrilled to partner with a best-in-class firm like Goldman Sachs, whose market leadership will be instrumental as we enter this pivotal growth phase and expand our market reach. With this additional capital, we will continue to accelerate AI innovation and revolutionize healthcare by making every patient interaction more empathic, personalized, and proactive.""

Navina's AI copilot has rapidly established itself as the trusted solution for value-based care organizations, beginning with primary care and expanding to broader healthcare segments. The platform serves over 10,000 healthcare professionals across 1,300 clinics and supports the care of more than three million patients. The company has already secured partnerships with industry leaders including agilon health, InnovaCare Health, Millennium Physician Group, and Privia Health, and was recently recognized as Best in KLAS 2025 for Clinician Digital Workflow, further validating its exceptional customer satisfaction and trust.

""AI is rapidly transforming modern healthcare, and Navina stands at the forefront of that transformation – delivering real, measurable value to thousands of clinicians,"" said Irit Kahan, Managing Director in Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. ""Their deep integration into clinical workflows, unparalleled provider trust, and demonstrated ROI make them uniquely positioned to drive meaningful impact across the healthcare ecosystem. We believe Navina's AI-powered platform is a game-changer, and we are excited to support their next stage of growth.""

As healthcare continues to transition toward value-based care, the need for accurate and timely clinical intelligence has become more critical than ever. Yet fragmented data, inefficient manual workflows, and growing administrative burdens make it difficult for clinicians to deliver proactive, preventive patient care, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and high cost of care.

Navina equips clinicians and care teams with real-time, data-driven insights that improve the quality of care and financial outcomes. Navina's AI copilot surfaces clinical insights that support effective decision-making throughout the care continuum–from the back office to the point of care–while significantly reducing the administrative burden. Navina natively integrates into the clinician workflow, and maintains an impressive 86% weekly active usage rate and high trust in its AI recommendations within daily practice.

With this funding, Navina will accelerate the development of its proprietary AI to ultimately become the definitive source of unified patient data that improves efficiency and care quality across the ecosystem from payers to providers. The company will expand its platform capabilities to further automate and optimize workflows from proactive population health management to effective point-of-care intervention.

About Navina

Navina's AI copilot brings clinical intelligence to clinicians and care teams, transforming care and value-based outcomes. Navina's powerful AI turns fragmented patient data into a concise patient profile with actionable insights at every clinical touchpoint.

Sustainability initiative Better Cotton has embarked on a two-year pilot project in Côte d'Ivoire aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for farmers while strengthening cotton supply chains.

Sustainability initiative Better Cotton has embarked on a two-year pilot project in Côte d'Ivoire aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility for farmers while strengthening cotton supply chains.

This initiative is set to develop a health programme specifically designed to serve the needs of approximately 8,000 local residents initially.

In Côte d'Ivoire, nearly half of the populace endures living beneath the poverty threshold and health indicators rank among the poorest in West Africa.

Despite the Côte d'Ivoire government's endorsement of a comprehensive social protection strategy and the enactment of a Universal Health Coverage law in 2019, which requires citizens to enrol, participation rates remain low.

As of 2024, only 27% of the population has registered for the programme, with a mere 5% actively utilizing the health care services offered by this system.

With this project, Better Cotton aspires to establish a scalable model that could benefit underserved populations worldwide.

Better Cotton smallholder livelihoods manager Maria Kjaer said: “Farmer health and well-being are essential to supporting sustainable agriculture. We have the opportunity to remove healthcare barriers for farming communities to create a real, positive impact.”

The initiative has received financial backing from Better Cotton, ISEAL, and Olam Agri. Its execution is facilitated by the financial assistance provided through the ISEAL Innovations Fund. This fund garners support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the UK Aid from the British government.

For the project, Better Cotton has collaborated with SECO, an Olam Agri subsidiary, and Elucid, a social enterprise to develop an ecosystem that improves health which reducing costs.

Elucid's digital healthcare platform will be deployed across select farming regions in Côte d'Ivoire.

This platform will register cotton farmers and link them with local accredited healthcare providers while facilitating secure payments and gathering user feedback to enhance service offerings, notes Better Cotton.

Elucid managing director and co-founder Samuel Knauss said: “With this project, we are bringing our healthcare model to cotton farmers by strengthening the capacity of agricultural producer organisations. This will ensure that farmers can access essential and emergency care without financial hardship. Building on our success in the cocoa and coffee sectors, we aim to show that investing in healthcare not only improves farmer well-being but also strengthens cotton supply chains and creates lasting impact for communities.”

The partnership will involve agricultural producer organisations (APOs) to promote local engagement with the platform, monitor its usage effectively, and ensure it addresses pertinent issues faced by the community.

The project's success is expected to expand social protection coverage for farmer households, eliminate healthcare access barriers, and pave the way for continued investment in these services even after the project concludes.

SECO vice president and managing director Jean-François Touré said: “This project shall serve as a reference for the industry, particularly as Côte d'Ivoire advances the implementation of its Universal Health Coverage programme. Through this partnership with Better Cotton and Elucid, we aim to create a lasting, scalable impact for farming communities.”

Better Cotton's initiative not only seeks to offer valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices but also aims to provide data on the relationship between health outcomes and farmer incomes, potentially informing similar efforts across various commodities and regions.

Last month, Better Cotton completed its evolution into a certification scheme with the aim of upholding stringent sustainability and transparency protocols across the cotton sector.

Aurora Public Schools is partnering with Community College of Aurora to launch the state's first health science high school. Aurora voters approved a bond in 2024 that will fund the project. The school will prepare students for careers in health care and address the growing demand for health care workers.

The magnet school, which doesn't have a name yet, will give students a head start in the workforce by offering hands-on experiences and college-level courses. Lisa Adams, Ed.D., the director of Career and Technical Education (CTE) at APS, says this health science high school is the first of its kind in Colorado.

The program is especially important now, as the health care sector continues to face challenges related to workforce shortages, particularly after the pandemic.

""There are about 50,000 health care worker positions available right now, including a deficit of 10,000 registered nurses,"" Adams explained. ""This school is part of our effort to bridge that gap.""

The school's curriculum will provide students with the opportunity to explore various health care fields before they graduate. Programs offered will include nursing, behavioral health, medical imaging (X-ray focus), respiratory therapy and surgical technology.

""We are really excited about this project because we understand that students are asking for more hands-on learning, particularly in health care,"" Adams explained. ""What could be better than upskilling our students, preparing our students for their future, but also upskilling the community?""

Each pathway is built to include concurrent enrollment in college-level courses through a partnership with the Community College of Aurora (CCA). Students will have the chance to earn college credits and industry certifications that are stackable and transferable to further education or immediate employment.

Through collaboration with UCHealth, students will receive hands-on training in these fields.

David Mafe, chief diversity officer and vice president of human resources at UCHealth, says this approach will prepare students for health care fields that serve Aurora and its surrounding communities.

""Students will not just learn the theory behind health care, they will have the chance to work directly with medical professionals in real-world environments, including simulation labs and clinical settings,"" Mafe explained.

The school will be located near North Middle School. Its proximity to UCHealth will allow students to gain experience through onsite opportunities.

Students who complete the program may have the opportunity to work for UCHealth, where they could benefit from the Ascend program, a debt-free education program that helps employees continue their education while working in health care.

Once fully operational, the school is expected to graduate around 120 students annually, offering the community a steady pipeline of qualified, industry-ready workers.

The health science high school is set to open in 2027.    

""Our hope is to be able to hire as many of them as we possibly can,"" Mafe said. ""We need workforce pipelines. We need people who are excited about this work, and this is exactly the demographic that we need in our organization.""

Boise State star Ashton Jeanty talks to Fox News Digital about his experience with name, image and likeness while dominating the football field.

Former NFL star J.J. Watt called out the NCAA on Monday for referring to collegiate athletes as students first.

Watt, in a post on X, pointed to the money the organization makes, the advent of name, image and likeness (NIL), the transfer portal and the cross-country travel teams have to make.

""At some point the NCAA needs to drop the ‘student first, athlete second' charade,"" the former Wisconsin Badgers star wrote. ""Billions of dollars, NIL, transfer portal (free agency), traveling cross-country for midweek games…

""Education is not the main focus. Admit it and call it what it is. A business. Run it as such.""

When one X user noticed that Watt's point seemed to only refer to the best players in the best programs, Watt agreed.

""That's exactly my point,"" Watt added. ""We've got kids who aren't ‘making money' and will never go pro, yet they are traveling across the country midweek for ‘conference games,' transferring schools, sacrificing studies for sport, etc. None of this is about what's doing best for the student.""

Many college coaches in the NCAA ranks have echoed Watt's point.

Former Alabama Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban ripped the treatment of NIL in college sports in February 2024.

""What we have now is not college football -- not college football as we know it. You hear somebody use the word 'student-athlete.' That doesn't exist,"" Saban said in an interview with ESPN.

He added that collectives in college sports had ""nothing to do with name, image and likeness.""

""Just like an NFL player has a contract or a coach has a contract, something in place, so you don't have all this raiding of rosters and mass movement,"" he said. ""I wonder what fans are going to say when they don't even know the team from year to year because there's no development of teams, just bringing in new players every year.""

Follow:


            CNN Sports' Amanda Davies was crowned Broadcast Journalist of the Year at the SJA British Sports Journalism Awards on Monday.
    


            Davies was up against the BBC's Dan Roan, Sky Sports' Patrick Davison, Sky News' Rob Harris, Amazon Prime's Alex Aljoe and Sky Sports News' Craig Slater.
    


            Afterwards, Davies called the winning of the award “really, really special.”
    


            “People say: ‘Oh, awards don't matter until you win them.' But it is,” Davies told the SJA. “I said it in (the awards hall), the only job I wanted in the world, as well as being mom to my daughter Molly, is to do what I do and to be given the platform I'm given to do the job I do and, hopefully, make a little bit of difference and tell the stories that matter.
    


            “And then to be recognized for that after 25 years in the industry, it's amazing.”
    


            The SJA adjudged that Davies' entry “demonstrated remarkable versatility, underpinned by one constant – a sharp instinct for news.”
    


            “Whether anchoring in the studio, reporting from the heart of a war zone, or commanding the stage at a high-profile awards ceremony, she exemplifies fearless journalism,” it said. “She never shies away from asking the tough questions, balancing unrelenting professionalism with an innate ability to connect with people. Her tenacity, poise, and dedication to uncovering the truth ensure she delivers compelling stories every time.”
    


            Davies' submission included a mix of exclusive interviews and breaking news stories from across the globe.
    


            That included breaking the news of World Athletics president Seb Coe's visit to Ukraine – featuring exclusive access to travel alongside Coe to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – as well as being the only person to speak with soccer star Kylian Mbappé when he left Paris Saint-Germain.
    


            Davies also reported two headline-making news lines from Cristiano Ronaldo – his belief that the Saudi league is better than France's Ligue 1 and his plans to go into club ownership – while tennis legend Serena Williams revealed her big plans for the WNBA.
    


            “When the big names made news in 2024 – it was Amanda they trusted,” Davies' submission said.
    


            CNN Sports was also nominated in two other categories at this year's SJA Awards, which recognize the best contributors to the UK's sports journalism industry.
    


            World Sport – CNN's daily sports show co-hosted by Davies – came third in the best television show category, with Sky Sports News' Deadline Day finishing first. CNN was also nominated in the Television Live Event Coverage category for its coverage of the Paris Olympics.

Digital Media Coordinator

CBS Sports' top 10 offseason moves (so far)

The start of free agency two weeks ago led to a flurry of moves.

Only 20 players remain available from NFL.com's list of the top 101 free agents. The Giants agreed to several players from NFL.com's list, including cornerback Paulson Adebo, who was one of the first players the team reportedly agreed to a deal with once the negotiating period opened on March 10.

CBS Sports' Cody Benjamin recently broke down the top 10 offseason moves so far, which featured the Giants' signing of Adebo at No. 4.

""Despite missing 10 games in his final season with the New Orleans Saints, Adebo has totaled seven picks and 28 pass breakups since 2023 alone,"" wrote Benjamin. ""Ranked 16th among all cornerbacks in forced incompletions since 2021, per PFF, he could be a lockdown No. 1.""

Adebo has started 51 of 52 games over the last four seasons for the Saints. He registered a total of 10 interceptions and 43 passes defensed during his time in New Orleans, which led to the 25-year-old developing the reputation of being a ballhawk.

The 6-foot-1, 192-pound corner has at least three interceptions in three of his four seasons, and those impressive stats since 2023 that Benjamin noted above (seven INT, 28 PD) came in only 22 games.

He was able to rack up three takeaways in just seven games last season before a broken leg cut his season short, while his 18 pass breakups in 2023 were the third-most in the league.

Here are CBS Sports' top 5 offseason moves so far:

Altoona's Joseph Speece (right) is congratulated by teammate Eric McAllister after scoring a run.

STATE COLLEGE — Altoona has the potential to have a special high school baseball season this year, but Monday afternoon during a cold, windy game against rival State College, the Mountain Lions proved there's a thin line between winning and losing.

And a lot of it has to do with finding the strike zone.

Altoona took advantage of some timely hitting and four walks by State College starter Cody Norman to take a six-run lead through the first two innings, but the Mountain Lions gave it all back plus one when their pitchers struggled to get the ball across the plate in a 7-6 setback.

“We can't walk eight guys in the third and fourth inning,” Altoona coach Tom Smith said. “That was probably the most disappointing part where we walked eight guys in those innings. You're not going to win many games if you walk eight guys and hit a guy over two innings, and it cost us today.”

Of the seven runs State College scored, five of those batters who eventually scored reached base by a walk and one other reached after being hit by a pitch.

All of a sudden, a team that looked like it was about to improve to 2-0 and make a statement against its top rival was on the losing end. It begs the question whether Altoona's season will turn out more like the team that played the first two innings or the team that played the final five.

“We're probably somewhere in between,” Smith said. “In order for us to be successful against any team, you have to be able to throw strikes. You have a six-run lead, and just too many walks. We also didn't add on. Their second pitcher came in there and totally dominated us to the point that we struggled to get a baserunner against him.”

Aaron Smearman led off the top of the first inning with a walk and scored on Dante LaRocco's double. LaRocco, a junior, went to third on an error and scored on a wild pitch to put Altoona ahead 2-0 after an inning.

LaRocco suffered a serious injury prior to basketball season but has worked his way back in time for baseball season, a sport in which he had an excellent year as a sophomore.

“It feels great to be back out here with my teammates,” LaRocco said. “There's no better feeling than being out here with them. We want to be as good as we can be and win as many games as we can.”

LaRocco was part of the action in the second inning as well.

Noah Staines drew a walk to lead off the inning and was erased on a fielder's choice. Will Sankey and Smearman walked with two outs to load the bases, and LaRocco drove home a run on an infield single.

Junior Tanner Stroup, a West Virginia commit, emptied the bases with a three-run double that made it 6-0 in favor of Altoona.

But State College brought in relief pitcher Jude Scavone, and the momentum started to shift toward the Little Lions. Scavone stranded Stroup and allowed just one hit — a Nick Kraft single — over the next three innings.

“I don't know if we had a hit after the second inning to be honest,” Smith said. “If we did, we might have had one.”

State College scored twice in the bottom of the third, first on a sacrifice fly by Jack Coleman and then on a bases-loaded walk by Austin Herncane that ended starter Smearman's day on the mound.

Four of the first five batters for the Little Lions reached on walks to begin the bottom of the fourth inning, and all four scored. The big blow came from Ryden Walker, who had a two-run single and eventually scored the go-ahead run on an error the the bases loaded and two outs.

“I'm proud of the boys, because it communicated to me here in our first game the type of team we have,” State College coach David Williams said. “We have been preaching the Philadelphia Eagles quote that you can't be great without the greatness of others, and obviously they are receiving that message. They are supporting each other and working hard. They have each other's backs. That's the type of team we have, and we're going to need that to get through our Mid-Penn schedule.”

Altoona managed just one baserunner against State College closer Sebastian Rhoades, who pitched the final two innings to earn the save.

“This is Sebastian's third year in varsity,” Williams said. “He's been playing at a high level since his 10th-grade year. I have all the trust in him. Jude came in and kept their offense at bay to help us get back into the game, and Sebastain came in and threw at a high level. I'm really proud of our boys.”

Altoona's game played out almost the opposite as its first when it scored five runs late to rally for a 7-4 victory.

“It's the second game of the year,” Smith said. “It's very early, but there's no freebies in this league. We need to play a complete game. That's what we're looking for. It's the second game in. You take the good and bad and try to increase the good and minimize the bad, but we need to play a complete game. It's the only way we're going to be successful.”

A year ago, Altoona won both regular season games against State College and lost against the Little Lions in the District 6 playoffs. The Mountain Lions have confidence they can turn that around this season.

“We're definitely more like the team that started the game,” LaRocco said. “We got a little comfortable, but I'm not worried about it. We'll be back.”

Dave Barnett learned plenty listening to and watching legendary sports broadcaster Bill Mercer over the years that helped change his life — at least after a bit of a tough start.

Like a lot of boys growing up in the 1970s and '80s, Barnett, the voice of North Texas athletics, loved to watch Mercer call World Class Championship Wrestling.



“My brother and I would try out the wrestling moves that we would learn watching Fritz Von Erich, Killer Karl Kox and Skandor Akbar,” Barnett recalled this week. “Mom didn't like us wrestling on her floor while watching Bill Mercer.”

Memories of Mercer came flooding back for a host of influential broadcasters and media members following his death Saturday at the age of 99.

Those family wrestling matches in the Barnett family home might have been the only time Mercer led one of them astray during a wide-ranging career in sports media, news and teaching.

Mercer covered the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, worked the Texas Rangers' inaugural season in 1972 and also covered the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Texans of the American Football League and Chicago White Sox as well as Southwest Conference football and basketball games. He was also the voice of North Texas athletics.

Mercer was the soundtrack for generations of sports fans, who watched him cover a wide variety of events with the skill and care that made him widely respected in the media business.

“You'd be hard-pressed to find a broadcaster who had a career like Bill did,” said Ted Emrich, who studied under Mercer and now calls games for ESPN. “He called so many sports, had a background in news and a legacy of mentorship. He was so influential.”

Mercer was a prominent wrestling announcer in the 1950s in Muskogee, Oklahoma, before moving Dallas.

The number of landmark moments he covered after landing in Dallas are almost too many to count.

Mercer told Lee Harvey Oswald that he had been charged with killing Kennedy in a media scrum in 1963. He also called UNT's games when Abner Haynes and Leon King became the first Black athletes to play college football in Texas in 1956.

Mercer's time calling World Class Championship Wrestling certainly wasn't as serious as some of the events he covered during his time in news, and even college and pro sports, but it made him a prominent figure across the world.

Those experiences were a precursor to Mercer's time teaching at UNT that spanned 35 years. Mercer's former students who went on to work in the media are often referred to as the “Mercer Mafia.”



“Bill's impact as a teacher is far more widespread than what he did as a broadcaster even with his reach in wrestling circles,” said Craig Way, one of Mercer's former students. “He was voted the fourth most popular [TV personality] in a survey in Israel in the 1980s behind the Von Erichs, but his impact went far beyond what he did on TV and radio because of the way he developed students into becoming better broadcasters and better people.”

Mercer's former students say they marvel at the way he imparted the knowledge he gained through the years. Way was taken aback by how Mercer could boil down the key aspects of calling games to the basics that he would outline on a chalkboard in the days before PowerPoint.

“I can't speak for other individuals at North Texas, but I feel pretty strongly that they would all concur that we would not be where we are today in our respective careers in sports media without Bill's guidance, teaching and mentorship,” said Mark Followill, the longtime television play-by-play voice of the Dallas Mavericks. “We learned so much from him. He was an incredible teacher and had an understanding of the craft of sports media, particularly sports play-by-play.

“He had a craft for teaching it.”

Mercer would send his students out to call games from the stands with fans all around them and ask them to come back with a recording of them calling the action. He believed if his students could tackle those tough environments, they could handle being in a press box or sitting courtside.

“You would turn it in, and the next week you would have several sheets from his legal pad with his notes in red pen on voice quality and if you're giving the time and score enough,” Emrich said. “He knew what made for a great broadcast and how to communicate that to all of us.”

Those critiques didn't stop when Mercer's students left UNT.

Way still had Mercer listen to his broadcasts over the years.

“It was like a golfer going to a swing coach,” Way said. “You need someone to listen with a critical ear and give you the guidance you need. Most of the time, he would say, ‘I don't know why I'm doing this. You sound great, but you might want to do this or that.' He gave me great guidance for decades beyond when I took his classes in 1982, '83 and '84.”

Mercer taught well beyond retirement age and remained in close contact with his former students. He enjoyed talking about his time serving in Navy in World War II and about how they were faring in their broadcasting careers.

Way is convinced that Mercer could have stepped in for a short time to broadcast a game at 99. Mercer swapped emails with his former students up until a few months ago.

Barnett was among Mercer's former students who stayed in contact decades after his mother banned him from flipping the television to wrestling in the living room.

“I never saw Bill in a bad mood,” Barnett said. “I visited him last summer, and he hadn't lost a thing mentally. He remembered incredible details about his life. That was a blessing. I'm glad we had Bill for as long as we did.”","{'href': 'https://www.keranews.org', 'title': 'KERA News'}"

West Virginia's JJ Quinerly (11) attempts to shoot as North Carolina's Lexi Donarski (20) defends during the second half in the second round of the NCAA college basketball tournament in Chapel Hill, N.C., Monday, March 24, 2025.

MORGANTOWN — With the shrill shriek of a referee's whistle reverberating in her ears; with the muffled clank of a basketball bouncing off the rim, JJ Quinerly's storied career at West Virginia came to a storybook ending on Monday night in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Unfortunately, it was a horror story that had to come from the typewriter of Stephen King as the Mountaineers were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament, 58-47, by a North Carolina basketball team that received a 21-point performance from Alyssa Ustby to advance to the Sweet 16.

Quinerly spent her four years at WVU playing for three different coaches, winding up the third all-time leading scorer in the program's history with 2,016 points. Unfortunately, only 8 of them came in this frustrating game in which she went just 2 for 12 shooting as she was handcuffed by an unrelentingly strong Tar Heels defense and by the foul police in striped shirts who managed to call three fouls on her within 10 seconds on the court in the second half.

So frustrated was she that very late in the game, as shots by her and her teammates went everywhere but in and when the endless tweets were from whistles, not social media post, she took her fist and slammed a bouncing basketball into the floor.

This game will never erase the legacy she left as she accomplished almost everything she set out to accomplish.

“I wanted to be remembered as one of best guards ever to play at WVU. I think I left like a legacy here and I left the program better than it was when I came in,” she said.

One cannot blame the officials for the 22 fouls they called on the Mountaineers, as they called 20 on Carolina, but it was how the fouls were distributed as they fouled out Kylee Blacksten and Jordan Thomas and put Quinerly on ice with her four fouls while not one Caroline player was ever in any real foul trouble, even though four of them wound up with three fouls.

“There wasn't a lot of flow to that game. I don't think it necessarily went our way. It was on someone else's floor. I don't think it had anything to do with the outcome,” Coach Mark Kellogg said..

For most of the game WVU threatened their own team record for fewest points in an NCAA tournament game, which was 43 scored against LSU in 2007. A late free throw and a last-second 3 from Sydney Shaw took the Mountaineers past the infamous record.

Shaw's 3 also saved face for the Mountaineers as it was their second of the game in 21 tries, while an inglorious 9.5% performance from beyond the arc, it was better than the 8.3% they managed in that LSU game, which is 8.3%.

The Mountaineers also contributed to their own demise by turning the ball over 16 times, and one night after scoring 28 points off turnovers against Columbia they could get just 11 off 17 turnovers they forced from Carolina and 2 points the whole game on fast breaks.

“I thought it might be a game a little bit like that, to be honest,” Kellogg said. “It was two elite defensive teams. I thought it might be a little bit of a slugfest. I certainly thought we had a better offensive performance in us, and it wasn't our night on the offensive end. Certainly they had a lot to do with that.

It was a dreadful performance from the onset as Quinerly missed her first two shots, didn't get her first of two baskets in the game until 2:41 was left in the half and WVU fell behind, 6-0.

In a sloppy first quarter, they rallied for the final eight points to go into a 12-12 tie as the second quarter began.

It was little different in the second quarter as WVU managed just two baskets out of 11 shots but again somehow hung close, entering halftime down just 24-21.

Then, midway through the third quarter they caught fire and rushed to a 35-33 lead with 3:02 left in the half.

Was this spurt they had been waiting for?

Hardly.

North Carolina, with Utsey showing the way, scored 16 of the next 19 points with Quinerly on the bench trying to nurse her foul situation.

At that point North Carolina had an 11-point lead at 49-38 and the way WVU was shooting they could have played until next Monday without catching up.

“They scored 58 points. I don't think it was our defense. It was our offense,” Kellogg said. “We shot 24 percent. What did we shoot, 24? We shot 24 percent and 9.5 percent from the 3. It's going to be hard to win when you score 47 points.

“We can win games holding teams to 58. I thought our effort on the defensive end was really good,” the coach continued. “I thought we competed. I thought we held them down long enough to see if we could make a run. We never made any runs. I don't know the kills and the stops, but when we hold somebody to 58, there's going to be some pretty good defensive possessions.”

It was what has come to be a typical second round game in the NCAA Tournament for WVU, who now is 1-13 in second-round games.

Messenger photo by Britt Kudla: St. Edmond's Grant Galles competes during last year's state meet. Galles is back for his junior season.

St. Edmond head boys track and field coach Donn Larson will need to be a little more selective with where he places his athletes this spring.

With a roster consisting of just 17 athletes, Larson knows that the Gaels will not be in many team races. Instead, the focus is on individuals and forming the right relays to have as many qualifiers as possible come state.

“It's definitely the smallest bunch we've had, as we are usually in the 25 to 30 range,” Larson said. “But we'll focus in on getting as many individuals to state as we can and go from there.

“Once we get going and running, we can see where kids really fit in.”

Juniors Anthony Valles and Grant Galles, who have competed in Des Moines at state each of their first two seasons on the track, return to lead the way. Aaron Hindt, a sophomore, is also back with state experience.

“Anthony is back strong in the 800, 1,600 and 3,200,” Larson said. “And he is a kid I can throw in the distance medley. Aaron is going to be in the long jump along with the 100, 200 and 400. He's a kid that could probably run the 800 if I asked.

“Grant is just getting back into track shape after basketball season and he'll be a 200 and 400 runner.”

Valles, who was 14th in the 3,200 in Class 1A and 19th in the 1,600 last year, also ran on the sprint medley relay with Galles and Hindt that placed 13th. As a freshman, he was part of the fifth place 4×800 relay.

Galles, coming off a starting role on the St. Edmond basketball team that reached the final four, was on three qualifying relays a season ago after running on one in 2023. 

Both Galles and Hindt were on the 4×200 and 4×400 that reached Drake Stadium a season ago, as the 4×200 finished 18th. As a freshman, Galles ran the lead leg of the 4×400 that also placed 18th.

“We just don't have the amount of runners we need to field strong relays,” Larson said. “It makes it tough but we'll do what we can with who we have out.”

Seniors Levi Odor-Westrum, Logan Reed and Liam Shannon provide more experience. Along with Valles, Odor-Westrum and Shannon ran at state cross country this past fall, with Valles finishing sixth, Shannon 29th and Odor-Westrum 84th. 

Junior Jonah Carlson, along with sophomores Erik Larson and Drake Yurkovac, are also out for track after running at state cross country this past year.

“Liam has a chance to qualify in the 3,200 for state,” Larson said. “It will be our job as coaches to get them in position for the best event possible.”

Rounding out the roster are juniors Kinnick Henning, Jonah Mosier and Jossef Taveras; sophomores Evan Christiansen, Aidan Reel and Abram Ribbens; and freshmen Matthew Crimmins and Thomas Ehn.

Henning was a two-way starter on the football team before suffering a season-ending injury, Christiansen and Ehn were both on the basketball squad and Crimmins qualified for state wrestling.

Larson will be assisted by Cory Naughton and Mike Landwehr this spring.

WATCH: TN Bill would level the playing field for girls' sports in schools 

MEMPHIS, Tenn. - A bill making its way through the Tennessee legislature would ensure female athletes have the same access and opportunities as their male counterparts.

Sen. Raumesh Akbari, of Memphis, introduced the Equal Opportunities for Girls' Sports Act, which would provide state funding for girls' sports programs in public schools.

""Girls' sports are just as important as boys' sports,"" said Akbari. ""We want to give our girls the exact same opportunities to succeed and to achieve on the court and really off the court as well. A lot of times we here in the General Assembly say we've got to protect our girls in sports. And so for us, the main way to protect girls in sports is to make sure that they have access to the same facilities and equipment and resources. Give them the resources so they can succeed.""

Sen. Akbari points to research from the Women's Sports Foundation that shows girls drop out of sports at twice the rate of boys due to a lack of resources, facilities and inadequate coaching support. Nationally, girls have 1.3 million fewer opportunities to play high school sports than boys.

The Tennessee Equal Opportunities for Girls' Sports Act will:

""It has been a long time coming,"" said Kandis Banks, whose daughter plays several sports for Overton High School. ""They should have been, you know, finding the girls' sports because how else would they want them to succeed you know they need the help.""

""I think that's a great amount of encouragement to show that the outside community is looking at them and recognizes them and what they're doing,"" said Ken Wallace, a senior at Overton High School.

Wallace was on the bowling team and took pictures for several sports teams for the school. She says she's always noticed a difference in resources for the girls' and boys' teams.

""I've noticed that, like, the media and the recognition that the boys' sports teams get, it just seems like there's a lack of enthusiasm in general with the women's side,"" said Wallace. ""So I think that also translates over to the funding that they get as well. I've also notice the lack of equipment or the lack of useful and up-to-date equipment is also something that, you know, should be changed.""

The bill also creates a clear process for addressing inequities. Parents can file a complaint with the Department of Education, which will be required to investigate and provide additional funds to fix the issue. And school districts must report participation rates and funding levels to ensure compliance.

""It's great because they finally have a chance to be shown at a equal footing as the other competitors,"" said Wallace. ""I think it's a great opportunity and it just shows more faith and belief in our youth.""

The bill is scheduled to be discussed in a committee on Wednesday. You can read the full text of legislation here.

Crestview junior Addison Rhodes is the Ohio Division V Player of the Year. She is the first Crestview girls basketball player to earn first-team All-Ohio honors. (Morning Journal/Ron Firth)


COLUMBIANA — Crestview junior Addison Rhodes' talent has never been a secret.

After being a second-team All-Ohioan her first two seasons, Rhodes was named the Ohio Division V Player of the Year on Monday.

“We've always known how special she is,” Crestview coach Aaron Blatch said. “Now the rest of the state does too!”

Rhodes becomes the only first-team All-Ohioan for the Rebels' girls basketball program. Chelsea Bowker was a second-team All-Ohioan as a senior in 2009.

“She's certainly deserving,” Blatch said. “She would certainly acknowledge her teammates were a big part of it, too.

“It's great for our team and our program and awesome for her.”

She guided Crestview to a 21-4 season and has a career record of 67-8 with three straight district finals appearances.

Rhodes averaged an area-best 26.1 points a game along with 7.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 3.8 steals and 1.0 blocks. 

“She's such a humble kid,” Blatch said. “We're excited for her. I can confidently say there is nobody in Ohio outworking her. She certainly earned it.”

Rhodes' shooting separates her from the rest. She made school-record 81 three-pointers on the season, while shooting 51.3% from the field, 44.5% from three-point range and 89.3% from the foul line.

Besides her All-Ohio honors this season, Rhodes was the Northeast Inland District Player of the Year, Columbiana County Player of the Year, Mahoning Valley Athletic Conference Player of the Year and Morning Journal All-Area Player of the Year.

Rhodes' career totals through her junior season are 1,687 points, 604 rebounds and 157 three-pointers.

She has six Division I full-ride offers from Youngstown State, Robert Morris, Duquesne, Bowling Green, St. Bonaventure and Toledo, along with one from Division II national power Ashland.

“It's been cool, not just for her, during preseason workouts we had college coaches at the school every day,” Blatch said. “She's going to put the same amount of effort and work whether in an empty gym or in front of a lot of college coaches.”

Rhodes is in her third season playing for a national AAU team out of Pittsburgh.

“That's been a good avenue for playing in front of college coaches,” Blatch said. “She trains every day, between weight room, skill stuff and AAU, once or twice a day all year round.”

Rhodes plans on making a college commitment before her senior season.

“She's going to play out this AAU season and see what happens and then probably make a decision,” Blatch said.

Crestview senior Luvrain Gaskins teamed with Rhodes to give the Rebels a potent one-two punch.

Gaskins received All-Ohio special mention for the third straight year.

She averaged 13.2 points, 10.4 rebounds, 2.8 blocks and 2.0 steals a game. She finished her high school career with 1,362 points and 1,138 rebounds.

Gaskins has accepted a full-tuition scholarship to play basketball for NAIA Bethel University in Indiana.

Columbiana also had two players honored — seniors Ava Heinrich and Ellie Venezia — after a 22-0 regular season and the Eastern Ohio Athletic Conference title.

Heinrich received special mention in Division VI and Venezia honorable mention.

Heinrich topped the Clippers in scoring (13.8), steals (3.5) and three-pointers (58). She shot 48% from the field.

Venezia had an all-around game for the Clippers, averaging 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.3 steals a game. She shot 51% from two-point range.

Also receiving special mention were Salem senior Reese Davidson-Chuck and West Branch sophomore Audrey Eaton in Division IV and Wellsville senior Bella Poppelriter in Division VII.

Davidson-Chuck was the Eastern Buckeye Conference Player of the Year and the Columbiana Classic MVP. She averaged a team-high 13.8 points per game along with 5.3 rebounds, 3.8 steals and 2.3 assists for the 11-win Quakers.

Eaton was one of two returning starters for the Warriors and led them to a 22-3 season and a second straight Eastern Buckeye Conference title. She topped the Warriors in scoring (8.9) and assists (3.3). She also averaged 3.3 rebounds and 2.5 steals a game.

Poppelriter was Wellsville's leading scorer all four years, averaging 19.0 points, 10.0 rebounds and four steals a game this season. The Tigers won 12 games after almost not having enough players for a team. Poppelriter finished her career with 1,429 points (fourth all-time at Wellsville), 708 rebounds, 317 steals and 113 blocks .

Getting honorable mention were East Liverpool senior Kenzie Headley and West Branch junior Tallie Muniz in Division IV.

Headley' play led the Potters to a 10-win season. She averaged 12.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.1 blocks a game.

Muniz was the Warriors inside leader in rebounds (4.7), blocked shots (1.3) and field goal percentage (54%). She was second on the team in scoring (7.0).

From left, Youngstown State's Brady Shannon readies to hit during a game against Milwaukee on March 15 at Eastwood Field, and Shannon passes during a Penguins spring football practice on March 11 at Stambaugh Stadium.

YOUNGSTOWN — When former Ursuline star Brady Shannon was still in high school, he had to make a choice between his two passions. 

Shannon had multiple offers from various schools to play either football or baseball at the collegiate level. Ultimately, he opted to play baseball at Central Florida, and he spent his freshman season playing for the Knights.

But his love for football still lingered in the back of his mind. So much so that he entered the transfer portal in December 2023 with the intent of playing football once again. 

So, Shannon transferred home, landing at Youngstown State to join the football program, where he was one of the Penguins' backup quarterbacks during the 2024 season. 

Then this past winter, after the end of football season, Shannon was given the opportunity to join the YSU baseball team for the 2025 season, allowing him to fulfill his dream of being a dual-sport athlete and play both sports at the Division I level. 

“It's always been a goal of mine to do both,” Shannon said. “I always knew I didn't want to give up baseball. That was something I told myself, giving up baseball was not an option for me because you put so much time into both sports for your whole life, and when you get the opportunity to do both of them, you can't pass it up.”

When Shannon first arrived at YSU last year, he wanted to spend his first season focusing on football and adjusting to the speed of college football after not playing for almost two years. 

But when the opportunity to play baseball presented itself after he had a season of football under his belt, he jumped at the opportunity. 

“I've always wanted to do this and play the two sports I love at a high level, and to do it at YSU is a blessing,” Shannon said. “To have all the people in my corner, the football coaches, the baseball coaches, compliance — if they weren't all a part of it and being understanding and patient with me with all the communication that goes on, I wouldn't be able to do it without them.”

Thus far this spring, Shannon has played in 19 of YSU's 22 games and started 16 of them. He's batting .250 with 10 RBIs and is second on the team with five home runs.

Shannon had a breakout performance for the 4-18 Penguins on March 15 when he had a pair of solo home runs in YSU's 10-7 victory over Milwaukee at Eastwood Field. 

“He brings leadership, he's the ultimate locker room guy. Everybody loves him. He's obviously been part of multiple locker rooms on the football and baseball side and he brings everybody together,” YSU baseball head coach Trevor Charpie said. “He's a hard-nosed kid, so you never have to worry about him being gritty or working hard or playing the game all out. He's always going to do that.

“Brady Shannon is a baller, not only as a baseball player, not only as a football player, but as a human being. He's a great example of what you want in an athlete, and I don't think there could be a better person to represent the Youngstown area.”

After not playing competitive baseball for about a year, it took Shannon some time to get his swing back and get re-adjusted to seeing live pitching. But once he did, he started “hitting the cover off the ball,” according to Charpie. 

“Baseball is one of those sports that you have to consistently get reps in,” Charpie said. “So there was, I wouldn't say a learning curve, but there was a time period where he was getting his swing back in shape. I wasn't just going to give him a starting job. He had to earn that, and he did. He got his opportunity and he made the most of it.”

On the gridiron, Shannon was one of two quarterbacks left on the roster after two transferred out after the end of the 2024 season. 

The Penguins added a pair of freshmen quarterbacks to the roster, but this spring has been an adjustment for both Shannon and returning starter Beau Brungard as YSU brought in new offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich.

With Yurcich's arrival comes a new offense and playbook, which the quarterbacks are learning and YSU has been working to implement during spring practice. 

“It's always an adjustment learning a new playbook, especially once you get that playbook from before installed in your head,” Shannon said. “But it's all about reps, film and getting on board with Coach Yurcich. Obviously you gotta juggle a little bit because there's only so much time in the day with baseball and stuff. But the offense is looking good, it's looking better every day, and I think we're definitely headed in the right direction with that.”

With the NCAA time limitations of 20 hours per week, Shannon has to balance games, practices and workouts between both sports, which makes it harder to pick up the offense having less time on the field than some of his football counterparts. 

“It's not easy,” YSU football head coach Doug Phillips said. “You got new language offensively, new plays, so when you only have maybe five hours of football per week compared to someone else, it's difficult. But we talked about those things in January when he came in and we talked about him having the opportunity to play (baseball) too. So on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he gets as many reps as he can.”

But still, Shannon is making the best of it. He said he's spending a good deal of time on his own learning and repping things so that he doesn't fall behind, whether it's studying plays and film in the baseball team's hotel or on the bus coming home from a road game.

“I gotta take responsibility and teach myself how to do it,” Shannon said. “The coaches do a great job with making sure I'm staying up to speed with everything and not getting behind. It's a lot on the plate, but when it's something you love, you're going to do it. It's not a chore.

“It's been an adjustment, obviously the schedule is really busy being in-season for baseball and then spring football practices. But it's a good busy. I'm doing two things that I love. … I get to go to football practice and I get to play baseball games, it's really the best of both worlds.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — JuJu Watkins was carried off the floor with a season-ending knee injury in the first quarter of top-seeded USC's game against Mississippi State in the NCAA Tournament. Watkins was driving to the basket when she went down with a non-contact injury. She grabbed her right knee with a pained expression on her face. A team spokesperson says Watkins will undergo surgery and then begin rehabilitation. The crowd in Galen Center went silent as coach Lindsay Gottlieb and two other USC staffers attended to Watkins, a 6-foot-2 sophomore who averages 24.6 points and is one of the biggest stars in the women's game.NORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Skylar Vann scored 17 points, Payton Verhulst added 16 and No. 3 seed Oklahoma cruised into the Sweet 16 of the women's NCAA Tournament, dispatching No. 6 seed Iowa 96-62. Raegan Beers had 11 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks in just 18 minutes for the Sooners. Oklahoma coach Jennie Baranczyk beat her alma mater and advanced past the second round for the first time in her four years with the Sooners. Oklahoma will play UConn or South Dakota State on Saturday in Spokane, Washington. Iowa had reached the previous two national title games with Caitlin Clark, who's now in the WNBA.RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Aziaha James scored 26 points and second-seeded N.C. State made an NCAA Tournament program-record 15 shots from 3-point range in an 83-49 victory over seventh-seeded Michigan State in the women's second round. James connected for six 3s and Madison Hayes, who had 17 points, drilled five 3-pointers. Saniya Rivers added 17 points and 11 assists and Zamareya Jones had 12 points for the Wolfpack (28-6). N.C. State will meet either Florida State or LSU in a Sweet 16 matchup Friday in Spokane, Washington. The Wolfpack will be in the Sweet 16 for the sixth time in coach Wes Moore's 12 seasons.AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Madison Booker scored 20 points and No. 1-seed Texas used a smothering defense to earn a 65-48 victory over No. 8 Illinois in the second round of the women's NCAA Tournament. The win sends the Longhorns to the Sweet 16 for the fourth time in the last five seasons. Ndjakalenga Mwenentanda added 19 points for Texas. Texas outscored Illinois 18-6 in the second quarter, then broke the game open at the start of the third when the Longhorns stretched the lead to 24 after steals by Booker and Rori Harmon led to quick baskets. Adalia McKenzie led Illinois with 13 points.MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota has hired Colorado State's Niko Medved as its next coach. The native of the Twin Cities area and former student manager for the Gophers had the Rams within one basket of the Sweet 16. Colorado State hit the 25-win mark and made the NCAA Tournament three times in Medved's seven seasons. He was 143-85 with the Rams for the second-best winning percentage in program history. Medved was the front-runner for the Minnesota job from the start. His predecessor Ben Johnson was fired after going 56-71 overall and 22-57 in the Big Ten Conference over four years on the job.UNDATED (AP) — Ben McCollum, who led Drake's dominating run through the Missouri Valley Conference and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs, is the new head coach at Iowa. Athletic director Beth Goetz announced McCollum's hiring 10 days after she fired Fran McCaffery and two days after McCollum wrapped up a 31-4 season with a second-round loss to Texas Tech. McCollum takes over a program that had its worst season in seven years. The Hawkeyes were 17-16 and tied for 12th in the Big Ten. Terms of McCollum's contract weren't announced.DENVER (AP) — They're playing for more than trips to the Final Four and a chance to cut down nets at March Madness. It's also a chance to see and be seen – by other teams. In yet another sign of the times in college sports, the transfer portal opens Monday, giving basketball players a 30-day window to switch schools. It means some of the 1,000 or so players on the 68 teams that qualified for the NCAA Tournament are playing to win, but also for more money, more playing time, a chance to be seen and potentially set things up for next year.EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Northwestern coach Joe McKeown plans to retire after next season. McKeown has a 777-432 record with 17 NCAA Tournament appearances in 39 years at Northwestern, George Washington and New Mexico State. McKeown says it's “been an honor to be in Evanston for the past 17 years.” McKeown is 268-258 in 17 seasons at Northwestern. The Wildcats reached the NCAA Tournament in 2015 and 2021. McKeown led George Washington to a 441-154 record and 15 NCAA appearances in 19 seasons, with four trips to the Sweet 16 and an Elite Eight appearance in 1997. He coached New Mexico State to a 68-20 mark and two NCAA appearances from 1986 to 1989.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Indiana basketball is in the midst of major changes after the Hoosiers hired former Drake and West Virginia head coach Darian DeVries to fill their Indiana head coaching vacancy. Indiana basketball is one of the most prestigious programs in the country, with five national championships and eight Final Four appearances. West Virginia won 19 games in its first season under DeVries, who will hope for a quick turnaround in Bloomington. Despite Indiana's struggles in recent seasons, its prestige and payroll could lead to a quick turnaround with DeVries at the helm. 

As one of the premier programs in college basketball, DeVries is set to hit the college basketball transfer portal hard in hopes of landing players who can lead the Hoosiers back to prominence. What will the 2025-26 Indiana basketball roster look like, and who will come and go via the Indiana basketball transfer portal? If you love the Hoosiers, or want the latest roster updates and college basketball transfer portal news, be sure to see what the proven team of insiders are saying at Peegs.com, the 247Sports affiliate that covers the Hoosiers. 

Peegs.com's insiders are providing on-the-ground updates on every development surrounding Woodson's exit and the future of the Indiana basketball program, including insights from Trevor Andershock, Jared Kelly and Jeff Rabjohns, all of whom have deep-rooted ties inside the Indiana program. Get all the inside scoop on the basketball program, plus and VIP intel on Indiana football, recruiting and more, as well as access to Peegs.com's VIPs forums, where you can connect with other Indiana fans and insiders.

And right now, Peegs.com is offering 50% off annual subscriptions*, so now is the time to sign up. The team at Peegs.com already has news out on who is coming and going on the Indiana basketball roster. Head to Peegs.com now to see the latest updates.

DeVries didn't take much time adding to the depth of his roster at Indiana. The first move made by DeVries was to sign his son, Tucker, who entered the transfer portal last week with a ""do not contact"" tag. The two-time Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year will follow his dad to Indiana to give the Hoosiers a 6-foot-7 sharpshooter on the wing. 

The senior played the first eight games of the 2024-25 season before suffering a right shoulder injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year. At West Virginia, the younger DeVries was used as a ball-handler, screener, cutter, playmaker, and shooter. He can create a mismatch for opposing defenses with his versatility and knock down shots if opponents do not match up correctly. DeVries is a 36.7% career shooter on 752 three-point attempts, giving the Hoosiers a legitimate threat from the outside. 

Meanwhile, redshirt freshman guard Jakai Newton is the latest Indiana player to enter the transfer portal. A four-star prospect in the 2023 class, Newton only played in four games in his two years at Indiana due to injuries. Newton is one of four Indiana players in the transfer portal, joining Malik Reneau, Mackenzie Mgbako, and Gabe Cupps. Get the latest Indiana basketball roster news at Peegs.com.

DeVries is expected to go after some big names in the transfer portal, and the Peegs.com staff has all the latest news involving incoming and outgoing transfers. You can only see the latest updates at Peegs.com.

Press Release


ATLANTA – (March 21, 2025) — Boys & Girls Clubs of America and ESPN have teamed up to increase access to sports for young people in communities across the country. Building upon ESPN's longstanding commitment to breaking down barriers to entry in youth sports, this initiative will support the organization's ALL STARS programming, expanding upon the more than 2.3 million kids across the country who have the opportunity to participate in team sports through their local Boys & Girls Club. 

Unlike other youth sports programs, ALL STARS, is a youth-development-based curriculum that prioritizes participation, inclusion, and long-term development over winning and gaining sport-specific skills.  The partnership will also include events and competitions to complement the programming, making the idea of playing sports more accessible for Boys & Girls Club members.

“We are thrilled to partner with ESPN, a company that shares our commitment to youth development and creating positive impact. This partnership will provide young people with unique opportunities to experience the power of sports, guided by trained coaches and leveraging the incredible resources and reach of ESPN,” said Chad Hartman, National Director of Corporate Partnership & Engagement at Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

“ESPN is committed to providing access to sports for youth, especially for those who have fewer opportunities to participate,” said Kevin Martinez, vice president of ESPN Corporate Citizenship. “As part of our newly launched youth sports initiative, we're proud to team up with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to help youth take back sports so they can realize the incredible fun, happiness and life skills that sports brings.”

Additionally, this partnership will support training and development of Boys & Girls Club staff and coaches through community partner programs, foundational youth development and trauma-informed training for coaches to enhance the sports experience for young people served by Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

“Spending time at my Boys & Girls Club as a kid, I gained so much more than just a passion for sports – I learned about teamwork, leadership, and the importance of giving back,” said Michael Collins, senior golf analyst at ESPN and Boys & Girls Club alumnus. “ESPN has been a huge part of my life and career, and I've seen firsthand their commitment to supporting young athletes. So, now seeing these two organizations, which are both so meaningful to me, come together to give more kids access to sports – it's incredibly exciting.”

From left, AL.com reporters Ivana Hrynkiw, Hannah Denham, Creg Stephenson and Alaina BookmanFile photos

In early 2025, several AL.com journalists have earned national recognition for their reporting. 

The reporters were recognized for work in 2024, covering a wide range of topics, including sport reporting, business reporting and coverage of Alabama's prison system.

“This is a special place to practice journalism,” said Challen Stephens, acting vice president of news at AL.com. “Alabama readers take pride in their state, and we take care to cover Alabama in a way that is fair and firm, but also makes sense to the people who live here. That's why the work at AL.com so often makes a difference.""

Ivana Hrynkiw, an investigative reporter who covers the justice system, was recognized this month as one of Tomorrow's News Trailblazers by Editor & Publisher Magazine for her reporting on Alabama prisons.

She also was named a finalist for a Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar Association for her series Denied: Alabama's broken parole system.

The reporting found that the Alabama parole board used to release most prisoners who were eligible. But under new leadership, paroles fell to 8% by 2023. That's despite the board's own guidelines suggesting more than 80% of prisoners should qualify for a second chance. 

The series has led to significant impact. The parole rate rose to 20% the month after the first article, and finished 2024 at 20%, according to state data. That comes out to roughly 250 more people getting out of prison last year than in 2023. 

“Ivana's dogged reporting took readers inside numerous cases and let readers decide for themselves who they think should have been paroled. The stories of denials, including of people serving years for marijuana and shoplifting, prompted an immediate change in voting patterns on the parole board,” Stephens said. 

Lawmakers also held hearings and demanded answers, as prisoners featured on AL.com found lawyers or got new hearings that resulted in their release. 

“This sort of accountability has changed things,” said state Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, last summer. 

AL.com reporters Hannah Denham and Ramsey Archibald were also named for their contributions of data visualization, and Tamika Moore was named for her photography for the series.

Denham separately won an award from the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing for reporting on Walk of Champions, the failed nonprofit collective that formed to pay University of Alabama athletes but dissolved less than two years later. 

Judges said, “this is the type of story that should be honored, but also taken as a template.” 

In February, Creg Stephenson, an AL.com sports writer, won the Associated Press Sports Editors award for his project on the complicated legacy of Birmingham's white baseball legends. The four-part series ran as part of AL.com's coverage of Major League Baseball's game at Rickwood Field last summer.

In January, Alabama beat writer Nick Kelly was named Alabama's Sports Writer of the Year for 2024 by the National Sports Media Association.

Alaina Bookman, a violence prevention reporter, received an honorable mention from the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing for contributions to a multi-newsroom collaboration that examined how the child care crisis holds back moms without college degrees.

The 2025 World Figure Skating Championships are in Boston this week, with the world's best taking the ice at TD Garden for a crucial step on the road to next year's Olympics.



After a practice day Tuesday, competition will open Wednesday and run through Saturday, with medals handed out in men's and women's singles, pairs, and ice dance.



Here's a rundown of the contenders for the medal stand, with a number of Americans in the mix:





Short program: Thursday, 11:05 a.m.-4:45 p.m. (TV: USA, 3 p.m.)



Free skate: Saturday, 6-10 p.m. (TV: NBC, 8 p.m.)



Medal ceremony: Saturday, 10 p.m.





The “Quad God” became the first skater to perform a quadruple Axel in competition during the 2022 US Figure Skating Classic. Since then, he's used the skill to power himself to three straight national titles and the 2024 world championship. Still training in his home state of Virginia, Malinin is coached by his parents, Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, who were competitive figure skaters in Uzbekistan. Malinin will likely be a favorite at the Olympics.





Brown, an Illinois native, is a nine-time Grand Prix medalist, two-time Four Continents medalist, and the 2015 US national champion. At 19, Brown became one of the youngest male figure skating Olympic medalists, winning bronze in the team event in 2014. Brown withdrew from the 2025 US championships because of issues with adjusting to an equipment change but is expected to skate in Boston. While figure skating has become increasingly technical, Brown is known for exceptional artistry, often prioritizing program components, musicality, and emotion over elements such as quadruple jumps.





Kagiyama will look to earn his first global gold. Kagiyama has several silver medals, including the 2022 Olympics and three world silvers. He is coached by his father, Masakazu, who competed at the 1992 and 1994 Olympics.





Along with being a two-time European champion and earning the 2024 world bronze medal, Siao Him Fa was a vocal proponent of taking the backflip off the International Skating Union's banned elements list. He added a backflip to cap his European and world championship free skates, costing him 2-point deductions each time. The 2024-25 season marks the first in nearly 50 years that a backflip is allowed in competition. Siao Him Fa celebrated by adding a backflip to each of his programs.

IN THE CIRCLE — Harrison Central pitcher Emma Skinner delivers against St. Clairsville on Monday. 

CADIZ — Bailey Smith ignited a five-run scoring barrage with a monster one-out triple Monday in Harrison Central's season-opening win against St. Clairsville (0-3).

Leading 1-0, Smith crushed a Sophia Turner offering deep into the gap in left-center and motored her way around for a stand-up triple.

That made the score 2-0 and before the Red Devils recorded the final out, three more runs crossed the plate as the Huskies went on for the mercy-rule shortened 11-0 victory in Cadiz.

“I thought they settled in and hit the ball well,” Harrison Central head coach Darrin Young said. “I told them a couple of days ago that hitting is contagious and Bailey started it (Monday) and everybody starting hitting the ball.

“This group, if they play within themselves, is fun to watch.”

The Huskies laced gap shots and banged out hard-hit grounders. They combined that with opportunistic, heads-up base running that took advantage of seven St. Clairsville errors.

One of the strongest all-around performances came from freshman Kelsey Powers.

Batting leadoff and drawing the start at third base for the injured Mikayla Pelegreen, Powers finished with a single and triple and two RBI, going 2-for-2 at the plate with a walk. Powers actually scored on her triple after her moonshot to deep left resulted in an error on the relay home.

In the field, Powers made a couple of solid putouts.

“She had three or four putouts and, for a first time appearance for a freshmen, she didn't do too bad at all did she,” Young said.

The offensive output only made the job of pitcher Emma Skinner that much easier.

Skinner struck out six batters without a walk, scattering three harmless base hits in five innings of work. She allowed only singles to Noel Habig, Divine Roby and Lainey Benedict

The senior wasn't overpowering, but her combined pinpoint location with solid movement on her pitches from the left side kept St. C. batters from getting untracked.

“She's not going to strike out 10-12 eaach time out, but she puts some spin on the ball and will throw a lot of ground ball outs,” Young admitted.

Olivia Tonkovich and Cam Crothers each singled twice for the Huskies, who head to St. Clairsville on Wednesday for a return matchup with St. Clairsville.

The Red Devils dropped their first two contents of the season, Saturday, in a doubleheader against Marietta.

Turner struck out three and walked the same for St. C.

Bryan Hodgson, a 2005 Jamestown High School graduate, was at Arkansas State University for just two seasons before being named the new head coach at the University of South Florida on Monday.

TAMPA, Fla. — Bryan Hodgson, one of the nation's top recruiters and a rising head coach, has been named the University of South Florida head men's basketball coach, Vice President for Athletics Michael Kelly announced Monday.

“We are thrilled to welcome Bryan Hodgson as the next head coach of USF men's basketball,” Kelly said. “Bryan has been a part of winning programs at every level, demonstrating a remarkable ability to recruit top talent, develop players, and build championship-caliber teams. His passion, energy, and vision for USF basketball align perfectly with our commitment to excellence. We believe he is the right leader to take this program to new heights, and we can't wait to see his impact on our student-athletes and the Tampa Bay community.”

The 37-year-old Hodgson, a 2005 Jamestown High School graduate, is South Florida's 12th men's basketball coach and has coached collegiately for 18 years. He came to Tampa from Arkansas State, where he spent two seasons as head coach. He guided the Red Wolves to two of the most successful seasons in program history, with back-to-back 20-win seasons. During the 2023-24 campaign, after inheriting a team that lost 20 games, he led Arkansas State's turnaround, which included its first postseason appearance since 1999. The Red Wolves also set program records for scoring (2,019) and field goals made (1,021). Hodgson was also named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Award, given to the nation's top first-year head coach.

In 2024-25, the Red Wolves finished with a 25-11 record, the best in Arkansas State program history. The season featured a top-20 victory, saw the Red Wolves secure the Sun Belt Conference regular-season title, and marked their first National Invitation Tournament appearance in more than 30 years. Their offense led the conference, while their defense ranked second at the end of the regular season.

Hodgson's recruiting classes ranked atop the Sun Belt Conference in both of his seasons at Arkansas State and the incoming recruiting class is currently ranked 35th in the nation, according to 247 Sports.

“I am incredibly honored and excited to be the head coach at the University of South Florida,” Hodgson said. “From my first conversations with Michael Kelly and the USF leadership, it was clear that this place is strongly committed to building a winning culture. We are Tampa Bay's Home for Hoops, and I can't wait to work with our student-athletes, staff, and the passionate Bulls fan base, including the SoFlo Rodeo. We will play with energy, toughness, and a relentless drive to compete at the highest level. I can't wait to get started.”

Before Arkansas State, he served as an assistant under Nate Oats at Alabama from 2019 to 2023 and played a key role in landing top-15 recruiting classes each season. Alabama advanced to the NCAA Tournament in three straight seasons during Hodgson's time there, including two Sweet 16 appearances. During his final season in Tuscaloosa, the Crimson Tide won both the Southeastern Conference regular-season and tournament championships. Six student-athletes went on to be drafted into the NBA, including two in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft (Brandon Miller, No. 2 overall to the Charlotte Hornets, and Noah Clowney, No. 21 to the Brooklyn Nets). During his career, Hodgson has coached a total of 12 players who went on to compete in the NBA.

From 2015 to 2019, Hodgson played a pivotal role in the University at Buffalo's rise as a mid-major powerhouse, where he also served under Oats. He assisted in three NCAA Tournament runs, three Mid-American Conference tournament championships, two regular-season conference titles, and the program's highest-ever national ranking (No. 14). He developed 2019 MAC Player of the Year CJ Massinburg, who finished his career as a three-time All-MAC honoree and second in school history with 1,990 career points, including 273 three-pointers.

Hodgson's coaching career began at Fredonia State University, where he served as an assistant coach. He then went to Jamestown Community College and Midland College, where he led recruiting efforts and conducted player development workouts and in-season practice sessions.

His exceptional recruiting ability has earned him recognition as one of The Athletic's top 25 up-and-coming coaches and one of the 50 most impactful high-major assistant coaches. He was also one of 30 assistant coaches named to the 2016 Under Armour 30 Under 30 Team by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. 247Sports.com also previously named him the No. 2 recruiter in the country.

Hodgson played collegiately at Jamestown CC for two seasons and served as team captain both years. He earned a bachelor's degree in sports management from Fredonia State University in 2011 and a master's in education from the University of the Southwest in 2015.

A Western New York native, Hodgson was placed in foster care as an infant and adopted at age 2. He mentors children through Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. He is also the founder and president of Coaching Love Inc., which raises awareness for at-risk youth, particularly those in the foster care system or waiting to be adopted, through basketball and other sports.

Hodgson and his fiancee, Jordan, have a son, Jett, who was born in 2024.

MARK NANCE/Sun-Gazette Correspondent
Loyalsock's Alaina Dadzie (left) and Lacey Kriebel (right) hug following Friday's PIAA Class AAA semifinal victory. Kriebel won her 100th game on Friday in the process as a player.

Some wear braces, others padding and/or bandages. Look closer and one can also see some bumps and bruises.

Loyalsock has played 31 games this season and players have taken some physical pounding each time. That included Friday against Imhotep as some players sometimes limped back up to the ground after getting knocked down or diving after loose balls.

Through it all Loyalsock is still standing. Strong wills have helped Loyalsock keep pushing and now it stands as one of the state's two best teams. The Lancers defeated Imhotep, 65-46, last Friday in the Class AAA state semifinals, earning the program's first state championship appearance.

Loyalsock faces Shady Side on Thursday at Hershey's Giant Center for the state title.

“It's just such a tough group,” Loyalsock coach Curtis Jacobson said. “(Assistant coach) Jeff (Everett) said (last Thursday), ‘We understand you're beat up, but you have to figure out a way to play beat up because you're going to get beat up Friday, too. Nothing is going to change in one day, so you have to find a way inside to say, ‘I'm not beat up, I'm not sick, I'm not this or that. I'm excited and I'm ready.'”

Loyalsock certainly was that. The Lancers never trailed by more than two points, kept responding whenever it felt like Imhotep was building first half momentum and dominated the middle quarters before blowing the game wide open in the final four minutes.

Just about every player who competed Friday was battling or has battled some kind of physical ailment this season and that likely is the case for Shady Side athletes, too. The season is a grind, starting in mid-November and reaching 4 1/2 months now. That's a lot of time, competing in games and at practices, playing a physical sport.

You better believe no one is complaining, though. Reaching Hershey and taking its best shot there has been this team's goal since exiting Shamokin a year ago after dropping a heartbreaking state semifinal. The road to Hershey comes with a price and the Lancers have gladly paid it, fighting through the adversity which has come its way.

“There's a minute to go and they're diving for loose balls. There's nothing that makes me more excited than to see that,” Jacobson said. “How do you not get into the game as a coach when your kids are doing that daily. This is a credit to all the girls.”

Following an impressive quarterfinal win against Dunmore, Loyalsock had a weak not only to prepare for Imhotep, but to heal. In normal years, the semifinal would have been three days later, but the Giant Center was booked for this past weekend. As a result, the semifinals and championships were both pushed back a week.

The extension came at a perfect time. Following the Dunmore game, Jacobson said Loyalsock might end up cleaning out Martz Hall's ice supply, tending to their players. Not surprisingly, the first few days following that game were not great ones in terms of practices.

But by Thursday, the Lancers were feeling physically better and mentally locked in. Loyalsock produced, possibly, its best practice this season Thursday. So good were the Lancers there that guard Lacey Kriebel told her parents upon returning home that this game was theirs.

“Our practices were not at our highest at first, but we picked it up,” guard Jillian Kennedy said. “We performed amazing.”

The effort it takes to reach a state final is amazing but the Lancers have given it all season. And do not expect them to stop pushing hard as Thursday approaches.

“We're going to rest our bodies, ice, take as much Advil and Ibuprofen as we need and watch a bunch of film on our opponent and watch a lot of film on ourselves to see what we can do better,” guard Addie Bastian said. “We're ready.”

CENTURY CLUB

Kriebel played one of her best high school games, nearly collecting a double-double after scoring 20 points, grabbing nine rebounds and dealing eight assists. But Kriebel always has been a ‘We' player, not a ‘Me' player. The stats are a means to an end but her main goal is doing whatever it takes to win.

And Kriebel has now helped her teams do that a remarkable 100 times.

Kriebel was part of her 100th high school victory last Friday and her teams are 100-18 in two years at South Williamsport and two years at Loyalsock. She helped both schools win district and league championships and her teams have never won fewer than 22 games in a season, compiling an .847 winning percentage. The regular season lasts 22 games, so averaging 25 wins is a season is quite a tribute.

Kriebel also was a major part of her teams' 10th state playoff win, her squads winning multiple state tournament games three different times. In addition to the numbers, which included going 9 for 9 at the foul line, Kriebel skillfully ran the offense when point guard Jaekairah Harden was in foul trouble, aggressively played downhill and was a vital part of another strong collective defensive performance.

“A lot of our players were put in different spots,” Jacobson said. “Lacey did a great job handling the offense against an aggressive defense.”

IN THE GENES

Loyalsock scorekeeper Lynn Datres was an assistant coach 41 years ago when the Williamsport boys captured the 1984 Class AAAA state championship. Now he will watch his daughter Kerri Jacobson coach in a state final.

Kerri has been her husband Curtis's JV coach since he was hired in 2016. She also brings personal state championship experience to the table as does Jacobson. She was the starting shortstop on Loyalsock's 2008 Class AA state champion softball team and Jacobson played as a freshman in the 2006 Class AA state baseball final for Montoursville.

While assistant coach Jeff Everett is not related to either the Datres's or Jacobson's, he also brings state championship experience which could prove beneficial. Everett was an assistant coach in 2021 when the Loyalsock boys captured the Class AAA crown.

TYING THE RECORD

Loyalsock broke its program's single-season record for wins when it defeated Dunmore in the quarterfinals. Now it is trying to break the area record for wins in the 2000s.

Loyalsock's victory over Imhotep tied it with the 2000 Montoursville girls for the most wins in a season by a girls or boys teams this century. That Warrior squad finished 29-2 and also reached the 3A state final.

Loyalsock is the first area girls' team to reach the state championship since that Montoursville team. It already has raised the bar so high but now Loyalsock has an opportunity to place it where no other Lycoming County girls team ever has.

Warren senior and Mercyhurst University commit Alana Stuart is pictured in a game last year.
File photo by Mark Evans


Warren's softball team won its final four region games in the 2024 regular season, and head coach Carissa Stuart hopes to build off that behind senior, four-year starting pitcher Alana Stuart.

“Last year was a building year and we look to improve, even though we are still a very young team,” said Coach Stuart, whose Dragons finished 6-12 overall after an 11-3 loss to Hickory in the District 10 4A playoffs.

“I have a good core group back to build upon,” added Coach Stuart. “Top returners are Alana Stuart, Emma Gray, Malysia Sorensen and Alexis Jones.”

Alana Stuart was named a region second-team all-star at both pitcher and third base. The NCAA Division I Mercyhurst University commit batted .569 with nine home runs and had a slugging percentage of 1.140.

Emma Gray was a second-team all-star at second base as a sophomore. 

“(Senior) Emily Davidson is back after taking a year off, which adds even more depth for us,” added Coach Stuart, whose Dragons opened with a 14-1 win Friday at Elk County Catholic.

“I expect a lot from this group,” she said. “They have a ton of experience and knowledge of the game. I need these girls to take full advantage of every opportunity they have to score and make plays.”

In addition to Gray, juniors include Sophia Fromknecht, Danika Abbey, Tori Solberg and Braidin Stewart. Sophomores are Sorensen, Jones, Sydney Barr, Violet Brooker, Riley Cull, Alannah Garza, Peyton Hagg, Bella Oyola, Olivia Romanosky, Mallery Velez and Brooke Sherry. Freshmen are Laken Carroll and Rylee Kocher.

In addition to Alana Stuart, Davidson, Gray, Sorensen and Jones, “Olivia Romanosky, Tori Solberg, Danika Abbey, Alannah Garza, Braidin Stewart, Peyton Hagg and Riley Cull will round out our lineup,” said Coach Stuart. “It's still early in the season, so any one of them could see a considerable amount of playing time.

“Looking at our schedule, we look to be competitive in every game,” said Coach Stuart, assisted by Jeff Irwin. “Harbor Creek is a returning state champ and is now in our region (Region 6). McDowell and Meadville are always tough and General McLane, I know, has a good young group coming in this year. We're going to take one game at a time and just get better every time we hit the field. … I've already seen improvement since the first week of practice, so we just need to keep going in the right direction and good things will happen.”

Warren hosts Corry today at Lady Dragons Field in North Warren.

WEIRTON — Coming into the season, the Madonna softball team knew it had a lot of pieces back from last year's team that won 17 games. 

They also knew they had a couple freshmen joining the mix that were cause for added optimism. 

One of those ninth graders was Peyton Conley, who gave the team a second pitcher in addition to junior workhorse Kendall Ryan. 

Monday evening, Conley showed her bat is able to make contributions, too. 

Getting her second start in three games in the circle against Catholic Central, the youthful pitcher bounced back from a tough first outing in the rain at Oak Glen on opening day last week by tossing three scoreless innings and striking out six batters.

At the plate, though, her impact was even more pronounced as she went 4 for 4 and drove in four runs in what ended up being an 18-0 Blue Dons victory at home at Starvaggi Park. 

“She really settled in and found her strike zone and did an outstanding job with her control,” Madonna assistant coach Rodney Boniti said. “She had a big day with the bat, too.”

On the season, the freshman has six RBIs through the first three games of her high school career and has started the season 7 for 11 (.636) at the plate. She had a double, triple and two RBIs in her debut at Oak Glen. 

The Blue Dons as a whole have their bats going early in the young season, scoring at least six runs in all three games, averaging 10.3 runs per game in that span.

Also in the win against the Crusaders, Madi Owens had an inside-the-park three-run homer, Rylee Birkhimer had a double, single and two RBIs and Ally Laughlin tripled in a run. 

LINING IT UP — Madonna's Peyton Conley squares up a pitch for one of her four hits during Monday's game. - Andrew Grimm

“The girls did a lot of offseason work in the cages,” Boniti said. “They tried to refine their swings. They put a lot of work in and it's starting to show. They are swinging the bats and putting a lot of balls in play, and everyone knows when you put balls in play, good things tend to happen. 

“They're getting base runners on and moving girls around and that's a big thing.”

They've cleaned things up in the field, too. After seven errors were their undoing in the loss to the Golden Bears on opening day, they've committed just one in the next two games combined, both wins. 

Ryan had a 10 strikeout performance against Magnolia on Saturday as well. 

BACK ON THE FIELD

Monday's game was the second game back on the field for the revived Crusaders softball program after a two season hiatus. 

While it is a work in progress off to an 0-2 start, as is expected with a cast of new players, coach Donald Brown is optimistic about not only the rest of this season, but beyond. 

“We knew there were going to be some growing pains,” Brown said. “We've only been practicing for about a month, and being out on the field in a game is a lot different so it's been good to get the girls out on the field. Once we get established a little more I think we'll be fine. They'll come along as the season goes on.

“For us right now its about getting out there and getting better as we go.”

The Crusaders had two runners on twice, Taylor Ensminger, the lone senior of the group, providing a base hit while they drew three walks, but Conley prevented them from doing any damage on the scoreboard.  

Central was only down 3-0 with two outs in the bottom of the first, but the Blue Dons broke things open before they could get the third. 

Central did plate five runs in its season debut Saturday at East Liverpool. 

“It's a young group, we have a lot of young players, only one senior on the team, and some of these girls had never played before,” Brown said. “We have a lot of young girls that will hopefully not only keep getting better this year, but be back next year and beyond and continue to improve. 

“We had some base runners on, we did a little better Saturday, but I told them to keep their heads up throughout the whole game and they did, they were still into the game and didn't get down on themselves.”

Returning letter winners for the Sheffield boys track and field team include, in front, from left: Will Zdarko, Aamond Bowman, Chase Fetzeck, Jack Chapman, Zachary Barnes, Isaac Hammerbeck and Emre Morgan. In the middle are: Landon Snell, Nicholas Hagg, Ben Lindberg, Hayden Holden and Wyatt Newark. In back are: Andrew Kyler, Alex Marfink, Colby Barr, Marc Lewis and Braylon Winslow.

With 57 high school athletes on the Sheffield High School track & field roster — and 31 more if you add seventh and eighth grades, it would be easy to focus on sheer numbers to gauge the program's success.

Rather than focus on the fact that nearly half the student body has joined the small-school team, Sheffield head coach Jason Snell would prefer to focus on the number one, as in one team for “one last ride” in the high school's final year.

“The coaching staff and myself have been so blessed by the kids that have come out for track and field in my tenure in the last five years as a head coach,” said Snell. “From day one, I wanted to surround the kids and myself with a staff of coaches that have the same visions as me. Kids first, loves Sheffield, hard work ethic, and creating a safe place for any and all athletes that come forward, no matter what their athletic ability may be. We want every kid that may of always wanted to feel like part of a special group to do just that. The kids that may have feared to come out because of bullying, not being as athletically competitive as others, or just possibly rejection from a team in general. Kids will be kids, but no matter how athletically gifted you are, you treat every one of your teammates with the same respect you desire or else you aren't part of the culture we desire plain and simple. The message of ‘we want you' to each and every kid at Sheffield High School.”

The roster includes 11 seniors: Madison Connolly, Emily Davidson, Sarah Hoffman, Michah Kelley, Katie Powell, Colby Barr, Andrew Hoden, Andrew Kyler, Marc Lewis, Alex Marfink and Braylon Winslow.

“The great thing about track and field is that everyone is a starter,” Snell said. 

Returning letter winners for the Sheffield girls track and field team include, in front, from left: Raelyn Wightman, Kaitlyn Finch, Maddy Snell and Chloe Robinson. In the middle are: Rachel Farnsworth and Alanna Warrior. In back are: Emily Davidson, Sarah Hoffman, Katie Powell and Madison Connolly.

“Everyone gets to compete and, as coaches and Wolverine athletes, we have prided ourselves on and almost made it our identity of standing and cheering every athlete that comes out for our program from seventh through 12th grade, during competition and beyond. And I say ‘program' proudly because that is exactly what it is. Junior high and varsity may compete at different levels, but we practice together as a whole, we meet and communicate together as a whole daily, and we support each other as a whole daily. Put all of those recipe ingredients together, and kids that never knew they could compete athletically — let alone successfully compete, and be part of something for the greater good, the success just began revealing itself.”

Juniors are Rachel Farnsworth, Addisen Heeter, Bailey Hutchinson, Dajanay Thomas, Nevaeh Valentine, Alanna Warrior, Zachary Barnes, Aamond Bowman, Jack Chapman, Nicholas Hagg, Isaac Hammerbeck, Hayden Holden, Ben Lindberg, Emre Morgan, Wyatt Newark, Noah Nuzman, Landon Snell and Will Zdarko.

“Track & field may have individual accolades, but having a team-first mentality and seeing the smiles, confidence earned, community support, and the huge numbers for a small school compete together, is why I am so passionate about this program and what makes it so unique,” Snell said. “Something the small Sheffield community gave me and my brothers as kids that didn't always have the perfect, best-scenario childhood. Us coaches are just lucky enough to get to witness it daily and hopefully help reveal to each and every one of them that they are special, cared about, and bring something to our table. Through all the new confidence and camaraderie, all we can hope and ask for is that when they leave Sheffield, they leave with tools against life's hard lessons of adversity. That just maybe, through sports participation and being a good teammate, they will have possibly cemented in their brain, that they will believe that life is about overcoming and that anything is possible when you believe in yourself.”

Sophomores include Sydney Barr, Kaitlyn Finch, Avri Hornburg, Chloe Robinson, Kelsi Silves, Madison Snell, Raelyn Wightman, Noah Callander, Chase Fetzeck, Tra'Von Jackson, Caleb Steffan and John Whipple.

“We have so many leaders and great role models returning for one last ride to lead by example and set great expectations,” said Coach Snell. “We have lost some of our talented and great athletes and students this season due to the simple and uncomplicated ability of transferring to Warren full-time, or the many, many travel sports programs that have begun the overtaking and sinking of small-town sports. We still have 90 kids out from grades 7-12 that want to be here and want to make as many bittersweet Wolverine memories as possible as fate will permit and allow.”

The freshman are Viola Anderson, Tymber Barr, Peyton Heeter, Kelci Kiser, Lily Richards, James Chapman, Travis Childress, Garrett Copley, Cayden Davis, Landen Faul, Grayson Harper, Joby Hilyer, Orion Ihme, Keianu Kelly, Gordon Vinopal and Owen Winslow.

“Our expectations are the same every year — a Northern Tier League championship,” added Snell. “The boys have been so, so very close the past few years and the forfeiting nine points for pole vault always is a huge factor in that scenario. The boys' toughest obstacles will be, as always, Coudersport and Port Allegany. They always both return an army of talent. The girls always struggle with lower numbers and trying to field a team that can compete all across the board and participate in all events. This year, through lots of leadership by some returning Lady Wolverines upperclassmen, we are looking better than ever to be able to compete with anyone. Besides an NTL title, every year, especially it being our last season, we as a program want to qualify more athletes to the District 9 Championships than the prior year or ever for that matter. I think we are in a great position to do that as well. We have some very athletic underclassmen that have moved up this year and will immediately be competitive at the varsity level.

“It, being the last season, changes everything,” said Snell. “As coach Michael Barr said during football season, we are going to ‘make memories' — that we can cherish forever. We are going to put it all out there and whatever results come our way at the end, we will be proud of the work, efforts, time we had, and memories we have all made together on Wolverine Mountain.”

Sheffield returns 28 letter winners and 14 District 9 Championship qualifiers.

“In the last few seasons, on the boys side, all three relays have qualified for districts and the girls 4-by-100 has made the trip as well,” said Coach Snell. “It is looking good to maintain our success with strong relays with many key parts returning. 

“On the girls' side, sophomores Madison Snell and Raelyn Wightman return to lead the ladies in sprints. A senior and 300-meter hurdle record holder, Sarah Hoffman returns to lead the hurdles with the up-and-coming talented freshman Tymber Barr joining her. In the 400 and up, sophomore Kaitlyn Finch leads the pack with some awesome additions and newcomers this season in junior Addisen Heeter, and freshmen Peyton Heeter and Lily Richards. In jumping events — a multi-sport star also playing softball for the Warren Dragons — senior Emily Davidson and sophomore Chloe Robinson return to lead the jumping duties while mentoring a few new faces in those events as well. Senior Madison Connolly is a returning leader in all three throwing events. In shot put and discus, she is joined by Madison Snell, a 2024 D9 qualifier in the shot, and in javelin, Connolly is joined in dominance with fellow senior Emily Davidson. Lots of promising young lady Wolverines in the mix as well in throwing.

“On the boys' side, senior captain Colby Barr returns to lead the sprints and relays.

Joining him in the sprints is returning junior Jack Chapman and oncoming and

speedy freshman Landen Faul. In the hurdles, Sheffield returns a plethora of talent, including some district qualifiers. Senior Alex Marfink is a quiet but unsung leader in the hurdle events. His stellar partners in these hurdle events include sophomore Chase Fetzeck and juniors Isaac Hammerbeck, Hayden Holden, and Zachary Barnes. Freshman James Chapman joins them bringing lots of potential. In distance, senior Marc Lewis and junior Emre Morgan bring their exceptional stamina and endurance back for another season. Senior vocal and lead by example treasure Andrew Kyler also joins them occasionally as well as adding his talents to the throws. Freshman Garrett Copley is new to the ranks of distance this year, but is showing lots of great effort and potential. When speaking of the jumping Sheffield tracksters, a couple of juniors stand out, one a returning '24 D9 qualifier. Juniors Aamond Bowman and Will Zdarko hope to continue success in the pits and clearing the high jump bar. In the throwing events for the Wolverines, the talent isn't just a couple guys dominating it all. Every event has its own leaders. In the shot put, Alex Marfink and freshman Joby Hilyer are standing out. The discus, juniors Landon Snell and Emre Morgan aim to please in the netted sector. And, in the javelin, senior Braylon Winslow and juniors Wyatt Newark and Ben Lindberg have been getting better distances daily. Junior Nicholas Hagg also adds a lot of depth and talent to the Wolverine throwers.”

Sheffield starts on Tuesday, April 1, at Otto-Eldred, and its home opener is scheduled for April 3 against Johnsonburg.

“Memories and meaningful moment lessons to prepare our athletes for the real world are our focus this year,” said Snell. “Many tears will be shed this year, but they will be shed together. Most importantly, everything happening this year, it will be done together.”

Mar 25, 2025

AP FILE PHOTO - Drake head coach Ben McCollum applauds his team during the second half against Bradley in the championship game of the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament on March 9 in St. Louis.

Ben McCollum, who led Drake's dominating run through the Missouri Valley Conference and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs, was named head coach at Iowa on Monday.

Athletic director Beth Goetz announced McCollum's hiring 10 days after she fired Fran McCaffery and two days after McCollum wrapped up a 31-4 season with a loss to Texas Tech in the second round of the West Regional. Terms of his contract weren't announced.

McCollum takes over a program that had its worst season in seven years. The Hawkeyes were 17-16 overall and, at 7-13, tied for 12th in the Big Ten Conference. Iowa also has seen a steep decline in attendance the last two years.

The 43-year-old McCollum's ties to the Hawkeye State run deep. He was born in Iowa City, raised in Storm Lake and played junior college basketball in Mason City. His mother earned her undergraduate, master's and law degrees from Iowa.

“Returning to Iowa City as the head coach of the Hawkeyes is a dream come true for me and my family,” McCollum said. “The passion of Hawkeye fans is unmatched, and I am incredibly excited to get started on this new journey together.”

McCollum's coaching profile has been on the rise since he landed his first head coaching job at Northwest Missouri State and won four Division II national championships in 15 seasons.

Four of his Northwest Missouri players joined him at Drake, and the Bulldogs became one of the top stories in college basketball this season. They were dubbed “Division II Drake” by some, a moniker that only served to motivate the team.

All four of the Northwest Missouri transfers were starters and one of them, Bennett Stirtz, led the Missouri Valley in scoring and was named conference player of the year and most outstanding player of the MVC Tournament.

The Bulldogs were picked fifth in the 12-team Valley and received no first-place votes. They ended up winning the regular-season championship by two games with 17 conference wins, their most ever. Then they won the MVC Tournament to run their overall win total to a school-record 30 in 33 games.

Next was a 67-57 win over Missouri in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, but the Bulldogs had difficulty matching up with Texas Tech and lost 77-64.

Now McCollum moves a little more than 100 miles east, from Des Moines to Iowa City.

“We are excited to welcome Coach McCollum and his family back to Iowa City,” Goetz said. “Ben has a track record of success both on and off the court. His talent for developing student-athletes and fostering a strong team culture has been evident throughout his career. I am confident that Hawkeye fans will enthusiastically support the McCollum family as we embark on the next chapter of Iowa men's basketball.”

McCollum coaches a grinding style. The Bulldogs' tempo was slowest in the nation. Offensive rebounding is emphasized. The defense allows 58.4 points per game, fewest in the nation. Just over 1 in 5 opponent possessions ends with a turnover.

“Death by a thousand paper cuts,” McCollum called his system.

The Bulldogs knocked off Miami, Vanderbilt and Kansas State on their way to a 12-0 start. They dropped back-to-back games before reeling off 11 straight MVC wins.

McCaffery was Iowa's all-time wins leader and, at 15 years, the longest-tenured coach in program history. The Hawkeyes dropped seven of nine games in February and didn't qualify for the Big Ten Tournament until the last day of the regular season.

The program has struggled to attract elite talent because of its shallow pool of funds for name, image and likeness compensation.

Since McCaffery's firing, seven players have announced they would enter the transfer portal.

Iowa's men were 10th in the Big Ten in average paid attendance this season, at 9,161 per game, though actual crowds appeared significantly less. That's an 8% drop from last season and 26% drop from 2022-23.

The 18-year-old showed off his tennis and crowd-conducting skills, signaling the arrival of a global phenom.BySteve TignorPublished Mar 25, 2025 copy_link

Published Mar 25, 2025

In the late 90s, I went to the Miami Open for the first time. In those days, it was played in Key Biscayne and known as “The Lipton.” The first match I watched featured Gustavo “Guga” Kuerten. Guga was already a Grand Slam champion by then, and the stands were full. But I was still unprepared for the burst of joyous noise that greeted the first good shot he hit, and every good shot thereafter. It felt like a corner of the grounds had been annexed by Brazil, covered in green and yellow, and renamed Tiny Rio. Even for someone from diverse New York, it was eye-opening. Florida felt like the world.A quarter of a century later, the tournament has been renamed to emphasize its location, and moved off of an island and into the city's pro-football stadium. One of the results, as we saw this past week, is that there's even more room for South Florida's 400,000-strong Brazilian community to put on their green and yellow and make their noise. For the first time since Kuerten retired in 2008, those fans had a homegrown tennis star to cheer in João Fonseca. Seventeen years is a long time to wait, and they made the most of it during his three matches.Read more: Djokovic hails ""future superstar” Fonseca amid Miami breakthroughThe tournament's schedulers knew what they had right away.

“I knew it was going to be crowded, but I didn't know it was going to be, like, huge,” a wide-eyed Fonseca said.He described his Miami experience as any 18-year-old might: “Super-cool” and “super-nice.”“First impression here is just I felt really in Brazil.”The event may have felt like a make-up for the actual Rio Open, which was played last month. There a tired Fonseca went out in the first round, after winning the title in Buenos Aires two days earlier.In Miami, it was easy to forget that Fonseca is still just 18, and was still the underdog against the 11th-ranked De Minaur. The Brazilian played like he belonged, through. He powered his ground strokes, dictated the rallies, and hit one ball so hard, he literally came out of one of his shoes.Fonseca came right up to the brink of victory. He won the first set 7-5, had break points at 3-3 and 4-4 in the second, and was up a break early in the third. From there, though, a little of his inexperience showed. He tentatively sliced a backhand into the net on the first of his break points, and overhit a running forehand on the second. In the end, he couldn't find the shot he needed to crack De Minaur for good.

I felt really in Brazil. João Fonseca on playing the Miami Open

Credit the Australian, a veteran of many Davis Cup contests past, for holding off the tide of emotion in the building. Afterward, he scrawled “Rio Open” on the camera lens, and couldn't contain his exhilaration in his post-match interview.Fonseca chalked the loss up to good play on De Minaur's part, and overexcitement on his own.“I had some opportunity to close,” he said. “Then probably I'll be more hyped during the match. He broke me and he started playing better. He was not missing any ball after that. So, I mean, it was difficult to play.”Over three matches, Fonseca showed his skill as a player, as well as a precocious ability to engage a crowd. He has the requisite repertoire of fist-pumps and arm flaps—as well as a late racquet slam—but it never felt like overkill. He's soft-spoken, level-headed, and serious, but not so serious that he couldn't revel in this moment, even if it ended in defeat.

Maybe I can watch some videos.”Fonseca will take his act to bigger stages in the coming months, but they probably won't feel like home the way Miami does.

Emma Raducanu has, by her own admission, never been afraid to do things ""a little bit differently"".

So it feels on brand the British number two has reached the first WTA 1,000 quarter-final of her career without a full-time coach.

Raducanu secured her fourth win in a row at the Miami Open by beating American 17th seed Amanda Anisimova on Monday.

It is the first time the 22-year-old has strung together that many victories in one tournament since the 2021 US Open - when she sealed a fairytale triumph as a teenage qualifier.

""I'd say I'm a bit of a free spirit so I don't need restrictions or being told what to do,"" Raducanu, ranked 60th in the world, said.

""I think when I'm being really authentic, that's when I'm playing my best.""

As she prepares to play US Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wednesday's quarter-final, BBC Sport analyses how Raducanu is thriving without a full-time coach.

Whether it has been winning a Grand Slam title as an unknown rookie, employing a carousel of coaches, or tailoring her schedule outside of the accepted norm, Raducanu regularly does what she thinks is right for her.

That doesn't always work out for the best, but she continues to stay true to her convictions.

Ending a short-lived partnership with Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of this tournament was another decision which was initially met by surprise.

But her run on the hard courts in Miami - a faster surface which suits her style - suggests the move has paid off.

Raducanu has played with a freedom and confidence only seen sporadically since her stunning US Open success.

""I feel when I am boxed into a regimented way then I am not able to express myself in the same way,"" Raducanu told Sky Sports.

In Florida she has been guided by Mark Petchey - a well-known figure in British tennis circles who worked with her as a teenager.

Petchey, who used to coach Andy Murray in his salad days on the ATP Tour, has been giving pointers on the practice courts and offering coaching advice from Raducanu's box.

Petchey has been working alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue and fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura.

What Raducanu describes as a ""different approach"" has brought an emphasis on having fun at the right times, with shorter, less intense practice and warm-up sessions.

""This week has been a great eye-opener to just when I'm happy and expressive and myself,"" Raducanu said.

""Having people that I've known for a very long time, since before the US Open, is the most valuable thing for this week at least.""

Raducanu's chopping and changing of coaches has been well documented - and the reasons behind their departures have varied.

In 2023, after splitting with a fifth coach in two years, Raducanu believed her ""provoking"" and ""challenging"" questions went some way to explaining the high turnover.

When she came back from wrist and ankle surgeries in 2024, the Briton turned to a trusted figure in childhood coach Nick Cavaday.

He provided stability and a solid sounding board, but the partnership ended in January when he stepped down because of a health issue.

Raducanu's father Ian secured the services of Platenik, but her results in Miami without him have left some wondering if she even needs a full-time coach.

Examples of players competing for long periods of time without a coach are rare. A recent one is Nick Kyrgios, who reached the 2022 Wimbledon final.

Never one to miss an opportunity to be provocative, the controversial Australian responded to Raducanu's run by calling coaches ""overrated"".

""People awfully quiet that Raducanu is winning now - where all the experts at now?"" Kyrgios posted on X.

Raducanu seems committed to finding a new full-time coach - but the availability of suitable candidates is limited with a third of the season gone.

Raducanu's representatives describe Petchey - balancing the role in Miami with his work as a television commentator - as a ""familiar face"" who is providing ""support"".

It is not clear, though, how long the arrangement will go on for.

Former British number one Tim Henman, who has advised Raducanu over the years, believes Petchey's involvement ""makes sense"" given he knows ""Emma's game"".

""It'll be interesting to see how long it lasts for,"" said Henman, who will return to the coaching box himself at this year's Laver Cup as a vice-captain.

""Emma has been fairly vocal that she is comfortable switching coaches - and that's her prerogative.

""I started playing professional tennis at the end of 1992 and finished in 2007. I had three coaches.

""I liked the consistency and continuity of working with a coach for a period of time. It was right for me but that doesn't mean it is right for Emma.""

Questions have regularly been raised about Raducanu's resilience, given the amount of injuries and issues she has dealt with since her US Open win.

This season has also been challenging. A back injury disrupted her pre-season before a traumatic stalking experience in Dubai and then Cavaday's exit.

The gritty manner in which she beat world number 10 Emma Navarro in the Miami second round answered some of the sceptics.

She also showed steel to swat aside third-round opponent McCartney Kessler and Anisimova, who were both hampered physically.

Raducanu feels she has rediscovered her ""competitive spirit"", conceding: ""I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.""

Whatever she goes on to achieve in Florida, the next challenge is sustaining her level over a longer period - something she has so far been unable to do.

Henman points to Raducanu playing more tournaments - even though she lost six of nine matches before the Miami Open - as a reason behind her improved durability.

Raducanu has played seven events this year - more than she ever has in the opening three months of the season.

After Miami she will move back inside the world's top 50 for the first time since August 2022.

""It is easy to look at the results but I would look more at the journey of tournament play - that's a big, big positive,"" said Henman.

""There is no doubt in my mind she's a great player and should be back knocking on the door of the top 30, seeded at Slams and the top 20 if she stays healthy.""

Tennis

MIAMI — Monday was a bad day for the Florida tennis faithful.

The MacGyvered tennis arena inside Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, was pretty dead all afternoon. Floridians Danielle Collins and Coco Gauff — the former born in St Petersburg, the latter who has lived in Delray Beach since she was seven — lost to Aryna Sabalenka and Magda Linette respectively.

Then evening fell, a Brazilian named Joao Fonseca entered the building, and a bad day turned into a tennis night out for the gods.

The Fonseca fanatics came from as close as downtown and Miami Beach and as far as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. They chanted “FON-SAY-CAH” as though they had been echoing his name off the seats of cavernous stadiums for a decade. They razzed his opponent, poor Alex de Minaur of Australia, the world No. 11 and one of the ultimate tennis gentlemen. They ignored the mostly hopeless pleas from chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani to exhibit a bit more sportsmanship than they might at a Copa America final.

“Obrigado, Obrigado,” he kept saying.

Sorry, Mohamed. All those folks in canary kits had a wunderkind they needed to will over the line.

The Fonseca phenomenon has been building for a little over a year now, beginning with two qualifying wins at the U.S. Open. In the third round of qualifying, Fonseca faced a New York crowd in full voice for an American, Eliot Spizzirri, and it got the better of him. Then he won the ATP Next Gen Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Things got seriously loud at this year's Australian Open, when Fonseca blew away No. 9 Andrey Rublev in the first round. The court for his second-round loss against Italy's Lorenzo Sonego looked like an exclusive nightclub — lines out the door and no hope of getting in.

Things went bananas when he won the Argentina Open in Buenos Aires in February. Maybe too bananas, since he lost his next match, at his hometown Rio de Janeiro Open, and admitted he had struggled with nerves.

In Miami, a city sometimes referred to as the capital of Latin America that is home to some 400,000 Brazilians and a tennis tournament that sells itself as a kind of South American grand slam, the Fonseca chorus reached its first crescendo of many. Against de Minaur, alas, it couldn't quite get their darling where he needed to go.

For the better part of two sets, Fonseca pounded the Australian with his power, but when he looked up at the scoreboard after nearly two hours, they were somehow even at a set apiece.

He went up a break of serve early in the third set, only to give back the advantage and with it the match. Fonseca would lose five straight games as his 18-year-old arm lost just enough oomph for de Minaur to turn the match into a track meet. He turned what had been a Brazilian highlight reel into an Australian grind, and rope-a-doped Fonseca into submission, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3.

De Minaur scribbled “Rio Open” on a television camera lens when all was said and done, in homage to the crowd and the player he'd found a real handful.

“I did very good not to lose my head,” he said after it was over. “I told myself, you know, I'm going to get chances. I'm going to stick around. Got to stick around. Got to get chances. Keep making it physical.”

Fonseca is going to have nights like these. He is the first man born in 2006 to win an ATP tour title and the fourth-youngest man to win one since 2000. He is likely to win many more. But even he knows how much he still has to learn. After losing his second-round match at Indian Wells earlier this month, he zipped across the desert to Phoenix and won the Arizona Tennis Classic, an event on the second-tier ATP Challenger Tour.

Last fall, before he won the ATP Next Gen Finals, a competition for the best players aged under 21, he spoke of the difference between junior tennis and the lower levels of the pro tours. In juniors, he could mostly win on talent alone. When he started playing grown men at the professional level, even in second- and third-tier tournaments on the Challenger and Futures tours, he quickly saw that smarts often won out over his talent.

In an interview earlier this month in California after his second-round loss to eventual champion Jack Draper at Indian Wells, Fonseca explained the difference between players at that level and those on the ATP Tour.

“They take the opportunities,” he said, a statement that foreshadowed Monday's battle with de Minaur. Fonseca wanted another chance at one of his break points at 4-4 in the second set, when he sliced a backhand instead of trying to hammer it away. He missed a forehand in the third set to go up 3-1. “When the important points come, they are more aggressive, they know how to play. I'm going to improve in this. The difference today? I didn't play bad, I think was the mentality.”

Brazilians have known about Fonseca's mentality and physicality for a while now, and they are so here for it.

Claudia Tanaka, who travelled with her parents 4,000 miles from Rio to cheer for Fonseca, said that she has been watching him since he was a boy. She and her mother and father, both “big tennis fans” who are in Miami for the duration of the tournament, were camped out on the plaza in their canary-yellow Brazil soccer team jerseys, their legs blanketed with the national flag.

“We only had day session tickets today, so we're going to stay and watch right here,” she said.

A few feet away, Vinnie Paco and Eduardo Paco of Sao Paulo were about to head into the stadium. They decided a week ago to snatch up some plane tickets and come to this tournament. “I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Fonseca,” Vinnie said.

Their compatriots and expatriates turned the first five days of the Miami Open into a Fonseca fest.

Learner Tien, the rising American, might have figured he'd have the home advantage in his first-round match against a player who was a rival through juniors and is becoming one at the tour level. No such luck. Instead, he learned that in Miami, national borders mean nothing. Tien reflected on a 6-7(1), 6-3, 6-4 defeat on Instagram by setting the location for his post to Rio de Janeiro. After the win, Fonseca had written “Am I in Brazil?” on the camera lens.

“I knew it was going to be crowded, but I didn't know it was going to be, like, huge,” he said of his time in Miami in a news conference Monday.

The Fonseca effect hasn't been all joy.

Tournament organizers caused some mayhem Saturday after they moved his match against Ugo Humbert from the Grandstand to the main stadium at the last minute. Brazilians who had already secured seats in the Grandstand and were watching Jakub Mensik against Draper as a warm-up act had to scramble to pay a surcharge for seats in the nether reaches of the Hard Rock Stadium. But not before they rained down boos and Fonseca chants in equal measure on an unsuspecting Czech and Brit who were just trying to play their own version of this tournament.

James Blake, the tournament director, had anticipated the situation. He knew Fonseca was one of his meal tickets, despite only being the world No. 60. He knew he was going to have to feature his matches, on pain of Brazilian fury. “It's a good problem to have,” Blake insisted.

Indeed it is, though Fonseca's competition doesn't quite see it that way.

“Super-dangerous player, playing with a lot of confidence,” de Minaur said. “Ultimately, it's always going to be a tough, tough match against him. He's still young, so he's only going to get better, and he's only going to make it even harder for us guys on tour.”

Tied with Felix Auger-Aliassime for the most wins this year, the Australian ended Fonseca's run at the ATP Masters 1000 event with a thrilling 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 victory. Raucous Brazilian fans created a carnival feel inside Stadium court, prompting De Minaur to sign the camera lens, ‘Rio Open :)'  after the two-hour, 31-minute match.

The 10th seed dropped serve in the opening game of the decider, but fought back by engaging in lengthy baseline rallies and testing Fonseca's endurance. The 26-year-old kept his cool and won six of the final seven games to hold off Fonseca and secure his place in the fourth round, equalling his best Miami result.

“It was a hell of a battle. I knew coming in what to expect. Not only is he an incredibly talented, dangerous, explosive player, but he's playing with so much confidence at the moment and the crowd behind him,” said De Minaur. “I knew I was going to be up against it and it was going to take every single ounce of me. Just put my head down and got to work, so very happy with that win.”

De Minaur found success with a daring approach, targeting Fonseca's forehand early in rallies. Yet the bold strategy allowed the Aussie to open up the court, send the 18-year-old scrambling and rush Fonseca's backhand. The teenager committed 43 unforced errors, including 25 off his double-hander.


“I think ultimately he is a big-time player, so he's going to go for many, many shots that might not be high percentage. But now he's playing with a lot of confidence and making them,” De Minaur said. “Earlier, he pulled off some great backhands, hit some backhands [down the line]. That forehand is so dangerous…


“Obviously, I know he's still young, he's played a lot of matches in a row. I knew if I could make this match physical, I had higher chances of it going my way.”



Level at 5-5 in the first set, Fonseca let out a loud roar after outlasting De Minaur in a baseline exchange in the opening point of the game. That adrenaline helped fuel the teenager to earn three consecutive break points, the first of the match for either player. Fonseca converted his second opportunity and closed out the opener on his serve.



De Minaur surged to a 3-0 lead in the second set, thanks to watertight baseline play while Fonseca was broken to love in a loose first service game. A topsy-turvy second set was filled with superb shotmaking from both, including Fonseca striking a Federer-like ‘SABR' backhand return winner and later, the Brazilian was hitting so hard that his left shoe fell off mid-rally. The longer the rallies, the harder De Minaur and Fonseca pummelled the ball. 







De Minaur fought off four of the five break points he faced in the second set — and five of eight for the match — according to Infosys ATP Stats. As the match extended beyond the two-hour mark, the nine-time tour-level titlist remained more consistent as Fonseca leaked errors in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

“You can go out there, you can complain, you can get rattled, do a lot of different things, but that's not going to help you win the tennis match. Ultimately, that's what I told myself, ‘It's going to be a battle not only against the player, against the crowd, just put your head down and do the work and try to compete every single point'.”

De Minaur and Grigor Dimitrov are the only men to reach the fourth round of Indian Wells and Miami in both 2024 and 2025. Back inside the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Live Rankings, displacing Daniil Medvedev, De Minaur will next face 29th seed Matteo Berrettini, who ousted Belgian Zizou Bergs 6-4, 6-4.De Minaur is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin and could move as high as second should he win his first ATP Masters 1000 title as he looks to return to the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive year.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Bowie State women's tennis standout Torrienne Emery has been named the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Conference Player of the Week, the conference announced Monday afternoon.

A native of Bowie, Md., Emery, played a pivotal role in the Bulldogs' recent success, securing key victories in both singles and doubles play against Virginia Union and Trinity. Over the past week, she posted a 2-0 singles record while teaming up with Kayla Lowery in doubles as the duo also went 2-0.

Emery's standout performance came in Bowie State's 5-2 victory over Trinity (DC) last Thursday, where she dominated her singles match 6-3, 6-0 and secured 6-2 doubles win, helping the Bulldogs claim their first victory of the season.

                            2025 Miami
                        


WTA Staff


World No. 2 Iga Swiatek of Poland moved one step closer to her first title of the year with a hard-fought 7-6(5), 6-3 victory over No. 22 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the Round of 16 at the Miami Open.

Swiatek needed 2 hours and 5 minutes to battle past former World No. 3 Svitolina, completing the quarterfinal lineup at the year's fourth WTA 1000 event just after midnight on Tuesday morning.

Miami: Draws | Scores | Order of play 

""It was much tougher to problem-solve, especially because Elina was also putting on some pressure,"" Swiatek said on court after her win. ""I needed to adjust, and I'm happy that I picked the right moments at the end to play more aggressively, and sometimes I was more patient.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Fast facts: Swiatek is still alive in her quest for a second Miami Open title -- she won this event in 2022 to complete the Sunshine Double (winning Indian Wells and Miami in the same year). The only other women to complete the Sunshine Double are Stefanie Graf (twice), Kim Clijsters and Victoria Azarenka.

Swiatek is indeed titleless so far in 2025 -- but despite that fact, she is still the tour leader in main-draw match-wins for the year. Her win over Svitolina was her 21st of the season, moving her ahead of Mirra Andreeva and Aryna Sabalenka's 20 victories apiece.

Swiatek is also now 13-1 against Ukrainian players at Hologic WTA Tour events. Her only WTA Tour-level loss to a Ukrainian player was against Svitolina, in the 2023 Wimbledon quarterfinals.

Match moments: Swiatek was up a break on three separate occasions in the first set, but each of those times, Svitolina broke back in the very next game, and the pair naturally settled the opening frame in a tiebreak.

Svitolina battled back from 3-0 down in the breaker, but Swiatek used deep, heavy forehands on the humid night to keep herself from falling behind. Swiatek earned her first set point at 6-5 with a crosscourt backhand winner, and the Pole closed out the one-set lead with one last forehand winner after 62 grueling minutes.

In the second set, Swiatek had three break points to take a dominant 5-1 lead, but Svitolina swatted those away and was eventually able to pull back on serve at 4-3. However, Swiatek broke again in a challenging 5-3 game, and she powered her way to victory from there. Swiatek finished the match with 34 winners to Svitolina's 22.

Wild card awaits: Swiatek will now face an unexpected opponent in the quarterfinals: 19-year-old wild card Alexandra Eala of the Philippines.

Eala moved into the first Hologic WTA Tour quarterfinal of her career when her fourth-round opponent, No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, withdrew in advance of their match due to a lower back injury.

Even though she received a walkover today, World No. 140 Eala is not to be taken lightly. Eala had been 0-4 against Top 40 players coming into Miami, but had a breakthrough win over No. 25 Jelena Ostapenko in the second round and an even bigger win over No. 5 Madison Keys in the third round.

With those wins, Eala became the first Filipina woman in the Open Era to defeat Grand Slam singles champions at any WTA Tour event -- and now she will play another in five-time major champion Swiatek.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

GREENVILLE, S.C. - The Brown women's tennis team (8-6) fell 4-0 to the nationally ranked No. 38 Furman Paladins (13-2) on Monday afternoon. This loss snaps the Bears' six match winning streak, and extends the Paladins' to eight matches.

""It was a great experience for our team to play such an experienced and gritty team today. Furman made us fight for every point in every match and I was so glad our players didn't back down from the challenge. Unfortunately we made too many mistakes in crucial moments, but overall I was proud of the willingness our players showed to be uncomfortable as they competed until the last points of their matches. I trust our players will take today's match as a learning opportunity to continue to grow their competitive 'muscles',"" Broadbent Family Women's Tennis Head Coach Lucie Schmidhauser said.

Brown was unable to earn the doubles point, starting the match with a 1-0 deficit. Furman picked up wins at second and third doubles giving the Paladins an early advantage. 

The Bears battled their way through singles, unable to come out with a win. Furman's Sara Snyder and Ellie Schulson held off senior Gabby Soliman and sophomore Anne Yang at the first and fourth lines, respectively. First-year Ali Maguy fought against the Paladins' Marissa Pennings, but ultimately dropped her match in a second set tiebreaker (1-6, 7-6(1)).

UP NEXT
The Bears will continue their road trip when they travel to UNC Charlotte to take on the 49ers on Wednesday, Mar. 26 at 1 p.m.

After a four-match away stretch, No. 13 Texas women's tennis was back at home for two matches over the weekend against No. 9 LSU and No. 49 Ole Miss, both resulting in 2–4 losses. 

Last year in the Big 12, head coach Howard Joffe's Longhorns lost only a single conference match. Now, in their first year in the Southeastern Conference, they hold a 4–5 conference record with a 10–8 overall record. While a win against No. 9 LSU would have done wonders for Texas' resume, the team was without two of its best players. 

No. 51 Sabina Zeynalova, the lone senior on the Texas roster, has been out with injury since the fall season. And against LSU, freshman Ariana Anazagasty-Pursoo was pulled from her singles match after filling in for Zeynalova for the doubles match. 

“When you don't have your number one player (Zeynalova) playing, and when you don't have your other starter in Ariana able to play singles — I don't think there's any team in the top 10 that could withstand that,” Joffe said. “I could be all bent out of shape about the result, but I'm not. I'm rather encouraged.” 

The Longhorns played without a third of their starting lineup against LSU. Of the 12 women playing Friday, 11 were freshmen. Texas secured the first point of the day after three challenging doubles matches.

On court three, freshman duo No. 20 Carmen Hera and No. 54 Eszter Meri started Texas off strong with a 6–4 victory. The second doubles game was lost to LSU's top doubles duo, Cadence Brace and Kayla Cross. With the No. 7 duo in the nation defeating Texas freshmen duo  Anazagasty-Pursoo and Ashton Bowers, the doubles point would come down to the final doubles game. 

Texas secured the doubles point with Salma Drugdova and Charlotte Kempenaers-Pocz beating the No. 29 doubles duo of Tilwith Di Girolami and Anita Sahdiieva, 7–5. 

LSU then went on a three-point run in the singles, 3–1, before the match finally ended 4–2. 

The last time the Longhorns had a worse record than now was in 2016-17 when the team went 14–9. However, that season conference win percentage was still positive, with a record of 6–3. 

Coach Joffe hoped to have Zeynalova or Anazagasty-Pursoo back for Sunday against Ole Miss but was ready to take on the Rebels without them.

“My hope is we'll have one of the two players I alluded to available,” Joffe said. “If I had a guess that isn't the case, and so there won't be any adjustments. It will just be another opportunity for these kids to get rough competition.”

Joffe's outlook was correct, and Texas had to face Ole Miss on Sunday without a third of its starters. Although Anazagasty-Pursoo was available for her doubles match, she and Bowers lost to the Rebel senior duo of Anaëlle Leclercq and Ludmila Kareisova. The Rebels would take the doubles point. 

The Rebel's Alice Souli finished the Longhorns off by clinching the match point against redshirt freshman Charlotte Kempenaers-Pocz.  

With little time left in the season, Texas will have to put its faith in health if it wants to go far in the NCAA tournament. 

“We don't have a ton of time; we've got four to six weeks to get everyone healthy and play together, and I do feel like we can be there right at the end,” Joffe said.

Texas has six matches before the SEC Championship takes place in Auburn, Alabama, in mid-April. The team's next match is in Knoxville, facing the Tennessee Volunteers.

Collin Bale (left) and Garrett Haupt will be the top doubles pairing for the Panthers in 2025. The senior duo qualified for state last season as part of the team that won the regional meet for the first time in program history.

Derby boys tennis had a historic season with the first-ever regional title in 2024. Heading into the spring, led by a strong senior class, the Panthers are ready to build off the recent success.

The Panthers have three returners from the regional championship team and have brought plenty of confidence into the 2025 season. Tyler Bradt, Collin Bale and Garrett Haupt have brought a new level of belief as key seniors this year.

”The success from last year gave our returners a lot of belief that they can achieve big goals,” head coach Kristen Regier said. “When players have belief backed by success, confidence follows suit and takes them to the next level.”

Bradt has emerged as the Panthers' top singles player in his senior season. Through the first few weeks of practice, Bradt has brought a more aggressive playing style. His improved serve could be a valuable asset for him this season. 

“Bradt is going to be our singles anchor, holding the most varsity experience in that spot,” Regier said. “His serve increased in power and placement last year, which has become quite a weapon.”

Going into their third year as a doubles unit, Collin Bale and Garrett Haupt are ready to elevate their game in their senior seasons. As the top doubles team, the two have learned their strengths and weaknesses and have worked to make themselves a fierce force this season. 

“Bale and Haupt are more in sync on the court than I have seen in their time at Derby,” Regier said. “They know their strengths and weaknesses and have worked to limit or enhance them. I think they are starting to believe that they can compete with anyone.”

Derby has a strong roster, and there will be tight competition for the second varsity singles and doubles spots. The roster will start to take shape through challenge matches, but there could be plenty of rotation among the top spots. 

Several players have emerged as contenders for the second singles spot, including seniors Ayden Bohaty, Liam Killenberg and Taylor Broberg. Junior Dylan Nelson-Craig and sophomore Brennan Ball have also played solid tennis early in the year. 

All of these players could find a role on the second varsity doubles pairing, depending on chemistry. There is fierce competition for the second doubles spot, which features the 2024 AVCTL-I JV champion duo of juniors Jayce Johnson and Landen Highsmith in the mix. 

The coaching staff plans to mix and match the rosters to find the right fit for the postseason roster. Derby will have plenty of opportunities to test different players in singles and doubles as varsity players are limited to eight meets in a regular season, including the AVCTL-I meet.  

“We have several players that are all in the mix for a top six spot,” Regier said. “We are going to mix and match rosters and give many players opportunities to earn the postseason spots.” 

The leadership on the roster has been strong early in the season behind a group of 11 seniors who have been in the Derby tennis program for three or more seasons. The culture of tennis has been focused on supporting each other and the team has shown a belief in their teammates, led by the upperclassmen. The excitement for the season is brewing from the energy the senior class has brought to the team this season.  

 “I am excited for this senior class,” Regier said. “They have been instrumental in the growth of Derby tennis and the development of our culture. The team has bought and is fostering the belief in their teammates in a way that we haven't seen before. I'm excited to see this team grow with each other and cheer each other on.”

Spring has sprung, the sun is out and Duke men's tennis stayed hot with a pair of conference victories.

This weekend, No. 13 Duke cruised to two ACC wins at home, clearing out the SMU Mustangs 4-0 Friday before defeating Boston College 6-1 two days later. With the win Sunday, the Blue Devils improved their record to 14-4 overall and 7-1 in ACC play. 

After a tough loss to Clemson last weekend snapped its streak of five conference wins, all Duke wanted was to get back on track. And after two weeks on the road, the Blue Devils got to do it on their home court. 

Right off the bat, the Blue Devils crafted a 1-0 lead after a pair of doubles victories. 

Junior Pedro Rodenas and senior Connor Krug dealt the first blow: After an early 1-2 deficit, the duo claimed five of the next six games en route to a 6-3 win. On court one, sophomore Cooper Williams and graduate student Andreja Petrovic were in a similar position, trailing the Mustangs 1-2. As the set went back and forth to settle at a 3-3 tie, the Duke pair persevered to win the next three games, grabbing the doubles point for the Blue Devils. 

Off to an early lead, the Blue Devils were dialed in. As the singles matches unfolded, the Blue Devils won the first set on all six courts.

Up against SMU's Maks Silagy in the No. 5 spot, a three-game run was exactly what Krug needed to secure his first set 6-2. Without stepping off the gas, Krug followed it up with another 6-2 set, claiming the first singles contest and setting the tone for the rest of the day.

On court two, both No. 71 Williams and SMU's Georgi Georgiev were having a good day. After the Duke sophomore surged to an early 5-0 advantage, it was Georgiev's turn. But although the Mustang managed to win three straight games, that was all Williams would give him, delivering a final blow to secure the set 6-3. Before long, Williams took the second set too, 6-1, propelling Duke to a 3-0 lead.

“They're a dangerous team and played well, but I thought across the board we came out ready to go,” head coach Ramsey Smith said. 

Even though his opponent took the early lead, 1-2, it was merely a falter in Rodenas' step. The 36th-ranked Blue Devils' answer was clear as he took the next three games, pushing to a 4-2 lead. After the two competitors traded hit after hit, Rodenas emerged victorious in the end, taking the first set 6-3. The second set proved much the same as Rodenas wrestled his way to 6-3, bringing the team score to 4-0— straight sets across the board.

“It was a collective win,” Smith said. “I was very impressed with the guys today.”

With a resounding win behind them, the air reeked of confidence in Ambler Tennis Stadium, evident as the doubles matches unfolded. 

On court three, junior Gerard Planelles Ripoll and graduate student Remy Dugardin wasted no time establishing dominance with a 6-0 victory. From there, all eyes were on court one, where Williams and Petrovic were trying to recreate their doubles clinch. 

“They both compete extremely well, and they're so good from the ground,” Smith said. “They call themselves the two back team, because when they're two back, they're just pretty dominant.”

As the score hovered at 3-2, the duo went on a four-game run to clear their opponents 6-2, claiming the doubles point for the Blue Devils to give them an early 1-0 advantage. 

It didn't stop there, as Duke took to singles play.

Jake Krug drew first blood for the Blue Devils. Fending off a series of deuces, the senior powered through to a decisive 6-0 set win before dropping the first game of the second set to Boston College's Connor McDonald. Krug went on to win four games in a row. 

With the set at 4-2, McDonald fought back, managing to break Krug's serve and edge closer to a tie. With a fire lit under him, the Blue Devil responded by giving the Eagle a taste of his own medicine. After breaking McDonald's serve to make the score 5-3 — Krug finished the set off with a three-point lead, clinching the second team point of the day for the Blue Devils. A dominant straight-set victory and the Blue Devils's first singles win of the day, a more impressive result given it was only his fourth appearance this season.

“I just know I can count on [Krug],” Smith said. “And I don't know how he does as well as he does, because it's hard when you're not building rhythm.”

Fortunately for Duke, Petrovic kept the rhythm building with a two-set win over Boston College's Caleb Saltz. In set one, the Oslo, Norway, native delivered a masterclass in tennis, taking game after game after game to amass a 5-0 lead. And after conceding a single game to Saltz, Petrovic closed out the set 6-1. A few games later, Petrovic did it again — this time on a break point — winning the set 6-2 and extending Duke's lead to 3-0. 

On court six, a pair of four-game runs built Eagles junior Aidan Pack's straight-set victory. Graduate student Oscar Brown tried but failed to respond, dropping the sets 2-6, 1-6, respectively. 

Still, the Eagles only delayed the inevitable: It wasn't long before Ripoll certified the team win for Duke in the No. 3 spot. After his opponent surged to an early 5-2 lead in the first set, a Boston College win seemed imminent. But Ripoll countered back with a five-game run, claiming the set 7-5. In the next set, the score was 5-2 and the Blue Devil was cruising. Ripoll then spun an ace to win the set and the match, crowning Duke the team victor for the day. 

From there, the dominoes kept falling. Although Duke had already secured the team win on paper, both coaches chose to play through the remaining matches. 

“Every match is a big deal,” Smith said. “We don't have too many of these opportunities left.”

Back in the No. 2 spot, the game was intense. Even with the winning team decided, everyone's eyes were on Connor Krug and the scoreboard. He'd won the first set 6-3, but the second set was a tougher battle. He'd started strong, gliding to a 3-0 lead. But before long it was 3-3, then 4-4 and then 5-5. A match that should've ended a while ago became agonizingly drawn out by Boston College's Andrew Ilie. 

Ilie took the lead for the first time, breaking Krug's serve to get to 6-5. Krug fought back, and then it was a tie. Again. As the seven-point tiebreaker played out, Krug stayed resolute, claiming the match as he broke the tie 7-2. 

With Duke now 5-1, only one match remained. After dropping his first set 2-6, freshman Saahith Jayaraman rallied back to claim the second, 6-4. From there, Jayaraman went on a rampage, clearing out his opponent in a 10-1 tiebreaker; the cherry on top for a weekend of conference victories.

All aboard the ACC train, the Blue Devils look to keep the momentum going as they face No. 37 Florida State and No. 34 Miami at home next weekend.

“The whole goal is to be playing our best tennis in April and May,” Smith said. “I think we're positioning ourselves well for that.”

Djokovic's 7-1 record against Musetti is pretty standard fare for him. When you're No. 1 for 428 weeks, you tend to build a strong head-to- head history against just about everybody. But look a little closer and you can see that the matchup—I won't call it a rivalry—between the Serb and the Italian is more complicated than it might seem.Twice at Roland Garros, Djokovic has come back to beat Musetti in five sets. In 2021, he lost the first two; in 2024, they played until 3 in the morning. The one time that Musetti prevailed was also a marathon three-setter in Monte Carlo. These two like to construct points, they mix in a lot of slice, and they'll finish at net when they can. All of which makes for entertaining, if prolonged, matches.

The other oddity between these two is that they've only played once on hard courts, in Dubai in 2022. The surface should favor Djokovic, who is a six-time champion in Miami. But will his current form favor him, too?In his first two rounds, Djokovic has jumped out to early leads and won in straight sets. But both times he had to go to a tiebreaker, and fight through some shaky patches, to win the second set. The Andy Murray era still seems to be a work in progress as far as how Djokovic wants to play.

Musetti, meanwhile, hadn't found a groove before Miami, either; he was just 4-2 in 2025 coming into the tournament. But he has competed well at this event, coming back from a set down to beat Quentin Halys and Felix Auger-Aliassime. He may find himself hard at work in a third set again on Tuesday.

Korda and Monfils have met just once, but neither of them will need to be reminded of what the other guy plays like. Their lone encounter happened in Indian Wells not much more than a week ago. Monfils won, but it was as tight as two sets can get, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4).Korda is one of a numbers of a players who started slowly in 2025, but have started to show signs of life during the Sunshine Double. The American beat Stefanos Tsitsipas two days ago for his first notable win of the season. Korda is comfortable here; he made his breakthrough in Miami when he reached the quarters as a 20-year-old in 2021.

Monfils, on the other hand, has been very much alive for this entire year so far. Each week, the 38-year-old seems to break another age-related record. In January, he became the oldest man since 1990 to win a title; this week, he became the oldest to reach the round of 16 at a Masters 1000.Befitting a tennis player of his age, though, he hasn't done it the easy way. Monfils won his first match 6-4 in the third, and his last two 7-6 in the third. He'll be on court at noon on Tuesday, after staying to watch his wife, Elina Svitolina, play late into the evening on Monday.

As those scores show, just about every match Monfils plays can go either way, and every one of them can seem to be decided randomly, by a couple of points late in the final set. Maybe after three tight victories, the old dad is due to lose a close one. And maybe Korda, who should be entering his prime at 24, is due to start a surge.

A clenched fist is exactly what Sunday's result felt like for Virginia.

After a gut-wrenching loss Friday to No. 14 California that tested the resilience of the squad, No. 6 Virginia bounced back, taking down No. 8 Stanford 4-2 in a statement win at home Sunday. The weekend served as a full-circle moment for the Cavaliers (12-6, 4-4 ACC), who leaned on their resilience, embraced lineup experimentation and found answers under pressure. 

“This adversity, these tough times — you need to have them to have great times,” Coach Andres Pedroso said he told his team following the match against the Golden Bears. “I don't know when those great moments will come, but they will. And this is a real test of our culture.” 

In Friday's battle against the Golden Bears (13-2, 6-2 ACC), the Cavaliers found themselves in another close match against a top-20 team, but the Golden Bears proved just a little sharper in big moments, handing the Cavaliers a 4-3 loss.

The doubles point slipped just out of the reach for Virginia. With yet another new lineup — graduate student James Hopper and freshman Keegan Rice playing Line 1, sophomore Dylan Dietrich and freshman Rafael Jódar playing Line 2, and juniors Mans Dahlberg and Ty Switzer debuting at Line 3 — the Cavaliers found promise but could not seal the deal. 

After breaking early, Dietrich and Jódar rode their strong baseline games to a 6-4 win on Court 2. The top singles duo turned Line 2 doubles partners capitalized on their strong forehands, translating their strong singles play into doubles.

“It's different,” Dietrich said of partnering with Jódar. “[Jódar] and I play a quicker doubles — hit the ball big and try to finish points fast. It's a different dynamic than with [Dahlberg], where it's more about building the point and being tricky at the net.”

But Hopper and Rice, despite having an early 3-1 lead, couldn't hold the momentum and fell 5-7, while Dahlberg and Switzer were broken midway through and lost 3-6. 

In singles, it was a day of tight sets. At Line 1, Jódar earned a top-10 win 7-6 (4), 7-6 (3), overcoming a controversial call late in the second set that nearly swung the momentum. The win gave Jódar his 14th-straight win and improved his record to 10-0 on the top singles court. At Line 2, Dietrich continued with his strong play, breezing through his match 6-3, 6-3 and dominating points with his big forehands and a handful of aces. 

In the middle of the lineup, freshman Roy Horovitz made his Line 4 singles debut. Still regaining strength after his ACL surgery, Horovitz showed flashes of promise, especially in a dominant second set, but fell 5-7, 6-1, 2-6 in a hard-fought battle. 

“He's dying to play,” Dietrich said of Horovitz. “He's probably the hardest-working guy on the team right now — in rehab, in fitness, in practice. It was awesome to see him back out there. It didn't go his way today, but he fought hard. And we need him. He's working on becoming that rock for us, and I know he'll get there.”

Hopper brought his trademark intensity and fight to Line 5, winning the first set 6-2 and then surviving an epic third-set tiebreak. Down 7-8 at one point, Hopper fought back to win 11-9, drawing cheers from teammates and spectators.

At Line 6, Dahlberg played one of the most intense matches of the day. Up 5-4 in the third set, the match slipped into another tiebreaker, where Dahlberg had a match point at 6-5 but ultimately fell 5-7, ending the match in the Golden Bear's favor.

Less than 48 hours later, the Cavaliers faced off against No. 8 Stanford (13-5, 5-3 ACC) and flipped the script — just as Pedroso had predicted. 

“We're going to make some adjustments from today and just continue to fight hard,” Pedroso said after the California loss. “I challenged the guys to be problem-solving machines, and I think they will be. I think you'll see a better Virginia.”

Another new doubles configuration — this time featuring Rice and Dietrich together for the first time — paid off immediately. The pair brought a fast-paced and aggressive style to Line 2, attacking returns early and controlling rallies to dictate points. Rice's volley game complemented Dietrich's steady presence from the back of the court, allowing the duo to roll to a dominant 6-2 win. 

At Line 3, Hopper and Horovitz showed composure under pressure. The duo earned a crucial break at 5-5 and held serve to clinch the doubles point with a 7-5 victory — a strong debut pairing that blended Hopper's experience with Horovitz's quick energy at the net. 

In singles, freshman Jangjun Kim reentered the lineup and immediately delivered a steady, composed performance at Line 5. Known for his steady play and smart point-building, Kim controlled tempo from the baseline and took advantage of short balls to close quickly at the net. His 6-3, 6-4 win gave Virginia its first singles point and early breathing room in the match.

Stanford, however, clawed back into the match. At Line 6, the Cardinals defeated Dahlberg 6-3, 6-4 and Line 4 saw the Cardinals edge out Hopper in a rollercoaster three-setter, 6-4, 1-6, 6-2. These results leveled the match at 2-2.

With pressure mounting, Dietrich delivered a response. He bounced back from a dropped second set by stepping inside the baseline and overwhelming his opponent with pace to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 at Line 2. He raced through the third set to put the Cavaliers back in front. 

That left it to Rice at Line 3. After dropping the first set 4-6, Rice responded with more energy. He surged through the second set 6-2 to force a decider, but the third was anything but smooth sailing. Rice fell behind multiple times, down a break, but each time, he found answers — grinding out rallies, redirecting pace, and keeping his footwork steady under pressure. Down in the third set, Rice rallied back, breaking his opponent at 5-4 to clinch the match 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 and secure the 4-2 victory for Virginia. 

At Line 1, Jódar's match was left unfinished. He had taken the first set 6-3, dropped a narrow tiebreak in the second, and was tied 1-1 in the third when Rice sealed the win. 

Virginia, despite a rocky ACC slate in which losses, so uncommon in the last handful of seasons, have come with regularity. But Sunday's win felt like a monumental marker and a massive result.

“Any culture can be great when we're winning, but this is a real, true test of our culture, and I know the guys are going to handle it great,” Pedroso said.

The Cavaliers will look to build on Sunday's win as they hit the road next weekend for a pair of ACC matchups, facing Notre Dame and Louisville.

Penn men's tennis junior Manfredi Graziani isn't at Penn to play — he is here to win.


“My first impression of him was that he was a super fiery competitor,” coach Rich Bonfiglio said. “He brought a lot of emotion and just fired it up on court.”
		

Graziani's tennis career began at age four in Italy, and later in Switzerland. He played on the junior circuit until coming to Penn in the fall of 2022. 


His freshman season actually overlapped with the senior season of his brother, who was an Ivy League Player of the Year, three-time first-team All-Ivy, and a two-time NCAA tournament qualifier.

“Having my brother here definitely made my decision easier for where I wanted to play in college,” Graziani said. “So when I got offered a spot, it was hard for me to say no.”


Graziani's decision to compete for Penn and also study Accounting and Finance at Wharton has definitely led to much success for the program. During his freshman year, he led the team in wins with 16, only dropping three matches throughout the season. Graziani also ended Temple's nation-leading 16-match win streak that spring season. During his freshman and sophomore year, Graziani was named an ITA Scholar-Athlete. 
	

Now as a junior, Graziani plays the top seeds in both singles and doubles and continues to be a reliable player for the Quakers.


“He was someone that we could always rely on for a point,” Bonfiglio said. 


Earlier this season, Graziani reached 50 career singles wins. A couple of standout matches came against Yale and Harvard earlier in the season where he took down nationally ranked opponents. Bonfiglio told the DP in an interview that he's expecting Graziani to enter the rankings himself any week now.


According to Graziani, the next goal is to qualify for NCAAs not only as an individual but also as a team. The team recorded a program record for most home wins after a sweep of Liberty and Wagner last weekend. Graziani notably won in singles at No.1 in two sets against Liberty that weekend. Looking ahead to senior year, Graziani also has his eye on an All-American title. 


“He can be a top 50 player in college tennis,” Bonfiglio said. “And he definitely has the ability to make NCAA singles and doubles. He has lofty goals but he also has the ability to go after them.”


Graziani recognizes that he was always talented but credits Penn for helping him develop the skills necessary to succeed at the highest level.


“I've always been talented and a good competitor,"" Graziani said. “But Penn has helped me with consistency. I don't think I achieved my full potential when I was younger because I was lazy, but the coaches here have pushed me and helped me succeed.”


Bonfiglio also recognized Graziani's drive, crediting his ability to find and fix his mistakes while on the court.


“His tennis has obviously improved and he's quite fitter than his freshman year,” Bonfiglio said. “That's something he learned … He knew he wanted to play a very physical game. So he definitely pushes himself, especially in the gym and during speed drills.”

Graziani's success this year has led him to consider possibly taking a year after graduation to play on the professional circuit. 


Although he has yet to make up his mind, he has one more goal he'd like to achieve during his time at Penn.


“My brother was one of the best tennis players Penn has seen,” Graziani said. “So I'm trying to break a few of his records before I leave.”

MIAMI, March  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Tennis star Leylah Fernandez and her family's nonprofit, the Leylah Annie & Family Foundation, have joined forces with First Serve Miami to launch a new community tennis initiative aimed at underserved youth. Announced during the Miami Open celebrations, the program will kick off this summer at Buccaneer Park in Miami Gardens and offer free tennis instruction, mentorship, and academic enrichment for children ages 5 to 18.

“This partnership truly means a lot to me, as it brings together two things I'm incredibly passionate about – giving back to the community and sharing the love of tennis,” said Fernandez, who lives in Miami. “Together, we'll help empower local youth by giving them the tools to grow both on and off the court.”



The initiative will combine the Leylah Annie & Family Foundation's mission to uplift communities through sport with First Serve Miami's longstanding commitment to providing tennis, life skills, and educational opportunities to Miami-area youth. The after-school program will focus on character development, leadership, teamwork, and academic success—alongside athletic training.

“First Serve Miami is thrilled to join forces with the Leylah Annie & Family Foundation to create lasting impact for Miami's youth,” said Angie Rivera, Executive Director of First Serve Miami. “Our shared vision will help provide these young people with the tools they need to succeed in all areas of life.”

The partnership was officially announced at First Serve Miami's fundraising luncheon at Hard Rock Stadium. This year's theme, “Serving Up Tennis through Programs, Parks and Partnerships,” highlights the tennis community's growing efforts to expand access and equity in the sport.

On March 21, the ULM tennis team played in an early morning matchup against Georgia Southern at Heard Stadium and was unable to secure a win in any of the four matches they played. ULM currently has a 3-7 record, but they have not been able to grab a single Sun Belt Conference win.

Freshman Vanja Cado and junior Mariam Hatem started off the doubles matches as they went neck and neck with Georgia Southern. The Eagles fought back and asserted their dominance towards the end, claiming a 6-4 win.

In a similar fashion, sophomore Raquel Alvaro and freshman Tingyi Li rallied hard in the second doubles match but were still defeated 1-6 by Georgia Southern. Additionally, since the Eagles had already won two out of the three games, junior Camila Barranco and sophomore Enna Krnjic had to leave their court three game unfinished.

In the singles matches, ULM's story remained the same, as Alvaro lost to Georgia Southern's Nanaka Kijima on court five. Shortly after, freshman Mariia Iordanova and Hatem both lost their games on courts six and one, respectively, as Georgia Southern secured a 4-0 win. As a result, Li, Cado and Barranco left their games unfinished on courts two, three and four.

ULM did not win a single match in either the doubles or singles games, which extended their losing streak to four and added to their five-game losing streak against Georgia Southern. Historically, ULM has only won two games against Georgia Southern, whereas the Eagles have defeated the Warhawks seven times.

ULM has a tough schedule ahead, as they go up against Sun Belt second-seed Coastal Carolina on March 23 and sixth-seed Marshall on March 29. ULM will be the underdogs in these matches, as they currently rank at the bottom of the Sun Belt Conference.

With the Sun Belt Conference schedule already well underway, the Warhawks will need to regroup quickly as they look to break their slump and secure their first conference victory in upcoming matches.

Sophomore Sein Myoung is now 7-4 overall in her singles matches after her tight comeback victory against Dartmouth's Peyton Capuano. ( Sergio Gonzalez / Daily Titan)

Cal State Fullerton tennis faced an early challenge on Sunday against Dartmouth College at the Titan Courts, winning 6-1 after a dominant display in their singles matches.

The Titans started the match off by dropping the doubles point, falling behind 1-0. 

CSUF fought hard, but fell short in two tightly contested matches. In the No. 1 doubles, Sein Myoung and Milena Gevorgyan battled Peyton Capuano and Michela Moore but couldn't pull out the win, losing 6-4. 

Similarly, the No. 2 duo of Mariia Nikitash and Diana Yanotovskaya came up short against Elizabeth Fahrmeier and Elise Wong, 6-4. 

The No. 3 doubles match was left unfinished after Dartmouth clinched the point. 

CSUF flipped the script in singles, winning all six matches in impressive fashion. 

Nikitash got things rolling with a clinical 6-2, 6-2 win, tying the game at 1-1 for the Titans.

Gevorgyan continued the momentum, defeating Caroline Lemcke 6-1, 7-5 and giving the Titans a 2-1 lead.

Seha Yu then finished No. 2 singles with a dominant 6-1, 6-4 victory, bumpint the Titan lead to 3-1.

CSUF earned their fourth point after Kaytlin Taylor delivered an amazing performance, outlasting Brooke Hess in a second-set tiebreaker to win 6-1, 7-6 (12-10).

Both Myoung and Yanotovskaya showcased their resilience in three-set thrillers.

Myoung lost her first set 6-3, then responded with a 7-6 (7-2) victory in the second set. In the tiebreaker, Myoung outlasted Capuano 1-0 (10-3) to claim the Titans' fifth point.

Similarly, after dropping the first set 6-2, Yanotvskaya stormed back to win the second set 6-3 and sealed the victory with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-4) tiebreaker in the third.

“I'm really proud of how the girls went into the singles. We had some big breakthroughs on a few different matches today, which was really exciting,"" said head coach Ellie Johnson. ""College tennis is such a unique opportunity to have a team environment.""

This win marked their second victory of the week, following a 4-0 win over Drake University. CSUF will look to build on their momentum heading into conference play.

""This is a really good time to have momentum as we have some big conference matches coming up,"" Johnson said. ""I'm really glad that we were able to pull out two wins this week, especially after a tight loss early on.""

Next, the Titans will have two home matches as Big West play resumes. 

They will host UC Davis on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and Long Beach State on Saturday at 11:00 a.m.

Raducanu has struggled with form and fitness issues since her only Grand Slam triumph as a teenager and has worked with a string of different coaches without much success, Vladimir Platenik the latest to leave her team last week after 14 days.

After reaching the third round of this year's Australian Open, Raducanu lost five out of her next six matches but has hit her stride in Miami, easing to a 6-1 6-3 fourth-round win over former French Open semi-finalist Amanda Anisimova on Monday.

""Circumstances change all the time, but for me the biggest thing I'm proud of is finding the competitive spirit and being there for every ball and drawing that out of myself,"" the 22-year-old told reporters after making her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.

""I think that's been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.

""That's the biggest win for me, feeling a lot of hunger, feeling on the court competitive, wanting to run down every ball, and that's the biggest win I from this week.""

Raducanu, who is being helped by coach Mark Petchey in Miami, next plays fourth-seed Jessica Pegula.

""I feel like in my environment, in my surroundings with the people I'm with, pretty relaxed, and I can be myself and expressive and true to myself. That's important,"" she added.

""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just also happy that I was able to transfer onto the court.""

Sam Nivola, who plays Lochlan Ratliff on The White Lotus, revealed why he broke the HBO show's strict NDA and who now knows the fate of his character on the drama series.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for season three, episode six of The White Lotus.

One guest of The White Lotus ignored the hotel's strict do not disturb sign.

Indeed, Sam Nivola—who plays the Ratliff family's youngest child Lochlan alongside Patrick Schwarzenegger's Saxon and Sarah Catherine Hook's Piper on season three—admitted that he broke the show's notoriously strict non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to reveal the fate of his character on the HBO series to a few people closest to him.

“I told my parents, but I haven't told my sister,” the 21-year-old told Variety in an interview published March 23. “She's bad at keeping secrets.”

Sam also told girlfriend Iris Apatow, whose parents are Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, for one simple reason. “I told my girlfriend,” he added, “because she was there while we were shooting it. That's about it.”

And ever since he blabbed to a select few, Sam—who, along with his sister May, is the child of English actress Emily Mortimer and her husband Alessandro Nivola—confessed he has a fear of retribution. 

“I'm not supposed to have told anyone, because I'm under a lot of NDAs,” he quipped. “I'm really scared about getting sued by HBO.”

While Sam has made sure to keep the show's final episodes (mostly) close to his chest, the Perfect Couple alum was up front about his experience filming this season's most recent developments—namely, the shocking alcohol- and drug-fueled moments of incest between his and Patrick's characters. 

""It was very weird kissing Patrick because he's a really good friend of mine,” he explained. “And, you know, I'm straight, he's straight. It's already weird.""

Plus, the much-discussed plot point—which also included Charlotte Le Bon, who plays Chloe—was actually the first sex scene of Sam's career.

""I was totally nervous,"" he shared. ""I'm a very anxious person, so I'm always nervous, especially on a big job like that. Doing the sex scene was nerve-racking, and we were on a boat, and I get seasick, so that was f--king stressful.”

Despite the nerves and discomfort, though, the days on set went well, thanks to the show's creator Mike White.

“The actual scene itself went smoothly,” Sam said. “Mike White was sort of calming about it, and I really trusted Patrick and Charlotte.""

Read on to learn more about the cast of The White Lotus' third season. 

Lalisa Manobal

How you like that? The singer known mononymously as Lisa went from being a rockstar on world stages as part of K-pop group Blackpink—alongside Jisoo, Jennie and Rosé—to donning the White Lotus staff uniform for her big debut as Mook.

Jason Isaacs

Looks like Lucius Malfoy missed the train to Hogwarts and instead landed at The White Lotus. That's right: He may look different without the luscious blond hair, but the Harry Potter star is returning to the screen as another uppity father figure, playing Timothy Ratliff, described as a ""wealthy businessman vacationing with his wife and three children.""

Isaacs has also made more recent appearances on TV shows like Robot Chicken, The Great and Sex Education (alongside his White Lotus costar Aimee Lou Wood.)

Parker Posey

Don't scream when you see it, but Posey—who plays Timothy's wife Victoria Ratliff—may look familiar from her movies Superman Returns, Blade: Trinity, Scream 3 and Dazed and Confused. She's also had brief stints on such TV shows as Parks and Recreation, New Girl, Portlandia and Search Party.

But the real rom-com fans will know her from the 1998 classic You've Got Mail, in which she played Joe Fox's (Tom Hanks) girlfriend Patricia Eden.

Patrick Schwarzenegger

While you may know him best from family photos as the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, he has already made a name for himself acting in Gen V, The Terminal List and The Staircase before playing Saxon Ratliff in season three. 

Sarah Catherine Hook

Prior to taking on the part of the Ratliffs' daughter Piper, Hook got her feet wet in the horror and fantasy genres, portraying Debbie Glatzel in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, Juliette Fairmont in First Kill and Elena Milak in Monsterland.

You may also know her from the 2024 Cruel Intentions remake as Caroline Merteuil or from the Ryan Murphy cinematic universe, in which she played Catherine Allday Davis in Impeachment: American Crime Story about the Bill Clinton–Monica Lewinsky scandal.

Sam Nivola

Nivola—who is dating Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann's daughter Iris Apatow—rounds out the Ratliff family as young Lochlan. But before hitting the shores of Thailand, he was in another show about a rich family at the beach: The Perfect Couple, playing Will Winbury, the son of Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber's Greer and Tag Winbury. He even costarred on the Netflix drama with White Lotus alum Meghann Fahy, who appeared as Daphne Sullivan on season two of the HBO show before playing Merritt Monaco on The Perfect Couple.

Nivola has also acted in White Noise with Adam Driver, Maestro with Bradley Cooper and With/In with Anne Hathaway. 

Natasha Rothwell

Of course, White Lotus fans will recognize Rothwell from season one, in which she played spa guru Belinda in Maui. Not only is she reprising the part for season three, but the actress has also graced the screen in Insecure, Wonka, A Year and Change and Love, Simon. Plus, she lent her comedy chops to Saturday Night Live as a writer from 2014 to 2015.

Leslie Bibb

The Iron Man alum is assembling to play Kate in The White Lotus after portraying Christine Everhart in the Marvel franchise. More recently, she starred in Palm Royale as Dinah Donahue and Jupiter's Legacy as Grace Kennedy-Sampson.

Carrie Coon

The Gilded Age star—who may also look familiar from The Sinner, Fargo and The Leftovers—steps into the role of Laurie, who joins pals Kate and Jaclyn for a girls' trip in Thailand this season.

Michelle Monaghan

While Monaghan plays TV star Jaclyn on The White Lotus, she's also a TV star IRL, having been on True Detective, Bad Monkey, Messiah and The Path. On the big screen, she's starred as Julia in Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Angie Genaro in Gone Baby Gone.

Walton Goggins

You'll feel justified in knowing that it's not all in your head—Goggins really does look familiar. In addition to starring in two Quentin Tarantino movies (playing Billy Crash in Django Unchained and Sheriff Chris Mannix in The Hateful Eight), he is also known for being Boyd Crowder in Justified from 2010 to 2015.

Aimee Lou Wood

The English actress joins the cast in season three as free-spirited Chelsea, who has an age-gap romance with Goggins' character Rick Hatchett. Yet, she is best known for her role as Aimee Gibbs on Netflix's Sex Education and also appeared in Seize Them! and Daddy Issues.

Lek Patravadi

Her acting credits may trace back 50 years—starting with Grounded God in 1975—but she most recently portrayed Prani Chiraanan on In Family We Trust in 2018.

Tayme Thapthimthong

The singer and former military man has acting credits that include Mechanic: Resurrection, Skin Trade and Paradox, as well as playing Pao on the TV series Farang.

Christian Friedel

If 13 minutes wasn't enough time to figure out where you recognize the German actor, allow us to refresh your memory. He played Rudolf Höss in The Zone of Interest, Reinhold Gräf in Babylon Berlin and Georg Elser in 13 Minutes.

Dick Van Dyke and his wife, Arlene Silver, changed up their looks to match two musical icons.

On Sunday, March 23, Silver, 52, took to her Instagram account to post a video montage with photos of her and the 99-year-old entertainment legend dressed up as country stars Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers performing their 1983 chart-topping song ""Islands in the Stream.""

The Mary Poppins star wore a cream-colored suit with a white button-down shirt underneath and sported white facial hair similar to the late singer's. Meanwhile, Silver donned a bedazzled purple dress paired with a large diamond necklace and blonde wig, which emulated Parton's voluminous hair and signature look.

Silver captioned her post, ""Dick & Arlene Van Dyke as Dolly Parton & Kenny Rogers 🏝️ 🌊 Luke Adams as Anything For A Laugh: The Chuck Barris Page ❤️🎈❤️.""

The husband and wife duo, who wed in 2012, were seemingly dressing up for a ""Vandy Manor"" show. It is unclear when the photos were taken. The couple has been throwing a Halloween ""Spooktacular"" event for years called ""Vandy Manor"" at their Malibu California home and are now doing another event called ""Vandy Camp,"" which they started earlier this month.

They held their first ""Vandy Camp"" event on Saturday, March 8, consisting of a Q&A for the six-time Emmy Award winner and multiple musical performances from him and Silver. Fans and friends attended the intimate event.

In July 2024, the comedian spoke to Entertainment Tonight about meeting his sweetheart at the SAG Awards in 2006.

""I never approached a strange woman in my life,"" Van Dyke told the outlet. ""And she walked by and I jumped and said, 'Hi, I'm Dick.' I had no idea she was half my age. Beautiful.""

Silver was a makeup artist then, and the former sitcom star explained, ""She had one [business] card left, which I took and hired her,"" he noted.

Silver revealed Van Dyke was the person who got her comfortable to sing, telling the publication, ""He's always happy and just positive. Always singing, and I would never sing in public. He got me to sing. He got me to sing up on a stage and sang in front of 1,500 people for the first time. He's just the most joyful person. He influences everybody else to be more joyful, playful.""

Taylour Paige is pregnant!

The 34-year-old actress, best known for movies like Zola and Magazine Dreams, announced her happy news in an Instagram post on Monday (March 24). 

This will be the first child for Taylour and her husband, fashion designer Rivington Angulo. They have been married since October 2022. 

Taylour posted a photo of herself wearing a form-fitting white dress that hugged her baby bump. She didn't include a caption, but her celebrity friends posted their excitement in the comments section. 

""We're readyy,"" Georgie Flores said. ""Omg YEASSS. Sooo happy for you 😍,"" Lily Collins wrote. ""Oh Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍,"" Aja Naomi King commented.

People reports that Taylour stepped out and revealed her baby bump while attending Essence's Black Women In Hollywood Awards in late February. A video shows her chatting with friends while her bump was on display. ","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Nia Long shared a cryptic message amid speculation that she and daytime talk show host Sherri Shepherd had a heated confrontation at a Broadway show.

During Monday's (March 24) broadcast of the ""Sherri"" show, Shepherd revealed that she had a tense exchange with an unnamed celebrity during Sunday's (March 23) premiere of ""Othello,"" a Broadway production starring Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal. 

Shepherd said she was conversing with friends when the celebrity physically turned her around and accused her of ""shading"" them on her daytime show.

“I'm standing there talking. Somebody grabbed my arms, and they forcefully turned me around,” Shepherd recalled on Monday's broadcast. “So I'm in a good mood, so I go, ‘Hi, what's going on?' 'cause I know her. And she says to me, she goes, ‘You've been shading me a lot.'”

Despite Shepherd denying the accusation, ""She goes, ‘Yes you have,' and then she just walked off,” the host said.

The comedian said she was confused by the confrontation because she doesn't ""shade many people.""

""It might be one person I shade and I … I never have shaded this unnamed celebrity,"" she said.

“I would say to unnamed celebrity because you think I shaded you — which means you watch my show — I don't know who you think I am. I think you got me confused with somebody, one of the bloggers or the influencers, because I know I didn't shade you,"" Shepherd added.

As fan speculation swirled over who the unnamed celebrity was, Page Six reported that the confrontation unfolded between Shepherd and Long.

Long shared a cryptic post on Instagram on Monday as rumors swirled about the alleged Broadway battle.

""About last night..."" the actress wrote with a kissing face emoji.

One fan interpreted the post as a ""classy"" response from Long amid the reports.

“Classy, no response is the response,” one person commented.

""Gangsta Nia Long, rolling up to Sherri on Broadway, I can't 😩😆,"" another said.

Jason Issacs is passing his wand over to another wizard.

The actor, who played Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, has a specific actor in mind to take over the role for the upcoming HBO TV series. In fact, Issacs would like to see the role gender-swapped, he told Variety in a recent interview.

""Meryl Streep,"" Issacs said when asked who he would cast in the part. ""She can do anything, that woman. There's literally no limit to what she can do.""

As for any advice for those entering the Wizarding World, Issacs said he doesn't have any to give.

""I wouldn't have any advice at all. Why would I bother? I know some of the people they're casting already. They're brilliant actors. It's going to be fantastic, and the last thing they need is advice from some old fart like me,"" Issacs said.

HBO announced in June 2024 that Francesca Gardiner will serve as the series' showrunner, while Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct episodes. The network also released an official synopsis for the show at that time.

The show ""will be a faithful adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter book series by author and executive producer J.K. Rowling,"" the synopsis reads. ""The series will feature a new cast to lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail and much-loved characters Harry Potter fans have loved for over twenty-five years.""

PARIS (AP) — French actor Gérard Depardieu acknowledged Tuesday that he used crude and heated language around a woman who accuses him of sexual assault and grabbed her hips but denied assaulting her, as he testified for the first time at his landmark trial in Paris.

She told the court that he'd behaved “like a madman” who took “pleasure in frightening me.”

Day 2 of the Paris trial centered on the Oscar-nominated actor's behavior during the filming in 2021 of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.

The 76-year-old has denied assaulting the women. But during more than an hour of testimony Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.

Depardieu said he'd been in a “bad mood"" because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.

“I understand perfectly if she's a bit upset,” he said in his gruff, deep voice so familiar to cinemagoers. “I don't have to talk like that, get angry like that, voilà.""

But he insisted that he isn't a sexual predator. “I'm not touching the butts of women,” Depardieu said.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict isn't expected immediately after the trial.

Plaintiff details alleged assault

The set dresser testified after Depardieu. She described the alleged assault in detail, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.

She said he grabbed her hips then started “palpating” her behind and ""in front, around.” She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.

“That's when I had a reflex of ‘My God.' I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn't do it,"" she testified. “He terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.""

“It was very brief, there was no shouting,” she said, adding that she'd been too “petrified” to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu's hands from her.

“I saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that's what I felt, it's savagery,” she said. ""He terrified me, and that amused him.”

She said Depardieu's calm and cooperative attitude in court bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.

“Here, he's exemplary, he doesn't move, he's quiet, he doesn't make any noise,"" she said. “He's not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.""

On the movie set, “he started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities,” she said.

The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.

Depardieu acknowledges boorish behavior

Because of Depardieu's fame and impact on the French movie industry, his trial is seen as an important test of French willingness to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.

His long and storied career — he told that court that he's made more than 250 movies — has turned him into a giant of the French movie industry. French President Emmanuel Macron has included himself among Depardieu's many admirers, calling him a “great actor” who ""makes France proud.” That was in 2023, when the star was already facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.

In his testimony, Depardieu said he'd noticed that the set dresser had been taken aback by his behavior and language. He acknowledged that he sometimes has a potty mouth and that his behavior can be boorish.

“I've always been told I have a Russian nature, I don't know if it's because of the drinking or the vulgarity,” he said. “I have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.""

But he said he “never, ever” would have pincered a woman between his legs against her will.

“I'm not like that,"" he said.

Drew Barrymore was abruptly ghosted after a first date and did not see it coming. 

The 50 First Dates actress opened up about the ""cryptic"" experience during Monday's (March 24) episode of her eponymous talk show. 

""Drew Crew"" members Valerie Bertinelli and Ross Matthews agreed with Barrymore before the host highlighted the relatability of her circumstance. 

 ""It does happen to all of us! The best of us, good people, who wouldn't treat other people like that necessarily.""

The Never Been Kissed star also read the text message to her friends, who helped her analyze its meaning. 

""Today, my friend said, ‘Well, did he answer the ha with one a?' I'm not kidding. This happened. And I was like, ‘No, it was like five or six a's.' And they were like, 'Oh no, that's great!'""

Barrymore revealed that the surprising text ultimately saved her time because she would never continue to date someone who communicated so poorly, encouraging the audience to steer clear of ""people who waste our time.""

Jamie Lee Curtis was shocked by the ""scale"" of the Los Angeles wildfires.

The 66-year-old actress is a resident of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which was badly damaged by the wildfires earlier this year, and Jamie has admitted to being astonished by the scale of the destruction.

The Hollywood star - whose home survived the wildfires - told 'Extra': ""It's f*****. Sorry … it's awful, it's an absolute catastrophe at a scale and magnitude that I didn't know when I flew home.""

Jamie admitted that she struggled to comprehend the scale of the damage.

The 'Knives Out' star explained: ""The dawning understanding of the severity of this is hard to imagine, and yet, like any community that faces adversity, people have come together and, you know, it's a trauma for sure. It is gnarly.""

Jamie previously described the situation in Los Angeles as a ""catastrophe"".

The actress said on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon': ""As you know, where I live is on fire right now. The entire city of Pacific Palisades is burning.

""I flew here last night, I was on the plane, started getting texts and it's f****** gnarly, you guys. It's just a catastrophe in southern California.

""Everything: the market I shop in, the schools my kids go to. Many, many, many friends now have lost their homes. So it's a really awful situation.""

Jamie also urged TV viewers to lend their support to people affected by the wildfires.

The actress - who donated $1 million to the fire recovery efforts - said: ""It's a really awful situation. I am, you know, obviously going to go home first thing tomorrow and be with my family and try to help my friends.

""But it is - just so I can tell you, if you know anybody on the west coast or not, the American red cross, support them.""

Speaking to 'Extra', Jason explained: ""It's huge.

Inger believes Jason - who advocates for coral reef preservation, marine protection and global initiatives against plastic pollution - can help to raise awareness of environmental issues.

She said: ""With a huge audience of engaged fans, we believe that Jason can move ocean considerations into the hearts and minds of citizens and business leaders to promote this urgency and action.""

President Donald Trump has slammed George Clooney as a ""second-rate movie 'star'"".

The US leader has blasted the actor and the TV show 60 Minutes following the 63-year-old's appearance on the programme over the weekend in a rant in which he also dismissed George as a ""failed political pundit"".

Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump fumed: ""Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total 'puff piece' on George Clooney, a second-rate movie 'star', and failed political pundit.

""He fought hard for Sleepy Joe's election and then, right after the debate, dumped him like a dog. Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for Kamala, only to soon realise that that was not going to work out too well.""

""60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before election day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history... And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!""

In his 60 Minutes interview to promote his Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck, George discussed the parallels between the turbulent media and political landscape in the play and in the US today.

He said: ""When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed.

""ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration. And CBS News is in the process... We're seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations — to make journalists smaller.

""Governments don't like the freedom of the press. They never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you're on. They don't like the press.""

He also addressed the op-ed piece he wrote for the New York Times last year calling on then-President Joe Biden to step down as the Democrat candidate in the 2024 election.

He said: ""I'll make it kind of easy. I was raised to tell the truth.

""I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised. And so I feel as if there were a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that.

""And I was not proud of that. And I also believed I had to tell the truth.""

When his essay was published, George was again blasted by Trump, who branded him a ""fake movie actor"" who ""never came close to making a great movie"".

He added: ""What does Clooney know about anything?

Production on the next James Bond film is reportedly underway.

Following Amazon's US$1 billion (S$1.34 billion) acquisition of the franchise, sources say the movie has been ""fast-tracked"" and is being dubbed Bond 26.

It was revealed last month Amazon MGM had taken full creative control of the 007 film franchise after the company struck a deal with its long-time producers Michael G Wilson, 82, and Barbara Broccoli, 63.

While the pair remain co-owners of the franchise, Amazon now has control over all future productions — a decision that has sparked concern among fans it will spawn a flood of content featuring 007.

According to The Sun, the next instalment in the film series is expected to have a budget of £250 million (S$432.5 million), in line with the cost of Daniel Craig's final outing as 007 in No Time to Die.

The newspaper reported the film is due to be released by the end of 2027, with a source stating: ""The Bond bosses had already proposed broad plots and reboot ideas. The writers' rooms are being assembled in the hope of recouping their investment ASAP.""

Bond films have traditionally been released in October or November.

The search for Daniel's replacement has intensified in recent weeks, with actors including Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 33, Harris Dickinson, 27, and James Norton, 38, rumoured to be in contention to fill his shoes as 007.

According to Puck, producers David Heyman, 62, known for his work on the Harry Potter films, and Amy Pascal, 65, who produced Tom Holland's Spider-Man films, are in talks to develop the project.

In March 2024, reports emerged Aaron Taylor-Johnson had secured the role, but the actor distanced himself from the claims, stating: ""I don't feel like I need to have a future drawn out for me. I feel like, whatever's drawn out for me, I can f****** do better.""

Amazon's acquisition of the Bond franchise is expected to lead to spin-off projects, though a source stated the company ""knows fans want and expect a movie"" and ""wants filming to be done by the end of next year"".

Bollywood's popular playback singer, Neha Kakkar, is once again making headlines, but this time not for her musical talent. The singer, known for her hit songs like ""Badri Ki Dulhaniya,"" ""Coca Cola,"" and ""Sunny Sunny,"" has recently found herself at the center of controversy after a video of her emotional outburst at a live concert in Melbourne went viral.

Neha, who gained fame as a contestant on Indian Idol before becoming one of Bollywood's top singers, was performing at a concert in Melbourne, but arrived three hours late. In the viral video, the singer is seen breaking down in tears on stage, apologising to her fans for the delay. ""You guys are so sweet! You've waited for so long. I hate making anyone wait. I'm so sorry!"" Neha said through her tears, clearly overwhelmed. She continued, ""This means a lot to me. I will always remember this evening. You guys have managed time for me, and I'll make sure to make you all dance tonight.""

Despite her emotional apology, the video has sparked mixed reactions from the audience. Some fans defended her, appreciating her sincerity, while others were far less forgiving. The live crowd can be heard in the video expressing frustration with the situation. ""This is not India, you're in Australia!"" one person can be heard saying. Others sarcastically mocked her by commenting, ""Go back! We've been waiting for three hours. Great acting!"" and ""This is not Indian Idol.""



The singer, who has also been a judge on Indian Idol, has faced criticism for being inconsiderate toward her audience. Many social media users pointed out that as a professional, she should have ensured better timing and communication with her fans. Some even accused her of creating a ""drama"" for attention, while others expressed concern over why she was so late in the first place.

While Neha's fans are divided over the incident, many are curious to know the real reason behind her late arrival. Although she hasn't publicly addressed the delay, this incident has certainly overshadowed her musical achievements for the moment.

Neha Kakkar, who has long been a favorite in Bollywood music, is known for her catchy tracks and vibrant personality, but her recent Melbourne concert drama has ignited debate across social media. Whether it's an emotional outpouring or a PR mishap, only time will tell how this incident impacts her public image.

BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Kangana Ranaut has entered the ongoing controversy surrounding comedian Kunal Kamra's parody video, where the comedian aimed at Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister, Eknath Shinde. Although Kamra did not explicitly name Shinde, he used the term ‘gaddar' (traitor) and included several subtle references to the Maharashtra politician, including mentions of Thane and a leader who “hides in Guwahati.”


Ranaut, known for her outspoken views, strongly condemned Kamra's actions, accusing him of “abusing Indian people and culture” for the sake of fleeting attention. She expressed her displeasure, stating that such parodies degrade the integrity of society. “We should think where society is heading when someone does this only for 2 minutes of fame,” Kangana said during a media interaction.

Drawing a parallel between Kamra's recent controversy and her legal struggles, Ranaut compared the BMC's action at The Habitat venue, where Kamra recorded the parody, to the demolition of her own property. While the BMC action was deemed legal, Ranaut called the demolition of her bungalow “illegal.” Her comments further focused on the broader issue of defaming individuals and their reputations.

In a particularly sharp critique, she questioned the credibility of individuals like Kamra, who engage in such parody acts. “You might be anyone, but insulting and defaming someone. A person for whom his/her respect is everything, and you insult and disregard them. Who are these people, and what are their credentials? If they can write, they should do so in literature,” she remarked.

Ranaut continued her criticism, adding, “Abusing people and our culture in the name of comedy... This has been done legally, but what had been done (demolishing of my bungalow) was illegally done.”



Kamra's parody video, which poked fun at Eknath Shinde, was a satirical take on the political turmoil following the Maharashtra elections, where Shiv Sena split from the BJP and internal shifts within the NCP created confusion. In the video, Kamra sang a parody of a popular song, mocking Shinde's political actions and labelling him a “dalbadlu” (turncoat). The lyrics of the parody included references to Thane, and a playful jab at Shinde's alleged hiding in Guwahati, a reference to his brief stay there during the political crisis.

The parody, which entertained the audience at the venue, also sparked a significant backlash from Shiv Sena workers. They stormed The Habitat, where the video was recorded, and vandalised the property. The enraged workers later filed a police complaint against Kamra. An FIR has been lodged against both the comedian and the Sena workers who were involved in the vandalism.

A recent incident further fueled the fire when a video surfaced, criticising Dhanashree Verma. The video, shared by YouTuber Shubhankar Mishra, portrayed Dhanashree as a ""gold digger."" In the clip, Mishra claimed that Dhanashree faced difficulties starting her new life post-divorce and insinuated that she was benefiting financially from the split. He also mocked her, saying, “If you're getting money, that gives you empowerment. So, shouldn't you also say that you are a self-made woman?”

What caught the public's attention was the reaction of Ritika Sajdeh, the wife of cricketer Rohit Sharma. She liked the video, which many interpreted as a subtle endorsement of the criticism aimed at Dhanashree. The move sparked outrage among fans, with many speculating that Ritika was supporting Chahal in this messy situation and blaming Dhanashree for the divorce.

The viral clip and Ritika's ""like"" have set social media abuzz, with netizens discussing whether Ritika's action was intentional or simply a casual gesture. While some believe it indicates her support for Chahal, others are uncertain of her motives.

Yuzvendra Chahal and Dhanashree Verma's relationship had been a subject of public fascination ever since they tied the knot in 2020. However, within just three years, the couple announced their separation. The divorce was finalised on March 20, 2025, and they have reportedly been living apart for the past 18 months.

The divorce has drawn significant media attention, especially after Chahal's lawyer confirmed the split in a statement to ANI. While Chahal has been busy with his IPL commitments, Dhanashree has continued to be active on social media, releasing new music videos, which fans speculate may also be linked to her personal life.

As the controversy unfolds, both Chahal and Dhanashree seem to be keeping their personal reasons under wraps, letting the public and social media speculate on the real cause of their split. However, Ritika Sajdeh's recent actions have only added fuel to the fire, and it seems that the drama surrounding their divorce is far from over.
