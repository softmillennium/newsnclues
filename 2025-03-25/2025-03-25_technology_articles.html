                <p>An investment of $ 21 billion in the US announced the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai just a few days before the planned introduction of new cells by President Donald Trump. The plan includes the construction of a steel plant in Louisiana for $ 5.8 billion, which produces 2.7 million tonnes of steel annually and creates over 1,400 jobs. It also includes an investment of $ 9 billion to increase production to 1.2 million vehicles per year by 2028 and six billion dollars to develop technological partnerships in robotics and AI. The company also announced investments in the expansion of cars in the US and technology development, including autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.

Trump described this step as evidence of customs policy efficiency and announced that it would announce another duties on vehicle import this week. It could also hit South Korea, which has a significant trade surplus with the US. At the same time, Hyundai will inaugurate a new car factory and batteries in Georgia for $ 7.59 billion. After launching all three US Hyundai plants, it plans to achieve annual production capacity of one million vehicles, BBC reports. Photo: Unsplash</p></b>

                <p>Infinite Reality, a media, ecommerce, and marketing company, has acquired Napster for $207 million.

 

The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company plans to turn Napster into a "social music platform" where artists can connect with and monetize their relationships with fans.


Napster has been operating as a streaming service since 2016, claiming over 110 million high-fidelity tracks, including lossless audio. Subscribers can listen offline and watch music videos, starting at $11 per month.

 

Infinite's CEO John Acunto mentioned Algorand's blockchain background as an appealing factor in the acquisition.</p></b>

                <p>Databricks, a company that helps big businesses build custom artificial intelligence models, has developed a machine learning trick.

The technique can boost the performance of an AI model without the need for clean labelled data.


Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, spent the past year talking to customers about the key challenges they face in getting AI to work reliably. The problem is dirty data.

”Everybody has some data, and has an idea of what they want to do,” Frankle says. But the lack of clean data makes it challenging to fine-tune a model to perform a specific task.

Databricks' model could allow companies to eventually deploy their own agents to perform tasks, without data quality standing in the way.


The technique offers a rare look at some of the key tricks that engineers are now using to improve the abilities of advanced AI models, especially when good data is hard to come by.

The method leverages ideas that have helped produce advanced reasoning models by combining reinforcement learning with “synthetic,” or AI-generated training data.</p></b>

                <p>The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $224.99.

At its core, the Colorsoft is a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition with a color screen, utilizing E Ink's color screen technology that provides more vibrancy than Kobo's Libra Colour.

The resulting contrast and color make browsing and reading books (or comics!) more pleasant and engaging, but don't expect glossy, high-res images like on a dedicated tablet. 

The Colorsoft benefits from all the upgrades you'll find on Amazon's newer Kindles, including an auto-adjusting front light, robust IPX8 waterproofing, and faster page-turning performance.

You'll also get up to two months of battery life and wireless charging, 32GB of storage, and zero ads. 

It's the e-reader to get if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon.</p></b>

                <p>Top intelligence officials from the Trump regime, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, appeared before lawmakers on Tuesday where they were asked about a Signal group chat that accidentally included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine.

The big takeaway: the officials insisted that none of the information they discussed was classified, but refused to share the information that was discussed and when asked whether the Atlantic editor could share it with the public, they wouldn’t give the green light for him to do that either. 

Ratcliffe and Gabbard were testifying to the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday for a hearing that had been scheduled long before the story in The Atlantic broke Monday.

Ratcliffe kept suggesting the information wasn’t classified, but the more he talked it started to become clear he was wording his answer carefully enough to simply say he hadn’t shared any classified intelligence over the chat. 

Gabbard attempted to stonewall much more than Ratcliffe, often refusing to answer the most basic questions under the pretext that an investigation was ongoing.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was the first to ask Gabbard if she was involved in the group chat and right off the bat she wouldn’t answer.

“So you refuse to acknowledge whether you are on this group chat?” Warner asked. “Senator, I’m not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said.

Democratic Sen. Reed of Rhode Island also asked Gabbard if she was overseas at any point during the group chat discussions. Gabbard said that she was but refused to answer a question from Reed about whether she was using an official government-issued phone or her personal device.

“It was also discussed in the hearing that one of the people on the chat, top Trump advisor and unofficial Secretary of State, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin while the chat was taking place,”

The Democratic senators made quite a dramatic show Tuesday in the face of stonewalling by Gabbard. 

Gabbard was also asked by Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona about what she considers classified information, and Gabbard wouldn’t give a straight answer.

Later in the hearing, Sen. Warner of Virginia asked why they wouldn’t just share the information at issue since they kept insisting it wasn’t classified.

“And that desire to have it both ways could present some serious issues if the most sensitive parts of their chat are ultimately released,”

Goldberg spoke to the news about not including many details in his article because he was trying to protect national security. 

Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said there appeared to be crimes committed and called for the resignation of top officials, “starting with the national security advisor and the secretary of defense.”

The secretary of defense will face any real consequences is unclear.

Hegseth was asked about the scandal on Monday and insisted “nobody was texting war plans,” a claim contradicted by Goldberg’s reporting. 

For his part, Trump has defended his officials, telling NBC News in a phone interview Tuesday that the job of his national security advisor was safe, at least for now.

Trump reportedly said, “Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,” insisting it was, “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.”</p></b>

                <p>People are often selective about the information they accept, seeking out sources that confirm their biases while discounting those that challenge their beliefs.

Search engines could potentially change this by prioritizing results from high-quality, credible sources, but people have learned to game the algorithms used by search engines.


The study found that people tend to devise search terms that are specific enough to ensure that the results will end up reinforcing their existing beliefs. 

Invisible swapping of search terms to something more general can go a long way toward enabling people to change their mind.

The researchers, Eugina Leung and Oleg Urminsky, focused on a simple question: is caffeine good or bad for you? They found that using neutral search terms like "what are the health effects of caffeine" would get a mixture of pros and cons.</p></b>

                <p>Google has announced the debut of Gemini 2.5, an experimental version of its AI model.

The new AI model is currently available for developers and Gemini Advanced users. It's only been a few months since the release of Gemini 2.0, but Google is already moving on to the next update - Gemini 2.5.


Gemini 2.5 Pro is the first release of the 2.5 generation, which is a thinking model capable of reasoning through thoughts before responding. It comes with a 1 million token context window and will expand to 2 million soon.

According to Google, Gemini 2.5 outperforms some of the most popular AI models across various benchmarks, including reasoning, science, and mathematics. The company achieved this feat by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training.


Gemini 2.5 has made significant improvements in coding performance compared to Gemini 2.0. Google claims that it can create "visually compelling web apps and agentic code applications." To demonstrate its capabilities, Google shared a video of the AI generating a game based on a text prompt.</p></b>

                <p>The Pentagon warned against using Signal in a memo just last week, according to NPR.

The memo was delivered department-wide days before The Atlantic published a bombshell revelation that its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg had been erroneously added to a Signal group chat that involved detailed discussions of planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.


Members in the Signal chat included U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President J.D. Vance, among others.

The Pentagon wrote in its memo, “Russian professional hacking groups are employing the ‘linked devices’ features to spy on encrypted conversations.”

A linked device allows users to sign into their account from multiple places, and incoming and outgoing messages appear on all devices.


Because Signal is end-to-end encrypted and messages are only stored locally on devices with an encryption key, hackers can create malicious phishing pages or QR codes associated with group chats, which users can send to one another as invites.

The Pentagon's memo states that after gaining access to the malicious code, groups can add their own device as a linked device, allowing them to view every message sent by the unwitting user in real time, bypassing the end-to-end encryption.


Signal has defended its security practices and outlined the great lengths it has gone to prevent itself from being able to access user data.

But at the end of the day, neither Signal nor end-to-end encryption technology is going to protect someone sharing classified war plans in an open group chat.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was involved in a Signal group chat that included discussions of planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.


White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been on the defensive trying to put out this latest fire, posting on X again on Tuesday to say that no war plans or otherwise classified materials were discussed in the chat.

An investigation into how a journalist was added to the conversation remains ongoing.</p></b>

                <p>The Last of Us Part II is a video game where key facts are dispersed to create maximum emotional impact.

Part of what makes the game great is the dispersal of information, but this will be different for character Abby in the TV show season two.


In the game, Abby's backstory is revealed only after playing as her in the second half. This allows players to form an empathic connection with her and makes the mystery of her past more impactful when it is eventually revealed.


Game and show creator Neil Druckmann confirmed that Abby's backstory will be revealed much earlier in the TV show due to a few reasons. One reason is that, unlike in the game, viewers are not playing as Abby and therefore need other tools to form an empathic connection with her.


Druckmann explained that because players don't play as Abby in the game, they can withhold certain information to make it a mystery that will be revealed later. However, since viewers are watching a show rather than playing a game, this approach won't work.

The second reason Druckmann mentioned is that if the backstory was revealed at the same time as in the game, viewers would have to wait a long time to get context and it might get spoiled between seasons.</p></b>

                <p>9,000 units of Intel Arc A580 were sold on eBay.

There are 62 sales of Intel Arc A750.

Nvidia's 40-series and 50-series GPUs all showed over 100 sales.

The most popular GPU on eBay for the past month was the RTX 4090 with 708 sales.

AMD's 7700 XT, 7600 XT, and 7600 combined for only 88 total sold listings.

A person who works for Nvidia said they "thought" that the supply of consumer graphics cards would catch up to demand by May or June.


 
The numbers we've seen suggest 150K~175K wafer starts per month (WSPM) for 5nm-class nodes.

At the same time, the latest GPU market share numbers suggest all desktop GPUs combined account for over eight million graphics cards sold per quarter.

Using the relatively small BMG-G21 die of Intel's Battlemage cards (272 sqmm), die per wafer calculators suggest Intel would only get about 210 chips at most from a single wafer.


 
The economics aren't in favor of gamers getting a lot more GPUs any time soon.</p></b>

                <p>Apple will host its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) online from June 9-13 this year.

The company will open with a special event at Apple Park on June 9, similar to in-person events held in recent years. The rest of the week, developers can log on to learn about new features coming to various Apple operating systems.

We expect Apple to reveal updates for iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and tvOS 19 on Apple TV during WWDC.

The event may also include an update on VisionOS-like makeover for iOS 19, which has been hinted at through apps like Invites. The interface is expected to have a more photo-centric design.

Apple's redesign of macOS 16 will likely match its mobile counterparts, with icons featuring translucent windows and circular iconography.

Developers can attend WWDC in person by signing up to request attendance, while others can join online through the WWDC portal or YouTube channel.</p></b>

                <p>Demand for AMD’s latest Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards is high.

The demand for Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT add-in boards (AIB) is close to impossible to get at its recommended price in the U.S., Europe, or anywhere else.

AMD claims that its latest Radeon RX 9070 XT discrete GPU for desktop PCs is its most successful standalone AMD Radeon graphics card ever in terms of first-week sales.


Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, said in an interview that the Radeon RX 9070 XT outsold its predecessors by a factor of 10 in the first week.

"The Radeon RX 9070 XT has been a fantastic success," Lisa Su said. "It is the number one selling [graphics card] of all of the AMD Radeon generations for first-week sales by far, 10X higher than previous generations."

First-week sales are a very interesting metric that reflects how many products were stockpiled for early birds and how many early birds were willing to buy them in the first week of sales.

However, it does not reflect how many GPUs per launch quarter AMD sells, which is perhaps a more traditional metric.


Pictures of AMD's Navi 48 GPUs indicate that the parts were assembled in late October, 2024, so the company has been stockpiling Navi 48 graphics processing units for months before formally introducing them on March 6, 2025.

AMD shipped about 1.43 million discrete desktop GPUs to its partners in Q4 2024, and it is unlikely that these were outgoing RDNA 3-based processors.


With its family of GPUs based on the RDNA 4 microarchitecture, AMD decided not to pursue the high-end segment of the market, leaving them entirely for Nvidia with its products like the GeForce RTX 5080 ($999) and GeForce RTX 5090 ($1,999).

Instead, the company focused on the performance-mainstream segment and currently offers Radeon RX 9070 at a $549 MSRP and Radeon RX 9070 XT at a $599 MSRP.


Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX launched at $899–$999 in mid-December, 2022, and supplies weren't particularly large.

When it comes to Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT ($579–$649, launched mid-November, 2020) and Radeon RX 6900 XT ($999, early December, 2020), those products were launched amid the COVID-19 pandemic and are known for their low stock availability at launch; they sold out the first day.


As for AMD's 2019 products — the Radeon VII (Vega 20, early 2019) for $699, Radeon Vega Frontier Edition for $999–$1,499 (Vega 10, June, 2019), and Radeon RX 5700 XT and RX 5700 XT AE for $399–$499 (July, 2019) were also aimed at different market segments.


The graph based on data from JPR clearly indicates that AMD has consistently sold fewer graphics cards in their ‘halo GPU’ launch quarters than in their previous cycles.

There were exceptions in 2016–2017, but mainly because AMD’s Radeon R9 Fury and Radeon 300-series GPUs failed to gain any significant popularity in 2015.

The overall trend is that sales of AMD’s desktop GPUs are declining — a trend that reflects not only industry dynamics but also the company’s market share losses to Nvidia.


Has AMD managed to do beat the prior records with RDNA 4? We don't know yet.</p></b>

The task force is investigating at least 48 instances related to Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations this month, with at least seven cases being investigated in conjunction with local law enforcement.

The agency's newly formed 10-person task force will deploy ATF personnel and FBI Counterterrorism Division personnel to investigate the incidents.

ATF is embedding personnel in some FBI field offices, starting in San Antonio, Texas.

There were previously three arrests related to the attacks.</p></b>

                <p>Hisense has released enormous 75-inch and 85-inch Canvas TV models.

 

The Canvas TVs have an anti-glare, matte display and a slim wall mount that helps hide the fact you're nailing an oversized screen to your living room wall.

 

These larger Canvas TVs support Art Mode to display a slideshow of "curated artwork" or personal photography.

 

Hisense is trying to capitalize on these stealth TVs as Samsung has been selling The Frame for close to eight years and claimed it sold more than 1 million units in 2021.

 

Samsung started offering its Art Store to owners of its Neo QLED and QLED TV models alongside its Frame last year.

 

The company debuted a Music Frame for even more hidden audio in a unit that looks like a typical picture frame.

 

Hisense's equivalent size Canvas goes for $1,000 on Amazon before any discount.

 

Customers seem to prefer TVs that don't look like TVs as TCL debuted its NXTVision and NXTVision Pro frame TVs last year.

 

TCL's "Pro" models are still coming soon.

 

The cost of traditional flatscreens may be pushed further down if people keep buying picture frame TVs.</p></b>

                <p>President Donald Trump nominated private astronaut Jared Isaacman to become chief of NASA nearly four months ago.

 
The nomination has yet to receive a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

The space community generally supports Isaacman, who has flown to space twice on private Crew Dragon missions and raised charitable funds. He has been working to build support through conversations with people in the space community and officeholders.

Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican chair of the Senate committee, is a primary obstacle to Isaacman's nomination. Cruz is concerned about Isaacman's past donations to Democrats and his interest in Mars exploration over the Moon. Cruz also disapproved of Elon Musk's call to end the International Space Station early, which is operated by NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The governors of several southern US states sent a letter to Cruz expressing "strong support" for Isaacman's swift confirmation in early March. The letter was notable for excluding the governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, where NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center is located. However, Ivey recently sent Cruz a letter praising Isaacman as an "exceptional selection" to lead NASA.

The governors of all US states with major human spaceflight activities have now lined up behind Isaacman.</p></b>

                <p>Money Forward issued a statement on March 24th, due to the continuous number of fraudulent transactions at online securities such as Rakuten Securities and SBI Securities.

According to the statement, no information leaks have been confirmed due to the fact that Money Forward ME has been unauthorized and the linkage of services with Money Forward ME has been confirmed.

In addition, when linking Money Forward ME with financial-related services, we only keep login information (login ID and login password) to check details and balance, and we will not enter your transaction password.

Furthermore, information entered by users when linking to the service, such as login information, is strictly managed in accordance with the security policies set forth at Money Forward and Money Forward Home. They will continue to strive to further strengthen security.

Some posts on social media also saw posts that looked like association games that said "Money Forward is suspicious," which seems to have dispelled these concerns. In addition, in response to the current situation, we have strengthened security so that accounts can be linked even if Rakuten Securities has set up two-step authentication.

                <p>Hollywood loves a possession story—going back to The Exorcist, of course, the grandaddy of them all and still the gold standard among all demon-infested cinematic tales. In the 50-plus years since Captain Howdy’s arrival, there have been many imitators of varying degrees of quality. At first glance, The Ritual looks pretty standard (it’s based on true events and features the old priest/young priest combo, with a side of “dark past” and “faith crisis” to boot), but then you see who’s starring in it: Dan Stevens and Al Pacino.

The first teaser is here and it features Pacino doing a gruff accent while taking about being part of “the Lord’s army,” and Stevens big-eyed and freaked out while also somehow making a priest collar look kind of dapper. Less inspiring are the expected shots of a woman contorting herself while in the grip of evil, and those exaggerated bone-popping sound effects that always seem to accompany someone who’s in demonic mode.

According to a press release, The Ritual is based on “the most thoroughly documented and widely publicized exorcism in American history,” occurring in a small Iowa town in 1928. The afflicted was 46-year-old Emma Schmidt, who’d been troubled for years; whether or not that was due to medical science not understanding mental health issues at the time, or if something genuinely sinister was afoot, we may never know—but the Catholic Church really did sanction the ceremony, and it grabbed sensational newspaper headlines at the time

In addition to Stevens and Pacino, the cast includes Ashley Greene, Abigail Cowen, Maria Camila Giraldo, Meadow Williams, Patrick Fabian, and Patricia Heaton. The Ritual is directed and co-written by David Midell, and you can learn more about the historical story behind the film at its official website.

The Ritual hits theaters June 6.</p></b>

It's reported that classified information about the bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen was discussed in the chat.

Goldberg shouldn't have been on these chats as a journalist, raising serious questions about the breach and whether officials should be held accountable.

The incident is seen as a ridiculous mistake by many, with Goldberg himself initially thinking it wasn't real when he was added to the group chat.

According to Goldberg, the officials openly discussed ways to not impact Saudi Arabian oil interests in the region.

                <p>GM, EVgo, and Pilot announce they have installed electric vehicle chargers at 130 locations across 25 states.

The partnership aimed to install 2,000 DC fast chargers at 500 Pilot and Flying J truck stop locations nationwide.

Pilot says its charging infrastructure now stretches along I-75 between Michigan and Georgia, as well as highway routes between Minneapolis and Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland, San Antonio and Houston, and Dallas and Nashville.

Each station is set up with gas station-style canopies, with some that have space to drive electric trucks with trailers through the station for easy charging.

Pilot has a site that shows which locations have EV charging stations and statuses on whether they’re in use.

Each stall has two CCS1 plugs and up to 350kW speed when a single compatible EV is connected. 

GM says some EVs can charge up in “as little as 15 minutes,” but only few EVs can achieve the max charge speed, but only in small bursts and probably not up to 100 percent.

For most EV models, you can expect a 20 to 80 percent charge in around 30 minutes.</p></b>

                <p>World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol founded by President Donald Trump's sons, announced it will launch a stablecoin called USD1.

The announcement comes after President Trump supported a new legal framework to normalize stablecoins.

USD1 will be backed by U.S. Treasury bonds, dollars, and other cash equivalents, and will launch on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.

Zach Witkoff, one of the founders, said USD1 is designed for sovereign investors and major institutions to integrate into their strategies for cross-border transactions.

World Liberty Financial has been accused of being a favor-trading fund and inviting overseas interests to trust it with their money through this stablecoin project.

The company's founder has ties to the Trump administration, as Zach Witkoff's father is Special Envoy to the Middle East.

President Trump recently spoke at the Digital Asset Summit 2025, calling for landmark legislation creating rules for stablecoins and market structure.

This comes after the Senate Banking Committee approved the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.

The bill would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins to normalize their usage in the financial system.

Critics of the bill, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have pointed out that it doesn't offer sufficient national security protections.

World Liberty Financial's positioning of USD1 as an option for foreign investors raises questions about its ties to the Trump administration and potential national security risks.

Stablecoins can generate significant profits through transaction fees and interest on treasury holdings.

Tether reported $13 billion in profits in 2024 alone, despite potential issues with unpegged values causing instability.

The launch of USD1 by World Liberty Financial seems to be ahead of the curve on what the Trump administration plans to do with crypto regulations.</p></b>

                <p>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.

Today, Amazon MGM announced that it has tapped veteran producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman to produce a new untitled Bond feature. Pascal, best known for her work on Sony’s Spider-Man cinematic franchise and other Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall, will produce the new Amazon project through Pascal Pictures. Heyman, who produced all eight of Warner Bros.’ live-action Harry Potter films and is currently working on HBO / Max’s reimagined series, is attached to the project through Heyday films.

In a statement about their new gigs, Pascal and Heyman said that it was an honor to take stewardship of the Bond IP after Broccoli and Wilson. “We are humbled to follow in the footsteps of Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson who made so many extraordinary films and honored and excited to keep the spirit of Bond very much alive as he embarks on his next adventure,” they said.

Amazon MGM’s head of film Courtenay Valenti noted Pascal and Heyman’s past success leading massive film franchises, and insisted that the studio is “approaching every creative decision with James Bond… with the greatest sense of responsibility.”

Valenti’s statement reads a little ominous given how reluctant Broccoli and Wilson reportedly were about letting Amazon fully take over the Bond franchise after MGM’s acquisition back in 2021. But with the old guard bowing out, this new development was inevitable, and now all there is to do is wait and see just what Pascal and Heyman decide to do with the series.</p></b>

                <p>23andMe, a DNA testing company, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Earlier this week, 23andMe officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just as its CEO Anne Wojcicki stepped down from the position.


The company's handling of customer data has been criticized. Starting in April 2023, hackers gained access to the personal information of nearly 7 million customers.


The hack allowed hackers to obtain names, birth years, and family tree information. It took five months for the company to notice the hack, and two months before it publicly admitted to the total scale of the breach.


The company attempted to lay the blame at its customers' feet, scolding them for recycling passwords.


In December 2023, the company agreed to pay $30 million to settle a class action lawsuit filed against it for the breach.


A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2010 accused the consumer DNA testing industry of regularly misleading the public.

The report claimed companies often marketed tests by falsely claiming they could accurately predict the chances of someone developing medical conditions.


In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration banned 23andMe for selling its own version of these personal genetics tests.


After retooling its business model, 23andMe launched FDA-approved tests to reveal if someone carries genes linked to specific hereditary conditions.


Egregious false advertising in the DNA testing industry has declined somewhat since the GAO report, but some companies are still being caught for deceiving their customers.


Most people don't really benefit from direct-to-consumer DNA tests because our hereditary factors are only one piece of the puzzle that is our health.

Our genes can influence our risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes, but factors like lack of exercise or obesity have a much greater impact.


Scientists continue to find new links between genetics and health, but we're not currently at a point where a DNA printout can provide a precise road map to someone's health.


A 2018 study found that up to 40% of genetic variants marked as potentially worrying in a person's raw genetic data were actually false positives.


Ancestry testing has its problems, too, and the genetic markers used by these companies are subject to some interpretation.


It's possible that two companies will pop out two markedly different assessments of your ancestry.</p></b>

                <p>Starting from March 24th, the operation of "Myna License Person" that integrates My Number Cards and driver's licenses began. However, there were problems such as the inability to unify the unit at some counters in some prefectures, and the reading app could not read correct information.

When asked about this matter at a press conference on March 25th, Taira Masaaki, the Digital Minister, said, "It has been discovered that the app that reads Myna licenses released by the National Police Agency has been promptly fixed, and all stores have already released the app that has been fixed. The app that police officers use for traffic crackdowns and other purposes is working properly, and there is no problem with police operations such as enforcement on the ground. The Digital Agency would like to continue working with the National Police Agency to respond appropriately to publicize the app."

On the morning of the 24th, the National Police Agency announced on the "Myna License Reading App-only site" that there are issues with Myna License and that there will be no problems with traffic enforcement. On the morning of the 25th, they informed us that the problem had been fixed.

Regarding the defects in the Myna license, Hayashi Yoshimasa, Chief Cabinet Secretary, also said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 24th, "We will strive to provide accurate information regarding the Myna license, and we will take every possible measure to ensure smooth operation."

                <p>OpenAI is integrating new image generation capabilities directly into ChatGPT starting today — this feature is dubbed “Images in ChatGPT.”

Users can now use GPT-4o to generate images within ChatGPT itself.

This initial release focuses solely on image creation and will be available across ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Free subscription tiers.

The free tier's usage limit is the same as DALL-E, spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge, but added that they “didn’t have a specific number to share” and ”these may change over time based on demand.”

Per the ChatGPT FAQ, free users were previously able to generate “three images per day with DALL·E 3.”


As for the fate of DALL-E, Christianson said “fans” will “still have access via a custom GPT.”

“This model is a step change above previous models,” research lead Gabriel Goh told The Verge, adding that the team used the GPT-4o “omnimodal” — or a model that can generate any kind of data like text, image, audio, and video — foundation for this feature.

Some of the improvements Goh noted include “binding,” which refers to how well AI image generators maintain correct relationships between attributes and objects; a model with poor binding might get a prompt for a blue star plus a red triangle and create a red star and no triangle.


Most image models struggle with this, Goh said, often mixing up colors and shapes when asked to render multiple items — typically around 5 to 8.

He says this new image generation tool can correctly bind attributes for 15 to 20 objects without confusion, representing a significant improvement in accuracy and reliability.

Users will also notice an improvement in text rendering, which makes it easier to generate coherent text without typos on an image (in existing tools, you’ll often notice that text gets garbled pretty easily).

Getting text rendering right was a significant challenge, Goh said.

If small titles or text elements have typos or errors, the entire image can become unusable.


“This was just like a process of iteration that took many, many months to get right,” Goh said. While not perfect, he said the team reached a point where the text quality is consistently usable (where it tends to blunder is really small text).

“It’s been just many months of small improvements.”</p></b>

Users will also notice an improvement in text rendering, which makes it easier to generate coherent text without typos on an image. Getting text rendering right was a significant challenge, Goh said. 

The system uses an autoregressive approach — generating images sequentially from left to right and top to bottom, similar to how text is written.

In a briefing before the feature launch, the team demonstrated several examples showing the system’s capabilities, including scientific diagrams like Newton’s prism experiment with correctly labeled components, multi-panel comics with consistent characters and text bubbles, and informational posters with accurate text.

“If I go to draw an image, I do so with the limitation of my own skill... but also with all of the knowledge of the world that I’ve built up,” ChatGPT multimodal product lead Jackie Shannon explained. “The model brings world knowledge to the equation, so when you ask for an image of Newton’s prism experiment, you don’t have to explain what that is to get an image back.”

The new system does take longer to generate images than before, though OpenAI suggests this is a worthwhile tradeoff.

OpenAI's new image generation system doesn't include visual watermarks or indicators showing images are AI-generated. However, Shannon explained that “all of our generated images will include standard C2PA metadata to mark the image as having been created by OpenAI”</p></b>

The laptop features an RTX 4060 GPU, a Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It also has a 144Hz, 1080p display.

 
The Thin A15 is a relatively thin and lightweight laptop, measuring 0.85 inches thick and weighing 4.10 pounds. It features HDMI 2.1 out, three USB-A ports, and one USB-C port.

 
We have tested other RTX 4060-enabled laptops and found that they can handle demanding games at high frame rates. The Dell G16 laptop with a Core i7-13650HX CPU and RTX 4060 achieved frame rates of up to 98fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080p.

 
We expect the Thin A15 to offer strong 1080p gaming performance, with frame rates ranging from 60 to 90fps on demanding titles. However, ray tracing may be a challenge for this sub-$1000 laptop.</p></b>

                <p>The U.S. Air Force announced it intends to build two landing pads on Johnston Island in the Pacific as part of a test for the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program.

The program involves shooting rockets into space loaded down with supplies to ship stuff around the planet faster, allowing delivery anywhere on the planet in “90 minutes or less.”

Johnston Island is about 700 nautical miles off the coast of Hawaii and includes a national wildlife refuge and marine monument.

The Air Force must study the effects landing massive rockets may have on protected species before construction can begin.

It plans to make its reports public in early April, allowing for a 30-day period for public comment on the proposal.

The military has been working on shooting cargo into space for at least half a decade.

Now retired general Stephen R. Lyons gave a speech at a National Defense Transportation meeting in 2020 where he teased a future of rocket shipping.

A military is only as good as its logistics, and one of the reasons the American military has been dominant is its ability to move humans, supplies, and equipment anywhere on the planet.

One of the problems with the rocket shipping plan is cost; fueling and flying a C-17 loaded down with up-armored Humvees to the Middle East is expensive, but launching a rocket into space is still more costly.</p></b>

                <p>Samsung is allowing customers to reserve preorders for its glasses-free 3D monitor, the Odyssey 3D G90XF.

The 27-inch display features a 4K resolution and uses eye-tracking to deliver a natural-looking high-definition 3D image.

You'll need to install Samsung's Reality Hub app to make games appear in 3D.

Samsung is working with developers to optimize upcoming games for the monitor.

The Odyssey 3D G90XF has a 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms gray-to-gray response time, and support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.

It can also convert "nearly all" content into 3D using the panel's lenticular lens.


The Odyssey 3D G90XF requires an Nvidia graphics card (RTX 3080 or higher) to use the 3D conversion feature, and it doesn't work with DRM-protected content.

Some video players might not support the 3D conversion tool, and it's also unavailable in HDR mode.

Samsung is launching the Odyssey OLED G8, which comes in 27-inch and 32-inch models.

The 27-inch model costs $1,299.99 and features a 4K OLED display with a .03ms gray-to-gray response time and a 240Hz refresh rate.

A new 49-inch Odyssey G9 model is also being launched, but its pricing is unclear.


Samsung is launching a ViewFinity S8 monitor with a larger 37-inch 4K display for $599.99.</p></b>

                <p>ASRock has issued a second update addressing boot-up and CPU damage issues on its AM5 motherboards.

This time in a blog post, the board maker went the extra mile to prove its BIOS updates are not causing motherboard and CPU damage by fixing a customer's AM5 motherboard that showed signs of CPU socket burn damage.

ASRock achieved this by restoring the motherboard above without actually "fixing" it. ASRock cleaned and removed debris from the motherboard's CPU socket and fired up the board with its original BIOS.

Despite not actually repairing the socket, the board booted successfully and "passed long-term stress testing" according to ASRock.


Efforts to repair this specific board appear to be in direct response to a previous report of one Ryzen 7 9800X3D burning out on an ASRock motherboard. In fact, the "socket damage" on the board ASRock fixed looks identical to the damaged motherboard in the aforementioned report.

The board maker's findings suggest that the aforementioned 9800X3D burnout was in fact a case of user error of some kind — meaning, the debris shouldn't have been in the socket pins.


ASRock also announced the full non-beta release of BIOS version 3.20 to its AM5 motherboards, featuring memory compatibility improvements. This update addresses widespread reports of boot-up issues occurring on many ASRock AM5 motherboards.

Alarms about CPU burnout and boot-up issues started to ring when the aforementioned 9800X3D burnout case was reported.


ASRock first responded to these issues in February, revealing the issues were related to memory incompatibility issues affecting all Ryzen 9000 series parts, preventing customers' motherboards from booting up.

At the time, the board maker also released beta BIOS 3.20 to rectify this problem.

Now, it appears ASRock has finally brought those changes into an official format for everyone to download in the form of BIOS 3.20.</p></b>

                <p>The Ryzen 7 9800X3D from AMD is back in stock at most retailers for around $479 MSRP list price.

 
If you're after a CPU upgrade, the Ryzen 7 9700X can be found on Amazon for $289 during the Big Spring Sale, which is $190 less than our top pick. This processor has an 8-core, 16-thread design with a base clock of 3.8 GHz and boost clocks reaching up to 5.5 GHz.

 
AMD's 9700X is an attractive option in the enthusiast CPU market due to its low TDP of just 65W. It also offers plenty of headroom for overclocking, making it a great choice for those looking to squeeze more performance out of their system.


The Ryzen 7 9700X has improved significantly since its release, with optimizations to Windows and firmware updates enhancing its performance in applications and gaming.</p></b>

                <p>Howard Lutnick, commerce secretary under President Trump, told leaders of the government's rural broadband initiative to prioritize satellite connectivity over ground-based broadband.

The clear thrust of his directive was to increase the amount of satellite being used regardless of any other considerations, according to Evan Feinman, who ran the rural broadband program until being pushed out last week. 

Starlink uses satellites in low-earth orbit, offering faster speeds than older space-based internet services likes HughesNet. But Feinman has been an outspoken critic of using Starlink in place of fiber optic, as satellite-based internet cannot reach the types of speeds expected from ground-based infrastructure.

Requests make a round-about trip to space and back, and consequently there is significant ping; synchronous communications like video calls or multiplayer gaming can be slow.</p></b>

                <p>At the beginning of March, the French publisher of Harvest wealth management software announced it had been the victim of a ransom-type computer attack.

All services offered by Harvest to its customers, mainly banks and wealth management advisers, were paralyzed due to this attack.

The company has recently communicated with its partners, warning them about possible leaks of personal data, which led banks to contact their customers to warn them of the risk.

Banque Populaire-Caisse d'Alivé (BPCE) began to contact its affected customers about the leak, while Banque Palatine also undertook to inform its concerned customers.

For BPCE customers, the leaked data includes identity information and in a limited number of cases, outstanding and securities numbers.

For MAIF, the data relates to civil status, matrimonial situation, and professional circumstances.

The dissemination of these data facilitates phishing, scam or identity theft attacks, prompting banks to call their customers to vigilance.

The exact number of people affected by this data leak is difficult to estimate due to a fairly vague description in Harvest's communication.

Harvest assures that the "contained in Harvest software has not been the subject of any extraction".

The computer attack targeted Harvest on February 27 and caused the blocking of several services offered by the company.

These services include simulation of financial operations, fund scoring, account aggregation, etc., and are used by wealth management advisers.

Initially, Harvest assured that no data leak had been noted, and that the restart of services would gradually be done during March.</p></b>

                <p>Apple has set the date for this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), with the event kicking off with an in-person experience to watch the keynote and Platforms State of the Union on June 9th at Apple Park and running through June 13th. Announcements will focus on the upcoming versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple reportedly has major visual design changes planned for its software platforms this year. WWDC could also see the debut of new hardware and an update on the AI-powered Siri features that were recently delayed.

The company used last year’s WWDC to introduce Apple Intelligence, showcasing still-unreleased advanced features for Siri that would allow the voice assistant to see your screen and perform actions based on what’s being displayed, integrate more deeply with your apps, and understand personal context when completing tasks.

Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told Daring Fireball recently that “It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”

With any luck, Apple might offer a more evolved AI strategy alongside a specific timeline at WWDC, including the rumored smart display that’s seemingly impacted by the Siri setback. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman previously reported that Siri’s more advanced conversational features might not arrive until iOS 20 “at best,” however, and Apple reportedly restructured the team in charge of the project, replacing John Giannandrea with Vision Pro leader Mike Rockwell.

Details around iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and the next Californication of macOS are likely to be included during WWDC 2025, which Gurman also reported could include a significantly redesigned look, updating icons, menus, and buttons to make things more consistent across Apple devices.</p></b>

                <p>The GeForce RTX 5090 is one of the best graphics cards — and the hardest to find in stock, especially if you want a card at something close to MSRP.

The Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 5090 AMP Extreme Infinity is the company's flagship SKU, tailored for consumers seeking all the premium features of an RTX 5090. The graphics card initially entered the market at $2,499.99 but reached as high as $2,599.99 during its last stock availability.

Zotac has now raised the price to $2,999.99, reflecting a substantial 20% increase from the original price. The more affordable Zotac Gaming RTX 5090 Solid OC arrived with a $2,261.69 price tag, although it didn't take long for the graphics card to jump to $2,381.13.

Zotac has set the new price at $2,699.99, a 19% increase. The standard Zotac Gaming RTX 5090 was one of the few MSRP models on the market.

The non-OC version is still visible at some U.S. retailers, such as Newegg, but it's obviously out of stock — just like any other 5090 priced below $4,000.
