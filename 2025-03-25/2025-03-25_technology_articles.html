An investment of $ 21 billion in the US announced the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai just a few days before the planned introduction of new cells by President Donald Trump. The plan includes the construction of a steel plant in Louisiana for $ 5.8 billion, which produces 2.7 million tonnes of steel annually and creates over 1,400 jobs. It also includes an investment of $ 9 billion to increase production to 1.2 million vehicles per year by 2028 and six billion dollars to develop technological partnerships in robotics and AI. The company also announced investments in the expansion of cars in the US and technology development, including autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.

Trump described this step as evidence of customs policy efficiency and announced that it would announce another duties on vehicle import this week. It could also hit South Korea, which has a significant trade surplus with the US. At the same time, Hyundai will inaugurate a new car factory and batteries in Georgia for $ 7.59 billion. After launching all three US Hyundai plants, it plans to achieve annual production capacity of one million vehicles, BBC reports. Photo: Unsplash</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Infinite Reality has entered an agreement to acquire Napster, a media, ecommerce, and marketing company focused on 3D and AI-powered experiences.

 
The brand originally launched in 1999 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) music file-sharing service is set to be reborn again. This time, new owners are reshaping the brand into one focused on marketing musicians in the metaverse.

 

Infinite announced today a definitive agreement to buy Napster for $207 million. The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company plans to turn Napster into a “social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement over passive listening, allowing artists to connect with, own, and monetize the relationship with their fans."

 

Jon Vlassopulos, who became Napster CEO in 2022, will continue with his role at the brand. Since 2016, Napster has been operating as a (legal) streaming service.

 

It claims to have over 110 million high-fidelity tracks, with some supporting lossless audio. Napster subscribers can also listen offline and watch music videos. The service currently starts at $11 per month.

Since 2022, Napster has been owned by Web3 and blockchain firms Hivemind and Algorand. Infinite also develops Web3 tech, and CEO John Acunto told CNBC that Algorand’s blockchain background was appealing, as was Napster's licenses for streaming millions of songs.

Infinite plans to use the platform to offer "branded 3D virtual spaces where fans can enjoy virtual concerts, social listening parties, and other immersive and community-based experiences" and more "gamification." Infinite also wants musicians to use Napster as a platform where fans can purchase tickets for performances, physical and virtual merchandise, and "exclusive digital content."

Infinite also plans to offer artists abilities to use "AI-powered customer service, sales, and community management agents" and "enhanced analytics dashboards to better understand fan behavior” with Napster.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/databricks-has-a-trick-that-lets-ai-models-improve-themselves/'>Databricks Has a Trick That Lets AI Models Improve Themselves</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 20:00:11 <p>
Databricks, a company that helps big businesses build custom artificial intelligence models, has developed a machine learning trick that can boost the performance of an AI model without the need for clean labelled data.

Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, spent the past year talking to customers about the key challenges they face in getting AI to work reliably. Everybody has some data, and has an idea of what they want to do, but the lack of clean data makes it challenging to fine-tune a model to perform a specific task.

Databricks' model could allow companies to eventually deploy their own agents to perform tasks, without data quality standing in the way.

The technique offers a rare look at some of the key tricks that engineers are now using to improve the abilities of advanced AI models, especially when good data is hard to come by. The method leverages ideas that have helped produce advanced reasoning models by combining reinforcement learning, a way for AI models to improve through practice, with “synthetic,” or AI-generated training data.

The Databricks method exploits the fact that, given enough tries, even a weak model can score well on a given task or benchmark. Researchers call this method of boosting a model’s performance “best-of-N”. 

Databricks trained a model to predict which best-of-N result human testers would prefer, based on examples. The Databricks reward model, or DBRM, can then be used to improve the performance of other models without the need for further labelled data.

DBRM is then used to select the best outputs from a given model. This creates synthetic training data for further fine-tuning the model so that it produces a better output first time. Databricks calls its new approach Test-time Adaptive Optimization or TAO.

He adds that the research done by Databricks shows that the TAO method improves as it is scaled up to larger, more capable models.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Top intelligence officials from the Trump regime, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, appeared before lawmakers on Tuesday.

They were asked about a Signal group chat that accidentally included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. The big takeaway: the officials insisted that none of the information they discussed was classified, but refused to share the information that was discussed.

Ratcliffe and Gabbard were testifying to the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday for a hearing that had been scheduled long before the story in The Atlantic broke Monday. Ratcliffe and Gabbard were just two officials on a large group chat discussing plans to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen, a chat that included others like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

It appears Waltz was the one who accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat, according to the journalist’s reporting. The hearing was not planned with the intention of discussing The Atlantic’s bombshell story.

One of the main questions at issue was whether there was classified information discussed in the group chat. Ratcliffe kept suggesting the information wasn’t classified, but the more he talked it started to become clear he was wording his answer carefully enough to simply say he hadn’t shared any classified intelligence over the chat.

Gabbard attempted to stonewall much more than Ratcliffe, often refusing to answer the most basic questions under the pretext that an investigation was ongoing. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was the first to ask Gabbard if she was involved in the group chat and right off the bat she wouldn’t answer.

“Senator, I’m not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said. “Why aren’t you going to get into the specifics? Is this… is it because it’s all classified?” Warner shot back.

Gabbard said that this was currently under review by the National Security Council. Democratic Sen. Reed of Rhode Island also asked Gabbard if she was overseas at any point during the group chat discussions.

Gabbard said that she was but refused to answer a question from Reed about whether she was using an official government-issued phone or her personal device. “I won’t speak to this because it’s under review by the National Security Council,” Gabbard said.

It was also discussed in the hearing that one of the people on the chat, top Trump advisor and unofficial Secretary of State, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin while the chat was happening.

The defense secretary referred to Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.” The “hoaxes” Hegseth claimed Goldberg was peddling included several things that were proved to be accurate.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

People are often selective about the information they accept, seeking out sources that confirm their biases while discounting those that challenge their beliefs.

By prioritizing results from high-quality, credible sources, a search engine could ensure people find accurate information more frequently and potentially update their beliefs.


The concept hasn't worked on the technology side as people learned to game algorithms used by search engines, resulting in webpages created by those with no interest in quality or credibility.


A new study suggests that this approach also fails on the human side, as people tend to devise search terms that ensure results will reinforce their existing beliefs.


The study was done by two researchers at Tulane, Eugina Leung and Oleg Urminsky, who focused on a simple question: is caffeine good or bad for you?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.androidauthority.com/google-announces-new-gemini-model-3538357/'>Gemini 2.5: Meet Google's Most Intelligent Reasoning Model to Date</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 19:38:56 <p>
Gemini 2.5 has been announced by Google.

The AI model is currently available for developers and Gemini Advanced Users.

It's only been a few months since the debut of Gemini 2.0, but Google is moving quickly with development.

Today, Google announced Gemini 2.5, its latest and most intelligent AI model to date.

The first release of the 2.5 generation will be Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is a thinking model capable of reasoning through thoughts before responding.

Gemini 2.5 Pro will come with a 1 million token context window, and Google says this will expand to 2 million soon.

According to Google, Gemini 2.5 outperforms some of the most popular AI models across a range of benchmarks, including reasoning, science, and mathematics.

The company achieved this feat by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training.

Enhancing coding performance was a major focus this time around.

Google claims it made a big improvement compared to 2.0, allowing it to create "visually compelling web apps and agentic code applications."

To show off the model's coding capability, Google shared a video of the AI generating a game based on a text prompt.

Gemini 2.5 is launching as an experimental model that will be available to developers in Ai Studio and Gemini Advanced Users in The Gemini App.

Google says Gemini 2.5 will also be available for Vertex AI in the coming weeks, but did not offer an exact date.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/the-pentagon-sent-out-a-warning-against-using-signal-right-before-yemen-group-chat-fiasco-2000580537'>The Pentagon Sent Out a Warning Against Using Signal Right Before Yemen Group Chat Fiasco</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 19:24:36 <p>
The Pentagon warned against using Signal in a memo just last week, according to NPR. It cited threats from Russian hackers.

 
The memo was delivered department-wide days before The Atlantic published a bombshell revelation that its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg had been erroneously added to a Signal group chat that involved detailed discussions of planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Members in the Signal chat included U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President J.D. Vance, among others.

 
In its memo warning against using Signal, the Pentagon wrote, “Russian professional hacking groups are employing the ‘linked devices’ features to spy on encrypted conversations.”

 
A single encryption key sent from the primary device to the new device does the job, bootstrapping a secure connection through which we can send encrypted data. It turns out that even a simple QR code does the trick — the new linked device can display a QR code that includes all of the necessary information to bootstrap the process and send encrypted data through a secure connection.

 
The Pentagon’s memo states that hackers are able to bypass this hurdle by creating malicious phishing pages or QR codes associated with group chats, which users can send to one another as invites. “After gaining access to the malicious code, the groups add their own device as a linked device. This allows the group to view every message sent by the unwitting user in real time, bypassing the end-to-end encryption.”

 
Another similar messaging app popular for private communications, Telegram, is used in both Russia and Ukraine, and has been the target of Russian hackers.

 
Signal has defended its security practices, and outlined the great lengths it has gone to prevent itself from being able to access user data. 

 
But at the end of the day, neither Signal nor end-to-end encryption technology is going to protect someone sharing classified war plans in an open group chat. It is a consumer-grade messaging app, operated by one technical organization, now being used for political communications amidst major global conflicts.

 
Governments provide secure physical rooms (commonly known as SCIFs) where classified information is discussed for a reason, and there’s also a reason why personal devices aren’t to be used in a SCIF. Consumer apps are meant to be easy and intuitive to use, and users can be targeted through means like social engineering.

 
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been on the defensive trying to put out this latest fire, posting on X again on Tuesday to say that no war plans or otherwise classified materials were discussed in the chat. An investigation into how a journalist was added to the conversation remains ongoing.

 
The White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different protocols related to communication involving the Vice President and other senior officials regarding sensitive topics.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Part of what makes The Last of Us Part II so great as a video game is the dispersal of information.

Keeping things spoiler-light, in the video game, Abby is the main antagonist throughout the first half. It’s not until the second half of the game when you are forced to play as her that you get her full backstory, thereby making her a more complete character.

There are two reasons why we change certain context or move certain things up in the story,” Druckmann said. “One of which [is] in the game… you play as Abby. So you immediately form an empathic connection with her because you’re surviving as her. You’re running through the snow, you’re fighting infected, and we can withhold certain things and make it a mystery that will be revealed later in the story.

Another reason is, where that revelation happens in the game, if we were to stick to a very similar timeline, viewers would have to wait a very, very long time to get that context,” he continued. So it felt appropriate for those reasons to move that up and give viewers that context right off the bat.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

9,000 wafers per month would be needed to satisfy GPU demand, but this is not feasible given current wafer starts.

There are only so many silicon wafers processed by TSMC each month, which needs to be shared between various customers including AI chips, GPUs, CPUs, smartphones, and more.

The latest GPU market share numbers suggest all desktop GPUs combined account for over eight million graphics cards sold per quarter.

Using die-per-wafer calculators, Intel would get about 210 chips at most from a single wafer, while AMD's Navi 48 could get up to 157 chips per wafer.

Nvidia's GB205 die could get up to 220 GPUs per wafer, or 150 GB203, or only 70 of the significantly larger GB202 die.

The economics aren't in favor of gamers getting a lot more GPUs any time soon.

Anyone in need of a new graphics card right now looks to be in for a tough decision.

The faster GPUs are all incredibly overpriced now, typically selling for 50% more than what they cost last October/November.

Your best bet might be to opt for an older and slower GPU and bide your time until graphics card prices come down.

The fundamental issue is that there are only so many silicon wafers processed by TSMC each month. 

The numbers we've seen suggest 150K~175K wafer starts per month (WSPM) for 5nm-class nodes, and that needs to be shared between a variety of customers including AI chips, GPUs, CPUs, smartphones, and more.

At the same time, the latest GPU market share numbers suggest all desktop GPUs combined account for over eight million graphics cards sold per quarter.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Demand for AMD’s latest Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards is so high that it is close to impossible to get a Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT add-in board (AIB) at its recommended price in the U.S., Europe, or just about anywhere else.

In fact, AMD claims that its latest Radeon RX 9070 XT discrete GPU for desktop PCs is its most successful standalone AMD Radeon graphics card ever in terms of first-week sales. Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, said in an interview that the Radeon RX 9070 XT outsold its predecessors by a factor of 10 in the first week.

"Radeon RX 9070 XT has been a fantastic success, actually, it is the number one selling [graphics card] of all of the AMD Radeon generations for first week sales by far. 10X higher than previous generations," Lisa Su said in an interview with Asus Tony. "We like to see people happy, and people are very happy with the Radeon RX 9070 XT."



First-week sales are, of course, a very interesting metric that reflects how many products were stockpiled for early birds and how many early birds were willing to buy them in the first week of sales.

Pictures of AMD's Navi 48 GPUs — which power AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT AIBs — that we have seen so far indicate that the parts were assembled in late October, 2024, so the company has been stockpiling Navi 48 graphics processing units for months before formally introducing them on March 6, 2025.

We have no idea how many chips and cards AMD and its partners stockpiled before March, but AMD shipped about 1.43 million discrete desktop GPUs to its partners in Q4 2024, according to Jon Peddie Research, and it is unlikely that these were outgoing RDNA 3-based processors.

With its family of GPUs based on the RDNA 4 microarchitecture, AMD decided not to pursue the high-end segment of the market, leaving them entirely for Nvidia with its products like the GeForce RTX 5080 ($999) and GeForce RTX 5090 ($1,999).

Instead, the company focused on the performance-mainstream segment and currently offers Radeon RX 9070 at a $549 MSRP and Radeon RX 9070 XT at a $599 MSRP.

At these prices, these are some of the best graphics cards on the market. Without a doubt, AMD could easily sell more Radeon RX 9070-series graphics cards at $549–$599 (even with a 15%–20% markup in retail) in the first week than it did with the prior generation.

Radeon RX 7900 XT and RX 7900 XTX launched at $899–$999 in mid-December, 2022, and supplies weren't particularly large. When it comes to Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT ($579–$649, launched mid-November, 2020) and Radeon RX 6900 XT ($999, early December, 2020), those products were launched amid the COVID-19 pandemic and are known for their low stock availability at launch; they sold out the first day.

As for AMD's 2019 products — the Radeon VII (Vega 20, early 2019) for $699, Radeon Vega Frontier Edition for $999–$1,499 (Vega 20, late 2018) and Radeon RX 5000-series, those were launched with high expectations but didn't live up to them.

There were exceptions in 2016–2017, but mainly because AMD’s Radeon R9 Fury and Radeon 300-series GPUs failed to gain any significant popularity in 2015. The overall trend is that sales of AMD’s desktop GPUs are declining — a trend that reflects not only industry dynamics but also the company’s market share losses to Nvidia.

Could AMD reverse the trend and outsell not only the more expensive Radeon RX 6800/6900 and Radeon RX 7900-series graphics cards, but also its cheaper Radeon RX 400/500 and RX 5000-series with its Radeon RX 9070-series products in Q1 2025?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

With most of President Donald Trump's cabinet members now approved by the US Senate, focus is turning to senior positions within the administration.

The administrator of NASA is among the most high-profile of these positions. Nearly four months ago Trump nominated private astronaut Jared Isaacman to become chief of the space agency.

Almost immediately after his nomination, much of the space community fell in behind Isaacman, who has flown to space twice on private Crew Dragon missions, raised charitable funds, and is generally well-liked.

However, publicly, not much has happened. This has raised questions within the space community about whether the nomination has stalled.

Although some people have expressed concern about financial ties between Isaacman and SpaceX, according to multiple sources, the primary obstacle has been Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who chairs the Senate committee.

Cruz is not happy that Isaacman has donated to Democrats in the past, and he is concerned that the private astronaut is more interested in Mars exploration than the Moon.

Money Forward issued a statement on March 24th, due to the continuous number of fraudulent transactions at online securities such as Rakuten Securities and SBI Securities.

According to the statement, no information leaks have been confirmed due to the fact that Money Forward ME has been unauthorized and the linkage of services with Money Forward ME has been confirmed.

In addition, when linking Money Forward ME with financial-related services, we only keep login information (login ID and login password) to check details and balance, and we will not enter your transaction password.

Furthermore, information entered by users when linking to the service, such as login information, is strictly managed in accordance with the security policies set forth at Money Forward and Money Forward Home. They will continue to strive to further strengthen security.

Some posts on social media also saw posts that looked like association games that said "Money Forward is suspicious," which seems to have dispelled these concerns. In addition, in response to the current situation, we have strengthened security so that accounts can be linked even if Rakuten Securities has set up two-step authentication.

Hollywood loves a possession story—going back to The Exorcist, of course, the grandaddy of them all and still the gold standard among all demon-infested cinematic tales. In the 50-plus years since Captain Howdy’s arrival, there have been many imitators of varying degrees of quality. At first glance, The Ritual looks pretty standard (it’s based on true events and features the old priest/young priest combo, with a side of “dark past” and “faith crisis” to boot), but then you see who’s starring in it: Dan Stevens and Al Pacino.

The first teaser is here and it features Pacino doing a gruff accent while taking about being part of “the Lord’s army,” and Stevens big-eyed and freaked out while also somehow making a priest collar look kind of dapper. Less inspiring are the expected shots of a woman contorting herself while in the grip of evil, and those exaggerated bone-popping sound effects that always seem to accompany someone who’s in demonic mode.

According to a press release, The Ritual is based on “the most thoroughly documented and widely publicized exorcism in American history,” occurring in a small Iowa town in 1928. The afflicted was 46-year-old Emma Schmidt, who’d been troubled for years; whether or not that was due to medical science not understanding mental health issues at the time, or if something genuinely sinister was afoot, we may never know—but the Catholic Church really did sanction the ceremony, and it grabbed sensational newspaper headlines at the time

In addition to Stevens and Pacino, the cast includes Ashley Greene, Abigail Cowen, Maria Camila Giraldo, Meadow Williams, Patrick Fabian, and Patricia Heaton. The Ritual is directed and co-written by David Midell, and you can learn more about the historical story behind the film at its official website.

GM, EVgo, and Pilot announce they have installed electric vehicle chargers at 130 locations across 25 states.

Pilot says its charging infrastructure now stretches along I-75 between Michigan and Georgia, as well as highway routes between Minneapolis and Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland, San Antonio and Houston, and Dallas and Nashville.

Each station is set up with gas station-style canopies, with some that have space to drive electric trucks with trailers through the station for easy charging. Pilot has a site that shows which locations have EV charging stations and statuses on whether they’re in use. 

Most locations seem to only have the capacity for four vehicles to charge at any given time. Each stall has two CCS1 plugs and up to 350kW speed when a single compatible EV is connected.

GM says some EVs can charge up in “as little as 15 minutes,” but this likely applies to few models, charging to only small bursts and not up to 100 percent.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol founded by President Donald Trump's sons, announced it will launch a stablecoin called USD1.

According to Reuters, USD1 will be backed by U.S. Treasury bonds, dollars, and other cash equivalents.

It'll launch on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, with plans to expand to other protocols in the future.

USD1 seeks to maintain a fixed value of $1 rather than be a more volatile token.


Zach Witkoff, one of the founders, said the company is "offering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions."

This suggests the company is interested in overseas money.

is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.

Today, Amazon MGM announced that it has tapped veteran producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman to produce a new untitled Bond feature. Pascal, best known for her work on Sony’s Spider-Man cinematic franchise and other Bond films including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall, will produce the new Amazon project through Pascal Pictures. Heyman, who produced all eight of Warner Bros.’ live-action Harry Potter films and is currently working on HBO / Max’s reimagined series, is attached to the project through Heyday films.

In a statement about their new gigs, Pascal and Heyman said that it was an honor to take stewardship of the Bond IP after Broccoli and Wilson. “We are humbled to follow in the footsteps of Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson who made so many extraordinary films and honored and excited to keep the spirit of Bond very much alive as he embarks on his next adventure,” they said.

Amazon MGM’s head of film Courtenay Valenti noted Pascal and Heyman’s past success leading massive film franchises, and insisted that the studio is “approaching every creative decision with James Bond… with the greatest sense of responsibility.”

Valenti’s statement reads a little ominous given how reluctant Broccoli and Wilson reportedly were about letting Amazon fully take over the Bond franchise after MGM’s acquisition back in 2021. But with the old guard bowing out, this new development was inevitable, and now all there is to do is wait and see just what Pascal and Heyman decide to do with the series.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, marking the latest development in its decline from being a genetic testing juggernaut valued at $6 billion.

The company's handling of customer data has been criticized, particularly after a breach in April 2023 that affected nearly 7 million customers. The hackers gained access to personal information such as names and family tree details but not DNA records.

It took the company five months to notice the hack and two months to publicly admit to the total scale of the breach. During this time, it attempted to shift blame onto its customers for reusing passwords.

The company agreed to pay $30 million in December to settle a class-action lawsuit related to the data breach. The incident severely eroded public trust in 23andMe and highlighted the security failings of consumer genetics testing companies.

A 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that these companies often made misleading claims about their tests, including false promises of accurately predicting medical conditions. In 2013, the FDA banned 23andMe from selling its own version of personal genetics tests due to this issue.

The company has since retooled its business model and launched FDA-approved tests for detecting genetic markers linked to certain hereditary conditions.

Many experts argue that direct-to-consumer DNA tests provide little benefit to consumers, as lifestyle factors often have a greater impact on health than genetic predispositions. These companies also face criticism for making exaggerated claims about their services.

A 2018 study found that up to 40% of genetic variants marked as potentially worrying were actually false positives. This highlights the need for more accurate and reliable DNA testing methods.

Ancestry testing also has its problems, with different companies often producing conflicting results even for identical twins.

The use of DNA data from consumer tests by law enforcement agencies is a growing concern.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theverge.com/openai/635118/chatgpt-sora-ai-image-generation-chatgpt'>OpenAI rolls out image generation powered by GPT-4o to ChatGPT</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techmeme&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 18:00:00 <p>
OpenAI is integrating new image generation capabilities directly into ChatGPT starting today — this feature is dubbed “Images in ChatGPT.”

This initial release focuses solely on image creation and will be available across ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Free subscription tiers.

The free tier’s usage limit is the same as DALL-E, spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge, but added that they “didn’t have a specific number to share” and ”these may change over time based on demand.”

This model is a step change above previous models,” research lead Gabriel Goh told The Verge, adding that the team used the GPT-4o “omnimodal” — or a model that can generate any kind of data like text, image, audio, and video — foundation for this feature.

Some of the improvements Goh noted include “binding,” which refers to how well AI image generators maintain correct relationships between attributes and objects; a model with poor binding, for instance, might get a prompt for a blue star plus a red triangle and create a red star and no triangle.

Users will also notice an improvement in text rendering, which makes it easier to generate coherent text without typos on an image (in existing tools, you’ll often notice that text gets garbled pretty easily).

Getting text rendering right was a significant challenge, Goh said. If small titles or text elements have typos or errors, the entire image can become unusable.

The system uses an autoregressive approach — generating images sequentially from left to right and top to bottom, similar to how text is written — rather than the diffusion model technique used by most image generators (like DALL-E) that create the entire image at once.

In a briefing before the feature launch, the team demonstrated several examples showing the system’s capabilities, including scientific diagrams like Newton’s prism experiment with correctly labeled components, multi-panel comics with consistent characters and text bubbles, and informational posters with accurate text.

They also highlighted practical applications like creating transparent background images for stickers, restaurant menus, and logos.

The new system does take longer to generate images than before, though OpenAI suggests this is a worthwhile tradeoff.

OpenAI’s new image generation system doesn’t include visual watermarks or indicators showing images are AI-generated.

However, the company “will have some internal tooling to be able to look up images as well,” and “all of our generated images will include standard C2PA metadata to mark the image as having been created by OpenAI.”

Ultimately, no system is perfect for this type of thing, but we’re continuously improving our safeguards and we think of this as a starting point.

One thing that’s true about all of the images generated from ChatGPT is that the user owns them and are free to use them within the bounds of our usage policies as they would like.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The free tier’s usage limit is the same as DALL-E, spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge, but added that they “didn’t have a specific number to share” and ”these may change over time based on demand.”

Most image models struggle with this, Goh said, often mixing up colors and shapes when asked to render multiple items — typically around 5 to 8.


He says this new image generation tool can correctly bind attributes for 15 to 20 objects without confusion, representing a significant improvement in accuracy and reliability.

The U.S. Air Force announced plans to build two landing pads on Johnston Island in the Pacific, part of a test for the Rocket Cargo Vanguard program.

It involves launching rockets into space loaded with supplies to transport goods around the planet faster than current methods.

The program aims to deliver anything anywhere on the planet in "90 minutes or less" by shooting a rocket into space and bringing it back down.

Johnston Island is about 700 nautical miles off the coast of Hawaii, and the Air Force must study the potential impact on protected species before construction begins.

The studies will examine the effects on "essential fish habitat, migratory birds, and other protected species."

The Air Force believes the reports will show that building two landing pads on the island will have "no significant impact" on the environment.

Once the reports are made public in early April, a 30-day period for public comment will begin.

The military has been working on rocket shipping for at least half a decade, with retired General Stephen R. Lyons hinting at its potential in a 2020 speech.

Lyons said the technology could move cargo and people quickly around the globe, with the potential to "move the equivalent of a C-17 payload anywhere on the globe in less than an hour."

A dominant military logistics system has been crucial to American success in recent conflicts.

ASRock has issued a second update addressing boot-up and CPU damage issues on its AM5 motherboards.

This time, in a blog post, ASRock went the extra mile to prove its BIOS updates are not causing motherboard and CPU damage by fixing a customer's AM5 motherboard that showed signs of CPU socket burn damage. They cleaned and removed debris from the motherboard's CPU socket and fired up the board with its original BIOS.


The board booted successfully and "passed long-term stress testing" according to ASRock.

Efforts to repair this specific board appear to be in direct response to a previous report of one Ryzen 7 9800X3D burning out on an ASRock motherboard. The "socket damage" on the board ASRock fixed looks identical to the damaged motherboard in the aforementioned report.


ASRock also announced the full non-beta release of BIOS version 3.20 to its AM5 motherboards, featuring memory compatibility improvements.

This update addresses widespread reports of boot-up issues occurring on many ASRock AM5 motherboards. Alarms about CPU burnout and boot-up issues started to ring when the aforementioned 9800X3D burnout case was reported. Afterward, ASRock moderators on Reddit created a megathread highlighting over 40 Reddit posts complaining about allegedly "dead" Ryzen 9000 series CPUs (mostly 9800X3D chips), the vast majority of which were coming from ASRock customers.


The primary issue was an inability to POST (or boot up) with Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs. ASRock first responded to these issues in February, revealing the issues were related to memory incompatibility issues affecting all Ryzen 9000 series parts, preventing customers' motherboards from booting up.


At the time, the board maker also released beta BIOS 3.20 to rectify this problem.

Now, it appears ASRock has finally brought those changes into an official format for everyone to download in the form of BIOS 3.20.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

At the beginning of March, the French publisher of Harvest wealth management software announced it had been the victim of a ransom-type computer attack.

All tech news for pros every day in our newsletter learn more about the use of personal data


In the immediate future, the initial effect of this attack was the paralysis of several programs and services offered by Harvest with its customers, mainly banks and wealth management advisers.


But the company recently communicated to its partners. And it warns possible leaks of personal data. This lead banks to contact their customers to warn them of the risk.

The MAIF subsidiary of MAIF financial solution as well as the Banque Populaire-Caisse d'Alivé (BPCE) began to contact their customers concerned by the data leak.


For BPCE customers, the data in question relates to their identity, but also, for a limited number of them, their outstanding and securities numbers.

For MAIF, these are data relating to civil status, the matrimonial and professional situation. In all cases, the dissemination of these data facilitates the implementation of phishing, scam or identity theft attacks.


The fact remains that the exact number of people affected by this data leak is difficult to estimate.

In the communication of March 19 addressed to its customers, Harvest evokes "a compromise of some internal files, and accounts of messaging of employees" as reported by the specialized magazine Managementdefortune.com.


The computer attack that targeted Harvest took place on February 27. It led to blocking several services offered by the company.

Apple has set the date for this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), with the event kicking off with an in-person experience to watch the keynote and Platforms State of the Union on June 9th at Apple Park and running through June 13th. Announcements will focus on the upcoming versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Apple reportedly has major visual design changes planned for its software platforms this year. WWDC could also see the debut of new hardware and an update on the AI-powered Siri features that were recently delayed.

The company used last year’s WWDC to introduce Apple Intelligence, showcasing still-unreleased advanced features for Siri that would allow the voice assistant to see your screen and perform actions based on what’s being displayed, integrate more deeply with your apps, and understand personal context when completing tasks.

Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told Daring Fireball recently that “It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”

With any luck, Apple might offer a more evolved AI strategy alongside a specific timeline at WWDC, including the rumored smart display that’s seemingly impacted by the Siri setback. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman previously reported that Siri’s more advanced conversational features might not arrive until iOS 20 “at best,” however, and Apple reportedly restructured the team in charge of the project, replacing John Giannandrea with Vision Pro leader Mike Rockwell.

Details around iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and the next Californication of macOS are likely to be included during WWDC 2025, which Gurman also reported could include a significantly redesigned look, updating icons, menus, and buttons to make things more consistent across Apple devices.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A new ruling from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that Apple cannot participate in Google's upcoming antitrust hearing.

Just a few years ago, a high-stakes court case involving Apple and Google would have found the companies on opposing sides, but not today. Apple's and Google's interests are strongly aligned here, to the tune of $20 billion. Google forks over that cash every year, and it's happy to do so to secure placement as the default search provider in the Safari desktop and mobile browser.

The antitrust penalties pending against Google would make that deal impermissible. Throughout the case, the government made the value of defaults clear—most people never change them. That effectively delivers Google a captive audience on Apple devices.

Google lost the case in August 2024, and the government proposed remedies in October. According to MediaPost, the appeals court took issue with Apple's sluggishness in choosing sides. It didn't even make its filing to participate in the remedy phase until November, some 33 days after the initial proposal. The judges ruled this delay "seems difficult to justify."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/handmaids-tale-season-5-recap-hulu-2000579513'>The 5 Most Important Things to Remember About The Handmaid’s Tale Season 5</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 17:00:45 <p>
The Handmaid's Tale returns with its sixth season on April 8, after a hiatus since November 2022.

The story has expanded beyond Gilead, but June (Elisabeth Moss) still has family in Canada, where she escaped to in episode four.

She was reunited with her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle), best friend Moira (Samira Wiley), and Nichole, the baby June had in Gilead with Nick (Max Minghella).

However, Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) was arrested in Canada for his crimes after being turned in by his wife Serena.

Fred later ratted out Serena, who was also detained.

Despite their betrayals, Fred got Serena pregnant in season four.

The main characters now living in Canada include June, Luke, and Nichole.

There are still Gilead-set plotlines swirling around the remaining handmaids, including Janine (Madeline Brewer) and Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd).

Commanders Nick and Commander Lawrence (Bradley Whitford) also play a role in the story.

The United States has a presence in the show thanks to Mark Tuello (Sam Jaeger), an agent of its government-in-exile.

With that in mind, here are five big things you need to remember about season five:

Fred's dead; he was killed by June and other former handmaids in the season four finale.

Hannah is still in Gilead, being fast-tracked into a marriage despite being just a child.

Emily left her wife and son and headed back to Gilead in season five.

Serena Waterford finally became a mother when she gave birth to her son Noah.

June's life is still in chaos as she plans to flee to Hawaii with Nichole.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

World of Warcraft Classic's Hardcore mode has made character death permanent across the entire in-game realm.

Now, Blizzard says it's modifying its policy somewhat in response to a series of "unprecedented distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks" undertaken "with the singular goal of disrupting players’ experiences."

The World of Warcraft developer says it may now resurrect Classic Hardcore characters "at our sole discretion" when those deaths come "in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game."

In recent weeks, many of the OnlyFangs Guild's characters' journeys have ended as the result of a series of DDOS attacks that impacted all of World of Warcraft and other Battle.net games.

Those attacks seemed suspiciously timed to coincide with major livestreamed OnlyFangs raids and negatively impacted many other players in the process.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/satelliti-cina-esercitazioni-militari-spazio-space-force/'>Satellites, China is conducting military exercises in space</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 16:51:27 <p>
A high commander of the US Space Force (USSF) said China and Russia are filling the gap in space safety.

The USSF is "starting to see our equal concentrating on the exercises of air fights between satellites in space", said General Michael Guetlein, deputy director of the organization's space operations.

"We have observed five different objects in the space to make maneuvers in a synchronized and controlled way," added Guetlein. This is what we call Dogfighting in space.

The USSF confirmed to the military news site Defendesse One Che Guetlein referred to a series of satellite maneuvers detected in 2024 in the low orbit of the earth.

These exercises have seen several experimental satellites as protagonists, specifically three shiyan-24c and two shijian-6 05 a/b. The Shijian-6 system is believed to have "electronic intelligence" skills.

Guetlein's observations arrived on the occasion of an annual conference dedicated to the defense sector, which recently held in Arlington, Virginia.

The US General accused the opponents of the United States of being willing to "go against international behavior rules" generally adopted in the space sector and to do so "in a non-secure and not very professional way".

The United States have reason to be nervous. This month China confirmed the existence of two satellites with advanced monitoring capacity.

This is just an example of the latest steps forward that Russia and above all China are doing in the spatial armaments race. "The gap in terms of capacity was enormous, but it was significantly reduced," said Guetlein.

To extend the advantage over the opponents again and consolidate the "spatial superiority" of the United States, Guetlein asked to increase the USSF budgets and a revision of strategies to defend US satellites.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/report-boeing-asks-trump-admin-to-weaken-penalties-in-737-max-crash-case/'>Report: Boeing asks Trump admin to weaken penalties in 737 Max crash case</a></h2><b>Source:</b> arstechnica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 16:40:07 <p>
Boeing is trying to withdraw a plea agreement and obtain more lenient treatment from the Trump administration in a case involving two deadly 737 Max crashes, The Wall Street Journal reported today.

Boeing previously agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States. Boeing could still plead guilty but face weaker penalties than it agreed to last year if the Justice Department and a federal judge agree.

Trump's Department of Justice "is reviewing numerous pending criminal cases that haven't yet gone to trial or been approved by courts," and "Boeing stands to benefit from fresh eyes at Trump's Justice Department, which is inclined to at least modify parts of the agreement," the WSJ wrote, citing people familiar with the matter. "Allowing Boeing to rescind its plea agreement, or lightening the company's punishment, would mark one of the most prominent examples of the Trump administration's lighter-touch approach to some white-collar enforcement."

In July 2024, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $243.6 million for violating a 2021 agreement that was spurred by 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a combined 346 people.

Boeing had avoided prosecution in January 2021 when it signed a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties and compensation to airline customers and the victims' families. But in May 2024, the Justice Department said it determined that Boeing violated the deferred prosecution agreement "by failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."

Judge rejected previous plea deal

Boeing's plea deal was for a charge of defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration Aircraft Evaluation Group, and the plea agreement was submitted for review in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Judge Reed O'Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the plea deal in December because it "requires the parties to consider race when hiring the independent monitor" and because Boeing wouldn't actually have to comply with the monitor's recommendations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/an-astronomer-calculated-the-exact-day-a-star-will-blow-and-its-this-week-2000580309'>An Astronomer Calculated the Exact Day a Star Will Blow—and It’s This Week</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 16:35:53 <p>
Astronomers have been watching a small constellation in the night sky, waiting for a nearby binary star system to explode. The wait may finally be over: A numerical estimate predicts the rare nova eruption could happen on Thursday, March 27.

T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), also known as the Blaze Star, is a binary star system located 3,000 light-years from Earth. It periodically explodes in a recurring nova every 79 years or so, and it’s due for an impending eruption.

The Blaze Star has spent the past decade behaving much like it did in the lead-up to its last visible eruption nearly 80 years ago, according to NASA. The current window for the rare astronomical event opened in February 2024 and remains open. 

A paper published last year in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society estimated that the star is likely to explode on Thursday, March 27—so get ready to look up.

When will the Blaze Star explode?

To better pinpoint the next eruption date, the astronomer behind the 2024 study, Jean Schneider of the Paris Observatory, combined the previous explosion dates with the orbital dynamics of the star system. The researcher found that the nova eruptions occurred at intervals that were an exact multiple of the star system’s orbital period—meaning the explosions happened after a specific number of orbits the stars completed around each other.

Rather than relying on the behavior of the star system, the paper suggests that T CrB explodes once every 128 orbits, with each orbital period being roughly 227 days. Based on these calculations, the nova is set to take place on March 27. Should it fail to explode on Thursday, Schneider lists two subsequent dates: November 10, 2025 and June 25, 2026.

In his paper, he also predicted August 12, 2024, which we can now obviously rule out. To be clear, Schneider is strictly running the numbers; his paper does not take into account the physics of how or why the eruption happens. It’s a one-dimensional approach, so his predictions could be way off—but wow would that ever be neat if the Blaze Star erupts according to his unusually strict timeline.

What is the T CrB nova?

Located in the Corona Borealis constellation, T CrB is a binary system made up of a white dwarf (the remains of a dead star with a mass comparable to that of the Sun squeezed into an Earth-sized body) and an ancient red giant star. The red giant, roughly 1.12 times the mass of our Sun, orbits the white dwarf every 227 days.

The two stars are separated by only 0.54 astronomical units, about the same as the distance from the Sun to Venus. The red giant star is slowly being stripped of its hydrogen by the strong gravitational pull of its companion, the white dwarf, as the two are interlocked in a dangerous orbital dance.

The material from the red giant star forms an accretion disk, which swirls around the white dwarf. As the hydrogen from the red giant star accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, it causes a buildup of pressure and heat, which eventually triggers a thermonuclear explosion that blasts away all that material.

Unlike a supernova, which destroys a dying star, the dwarf star remains intact after the nova explosion. It does, however, blast the material into space in an explosive flash that’s bright enough to see from Earth with the unaided eye.

The first recorded sighting of the T CrB nova was more than 800 years ago, and the cycle repeats itself roughly once every 79 years on average.

What you’ll see in the sky

When it does take place, the outburst will be brief but it will appear as a new star in the sky for a little less than a week. The star system itself is currently invisible to the unaided eye at a magnitude of +10.

However, following its nova explosion, T CrB will be elevated to a magnitude of +2, almost as bright as the North Star. The nova will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere in the Corona Borealis constellation, which forms an arc shape in the night skies.

You can spot the stellar explosion without a telescope for several days after it happens. The star system will then begin to dim and won’t brighten again for roughly another 80 years, so make sure you catch this rare celestial event.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Netflix has started offering HDR movies and shows in the HDR10+ format.

Since December 2014, Netflix has supported the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Like Dolby Vision, HDR10+ is a more advanced form of HDR that uses dynamic metadata fine-tuned to specific content.

HDR10+ and Dolby Vision let creatives set how each frame looks, enabling a final result that should have more detail and look closer to how the content's creators intended. These formats are especially impactful when watching HDR content on lower-priced HDR TVs that could suffer from poor black levels and other performance gaps.

Netflix's blog post says: To enhance our offering, we have been adding HDR10+ streams to both new releases and existing popular HDR titles. AV1-HDR10+ now accounts for 50 percent of all eligible viewing hours.

The streaming service added that it has "over 11,000 hours of HDR titles."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 (G93SC) is available with a pretty hefty discount during Amazon’s current Spring Sale. 
Originally priced at $1,599, the Odyssey OLED G9 is now available for just $949.

This 49-inch ultrawide monitor is equivalent to two QHD monitors merged into a single QD-OLED panel with a 5120 x 1440 resolution. Thanks to the OLED screen, you’ll enjoy a 0.03ms response time, stunning blacks and contrasts, vibrant colors, outstanding integrated speakers, and top-notch calibration out of the box.

The Odyssey OLED G9 comes with the Samsung TV Plus experience and Game Hub. The former allows you to take advantage of Samsung’s ad-supported free streaming TV service. The latter gives you access to game streaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming directly from the monitor without needing to connect to a PC or game console.

Regarding connectivity, the rear of the monitor offers a comprehensive range of ports, including a single HDMI 2.1 port, a single DisplayPort 1.4 port, a single micro-HDMI 2.1 port, and a USB Hub. Notably, the ‘Picture-by-Picture’ mode allows simultaneous utilization of two inputs at their native resolutions, effectively transforming the monitor into two separate screens.

Considering the wealth of features, the excellent build quality that Samsung is known for, and useful extras like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and AirPlay support, now is a great time to buy if the Odyssey OLED G9 fits your budget.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Below, we've listed the lowest current price on half a dozen popular models of 4TB NVMe SSD.

Drive Price Read Speed Write Speed Silicon Power UD90 $204 5,000 MBps 4,800 MBps 

Not all of these are currently sale prices, just the lowest price you can get them for right now. Prices may have been lower in the recent past, but again, we don't know if they will go down anytime soon.

The Samsung 990 Pro, however, is on a huge sale this week as it now goes for $279, reduced from $319 just a few days ago.

The Samsung 990 Pro 4TB is among the fastest SSDs currently available on the market, with read and write speeds of up to 7450/6900 MB/s, maxing out the Gen 4 bandwidth. 

As you can see in the chart below, the 990 Pro does more than just deliver high transfer rates. It also incredibly low latency, which is great for gaming.

The WD Black SN850X is another high-performer and is also $279. The SN850X is a speedy PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs, laptops, and the PlayStation 5. The drive boasts a sequential performance that peaks at 7,300 MB/s reads and 6,600 MB/s writes.

However, if you want a cheap drive that's capable of solid, but not impressive performance, you should definitely consider the TeamGroup MP44, which still uses speedy TLC NAND and is $239 or the Silicon Power US75, which uses QLC but promises 7,500 MBps reads and is $205.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The trailer for Final Destination Bloodlines is out, showing where the chain of death started.

Directors Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky are at the helm for the film, which balances lore and terrifying incidents.


Having just rewatched all the Final Destination films, it's known that this one will fit in with the franchise. The idea to trace back 50 or 60 years earlier raises the stakes in this movie and creates possible period sequels/prequels.


A grandmother was supposed to die but instead lived and had a large family, and now death has finally worked its way back to all of them after decades, which is unsettling.


The cast includes Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, Richard Harmon, Owen Patrick Joyner, Anna Lore, Brec Bassinger, and the late Tony Todd in his likely final role.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The new WF-C710N still lack a memorable name but introduce improvements like upgraded active noise cancellation and features borrowed from Sony’s more premium earbud offerings.

One of our biggest complaints when we reviewed the WF-C700N was their lackluster ANC, which was really only capable of removing very low frequency hums and rumbling.

The new WF-C710N has improved the performance of both the ANC and ambient sound mode through the use of dual microphones.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Instagram is rolling out a new program to fast-track moderation reports made by school districts. After a district joins the new Schools Partnership program, any post or account they flag for potentially violating Instagram’s rules will “be automatically prioritized for review.”

The school’s account will then receive notifications about the status of their report, and whether Instagram takes action on it. The partnership program is available to middle schools and high schools in the US, and it will allow them to take action against harmful content students may post.

Schools are often made aware of threats or inappropriate content posted on social media platforms, and some use monitoring programs to keep tabs on what students post online. Educational institutions will get a banner on their profile indicating that they’re part of the program, and they’ll gain access to resources to “help support educators, parents, guardians and students navigate Instagram safely.”

Instagram has been trying to get ahead of the online child safety legislation popping up across the US.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/bonus-nido-2025-informazioni/'>Nurse bonus, open the INPS portal: up to 3,600 euros for families with young children</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:59:52 <p>
The INPS portal to request the 2025 nursery bonus is finally active. Starting from March 25, parents can apply to obtain the contribution destined to bear the costs for the frequency of nursery schools and for the forms of home assistance.

Introduced in 2017 and strengthened with the recent Budget Law, the nursery bonus aims to reduce the economic impact of the straight kindergartens, which can cost families between 300 and 600 euros per month, with even higher tips in large urban centers. The INPS has communicated that the processing of applications will begin from April 2, 2025.

The latest financial has changed the bonus structure, updating the amounts for families with small children. The system was remodeled: until last year the maximum contribution was 3,000 euros for families with lower Isee, while now the amounts vary according to the year of birth of the child, with a differentiation between born before and after 2024

The delivery takes place in eleven monthly installments of about 327 euros each. For children born until December 2023, the contribution follows three bands: 3,000 euros for families with ISEE up to 25,000 euros; 2,500 euros per core with ISEE between 25,001 and 40,000 euros; 1,500 euros for those who have an economic indicator of more than 40,000 euros or in the case of ISEE not present or not valid.

The same amount of 1,500 euros also applies to families with children born from 2024 but with ISEA over 40,000 euros. Another novelty introduced by the Budget Law 2025 concerns the calculation of the ISEE: the contributions received from the single and universal allowance are no longer counted (the monthly contribution that families receive for children).

To access the nursery bonus, the main requirements are the citizenship (Italian, of an EU country or valid residence permit), the residence in Italy and a child under the age of three. Applications can only be submitted online through the INPS portal or through the patronage, until 31 December 2025.

It is important that the request is sent by the parent who actually pays the straight line fees, while for home support it is necessary that the applicant lives with his son in the same home. The applications are accepted in order of arrival, until the 937.8 million euros allocated for 2025 are exhausted. 

There are no income-based rankings or other criteria: only the rapidity in the presentation counts. For this, it is better not to wait for the last months of the year, because the funds could end before.

The INPS specifies that the timing of the applications are normally 30 days, as established by the law. Payments will follow after verifying the documentation presented and based on the availability of funds.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A survey by Writer, specializing in generative AI, examined the gap between what companies can do with AI and what employees want them to do.

The survey collected responses from 1,600 employees in the United States, including 800 executives and 800 employees, concerning the use of AI at the workplace.

Professionals want AI at their workplace

Many professionals are now looking for jobs that allow them to work with generative AI. Among those questioned, 59% of executives and 35% of employees said they were actively looking for a new job in a more innovative generative AI company than their current employer.

Additional proof of the attraction of AI, 97% of executives and 81% of employees said that if they were looking for a new job, they would like one in an innovative company in the field of generative AI.

Companies that adopt AI should therefore not have so much difficulty in retaining employees wishing to use it.

About 93% of executives and 90% of employees declared themselves optimistic about the approach of their company in terms of generative AI.

The survey respondents also indicated several reasons for which their employer adopted AI. The income opportunity is the first reason, followed by the interest of employees, then in competitive pressure.

How do these professionals take advantage of AI?

Data and knowledge analysis is the most popular response, followed by customer assistance, knowledge management, automation of complex tasks, and automation of repetitive tasks.

Some 97% of managers and 88% of employees said they had benefited from generative AI tools. Many of them said it gave them more time to focus on strategy or make data-based decisions more quickly.

A smaller number said that Gen gives them more time to manage or collaborate with their colleagues, while others allow them to spend less time writing reports and emails or performing administrative tasks.

Why do companies find it difficult to integrate AI?

This brings us back to companies that are struggling to integrate AI. What are the challenges and obstacles to which companies have faced?

Many people interviewed said that the adoption of AI has led to power struggles in their business, creating tensions between CIOs and other sectors of activity, as well as between managers and employees.

Other difficulties appeared. Some employees do not even know if their business has an AI strategy. Many executives and employees believe that their employer has not obtained a high return on investment thanks to AI, despite its promises.

In some companies, employees pay for their own AI tools because their business does not provide them with the ones they want to use.

A small number of employees even admitted to having sabotaged their company's strategy in terms of AI by making believe that the tools were not efficient enough or that they generated poor quality.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A senior science reporter covering energy and the environment reported on Monday that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will quit funding research into the impacts of climate change on health.

 

The NIH gave directions to staff members last week that likely puts a stop to any more funding for new academic programs or research into the impacts climate change has on health, according to internal records viewed by ProPublica.

 

This follows news from Mother Jones that the Department of Health and Human Services halted funding for three existing climate and health programs at NIH, including the Climate Change and Health Initiative launched in 2021.

 

The moves threaten efforts to protect Americans from more extreme weather and other disasters made worse by climate change, public health advocates warn.

 

"This is a direct attack on our health, on the science that keeps us protected," Juan Declet-Barreto of the Union of Concerned Scientists told The Verge.

 

Kids born in 2024 can expect "poorer air quality, hotter days, and lifelong social and community disruptions from climate change," according to a US policy brief from health journal The Lancet.

 

HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard said in an email to The Verge that "HHS is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) eliminates humanitarian aid programs and fires tens of thousands of government workers, demonstrators are expressing their rage by picketing Tesla showrooms and demanding Tesla owners sell their vehicles.

Others have taken things further, defacing Tesla vehicles with anti-Musk slogans, smashing windows, and even setting some Tesla property on fire. Musk’s allies in the Trump administration are threatening to prosecute anyone caught defacing Tesla vehicles by classifying the acts as “domestic terrorism.“

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.zdnet.de/88421197/ransomware-attacken-steigen-um-132-prozent/'>Ransomware attacks increase by 132 percent</a></h2><b>Source:</b> zdnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:43:19 <p>
In the last half of the year, ransomware attacks rose by 132 percent.

 
The current half-year report of the Advanced Threat Operations Team from Ontinue also shows a positive development: the ransom payments fell by 35 percent in 2024.


While in 2023 $1.25 billion in the pockets of cybercriminals to buy encrypted data again, it was only around $814 million last year.

 
The reason for this lies in better backup strategies and incident response plans, but also in new regulations that are increasingly prohibiting payments.

 
All of this leads to a rethink in Hacker groups that now adapted their tactics: Instead of just encrypting the data, they steal them and threaten to make them publicly to force companies to pay.


According to Ontinue, ransomware attacks are still one of the most popular means of hacker collectives and cybercriminals.

 
A worrying trend is that the hacker groups are less and less relying on pure programming knowledge, but has recently become increasingly on general IT skills.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230918/'>"NVIDIA", "Claude", "X Æ A-12" -- Can you pronounce it correctly?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:43:00 <p>
The word "NVIDIA" is so popular that it is featured in everyday economic news, but how exactly do these tech industry terms pronounce?

iOS
This would be the easiest. Simply line up and pronounce "Eye", "Oh", and "Ess". This is what Tim Cook and Apple officials say. However, in reality, there are quite a few people who pronounce it as "Eye-Ohs" or "Eye-Oss".

NVIDIA
This is easy to make mistakes. It's easy to wonder whether it's "EN-vi-dee-uh" or "IN-vid-ee-uh." When CEO Jenson Hwang said in his keynote that he "loves NVIDIA," he pronounced "IN-vid-ee-uh," which is the correct answer.

Jeff Bezos
Jeff Bezos is the well-known founder of Amazon. In 2013, the Washington Post introduced the pronunciation he himself spoke in a video, and according to it it is "BAY-zos." "Jeff" is just "Jeff."

Claude
The name of the Anthropic AI model. Is this "clod" or "cloud"? When the CEO appeared on CNBC, he pronounced "Clawed."


HUAWEI
A Chinese tech company. Normally, it is pronounced "WAH-way," but if you're going to imitate CEO Ren Zhengfei's pronunciation, it's "HWAH-way," which is initially a little more H-oriented.

SQL
Abbreviation for "Structured Query Language" that is often found in database-related areas. To be precise, it's better to read the words "Ess", "Cue", and "Ell," one by one, but many people call them "sequel."

Sundar Pichai
CEO of Google parent company Alphabet. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kemlani pronounced the reading of him on TikTok as "SOON-dir PITCH-eye."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/lonely-people-are-even-sadder-after-using-chatbots-research-finds-2000580344'>Lonely People Are Even Sadder After Using Chatbots, Research Finds</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:39:51 <p>
OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab last week released two new studies aimed at exploring the effect of AI chatbots on loneliness.

The results are complicated, but they also line up with what we now know about social media: Chatbots can make people lonely, but the people who reported feeling more alone after heavy use of an AI tended to feel pretty alone before they started.


To do the studies, OpenAI turned over almost 40 million interactions its users had with ChatGPT to researchers at MIT. In the first study, MIT looked at the “aggregate usage” of around 6,000 “heavy users of ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode over 3 months” and surveyed 4,076 specific users to understand how the chatbot made them feel.


In the second study, the researchers looked at how 981 participants interacted with ChatGPT over the course of 28 days. The papers are in-depth and complicated and worth a close read.

One of the big takeaways is that people who used the chatbots casually and didn’t engage with them emotionally didn’t report feeling lonelier at the end of the study. Yet, if a user said they were lonely before they started the study, they felt worse after it was over.


“Overall, higher daily usage—across all modalities and conversation types—correlated with higher loneliness, dependence, and problematic use, and lower socialization,” the study said.

Different kinds of interaction produced different results. Lonely users using a voice-based chatbot rather than a text-based one tended to fare worse. “Results showed that while voice-based chatbots initially appeared beneficial in mitigating loneliness and dependence compared with text-based chatbots, these advantages diminished at high usage levels, especially with a neutral-voice chatbot,” the study said.


The researchers were clear eyed about the results and compared the findings to previous studies on social media addiction and problem gaming. “The relationship between loneliness and social media use often becomes cyclical: the lonelier people are, the more time they spend on these platforms where they compare themselves with others and experience the fear of missing out, leading to more loneliness and subsequent usage,” the MIT team wrote in their paper.


“Loneliness is both a cause and effect of problematic internet use,” the researchers stressed. The study also lacked a control group and did not take into account external factors like the weather and seasonal changes, two things that can have a massive impact on mood.


Research into human emotional dependence on chatbots and its consequences is in its early days.

The researchers said that companies working on AI needed to study the guardrails in their services that would help mitigate the risks of exacerbating loneliness. They also said that the more a person understood about how AI systems work, the less likely they were to become dependent on it.


“From a broader perspective, there is a need for a more holistic approach to AI literacy,” the study said. “Current AI literacy efforts predominantly focus on technical concepts, whereas they should also incorporate psychosocial dimensions.”


The final sentence of the first study’s “impact” section cut to the heart of the problem: “Excessive use of AI chatbots is not merely a technological issue but a societal problem, necessitating efforts to reduce loneliness and promote healthier human connections.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/nist-doge-layoffs-atomic-spectroscopy/'>Trump Admin Plans to Cut Team Responsible for Critical Atomic Measurement Data</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:34:53 <p>
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is discussing plans to eliminate an entire team responsible for publishing and maintaining critical atomic measurement data.

The Atomic Spectroscopy Group studies how atoms absorb or emit light, allowing researchers to identify the elements present in a given sample. It then collects and updates those calculations in the Atomic Spectra Database, a catalog of industry-leading spectroscopy information and measurements that plays a crucial role in fields like astronomy, astrophysics, and medicine.

The database receives an average of 70,000 search requests worldwide each month. 

NIST's Atomic Spectroscopy Group has been used to discover many new exoplanets and develop powerful new diagnostic techniques, among other applications.


Evgeny Stambulchik, a senior staff research scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, started a petition to gather signatures from other researchers and members of the public who oppose the cuts to the atomic spectroscopy team. The petition currently has over 1,700 signatures.

Stambulchik said that atomic spectroscopy is essentially the only tool that can be used to interpret remote objects in space, like those observed by the powerful James Webb telescope.

It's also a crucial tool for investigating "matter at temperatures reaching tens of million degrees," such as inside a nuclear fusion reactor.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Our introduction to life in the Shire in some of Fellowship of the Rings‘ earliest moments are some of the best bits of the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy–Howard Shore’s sweeping music, the lush pastoral visuals, the warmth and joy of a peaceful life just buzzing through the screen. And now, all those bits, and then some, are forming the latest massive Lego Lord of the Rings set.

This morning Lego announced that the latest addition to its Lord of the Rings line–after its grand return in 2023 with Rivendell, and last year’s huge Barad-Dûr set–will whisk builders away to the Shire. Clocking in at just over 2,000 pieces, the set includes a brand new replica of Bag End, Bilbo and Frodo’s Hobbit hole, as well as various vignettes to depict the scenes of Bilbo’s 111th birthday party–right down to the flaming magical dragon firework that Merry and Pippin pilfer.

Lego Lord of the Rings: The Shire Gallery

It’s not the first time Bag End has been made in Lego form: back in 2012, a Bag End set released as part of Lego’s sets for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but the latest recreation gives the exterior an upgrade, and its interior now depicts a few key elements from Fellowship, like Bilbo’s writing room and the kitchen where he tells Gandalf of his plans to dramatically exit the Shire. As well as Bag End, some celebration tents, and the party tree that centers Biblo’s birthday bash, the set will come with 9 minifigures: Gandalf the Grey, the only standard-sized minifigure, and then 8 hobbits: Bilbo, Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Farmer Proudfoot and his wife, and Rosie Cotton.

That’s not all the halfling you can get though. Members of Lego’s Insider program who purchase the set any time between April 2 and April 8 will receive a bonus gift build in the form of Smeagol & Deagol, a vignette recreating the opening scenes from Return of the King where Smeagol and his unfortunate brother discover the One Ring after its generations-long slumber.

Lego Lord of the Rings: The Shire will release on April 5 for $260, with early access available to Lego Insiders from April 2.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230891/'>The latest iPad review for around 50,000 yen What is the 11th generation (A16) model?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> zdnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 15:03:00 <p>
あなたにとってiPadとは何か？──。これは意地悪な質問ではない。ある人にとってはクリエイティブな端末で、ある人にとってはゲーム、あるいは「単に画面の大きいiPhone」だったりする。

iPadの上位モデルはプロフェッショナルな用途も十分にこなせるが、実際にはそこまで求めていない人も多い。もし派手な機能を求めないなら、いまだに「無印iPad」と呼ばれるAppleのベーシックモデルを買えばいい。大多数の人が欲しいのは、おそらくそういうiPadだろう。

今回登場した第11世代「iPad」（A16）もまさにそうしたモデルだ。日本では5万8800円で買える本機は、128GBストレージとA16チップを備え、まさにちょうどよい仕様に仕上がっている。

第11世代「iPad」A16（Amazonで価格をチェック）



ただし、iPadをノートPCライクに使うつもりなら話は別だ。キーボードをつけたり、Apple Pencilで本格的なイラストやデザインをしたいなら、最初からM3搭載の新しい「iPad Air」を検討しておいたほうが賢明だ。ディスプレイの表示品質も格段にきれいだし、周辺機器を揃えるとすぐに金額がかさむからだ。

M3搭載の「iPad Air」（Amazonで価格をチェック）



筆者の場合、iPadはボードゲームの「Balatro」や「カタン」「Retro Bowl Plus」を延々とプレイしたり、テレビがふさがっているときに動画を観たり、資料を読んだりしている。たまにキーボードケースをつけて文章を書くことはあるが、写真を眺めたり、SNSをだらだら見たり、友人や家族とビデオチャットしたりがメインだ。マルチタスクでクリエイティブなことをする機会はほとんどない。そんな私には無印のiPadで十分だ。

●ストレージ容量は前モデルから倍増

無印のiPadは昔からストレージ容量が不足しており不満だった。先代の第10世代iPadは64GBしかなく、記事を書くときは「ストレージは上げておいたほうがいい」とおすすめしてきた。

一方、今回の11世代iPadは同じ価格帯で128GBとストレージ容量が倍増した。もちろんパワーユーザーには物足りないかもしれないが、ストレージの増量を検討する人なら、最初からM3チップを積んだiPad Airを選んだほうがいい。ただし値段は9万8800円する。

●A16チップで少しだけ高速。でも爆速ではない

iPad（A16）はA16チップを搭載している。これは「iPhone 14 Pro」や「iPhone 15」にも使われているチップで、第10世代iPadのA14よりは速くなっているが、ぶっちぎりの性能というわけではない。

Geekbench 6のマルチコアスコアは6186で、M3搭載のiPad Air（約1万1643）のおよそ半分だ。シングルコアは2589で、これはM2世代のiPad Proと同等だ。ただ、おそらく大半の人は、このiPadでマルチタスクはしないだろう。

普段使いのアプリ、例えば動画ストリーミングや軽めのゲーム、記事を読むくらいなら、この程度の性能差はわからないはずだ。

筆者はハイスペックなiPadももちろん好きだ。プロセッサが速いほうが長く使えるし、画面も格段に美しいし、性能に余裕があるに越したことはない。

ただ、Mシリーズのチップを搭載するiPadだからといって日常的に大きく得するかというと、個人的にはそうでもない。MシリーズiPad AirやiPad Proに搭載されている追加のマルチタスク機能も、同時に4つのアプリを開ける程度で、正直そこまで活用していない。

Apple Intelligence？ 今はまだ全然実用レベルではないし、自分の生活にはあまり役立たない。今後のiPadOSではAI機能が強化されるかもしれないが、A16チップ搭載のこの第11世代iPadはそのアップデートから外れている。

今は正直、Apple Intelligenceがなくても困らない。でも1年後にはどう感じるかわからない。今は問題なくても、将来変わるかもしれない。そのあたりは自分の使い方とアップデートの方向性を見ながら判断すればいいと思う。

カメラにも変化はない。でもそれで問題ない。第10世代のアップデートですでにカメラまわり（とiPad本体のデザイン全体）が刷新されているからだ。要するに今回のモデルは、第10世代にストレージ容量とチップの性能を上げただけの変化だ。だが、横向きフロントカメラが正面に配置されているおかげで、ケースに立てて家族みんなでビデオ通話しても、画面の中央にきれいに映ってくれる。

●不満点

少し不満なのは、2024年秋に発売された最新「iPad mini」よりも仕様が劣るという点だ。

最新の8インチ「iPad mini」はA17チップを搭載しており、Apple Intelligenceを使える。それにApple Pencil Proにも対応していて、本体側面にマグネットでピタッとくっつく。

一方、今回のiPadはApple Intelligenceの対応ラインからぎりぎり外れている。それに、使えるペンはシンプルなUSB-CのApple Pencilか、Lightningアダプタが必要な初代Apple Pencilだけだ。どちらもiPad本体にマグネット装着する機能はなく、持ち歩くときは別の方法を考えるか、ペン収納ループ付きのケースでも使うしかない。

USB-CのApple Pencilはアート系アプリで使えるが、筆圧感知やホバーモード、新しいタップ操作などの機能は一切ない。本格的にアートをやるならやはり「iPad Air」や「iPad Pro」を買うべきだ。

ただ、Appleが手頃なモデルをラインナップしてくれているのはありがたい。子ども用にもいいし、シンプルに使いたいだけの人には十分だ。余計な機能を削っている分、価格が上がらなかったのは評価したい。とはいえ、次のモデルでは、もう少し上のチップを積んで、Apple Pencil Proに対応して欲しいとは思う。

Project G-Assist is now available with the latest Nvidia App version 11.0.3.218, an idea that started as an April Fools' joke eight years ago.

 

Nvidia also introduced custom DLSS Super Resolution scaling factors, allowing users to override the default options with granularity ranging from 33% to 100%. Several settings from the original Nvidia Control Panel also appear in the App.



G-Assist uses a third-party SLM (Small Language Model) that's trained to carry out specific tasks. These tasks are generally associated with optimizing performance, answering questions related to your PC's hardware, and controlling lighting and fan speeds on select peripherals.

 

You can get G-Assist up and running as long as you have an Nvidia RTX 30/40/50 series GPU that features 12GB of VRAM or higher. Unfortunately, that leaves behind many entry-level and mid-range GPUs like the RTX 3060 Ti.



Following the Nvidia Blackwell RTX 50-series GPU launch, Nvidia rolled out an update to the Nvidia App that added a new DLSS Override section. Today, with the new update, instead of the hardcoded presets, you can adjust the input resolution to your liking between 33% and 100%.

 

Two important features once only found in the Nvidia Control Panel have made their way to the Nvidia App: Display Scaling and Display Color. The former allows you to override scaling in games/apps, using hardware-accelerated integer scaling, while the latter is used to tweak your display's color settings.



You can download the latest version of the Nvidia App from the official website or update it directly from within the Nvidai App if you're already using it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Steam Deck has been the best gaming handheld PC on the market due to its console-like ease of use with SteamOS.

Valve promised that SteamOS 3.8 would support non-Valve handhelds, and now several videos have surfaced of SteamOS running on Asus and Lenovo handhelds.

Phawx posted a video of himself running SteamOS on an unsupported Asus ROG Ally, which is one of the Steam Deck's earliest competitors.

The OS used by Phawx was not the full SteamOS 3.8 release, but rather SteamOS Holo, which has limitations such as locking the handheld's TDP at 15 W.

At 15 W TDP, the Asus ROG Ally running SteamOS outperformed the Steam Deck in Batman Arkham Knight by 13 average FPS.

However, the Steam Deck still managed to outperform the Ally in Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered.

A similar video was posted by YouTuber ETA Prime showing off the SteamOS 3.8 beta on a Windows-based Lenovo Legion Go S.

The Legion Go S running SteamOS performed marginally better than the same handheld running Windows.

SteamOS seems to offer better performance compared to similar Windows builds, which could be a problem for Microsoft.

Microsoft is reportedly working with Asus on an Xbox-centric handheld that may run a version of Windows optimized for smaller screens.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to the first large-scale study, chatbots like ChatGPT can be addictive.

The researchers looked at four million ChatGPT interactions and surveyed 4,000 people to gauge changes in the emotional well-being of the user base.

Chatbots often have a pet name, and their "conversational style, first-person language, and ability to simulate human-like interactions" can be both personal and personable, notes the OpenAI research paper.

This leads to some humans using chatbots for support and companionship.

The study highlights that a major Reddit community discussing AI companions has become one of the largest on the platform, with 2.3 million members.

Dabbling or light use of these things isn't usually an issue and can even be beneficial.

However, things can get out of hand in all these examples, and the MIT paper says that the "increasingly human-like behavior and engagement of chatbots" works to increase addictive qualities and behavior in users.

In addition to addiction and dependency issues, suspected chatbot usage problems were investigated by the teams, such as unrealistic expectations in real life and social withdrawal.

If you or anyone you know has indicators of addiction to chatbots, it might be a good idea to talk with them or consult a professional.

Warning signs include "preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, and mood modification," says OpenAI.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In reality, it only has some features, and of course no Myna license is included.

Starting from spring 2025, smartphones will be able to include "functions equivalent to My Number cards" such as name, address, date of birth, gender, My Number, and face photo.

However, according to the National Police Agency's website, even at that time, it is not possible to install a driver's license on a smartphone.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/princess-mononoke-4k-interview-atsushi-okui-2000579990'>Studio Ghibli's Atsushi Okui on Princess Mononoke's Enduring Environmental Message</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 14:00:26 <p>
Anime fans have long enjoyed the wide array of Studio Ghibli films, each offering unique, whimsical tales and awe-inspiring hand-drawn artwork.

Princess Mononoke, written and directed by famed animator Hayao Miyazaki, follows young warrior Ashitaka as he adventures in search of a cure to his life-threatening curse. During his journey, he stumbles into a heated conflict between an industrial village and San, a young girl raised by wolves fighting to stop humans from destroying the forest she calls home.

Ahead of the film’s re-release, we spoke with Ghibli vice president Atsushi Okui (via translator Mihoko Imai) about film’s enduring environmental message, inspirations, and its lasting legacy.

Isaiah Colbert, io9: Studio Ghibli has habitually made an annual theatrical pilgrimage, rereleasing its films in the U.S. However, in celebration of Princess Mononoke’s 40th anniversary, this will mark the film’s first release in 4K IMAX. What does this monumental accomplishment mean to Ghibli as it embarks on making even more animated films for a global audience?

Atsushi Okui: Ghibli films have been done on film, and Mononoke is no exception. The DCP (Digital Cinema Package) data for use for the theatrical releases of these films were 2K data, so the reason we embarked on this 4k project for the Mononoke release was because the DCP was made 10 years ago and that was done in 2K because that was the standard.

io9: Studio Ghibli isn’t shy about crafting stories for all ages while anchoring its tales on mature ideas like Spirited Away’s exploration of the anxieties of growing up, Kiki’s Delivery Service’s focus on creative burnout, and The Boy and the Heron’s heady themes of reconciling the loss of a loved one. Mononoke is no exception–how do you think its message of environmentalism has developed and resonated with audiences over the past 28 years?

Okui: Back in 1997, as with all of our other films, we make our films with a message that resonates with us at the time that we made it. It is a message of the time in 1997. We really never think about how the message will resonate decades hence or decades forth.

io9: Creatives are often inspired by the art they experience in their youth. Princess Mononoke has been cited as the inspiration behind many American artists and directors, including James Cameron’s Avatar films and Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko’s Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series. What works—be they other films or books—have inspired your team while creating Princess Mononoke?

Okui: Mr. Miyazaki is a man who likes to read widely, and he draws his inspiration from many different sources, including nature and history.

io9: Ghibli’s films have resonated around the world for their portrayal of women, especially women in leading roles like San. Do you see this kind of portrayal of strong femininity as an important perspective Ghibli wants to keep focusing on as a studio? How do you feel about the pushback in certain circles against keeping female characters at the forefront of your storytelling?

Okui: We can only say that because we make films that reflect the times as they come, we cannot necessarily promise you that our films will always have a strong female protagonist.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bambu Lab has built the Bambu H2D, a 3D printer that can also cut, draw, and etch.

The Bambu H2D starts at $1,899 and features two 3D printing nozzles and a modular attachment system. The printer can be used to dice through paper and vinyl with the blade attachment and draw logos or schematics with the pen attachment.

With 10-watt and 40-watt lasers, users can engrave and burn laser images into various materials. The author was able to use the printer to carve out a wooden Pokémon stencil for their daughter and create a custom cork drink coaster from one of her drawings.

The Bambu H2D is designed to muscle in on the prosumer hobbyist market, competing with products from Cricut, GlowForge, and Epilog. The author notes that they have had mixed results with the printer's basic 3D printing modes and that the dual-nozzle feature isn't working reliably.

The Bambu H2D comes with a range of features, including cameras, algorithms, and LIDAR. The author praises the printer's touchscreen and software for easing newcomers into printing, cutting, and etching.

However, the author notes that they won't be reviewing the printer soon due to its numerous functions and potential bugs. They also mention that the printer may require more time in the oven before it's fully dialed in.

The Bambu H2D is available for pre-order with various configurations, including a $1,899 model, a $2,799 combo with a 10W laser, an H2D AMS combo, and a $3,499 Laser Full Combo package.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/how-to-watch-the-partial-solar-eclipse-on-march-29-and-spot-the-unique-devil-horns-2000579194'>How to Watch the Partial Solar Eclipse on March 29 and Spot the Unique ‘Devil Horns’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 13:50:21 <p>
The Moon is getting ready to squeeze its way in front of our view of the Sun, partially blocking the star’s disc to create a rare view in the morning skies.

A partial solar eclipse will take place on Saturday, March 29, and will be visible throughout most of North America, Europe, as well as some parts of North and West Africa, and Northern Asia.

During a partial solar eclipse, the Moon passes in front of the Sun as seen from Earth, but the central part of its shadow—known as the umbra—misses the planet, according to NASA. That’s because the Sun, Moon, and Earth are not perfectly lined up.

Instead, the Moon’s larger, fuzzy outer shadow, called the penumbra, falls on Earth, causing the Sun to appear partially obscured.

When is the partial solar eclipse?

The partial solar eclipse will begin at 4:50 a.m. ET on Saturday, and will peak at 6:47 a.m. ET, according to timeanddate.com.

As noted, the eclipse will be partial for everyone in the Moon’s shadow.

Looking at the NASA eclipse map above, the curved yellow lines show the percentage of the Sun that will be covered at peak eclipse in each location, while green lines mark when that maximum coverage happens.

In most of North America, the partial solar eclipse will have already begun before the Sun begins to rise. Viewers looking at the eclipse from some parts of North America could be treated to a rare sight of “solar horns,” where the tips of the eclipsed Sun crescent are turned upwards as the star rises above the horizon, appearing as a pair of devil horns.

The solar horns can be seen from locations in southeastern Quebec and southwest New Brunswick in Canada and in northern Maine in the U.S., according to Space.com.

In western Europe and northwestern Africa, the eclipse will begin in the mid- to late morning while in eastern Europe and northern Asia, the eclipse will mostly occur in the afternoon or early evening, according to NASA.

The shadow of the Moon moves from west to east. That’s because the Moon orbits in the same direction as the rotation of Earth, although it travels twice as fast.

The partial eclipse will end at 8:43 a.m. ET for viewers at the last location to see it.

How to watch the partial solar eclipse

As with the total solar eclipse, you must protect your eyes while gazing up at the Sun when it is partially blocked.

You must use certified eclipse glasses, or solar viewing glasses, when looking directly at the Sun, and you cannot look through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other device while wearing eclipse glasses, NASA warns.

Instead, a special solar filter must be attached to the front of any optical device.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Among the participants in the candlelit dinner there were the national security councilor Michael Waltz and the deputy head of the political staff of the White House Stephen Miller, as reported a source that is familiar with events.

Even the secretary of state Marco Rubio was in Mar-a-lago in the same weekend, as demonstrated by a photo of the next day viewed by Wired and confirmed by a source aware of the events.

The details of the Signal group Fiasco emerged because in the days preceding the US attack, a user with the name "Michael Waltz" accidentally added the director of Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg to a chat entitled "Houthi PC Small Group". 

Atlantic told the conversations on the military plans in Yemen which took place on the platform, which also involved Waltz, Rubio and Miller involved.

The day before dinner, the officials in question discussed the opportunity to proceed with the bombing, underlining in some cases fear of the potential economic impact of the air attack.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing.

Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters.

Dominant US tech services may be the next focus. 

There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers.

Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the Internet and keep thousands of businesses running.

“There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former decadelong member of the European Parliament.

Politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives on March 18.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

同社は「統合オブザーバビリティSaaSプラットフォーム」を提供する企業としてグローバルでも右肩上がりの成長を継続しているといい、正井氏はその理由として積極的な研究開発投資を挙げた。年間で売上比28％を研究開発に投資しているとのことで、同氏が紹介したグローバルでのデータでは2021年以降オブザーバビリティベンダー各社の中でもDatadogの投資額が突出しており、競合に大差を付けている状況が示された。同社の市場シェアは2022年から首位を維持しているそうで、積極的な研究開発投資に支えられた製品力が市場の支持を得ているといえるだろう。

2025年の事業戦略を話した正井氏は、重点製品として「クラウドセキュリティ」「オンコール」「AI」の3つを挙げた。オンコールは2024年発表の新機能で、単純に言えばスマートフォンなどに通知を発信する機能といえる。従来はこの機能が提供されていなかったため、ユーザー企業は別途オンコール製品を用意して組み合わせて実現していたが、モニタリングから通知の発信、さらにリモートからのインシデント対応などを単一プラットフォームで実現したことで、既に多くの引き合いが来ているという。

AIに関しては、AIを活用して従来のモニタリングの機能を強化するとともに、ユーザー企業のAI環境に対する監視／管理を強化していくという2つの方向性で取り組まれる。具体的には、監視データを分析し、迅速な問題解決を支援する「Watchdog」、AIチャットボット「Bits AI」、AIスタック全体を可視化する「AI Integration」、大規模言語モデル（LLM）の可視性やパフォーマンス、セキュリティなどを総合的に支援する「LLM Observability」などが提供される（図1）。

チャネル＆アライアンス戦略に関しては、「Oracle Cloud Infrastructure」（OCI）の正式サポートが2024年に発表され、これによって「4大クラウド（Amazon Web Services、Google Cloud Platform、Microsoft Azure、OCI）全てをオブザーバビリティの観点でカバー」した。また、国内パートナーとの協業体制も強化しており、最上位となるゴールドティアパートナーが伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ（CTC）、アイレット、キンドリルジャパン、京セラコミュニケーションシステムの4社体制になったことに加え、新たなパートナー企業として東京エレクトロン デバイスとNTTデータとの契約締結が同日付で発表されている。

正井氏は、2025年の国内事業戦略として「日本市場への積極投資は今後も継続する」「日本法人の組織を拡大し、より強力に顧客、パートナーを支援可能な体制を作る」「市場カバレッジ強化については、オブザーバビリティ市場拡大を確実に捉えるため、2024年のミッドマーケット組織に続いて、2025年は関西地域担当のチームを新たに立ち上げる」「パートナーエコシステムの一層の拡大と、特にデリバリーの強化を図り、パートナービジネスの比重を高める」「新規顧客の獲得に加え、既存顧客における導入製品の拡大によってさらなる売上増を図る」「マーケティング活動では、オブザーバビリティ領域でのトッププレゼンスを獲得する」といった方針を語った。

Otter, the AI-powered automated transcription service, is launching a trio of artificial intelligence agents that aim to provide quick assistance and boost productivity during calls and meetings. The most notable is the aptly named Otter Meeting Agent, a voice-activated meeting assistant that’s capable of using company data to answer questions and complete tasks.

Otter says its new Meeting Agent is a “transformative evolution” of the existing AI meeting chatbot it already offers. As such, the video Otter released demonstrating some of the Meeting Agent features shows off some text-based capabilities that the older AI assistant already provided, such as “attending” online meetings, transcribing conversations, and summarizing information. The Meeting Agent, however, can now answer questions based on information in the company’s meeting database, and users can ask it to schedule future meetings and draft emails using “natural voice interaction.”

Otter says the AI Meeting Agent can currently be used on Zoom calls, and is being “incrementally rolled out” to all Otter.ai users. The Meeting Agent will be supported on Microsoft Teams and Google Meet in the coming weeks.

Otter is also launching a Sales Agent that provides live coaching assistance during calls to help sales representatives close deals and handle complaints, and a Sales Development Representative (SDR) Agent that can autonomously demonstrate products “without human intervention,” according to Otter.

The Sales Agent is supported on “all virtual conferencing platforms,” and is available to Otter enterprise sales customers. The SDR Agent is live on Otter’s website and companies interested in purchasing it will need to contact Otter directly. Otter says it’s also planning to release additional Agents “in the future” that specialize in marketing, recruiting, and “other functions.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 25th, Fujisoft and ABEJA announced that they had begun collaboration. This will promote various joint developments, including the construction of software development methods and tools using the AI ​​agents of ABEJA Platform.

ABEJA Platform is an AI platform that provides a comprehensive pipeline needed for continuous AI integration. The operational cycles for utilizing deep learning can be used in each process of "acquisition", "accumulation", "learning", "deployment", and "inference/relearning", and the necessary infrastructure and peripheral systems can be used, making it possible to save labor and automate the implementation and operation of deep learning in particular.

According to Fujisoft, while the movement to utilize generation AI in software development is progressing, many of the development tools related to generation AI are produced overseas, and some companies cannot easily adopt them due to differences in development culture, and others cannot actively utilize them even if they are introduced because they are not effective.

In order to solve this problem, the two companies will jointly develop AI-first software development methods and tools using ABEJA Platform, an AI platform based in Japan. By combining ABEJA Platform with Fujisoft's software development technology and knowledge on generation AI, this will lead to labor savings in advanced software development tasks that engineers have traditionally been responsible for.

In the future, we will promote joint development in a wide range of fields, including development methods that utilize the generation AI and AI agent functions, and construction of tools, and modernize the development process. Additionally, the company aims to utilize the know-how gained through joint development in related fields such as test code development and test automation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The author has traveled to Lulea, Sweden to visit Polestar's winter testing site on an icy lake called Stor-Skabram.

Polestar is conducting winter testing to fine-tune traction and stability-control programming for their electric vehicles.

This type of testing is especially important for EVs because they have electronic nannies that can't be turned off entirely, as the motors will rev up with torque when the tires lose traction.

The author notes that EVs require progressive output responses from the software to maintain performance and safety simultaneously while driving on ice and snow.

Battery performance in cold weather is also a challenge for EVs, as chemical cells don't respond well to frigid temperatures.

Polestar's Scandinavian roots make this testing even more important, given their focus on sustainability.

AMD is allegedly planning a successor to its Strix Point lineup of APUs for laptops, codenamed Gorgon Point.

Gorgon Point allegedly serves as a drop-in replacement for existing Strix Point designs, supporting the same FP8 package. There aren't many architectural changes, as Gorgon Point seemingly sticks with the same Zen 5/5c CPU cores, an RDNA 3.5-based integrated GPU, and an NPU based on XDNA 2.

Per the slides, AMD's mobile offerings will continue with Hawk Point (Ryzen 200) for mainstream devices, while on the premium end, Gorgon Point is expected to supersede Strix Point next year.

Following a two-year cadence, we anticipate Zen 6 to launch sometime later in 2025. However, the slides mention no Zen 6-based APU (likely to be named Medusa Point) for 2025 or 2026.

AMD's internal projections depict single-digit performance increments versus incumbent Strix Point APUs, if these slides are genuine. With the respective Ryzen AI 300 (Strix Point) APU at 15W as the baseline (100%), we've found that the most impressive wins land at just 5-6%, largely due to the faster clock speeds and improved binning.

AMD will probably incorporate its then-latest architectures, such as Zen 6 and RDNA 4 or the first iteration of UDNA, if we're lucky, with these chips. Sadly, an expected release window has not been specified, although we could be looking as far off as late 2026 or early 2027.

During a Q&A session with LG and AMD, it was supposedly mentioned that there are no plans to bring RDNA 4 discrete GPUs to laptops. This much was already said by AMD in broad terms previously, where it indicated RDNA 4 desktop GPUs are their first priority.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed Monday that he had been in a Signal group chat with top defense officials as they discussed plans for strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Goldberg writes that he was mistakenly added to the chat, which included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Vice President JD Vance, among others.

Hillary Clinton shared the Atlantic story on Monday with the words “you have got to be kidding me.”

Trump was asked about the breach during a press conference on Monday and insisted it was the first time he was hearing about it.

He said: “I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business. It’s not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it.”

Republicans had criticized Clinton's handling of classified data during her 2016 campaign for president.

Hegseth himself was critical of Clinton's handling of classified data back in 2016.

He told Fox News before the 2016 election that any security professional would be fired and criminally prosecuted for mishandling classified information like Clinton did.

In 2016, Trump said he would prosecute anyone who mishandled classified information.

Elected Democrats ridiculed the past statements of some members of the group chat.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pat Gelsinger became chief executive of Intel back in 2021 with the aim to turn the company around and regain process technology and product leadership over several years.

He was ousted in late 2024 before the job was done, but he remains strongly supportive of the company's mission.

"I was committed to and wanting to finish that story on the revitalization of Intel and with the board, the company, and now with Lip-Bu's leadership, you are really cheering them on to finish, because the role that Intel plays in the semiconductor industry is critical and one that's important not just for the industry but for the U.S., so I could not be more supportive of the team and Lip-Bu to finishing their journey," said Pat Gelsinger.

The challenges Intel faced, particularly around funding and market expectations, made the transformation extremely difficult.

Gelsinger pointed out that one of the biggest obstacles was the financial burden of building a next-generation fabrication network.

He noted that his IDM 2.0 strategy — under which Intel remains a vertically integrated maker of its own chips and a contract chipmaker with third party clients — was still the correct one, but acknowledged how capital-intensive and demanding it is for any company.

As Intel's core business declined faster than expected, it became clear that external capital was needed to fund the initiative.

"It is a heavy assignment, and for any company to carry the financial requirements of building next-generation technology fab network, it is very heavy in terms of capital returns required and the investments required to go accomplish that," Gelsinger acknowledged.

The former CEO of Intel also criticized the short-term focus of financial markets, which he said clashed with the long-term nature of the transformation Intel was undergoing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Comments made by TSMC founder Morris Chang about high fab building costs in Arizona and higher operating costs in the U.S. created an impression that producing chips in America is too expensive to be financially viable.

It costs TSMC less than 10% more to process a 300mm wafer in Arizona than the same wafer made in Taiwan, according to G. Dan Hutcheson from TechInsights.

While it definitely costs more to build a fab in the U.S. than in Taiwan, TSMC's cost was significantly higher because it built its first overseas fab in decades at a brand-new site with a new, sometimes unskilled workforce, according to Hutcheson.

The dominant factor of semiconductor production cost is the cost of equipment, which contributes well over two-thirds of overall wafer expenses. Tools made by leading companies like ASML, Applied Materials, KLA, Lam Research, or Tokyo Electron cost the same amount of money in Taiwan and the U.S.; they effectively neutralize location-based cost differences.

A major source of confusion about wafer prices comes from labor costs. Wages in the U.S. are roughly triple those in Taiwan, which many mistakenly take as a significant factor in chip production.

However, with the advanced automation of today's wafer fabrication facilities, labor accounts for less than 2% of the total cost, according to TechInsights's wafer cost model. Based on this model, the overall expense gap between operating costs of a fab in Arizona and Taiwan is minimal despite big differences in salaries and other local costs.

Wafers that TSMC currently produces at Fab 21 travel back to Taiwan to get diced, tested, and packaged. Some of them then go to China or elsewhere to be put into actual devices; some will travel back to the U.S., though.

TSMC is rumored to charge a 30% premium for chips made in the U.S.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

生成AIの登場でパソコンのあり方が変わってきた

2022年11月にOpenAIの「ChatGPT」が発表された以降、世界中が生成AIをいかに活用するかに注目が集まっている。生成AIを活用したクラウドサービスが次々と誕生し、ビジネスだけでなく、クリエイティブな作業やプライベートでの活用が進んでいる。 そうしたなか、AIを専用に処理するNPU（Neural Processing Unit）を内蔵したCPUが登場。AIを処理するには、CPUよりGPUのほうが得意で、これまではもっぱらGPUに頼ってきた。それが、GPUより効率よく処理するNPUの登場で、より身近にAI処理が可能となり、クラウド一辺倒だった生成AIの世界もローカルで処理するという流れになりつつある。 ローカルで処理することのメリットとしては、タイムラグの少ないリアルタイムな処理を可能にしたり、生成AIを利用するために必要な情報をクラウドへアップロードせずに済むため、データの情報漏洩や生成AIへ活用されるリスクを軽減できることだ。 NPUを内蔵したCPUは、インテルが一昨年前にインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ1）を発表。昨秋には最新CPUであるインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ2）を搭載したマシンが続々と登場している。 今回紹介する「Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition , imagined with Intel」もその1つで、大画面でありながら薄くて軽く、インテルの最新CPUであるインテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー 258Vを搭載。マイクロソフトが提唱する「Copilot+ PC」に準拠し、ローカルでのAI処理をいちはやく体験ができる。そんな本製品をレビューしていこう。

グラボなしでも高い画像処理能力でクリエイティブ作業も快適

まずは外観から見ていこう。15.3型という大画面液晶を採用しながら、最薄部は約13.9mmと非常に薄く、重さは1.53kgを実現している。このサイズとしては軽く、薄くて持ち運びやすいので、モバイルワークもこなせるモデルと言える。

現像作業はタッチパッドでもできるが、画面にタッチして操作するほうが遥かに楽 現像作業はタッチパッドでもできるが、画面にタッチして操作するほうが遥かに楽 さらに、画面のリフレッシュレートは120Hzなので、スクロールが滑らか。拡大した写真をスクロールしてもヌルヌル動くので、見やすいし目も疲れにくい。ちなみに、TÜV Low Blue LightおよびEyesafe認証も取得しているので、ハードウェア的にも目の疲れを軽減する仕様になっている。

高性能でありながら、AIにより長時間駆動が可能

CPUは冒頭でも述べたように、インテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー 258Vを搭載。4つのP-coreと4つのLPE-coreの合計8コア/8スレッドで最大動作周波数は4.8GHz、NPUは最大47Topsの処理が可能となっている。 CPUとしても高性能でありながら、NPUを使ったAIによるパフォーマンスの最適化により消費電力を抑えられ、最大22.4時間（公称値）のバッテリー駆動が可能。これだけもてばモバイルワークでも電源いらずで持ち運べる。 しかも32GBのLPDDR5x 対応メモリーを搭載するのでアプリ動作も余裕。ストレージも1TBのNVMe SSDなので、すぐに逼迫する心配はない。 実際に1日持ち歩いて使ってみたが、撮影した写真を現地で取り込んだり、Lightroom Classic CSで多少写真現像したり、Wi-Fiのあるところでネットを徘徊しつつ原稿を書くなどしてみたが、朝100%のバッテリー容量で外出し、晩に戻った際は40%弱のバッテリー残量だった。 作業する際にキーボードを触ってみたが、フルサイズでキーストロークが1.4mm確保されており、しっかりと打鍵感があり、それでいて静音だ。キー配列もクセがなく、筆者のような「かな入力」ユーザーでもすんなりタイピングできるだろう。キーボードバックライトの明るさは消灯を含め3段階調整できるので、バッテリーの状態に合わせて調整できるのも嬉しい。

キーボードはクセもなく、タイピングしやすい配列。キーボードの両端にはスピーカーを搭載している キーボードはクセもなく、タイピングしやすい配列。キーボードの両端にはスピーカーを搭載している タッチパッドは80mm×135mmと非常に大きく、指触りはとても滑らか。キーボードのホームポジションに指を置いたまま、親指でクイクイっと操作できるのもいい。画面タッチのほうが操作は楽なときもあるが、極力手の動きを少ない状態で作業を進めたいときは、タッチパッドで楽に作業を進められた。

キーボードに手を置いたままタッチパッド操作も余裕 キーボードに手を置いたままタッチパッド操作も余裕 また、インターフェースがUSB-CだけでなくUSB-Aも備えているのがありがたい。最近はUSB-Cだけに絞っている製品も少なくないが、USB-A端子のアクセサリーをまだまだ使用しているので、変換アダプターを介さずに使えるのがいい。HDMI端子も備えているので、会議室のディスプレイに投影する際も手間を掛けずに接続できる。

インターフェースは、右側にUSB 3.2 Gen 1×1、Thunderbolt™4×1。左側にHDMI×1、Thunderbolt™4×1、マイクロホン/ヘッドホン・コンボ・ジャックを備える インターフェースは、右側にUSB 3.2 Gen 1×1、Thunderbolt™4×1。左側にHDMI×1、Thunderbolt™4×1、マイクロホン/ヘッドホン・コンボ・ジャックを備える

Aura Editionならではのプレミアムな機能

本製品は、「Aura Edition imagined with Intel」と名付けられているとおり、インテルとの協力により、さまざまなアプリ機能が搭載されている。 その1つが「Smart Share」アプリ。あらかじめ「Intel Unison」によってスマホと連携（スマホ側にもIntel Unisonアプリのインストールが必要。iOS/Android版あり）しておくと、F11キーを押すだけで、スマホで撮った最近の写真や動画へ簡単にアクセスでき、ドラッグ&ドロップによって、スマホからパソコンへ簡単にコピーできる。 たとえば、スマホで撮影した写真をAdobe「Photoshop CS」でレタッチしたいといった場合、写真を転送する手間暇かけずに作業できる。意外とスマホからパソコンへの転送は面倒で、クラウド経由だったりUSB経由だったり、一手間二手間の作業工程が必要だった。それが、ボタン一つでSmart Shareアプリが起動し、必要な写真をドラッグ&ドロップで済むのは、まさに神である。

Waymo announced that Washington, DC will be its next robotaxi city.

The company aims to launch its Waymo One ridehailing service in the nation’s capitol in 2026 — though it acknowledged that it will first need to change the city law prohibiting fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers.


Currently, companies that want to test autonomous vehicles in DC are required to have a human driver behind the steering wheel in case something goes wrong. Tech advocates have been pressing the city council to loosen the restrictions to allow fully autonomous vehicles on public roads.

A spokesperson for the DC transportation department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The Alphabet-owned company’s manually driven vehicles have been spotted around DC since last year. A Waymo product manager told a local news outlet that the company was primarily focused on neighborhoods like Dupont Circle, Foggy Bottom, and Penn Quarter.

Waymo has not commented on the size of its service area nor which neighborhoods it is targeting if it launches next year.


Launching a robotaxi service in the heart of the federal government is a risky move. The feds have largely taken a back seat in regulating autonomous vehicles, leaving it to the states to develop their own rulebooks for safe deployment.

Legislation that would dramatically increase the number of AVs on the road has been stalled in Congress for over seven years, with lawmakers at odds over a range of issues, including safety, liability, and the right number of exemptions from federal motor vehicle safety standards.


DC is its own city with its own transportation challenges. It has some of the worst traffic congestion in the US thanks to an ever-expanding population and stagnate infrastructure.

Waymo currently operates its driverless ridehailing vehicles in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. It recently launched a partnership with Uber in Austin, and it plans to expand that deal to Atlanta later this year.

It also plans to operate robotaxis in Silicon Valley and Miami.


In DC, customers will use the company’s ridehail app, Waymo One, to summon driverless vehicles. Waymo currently provides 200,000 passenger trips a week using the app.


DC has seen some autonomous testing before. Cruise, General Motors’ now-defunct AV subsidiary, tested several of its vehicles there.

Another defunct company, Ford-backed Argo AI, has also previously tested autonomous vehicles in the district.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Partiful, an online platform, hosted a pre-Valentine's Day gathering called Love in the Stars, which was attended by singles who had been pre-approved to get in.

The event was hosted by local event promoter Spice King and the online dating-oriented members club Paloma. Attendees wore red to signal they were looking for love, while non-single supporters wore white or gold.


A couple of days before the event, a text blast announced that due to over 1,000 applications, the venue had been changed to Barbarossa Lounge in San Francisco's Financial District.

The organizers of The Feels, a nationwide in-person dating event series, shared their frustration with online dating. Allie Hoffman, the founder, stated that people are "collectively realizing that dating apps are the worst."

She described the issues with online dating as "depleting, bot-y, ghosty, breadcrumb-y, gaslight-y and fishy." She believes that people are seeking a more authentic experience.

Spice King, a local event organizer, echoed Hoffman's sentiments. He stated that swiping culture doesn't work for their generation anymore, and online dating makes them miss important things when searching for a partner.


The Feels hosted an exclusive event at Alchemy Springs in October 2024, and another one is planned for March at The Center, a yoga and sound bath space.

The Cybertruck generated significant buzz with its unique design and ambitious specifications, but sales have fallen short of expectations.

 
However, sales have fallen short of expectations due to higher-than-promised prices, lower driving range and payload capacity, and production issues.

 
The unconventional design hasn’t resonated with traditional truck buyers, and strong competition from Rivian and Ford has intensified the market.

 
When unveiled in 2019, Musk promised the production vehicle would launch within two years, starting with a $39,900 model. At the actual launch in 2023, the base model cost $21,000 more than that.

 
The Foundation Series model—an early-doors special—cost an additional $20,000 despite offering no physical differences other than a look-at-me logo.

 
Forbes spoke with experts who estimate that Tesla sank at least $2 billion into the development of the Cybertruck.

 
A traditional car might need 200,000 units per year to cover the research and development costs, Olav Sorenson, professor of strategy and sociology at UCLA and faculty director of its Price Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, has estimated.

 
Sorenson calculates that the Cybertruck, with its stainless steel body panels and unconventional construction, might require as many as 300,000 sales per year.

 
At current levels of Cybertruck sales Tesla “probably loses money on every one,” claims Sorenson.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

MagStor, one of the companies that develop LTO tape readers for client computers, has introduced the industry's first LTO tape drive with a Thunderbolt 5 interface.

The device is aimed at enterprises that need ultimate security, media professionals, and IT specialists who require vast cold storage capacities. The MagStor Thunderbolt 5 LTO drive comes with a Thunderbolt 5 interface and is compatible with PCs running Apple MacOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

MagStor does not disclose the exact specifications of the device for now, perhaps because it is still pending certification with Apple and Intel. While it is reasonable to expect it to be able to read LTO-9 tapes (18TB native capacity, 45TB compressed capacity), we do not know whether it will read next-generation LTO-10 tapes (up to 36TB native capacity, up to 90TB compressed capacity).

LTO tapes are widely used as cold storage by enterprises, media and entertainment industries, research institutions, and government agencies. However, LTO tapes are not exactly a popular storage technology for client computers due to high prices, lack of plug-and-play support, and specialized management software.

"At MagStor, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in data storage," said Tim Gerhard, VP of Product at MagStor. "After revolutionizing the market with the first-ever Thunderbolt 3 LTO drive, we’re excited to raise the bar again with Thunderbolt 5, ensuring our customers have access to the most powerful and flexible storage solutions available."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 24th, Recruit announced that it would discontinue development of the Skima part-time job service "TownWorkskima," which was scheduled to begin in fall 2024.

According to the announcement, as they are considering the overall strategy for the human resources-related business of the Recruit Group, they have decided to cancel the development of Town Workskima (tentative name) from the perspective of development priorities.

The Sukima Part-time Works service has become a hot topic due to its listing of Timey and the entry of Mercari. While it has the advantages of being able to work on a daily basis and making up for a sudden labor shortage, there have also been talk of cases of misuse of platforms such as "dark part-time jobs" and various companies are strengthening their response.

The company also commented, "As the labor shortage is becoming more serious and the employment environment is changing dramatically, the needs of job seekers and companies are diversifying. The entire group will continue to consider this in the future, aiming to create matching opportunities that meet the various needs of each individual."

Last night, March 24, a spiral in the night of half of Europe appeared for a few moments.

The Met Office, the National Meteorological Service of the United Kingdom, provided an explanation for the phenomenon. The experts told that it was probably caused by the frozen drain smoke of the Space X Falcon 9 rocket as soon as they launched.


The Falcon path
 

The Falcon 9 is a reusable rocket that releases its useful load immediately after launch and turns to return home while descending, releasing the remaining fuel.

At this point, the fuel freezes quickly because it is very high in the atmosphere and forms a spiral due to the rotary movement of the rocket.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.jp/article/the-antarctic-ozone-hole-is-healing/'>A future has emerged where ozone holes will completely "disappear" from the Antarctic</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 09:00:00 <p>
The stratosphere of the Earth has an ozone layer that plays a role like a sunscreen protecting the Earth from ultraviolet rays.

However, when ozone holes were observed in the 1980s, there was concern that ultraviolet rays reaching the surface could cause health damage such as skin cancer.

Research revealed that chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) reached the stratosphere and decomposed by ultraviolet rays under certain conditions, resulting in a product that depletes ozone.


In response to this issue, the Montreal Protocol was adopted in 1987 with the aim of regulating the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances worldwide.

This reduces the concentration of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere year by year, and certain results have been seen in suppressing the expansion of ozone holes.

A direct result of these global efforts is the fact that the ozone layer over Antarctica is gradually recovering, a recent study has revealed.


According to the report, statistical data proved that the signs of this recovery were not a coincidence product caused by natural fluctuations or an increase in greenhouse gases, but undoubtedly reduced ozone-depleting substances.

"We've seen many signs of antarctic ozone holes shrinking, but this is the first time we've ever seen that we've shown reliable quantitative data," explains Susan Solomon.


Observed data shows "Human Fingerprints"

Researchers from Solomon and others adopted a technique called "fingerprinting" to identify factors that cause the ozone layer over Antarctica to recover.

This is a method of identifying artificial causes by precisely analyzing multiple factors contained in observed data and separating the effects of each of them.


When we analyzed observation data of ozone holes obtained from satellites from 2005 to the present, this unique fingerprint gradually became clearer over time, and was most prominent in 2018.

The analysis results are based on observation data over 15 years, and the research team concluded that reducing ozone-depleting substances is effective with a 95% reliability.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/scientists-observe-for-the-first-time-carbon-dioxide-on-other-planets-outside-the-solar-system/'>Scientists Observe Carbon Dioxide on Planets Outside the Solar System for the First Time</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 08:00:00 <p>
Carbon dioxide has been detected on a planet outside our solar system for the first time.

The gas has been observed directly by the James Webb Space Telescope on four exoplanets, all belonging to the HR 8799 system, located 130 light-years from Earth.

The detection of CO2 offers clues as to how distant planets form, with the observations providing strong evidence that these four giant planets formed in much the same way as Jupiter and Saturn, through the slow formation of solid cores.

By detecting these strong formations of carbon dioxide, we have shown that there is a considerable fraction of heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, in the atmospheres of these planets.

Given what we know about the star they orbit, this probably indicates that they formed by core accretion, which, for planets we can see directly, is an exciting conclusion.

HR 8799 is a system that was born 30 million years ago, and so is young compared to our solar system, which has existed for 4.6 billion years.

Still hot from their violent formation, the planets of HR 8799 emit large amounts of infrared light.

This provides scientists with valuable data on how their formation compares to that of a star or brown dwarf, the term given to large gaseous planets that fail to develop into stars.

Our hope with this type of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence.

We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they are similar to or different from ours.

From there, we can try to understand how strange our solar system really is, or how normal it is.

Carbon dioxide has been an essential ingredient for development of life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere in outer space.

Plus, because CO2 condenses into tiny ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.

Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through a process in which a bunch of tiny icy particles coalesced to form a solid core, which then absorbed gas to grow into the gas giants we know today.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

NTTPCコミュニケーションズ（NTTPC）とみずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズは、埼玉県幸手市教育委員会と連携し、教員の働きがい向上に向けてバイタルデータを活用した実証実験を行っている。両社の担当者に、データの収集・分析や働き方改善の施策について話を聞いた。



左から、みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ デジタルコンサルティング部の山下智也氏、同部 コンサルタントの髙橋幸大氏、同部 マネージャーの伊澤俊氏、NTTPCコミュニケーションズ サービスクリエーション本部 第二サービスクリエーション部 サービスクリエーション担当の近藤直人氏、同部 担当課長の中田一郎氏 左から、みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ デジタルコンサルティング部の山下智也氏、同部 コンサルタントの髙橋幸大氏、同部 マネージャーの伊澤俊氏、NTTPCコミュニケーションズ サービスクリエーション本部 第二サービスクリエーション部 サービスクリエーション担当の近藤直人氏、同部 担当課長の中田一郎氏

同実証では、幸手市内の小学校6校の教員100～150人程度を対象に、貸与したウェアラブルデバイスからバイタルデータを収集し、働きがいとの関連性を分析する。実証期間は2024年12月～2025年3月末を予定しており、バイタルデータによる働きがい（エンゲージメント）測定の有効性の検証とデータ分析に基づく支援策を検討するとしている。



実証で利用するウェアラブルデバイス（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ） 実証で利用するウェアラブルデバイス（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ）

NTTPCはもともと企業向けに「健康経営支援サービス」を提供しており、従業員自身のセルフケアと企業の働く環境の改善をサポートしてきた。同サービスは、リストバンド型／リング型デバイスから従業員の業務中のバイタルを計測し、スマートフォンで自身の自律神経バランスや疲れの蓄積状況などの分析結果を見ることができる。

今回の実証実験では、教員を対象に同サービスを活用する。みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ デジタルコンサルティング部 マネージャーの伊澤俊氏は、教育領域のDX推進で中心になるのは児童・生徒だとしつつ、「子どもたちを支える教員がキーワードとして挙がりながらも、なかなかタッチしきれていないと感じている」と話す。

教員の働きがいの低下や離職が課題として挙がる中、労働時間の削減や校務DXなどが進んでいる。一方で教員は、高い専門性が求められる職種であり、持続可能な学校経営を構築するには、単に労働時間を短くするだけでなく、教員の“働きがい”に着目したアプローチが必要になるという。みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズでは自治体・教育現場における教育データ利活用推進を中心とした、教育DXに関わる調査・コンサルティングに複数年携わっていることから、そこでの知見を活用することを構想していた。同氏は、教員にとって真の働き方改革を推進するに当たり、「教員の働き方の指標やデータが少ないのではないかと感じ、2024年の夏ごろにNTTPCに協業の相談を持ちかけた」と実証の背景を語る。

また、NTTPC側も同社が提供するサービスはバイタルデータから現場の状態を可視化することに特化しており、セルフケアを促す通知機能がありつつも、組織に対する施策の提案までできていなかったという。同社 サービスクリエーション本部 第二サービスクリエーション部 サービスクリエーション担当の近藤直人氏は、「みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズの強みであるコンサルティングと掛け合わせて、現場を可視化するだけでなく、そこに対して具体的な施策や効果を実感してもらえるところを幸手市にもご評価いただき、今回の実証実験につながった」と説明する。

実証の企画・管理および教育現場へのコンサルティングはみずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズが行い、ウェアラブルデバイスやシステムの提供、機材トラブルのサポートなどはNTTPCが行う。

ウェアラブルデバイスで収集する脈拍などのバイタルデータを基に分析したものは、「個人標準偏差（いつもの状態）」を基準に、「ワークエンゲージメント（集中状態）」「ストレスフル（疲労・不安）」「バーンアウト（燃え尽き）」「リラックス（安定・寛容）」に分類する。利用者本人はアプリを通じて、自身の状態や変化を確認できる。



バイタルデータの分析イメージ（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ） バイタルデータの分析イメージ（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ）

一方、収集したデータは個人が特定されない学校ごとのデータとして、学校の管理者およびNTTPCやみずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズ側からも見ることができる。伊澤氏は「このサービスは、（教員を）管理するためのものではない」と強調し、「学校ごとのデータでは個人が特定されないため、不明瞭な部分も残ってしまうが、あえて余地を残したデータでどこまでできるかを挑戦している。そのため、管理する目的ではないということをユーザーには伝えたい」と話す。

また、同氏は「働き方はチームで考えていかなければ改革にはつながらない」と指摘。管理者や両社から見られる学校全体のデータは、「パフォーマンススコア」として学校全体のモチベーションやメンタル不調などが可視化される。パフォーマンススコアは、一般的に業務や物事に集中できる状態がパフォーマンスが高いとされ、パフォーマンス状態を100点満点でスコア化できる。

このデータを基に、みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズが課題を抱えている学校に対して改善施策を提案し、実施する。パフォーマンススコアは「良い」「中程度」「悪い」で分けられ、この推移が激しい学校が課題を抱えていると想定し、改善策の実施を考えている。

既にある程度のデータが収集・分析されており、各学校の違いが明らかになりつつあるという。残業時間だけを見ると問題がないような学校でも、バイタルデータを見ると改善の余地があることが分かった。従来の指標だけではアプローチができなかった学校に対して今回の実証をきっかけにアプローチできるのではないかとしている。

バイタルデータとは別に教員に対してアンケートを実施しており、調査結果とパフォーマンススコアがある程度対応していることも見えてきている。具体的な改善施策の提案としては、バイタルデータとアンケート調査の結果を照らし合わせるとともに、幸手市教育委員会の意見を取り入れながら進める。特にアンケート結果から、「同僚などとチームとして取り組んでいける機運を醸成したい」という声が多く寄せられたことから、一つの施策として学校管理職に対する外部有識者の講演を予定している。チームとしての学校経営の在り方や同僚間でのサポートがしやすい環境づくりなど、管理職が抱えている課題を基に他自治体の事例や有識者の知見を提供するという。



実証の概要（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ） 実証の概要（提供：NTTPCコミュニケーションズ）

この実証を行うに当たり、「学校現場の負担にならないようにいかに手軽にやっていくかを大事にしていた」と伊澤氏は言う。そのため、バイタルデータという手軽にとれる範囲のデータを活用し、これまで教育委員会や管理職の目が届きづらい教員一人一人の兆しを見ることができるようにした。「もちろん、バイタルデータの有用性はあるものの、それだけでは分からないこともあるのだという感覚は持っていなければならない」と語る。

幸手市教育委員会からは、勤怠データだけでは分からない部分に対してバイタルデータがどこまで有用なのか、またデータを踏まえた支援策の有効性について期待されているという。

今後の展開について、近藤氏は「健康経営支援サービスは可視化が強みで、打ち手の部分は打ち手の部分はパートナー商材を組み合わせることで完成するビジネスモデルとなっている。みずほリサーチ＆テクノロジーズによるコンサルティングならではの人のぬくもりがあってこそ、コミュニケーションの改善や現場での実践ができると思う。可視化だけでなく結果まで出して、横展開できたらと思っている」と明かす。

伊澤氏は、「このプロジェクトはいろいろな展開の仕方があると思っている。例えば、幸手市教育委員会に限らず、ご関心ある自治体と継続して協力しながら、バイタルデータの有用性を検証するとともに、バイタルデータを通じ得られた気づきも一助に教育現場へのより良い打ち手を検討することが重要と考える。また、教員に関するケアをより重要にしていくフェーズに入った時に、インプットとなる情報や教員に関するデータが不足しているという課題がある。この課題を解消することで、働き方だけでなく、個別最適・協働的な学びの実現において、教員のよりよい指導にもつながると考えている」と述べた。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230890/'>The possibility of "burning out satellites in the Earth's atmosphere" destroying the global environment -- Starlink has increased dramatically</a></h2><b>Source:</b> zdnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 06:08:00 <p>
A study funded by NASA has found that communications satellites like Starlink could reduce the Earth's ozone layer as they reach their lifespan and re-enter the atmosphere.

When satellites such as Starlink reach their lifespan, they enter the atmosphere and burn out, leaving small particles of aluminum oxide at that time.

This drops to the ozone layer, which absorbs ultraviolet rays. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that these oxides increased eight times between 2016 and 2022.

Not all of this increase comes from Starlink. This is because Starlink launched its first satellite in May 2019.

However, the Starlink satellite is currently the overwhelming majority in low orbit. There are approximately 8,100 artefacts in low orbit, of which more than 6,000 are Starlinks.

There are plans to launch an additional 12,000 units, with the possibility of up to 42,000 in the future, Space.com reports.

These satellites reach their lifespan in about five years. For example, a satellite weighing approximately 250 kg will release approximately 30 kg of aluminum oxide fine particles upon re-entry in the atmosphere.

Starlink's satellites are gradually getting heavier, with the latest model reaching approximately 1,250 kg. Aluminum is mainly released at about 50 to 80 km above, but it takes 30 years for it to descend to the ozone layer.

As of 2022, data shows that the amount of aluminum in the atmosphere has increased by 29.5% from natural values ​​due to burned-out satellites.

Researchers warn that things will get worse if things continue like this. "I'm particularly worried about the large number of satellites coming up in the future," Joseph Wang, one of the research authors, told CNET.

"We expect this will be an excess of 640% or more than natural value per year. That would be pretty bad."

Unlike other ozone depleting substances, aluminum oxides are not consumed during the reaction and remain in the atmosphere for a long time.

It could take 30 years for the ozone layer to be continuously damaged and eventually drop to altitude.

If Starlink scales as planned, more than 8,000 satellites will enter the atmosphere and burn out every year.

The amount of aluminum released could be 360 ​​tons, or 640% of the natural value. 

The environmental impact of satellite re-entry is currently unknown, the study states.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to a new study funded by NASA, communications satellites like Starlink could reduce the Earth's ozone layer as they reach their lifespan and re-enter the atmosphere.

This happens when satellites such as Starlink enter the atmosphere and burn out, leaving small particles of aluminum oxide behind.

These oxides increased eight times between 2016 and 2022, according to researchers at the University of Southern California.

There are approximately 8,100 artefacts in low orbit, with more than 6,000 being Starlinks.

Plans are underway to launch an additional 12,000 units, with a possibility of up to 42,000 in the future.

Satellites reach their lifespan in about five years and release aluminum oxide fine particles upon re-entry.

A satellite weighing approximately 250 kg will release approximately 30 kg of aluminum oxide upon re-entry.

However, Starlink's satellites are gradually getting heavier, with the latest model reaching approximately 1,250 kg.

Aluminum is mainly released at about 50 to 80 km above, but it takes 30 years for it to descend to the ozone layer.

As of 2022, data shows that the amount of aluminum in the atmosphere has increased by 29.5% from natural values due to burned-out satellites.

Researchers warn that things will get worse if this trend continues.

Joseph Wang, one of the research authors, said he's particularly worried about the large number of satellites coming up in the future.

Unlike other ozone-depleting substances, aluminum oxides are not consumed during the reaction and remain in the atmosphere for a long time.

It could take 30 years for the ozone layer to be continuously damaged and eventually drop to altitude.

If Starlink scales as planned, more than 8,000 satellites will enter the atmosphere and burn out every year.

The amount of aluminum released could be 360 tons, or 640% of the natural value, according to a predictive model.

The study states that the environmental impact of satellite re-entry is currently unknown.

Four years after its launch, Starlink accounts for 40% of all satellites launched so far in human history.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230881/'>Anticipated changes in cybersecurity trends over 2030-NRI Secure explains</a></h2><b>Source:</b> zdnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 06:00:00 <p>
The cybersecurity situation continues to change, but six major changes are expected to occur over 2030.

With this security roadmap, the company shows six changes: (1) the growing need for greater transparency regarding security measures, (2) the integration of cybersecurity and security, (3) the expansion of data security, (4) the guardrails of security accelerating innovation, (5) the expansion of security into space and the ocean fields, and (6) the expansion of socio-technical approaches to security.

First, the rise in awareness of security risks in the supply chain is said to be the first change. This could lead to companies and organizations being responsible for selecting products with a security level that suits their environment, such as through procurement, or for selecting organizations with a certain level of security even when outsourced.

Security ratings are the key to determining the level of security. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) will begin operating a security conformance assessment system for IoT products in March.

The second change is expected to strengthen cybersecurity information sharing between the public and private sectors. This includes the establishment of a "security clearance system" and the introduction of active cyber defense.

Active cyber defense requires monitoring and construction of countermeasures for cyber attack organizations using threat intelligence and other factors. Security clearance should consider a balance between the cost of obtaining certification and the benefits of obtaining it.

This will require companies and organizations to respond, especially considering that integrating national security and cybersecurity is a common practice overseas.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Innoitaly, a startup born in 2023, has developed a modular electronic architecture that produces energy, develops information with artificial intelligence, and saves energy.

The company's technology captures energy from the earth using MFC microbial fuel cells, which are also being researched by universities in Trento and Naples. Carlo Sam, one of the founders, explains that microbes digesting nutrients generate electricity that is exploited through an electronic device.

With a cubic decimeter of earth, they can feed a sensor capable of measuring various parameters of the soil and air, transmitting data every minute. This technology allows for energy generation with minimal maintenance and applications in sectors such as agriculture.

The sensors have an artificial intelligence on board that processes information instead of sending raw data packages, reducing traffic and storage costs. In agriculture, this can help monitor insects on cultures, which normally requires significant online cloud and traffic.

In addition to agriculture, the technology can be used for environmental monitoring in Italy, preventing avalanches, forest fires, or hydrogeological instability with minimal maintenance. The sensors are self-installing and can read a code via geolocalization.

The startup's objective is to provide 20-year-lasting sensors with minimal maintenance.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.jp/article/the-art-of-the-perfect-nap-sleep-science/'>What are the effective tips for taking a nap? Sleep experts explain</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 02:00:00 <p>
The author describes their experience of feeling refreshed after taking a 30-minute nap, but also notes the difficulty of falling asleep at night.

 

Most people naturally lose their arousal levels in the early afternoon, usually between 1pm and 4pm, due to their internal clock, or circadian rhythm. This is not just a heavy lunch, but a natural cycle of awakening and fatigue throughout the day.

 

Studies have shown that short naps during this time period (ideally after being exposed to bright light) can help combat fatigue and increase alertness and improve cognitive function without interfering with nighttime sleep. These "power naps" allow the brain to rest without getting into deep sleep, making it easier to wake up with a refreshed mood.

 

However, there is actually a pitfall here. A nap that is too long can cause you to wake up feeling worse than before. This is caused by "sleep inertia," the vague sensations and disorientation (decreased cognitive ability) that occur when you wake up from a deeper stage of sleep.

 

Once your nap is over 30 minutes, your brain transitions to slow wave sleep, making it much more difficult to wake up. Research shows that when awakening from deep sleep, a person can remain dull for up to an hour. These conditions can have serious consequences when safety is important, critical decisions, or machine operation.

 

If naps are essential For some, naps are essential. For example, shift workers who work on irregular schedules often suffer from only getting fragmentary sleep. Therefore, taking a nap at a moderate timing before a night shift will increase your level of alertness and reduce the risk of mistakes and accidents.

 

However, relying on naps instead of improving nighttime sleep is a temporary solution rather than a sustainable solution. Daytime sleep weakens the desire to sleep at night, so in cases of chronic insomnia, it is often recommended not to take a nap.

 

Some people use strategic naps to improve their performance. Athletes incorporate naps into their training schedules. This is to speed up muscle recovery and improve sports-related indicators such as reaction time and endurance.

 

NASA researchers report that a 26-minute nap improves long-distance flight staff performance by 34% and alertness by 54%.

 

Timing and environment are important for an effective nap. Keeping your nap time between 10 and 20 minutes prevents you from feeling dazed. The ideal timing is before 2pm. A nap too late can delay your body's natural sleep schedule.

 

A nap that lasts more than 30 minutes can cause problems, such as "sleep inertia," which can last for up to an hour after waking. This can be a problem in situations where safety or performance are important.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

table of contents 量子論のパラドックス解決に挑む 「重ね合わせ」「もつれ」の捉え直し 量子重力理論へ続く重要な踏み石 まだ誰も突き止めていない

駅のホームに立って、トロッコが通過していくのを見ているとしよう。トロッコに乗った女の子が、真っ赤なボールを落とす。女の子から見ると、ボールはまっすぐ下に落ちる。だが、ホームに立つあなたからは、ボールは弧を描いてからトロッコの床に落ちるように見える。このとき、女の子はトロッコに固定され、あなたは駅のホームに固定されて、同じ事象を異なる基準系で観測しているのだ。

基準系という概念は、古典物理学の世界で長い歴史をもつ。アイザック・ニュートンからガリレオ、アルバート・アインシュタインまで、みなそれを土台にして運動の研究を進めた。基準系とは、それ自体が動く可能性のある座標系（「原点」となるゼロ点を基準にして、位置と時間を特定する方法）と考えればよい。アインシュタインは、基準系を利用して相対性理論を展開し、時間と空間は宇宙に対して固定されているのではなく、伸びたり縮んだり歪んだりする可塑性をもつ存在であることを明らかにした。

だが、量子物理学はこれまで、基準系をほぼ視野に入れてこなかった。量子物理学の実験の解説には、架空の観測者、アリスとボブがたびたび登場するが、このふたりは物理的に異なる場所にいるのが普通で、それでも共通の基準系に固定されていると想定される。

それがいま、変わりつつある。アリスがいる基準系（上の例で言うとトロッコやホームに当たる）が同時に複数の位置である可能性があることに、あるいはボブが時間の測定に使っている時計は量子論的な不確定性の影響を受ける可能性があることに、量子物理学者は気づき始めたのだ。

量子論のパラドックス解決に挑む

「量子の世界では、量子論の形式で基準系を記述する必要があります」。そう語るのは、スイス連邦工科大学チューリッヒ校の理論物理学者、レナート・レンナーだ。

2024年の論文で、チャスラヴ・ブルクナーなど、ウィーン大学および量子光学・量子情報研究所（Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information、IQOQI）の物理学者が、長年にわたって研究されてきた量子現象、つまり重ね合わせや量子もつれなどに関して、量子基準系が新しい展望を開くということを示した。その知見を受けてレンナーは、量子論の思考実験で発生する奇妙なパラドックスの一部についても、量子基準系が解決の糸口になるのではないかと考えている。

ブルクナーらは、量子基準系のロジックを通して考えれば、量子重力理論をめぐる新たな洞察につながる可能性があると期待する。量子重力理論とは、重力をほかの基本的な相互作用と同じ理論の枠に収めようとする研究である。

量子基準系というこの新しい試みについて、レンナーは「何かとてつもなく大きなことの端緒についたばかりです」と話している。

「重ね合わせ」「もつれ」の捉え直し

量子基準系という概念が初めて提唱されたのは1984年だが、2019年ごろに複数のグループがその概念を再評価したことが、近年の研究の隆盛につながった。この量子基準系をめぐる活発な議論は、わたしたちにふたつの典型的な量子の特性の捉え方の見直しを迫っている。その特性とは、ひとつは重ね合わせ、すなわち物体が同時に複数の状態を取る可能性があること、もうひとつは量子もつれ、すなわち別個の粒子が単一の量子状態を共有し、その一方を観測すると他方の状態が瞬時に決まることである。

（左から）ウィーン大学および量子光学・量子情報研究所のルカ・アパドゥラ、アン=カトリーヌ・デ・ラ・ハメット、ヴィクトリア・カベル。どの量子系がもつれ状態や重ね合わせ状態になるように見えるかは、基準系の選択によって影響を受けるということを共同研究で示した。 Photograph: Andrea Di Biagio

この議論を理解するために、ふたつの基準系を想定し、それぞれをA、Bとする。仮に、Aの基準となる原点が複数の位置に存在する可能性がある量子物体に固定されているとしよう。Bの視点から見ると、Aの位置は一定の領域にぼんやり拡がって見える。しかし、Aの視点から見ると、Bまでの距離のほうがぼやけて拡がっている。あたかも、Bが重ね合わせ状態にあるように見えるということだ。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Shortly after senior Trump administration officials discussed and celebrated the bombing of Yemen in an encrypted group chat, a subset of the group feasted at an opulent dinner featuring the president.

The date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate attending a "candlelight" dinner that wasn't on his public calendar.

On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles.

Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targeting Houthi leadership. At least 53 people, including children, were killed.

Trump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Musk's 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED.

Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the president's brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared.

The Atlantic reported on the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing.

Details emerged because a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled "Houthi PC small group."

The day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike.

According to The Atlantic's reporting, Miller—who WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as “PM,” short for prime minister—effectively shut down concerns about the bombing.

On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. "Amazing job," wrote Waltz.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Google unveiled Gemini 2.5, a new family of AI reasoning models that pauses to "think" before answering a question.

To kick off the new family of models, Google is launching Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, a multimodal, reasoning AI model that claims to be its most intelligent model yet.


Since OpenAI launched the first AI reasoning model in September 2024, o1, the tech industry has raced to match or exceed that model's capabilities with their own. Today, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, and xAI all have AI reasoning models.

Google has experimented with AI reasoning models before, previously releasing a "thinking" version of Gemini in December. But Gemini 2.5 represents the company's most serious attempt yet at besting OpenAI's "o" series of models.


On an evaluation measuring code editing, called Aider Polyglot, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 68.6%, outperforming top AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek.

However, on another test measuring software dev abilities, SWE-bench Verified, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 63.8%, outperforming OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1.

Google has announced Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) for Advanced subscribers and developers, building on its previous mid-year/model update.

All models in the Gemini 2.5 family are "thinking models" capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy.


Compared to 2.0 Flash Thinking, Google is no longer explicitly attaching the “Thinking” label. Users can “Show thinking” in the Gemini app to see the train of thought.

Gemini 2.5 features a “new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training.”

Gemini 2.5 Pro (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 and codenamed “nebula”) is the first model in this family, aimed at complex tasks.

It tops the LMArena leaderboard — which measures human preferences — by a significant margin, and leads on math (AIME 2025), and science (GPQA diamond) benchmarks without test-time techniques that increase cost.

Gemini 2.5 Pro excels at creating visually compelling web apps and agentic code applications, along with code transformation and editing.

In addition to native multimodality, Gemini 2.5 Pro has a 1 million token context window with 2 million coming soon.

Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) is rolling out first to Gemini Advanced and Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI following in the coming weeks.

In an emotional advertisement running on Facebook and Instagram over the past month, a young woman, Katie, talks about being diagnosed with an illness that resulted in kidney failure at age 19. But she was able to find a transplant match “because a stranger was scrolling on TikTok.”

Thanks to that stranger’s kidney, she continued, she was here today. “For some people, having TikTok has literally been life saving,” the company wrote in a caption punctuated by a tearful smiling emoji.

The messages are part of a new ad blitz from TikTok, the popular social media app owned by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance. The campaign frames TikTok as a savior of Americans and a champion of small businesses as the app hurtles toward an April 5 deadline to sell the company to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the United States. President Trump, who paused a federal law demanding TikTok’s sale because of national security concerns related to its ties to China, has said he will give the app more time for a deal if needed.

But TikTok does not appear to be taking any chances.

In the past couple of months, the company has wallpapered Washington in marketing; bought wraparound ads in the print editions of The New York Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times; and poured money into national commercials.

The first in-person gathering devoted to those building with the AT Protocol, also known as ATProto, was held in Seattle over the weekend.

At the event, developers, engineers, founders, and members of the Bluesky team were in attendance.

Many in the community met each other for the first time after having only communicated online previously.

The conference focused on the protocol itself and its many possibilities, including building other types of social apps, communities, and authentication services via OAuth.

The goal is to put users back in control over their data, algorithms, and overall online experience.

Over 150 people attended the event in person, with others joining virtually.

Attendees are working to rebuild the web by putting power back in the hands of those who use it.

This means taking power away from tech oligarchs, also referred to as "Caesars."

Self-described anarchists, mutual aid devotees, and open source advocates were among the attendees.

Blaine Cook, co-author of OAuth and former lead developer at Twitter, spoke about his time at the social network that's now called X.

Cook compared today's decentralized social web to a jungle, chaotic from an outside perspective but beneficial for those within it.

He acknowledged the missteps of the past but held hope for the future.

Bluesky CEO Jay Graber also spoke, discussing the promise of the early web and how it has since turned into a tool for surveillance and control.

Graber emphasized that users have given power to large platforms, which can be taken back.

Attendees were reminded that new technologies alone aren't enough; a whole ecosystem of support and funding is necessary.

BlackSky's project aims to create a safer social media experience for Black users.

Technologist Ændra Rininsland spoke about the struggles faced by trans communities on open platforms.

Experts like Erin Kissane, who wrote extensively about Facebook's role in the Myanmar genocide, joined remotely to share their knowledge.

Kissane advised builders to prioritize the safety and perspectives of vulnerable groups when creating online communities.

Attendees left with connections formed over the weekend and plans to continue working together.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Manny Medina, former CEO of Outreach, has launched a new startup called Paid.

Medina announced Monday that Paid raised €10 million (about $11 million) in a pre-seed investment from EQT Ventures, Sequoia, and GTMFund.


The idea for Paid came after talking to dozens of agentic platform startups. A common complaint emerged: "They didn’t really know what to charge," Medina told TechCrunch.

The premise of Paid is that old ways of charging won't work with AI agents.

Agentic companies can't charge per user or per seat, as one employee could run lots of agents, or agents will run by themselves.


Companies developing AI agents also can't charge like SaaS, because if agents work properly, they take over a whole role.

An agent's customer wants to pay for its results, not discrete tasks an agent does. A company doesn't want to pay for each email the agent sent.


The costs associated with providing agents are variable, depending on how many LLM tokens it needs to execute its training and tasks.

Paid allows agentic startups to create pricing with an eye to profitable margins.


It also tracks agents' output, which lets startups validate return on investment. The Paid platform is being marketed to startups, rather than enterprises like Salesforce and Microsoft.


Medina has three companies as beta customers: Logic.app, 11x, VidLab7, Artisan, and HappyRobot.

Paid engineers built the initial product demos using tools like v0, Replit, and Lovable.

The company is now based in London.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Waymo said Tuesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides via the Waymo One app in Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Before it can launch commercially, the company will have to up its lobbying game in the capital, where autonomous vehicle permits still require a human behind the wheel.

The news from Waymo comes as the Alphabet-owned company aggressively expands its robotaxi coverage to cement its lead ahead of potential competitors like Amazon’s Zoox and Elon Musk’s Tesla. Musk said Tesla will launch a robotaxi service in Austin this summer and California at some point this year.

Waymo already operates a commercial service in Phoenix, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and more recently Austin, in partnership with ride-hail firm Uber. Waymo also intends to launch a robotaxi service via Uber in Atlanta this year and has already begun ferrying employees in fully autonomous vehicles in the city. Miami is next on Waymo’s public launch list for 2026, alongside Washington, D.C.

To raise even more enthusiasm and awareness, Waymo has said it plans to begin mapping in 10 cities this year, including Las Vegas, San Diego, and, as of Monday, Nashville.

Waymo’s Washington, D.C., announcement comes two months after the company launched a small test fleet of its Jaguar I-Pace robotaxis in the city, where it’s been driving manually and testing autonomously with a safety driver behind the wheel.

Waymo’s business model is contingent upon removing the human driver from the vehicle. The company said it will work with policymakers to update the district’s permitting rules to allow for fully autonomous vehicles to drive on public roads.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Last summer, mining startup KoBold made a splash when it said it had discovered one of the world’s largest copper deposits in more than a decade in Zambia.

 

Another startup, Earth AI, has exclusively told TechCrunch about its own discovery: promising deposits of critical minerals in parts of Australia that other mining outfits had ignored for decades.

The actual, real frontier [in mining] is not so much geographical as it is technological,” Roman Teslyuk, founder and CEO of Earth AI, told TechCrunch. 

Earth AI has identified deposits of copper, cobalt, and gold in the Northern Territory and silver, molybdenum, and tin at another site in New South Wales, 310 miles (500 kilometers) northwest of Sydney.

Teslyuk started Earth AI as a software company focused on making predictions about potential deposits, then approaching customers who might be interested in exploring sites further.

Mining is a very conservative industry,” Teslyuk said. “Everything outside of the approved dogma is considered heresy.”

Earth AI decided to develop its own drilling equipment to prove that the sites it identified were as promising as its software suggested.

The company was accepted to Y Combinator’s spring 2019 cohort, and it spent the next few years refining its hardware and software. 

In January, Earth AI raised a $20 million Series B.

Though the company uses AI to search for minerals like KoBold, Teslyuk says it takes a different tack.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Instagram has announced a new school partnership program to expedite moderation reports from verified school accounts.

The program is currently available to all middle and high schools in the U.S. and allows schools to report posts or student accounts that may violate Instagram's guidelines directly to the app.


These reports are then automatically prioritized for review, and schools are alerted to actions taken. The goal of the program is to help educators report potential teen safety issues, including bullying.

Participating schools will feature a "school partner" banner on their profiles, indicating their involvement in the program. Instagram will also offer educational resources with tips for safely using the app to educators, parents, guardians, and students.


The program has been tested with 60 schools over the past year, and was developed in collaboration with the International Society for Technology in Education and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ISTE+ASCD).


Other U.S. middle and high schools can sign up to join the program's waitlist. Instagram has also launched teen accounts for users under 16, which are set to private by default and have restrictions on messaging.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

During a livestream on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the first major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities in over a year.

ChatGPT can now leverage the company’s GPT-4o model to natively create and modify images and photos. GPT-4o has long underpinned the AI-powered chatbot platform, but until now, the model has been able to generate and edit only text — not images.

Altman said GPT-4o native image generation is live today in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation product, for subscribers to the company’s $200-a-month Pro plan. 

OpenAI says the feature is rolling out soon to Plus and free users of ChatGPT, as well as developers using the company’s API service.

GPT-4o with image output “thinks” a bit longer than the image-generation model it effectively replaces, DALL-E 3, to make what OpenAI describes as more accurate and detailed images. 

GPT-4o can edit existing images, including images with people in them — transforming them or “inpainting” details like foreground and background objects.

To power the new image feature, OpenAI told the Wall Street Journal it trained GPT-4o on “publicly available data,” as well as proprietary data from its partnerships with companies like Shutterstock.

OpenAI offers an opt-out form that allows creators to request that their works be removed from its training datasets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

DNA testing service 23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection on March 16, sparking concerns about what could happen to the genetic data of its 15 million customers.

The company has said that “data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.”

If you’re one of the 15 million people who shared their DNA with 23andMe, we’ve outlined the steps you can take to protect yourself. While you can’t delete all your 23andMe data, there are some things you can control.

The data-removal process may take some time, as users have reported that 23andMe’s website is functioning slower than usual, likely due to people flocking to the site to delete their data.

How to delete your 23andMe data

To delete your data from 23andMe, you need to log in to your account and then follow these steps: Navigate to the Settings section of your profile. Scroll down to the selection labeled 23andMe Data . Click the View option and scroll to the Delete Data section. Select the Permanently Delete Data button.

You will then receive an email from 23andMe with a link that will allow you to confirm your deletion request. You can choose to download a copy of your data before deleting it.

There is an important caveat, as 23andMe’s privacy policy states that the company and its labs “will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations.”

How to destroy your 23andMe test sample and revoke permission for your data to be used for research

If you previously opted to have your saliva sample and DNA stored by 23andMe, you can change this setting. To revoke your permission, go into your 23andMe account settings page and then navigate to Preferences. In addition, if you previously agreed to 23andMe and third-party researchers using your genetic data and sample for research, you can withdraw consent from the Research and Product Consents section in your account settings.

Check in with your family members

Once you have requested the deletion of your data, it’s important to check in with your family members and encourage them to do the same because it’s not just their DNA that’s at risk of sale — it also affects people they are related to.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

AI chipmaking company Cerebras Systems’ IPO is delayed again as the public listing’s national security review drags on.

Cerebras, which originally filed its intent to IPO in September 2024, thought the incoming Trump administration would help it breeze through its national security review, according to Reuters. That hasn’t been the case.

The White House has yet to fill multiple vacancies, including the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security — the position that oversees the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States — which means the department that oversees these types of reviews is incomplete, Reuters reports.

The chipmaker’s IPO originally triggered a national security review due to a $335 million investment the company received from Abu Dhabi-based G42, an AI holding company, with previous ties to Chinese tech giant Huawei.

In May 2023, Ford triggered a transformation when the U.S. automaker locked in a deal to give owners of its EVs access to the Tesla Supercharger network.

Automakers from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes followed suit, with nearly every major automaker agreeing to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) by the end of 2023.

Many non-Tesla customers are still waiting for adapters that will give them access to the Tesla Supercharging Network. However, recent announcements from automakers may provide an electric lining of optimism.

The shift to the Tesla EV charging standard began in November 2022 when several automakers announced their plans to adopt NACS.

Tesla's network currently has over 15,000 Superchargers across North America, with many more locations planned or under construction.

In May 2023, Ford became the first major automaker to announce its plan to join Tesla's Supercharger network.

The new Overlay makes streaming games on Discord more user-friendly on the streamer's end.

In its legacy form, streamers could toggle the Overlay display to use Discord while playing games, but this would bring up the entire Discord client in the center of the screen, blocking the stream and making for a clunky user experience.


Users can add specific Discord widgets that will appear around the screen for easy access, making it possible to see messages and adjust sound and video settings without pulling up the entire Discord client.

These widgets can be customized for opacity, sizing, and placement on the screen.

The picture-in-picture widget lets you watch another friend's streaming feed from your own Overlay.

Sam Weaver, former vice president of product management at Unqork, realized the company needed a better way to manage its Kubernetes clusters.

When Unqork couldn’t find anything off the shelf, it assembled a 15-person team to build a Kubernetes management product.

The resulting platform was just okay, taking about two years to develop and costing millions of dollars.

Weaver sat on the idea until he met Michael Guarino, an engineer with experience at Amazon and Twitter.

When Weaver explained the problem to Guarino, he thought it was straightforward to solve and built a better system by himself in a few weeks.

That platform became the basis for Plural, which consolidates enterprise Kubernetes clusters onto one dashboard.

Plural’s AI can offer suggestions about optimizing cluster efficiency or diagnosing scaling issues.

The company is cloud and LLM agnostic.

Weaver said that the hope is that Plural frees up time for developers by reducing operational overhead.

Over the past few years, enterprises have gone from managing one Kubernetes cluster to multiple.

This trend has been accelerated by the rise of AI.

Plural was founded in 2021 and launched its original platform shortly after.

The company now works with multiple enterprise customers.

It recently raised a $6 million seed round led by Primary Venture Partners with participation from Capital One Ventures and Company Ventures.

Weaver said the team set out to raise $3 million but ended up doubling its round after seeing strong demand.

Plural wants to put the money toward deepening its product capabilities.

The company eventually hopes to explore areas outside of Kubernetes.

Competition includes Loft Labs, a startup that has raised $28.6 million in venture funding, and Rancher Labs, which was acquired by Suse for $600 million.

Weaver thinks Plural’s biggest differentiator is its architecture, specifically its GitOps model and self-hosted product.

No data is sent home to the cloud, and customers have full control over deployment.

Each Kubernetes cluster has its own AI agent that runs on top of it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Following a string of lawsuits and criticism for allegedly failing to protect its underage users from harm, Character AI, the startup that lets users create different AI characters and talk to them over calls and texts, said on Tuesday that it is rolling out a new set of parental supervision tools to increase safety for its teenaged users.

Character AI will now give guardians and parents a summary of their teens’ activity on the app via a weekly email. The email will supposedly show the average time a child spends on the app and on the web, the time they spend talking to each character, and the top characters they interacted with during the week.

The startup says this data is aimed to give parents insights into their teens’ engagement habits on the platform. It specified that parents don’t get direct access to chats themselves.

Following the lawsuits, the startup last year added safety measures like a dedicated model for users under 18, time-spent notifications, and disclaimers to remind users that they are chatting with AI-powered characters. The company also blocked sensitive content for input and output by creating new classifiers for teens.

Earlier this year, the startup filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that alleged the company had played a part in a teen’s suicide.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Days after Donald Trump took office, Jonathan Kamens realized he couldn’t speak freely in his two digital group chats with fellow government employees of the U.S. Digital Service.

A friend cautioned that at least one of the group members might rat him out for warning the new administration would gut his agency.

So Kamens started inviting colleagues, one by one, to join him in a group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app.

Those qualities have also made Signal a favorite of some Silicon Valley billionaires, including Elon Musk. He has tweeted "Use Signal" and used both Signal and Apple's iMessage.

Among rank-and-file federal workers, the knowledge that their email messages, memos, and other official work could be made public someday has long made them conscious of what they say.

Rapid changes and the slashing of the federal workforce have made them desperate to share information with colleagues and counterparts elsewhere in the government.

Some federal workers said they're not using apps like Signal to conduct official government business. Rather, the app is one of the few remaining places where they feel they cannot be monitored in communications with family, members of the press, and co-workers.

When workers were asked last month to summarize five of their significant accomplishments from the past week, the State Department worker said Signal messages flew as colleagues tried to figure out whether and how to reply.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Napster was notorious on the internet 25 years ago for allowing people to swap songs for free, long before the music industry had come up with a model for the digital age.

The service was shuttered in 2001 amid mounting legal battles, and filed for bankruptcy the following year.


On Tuesday, Napster was acquired by 3D technology company Infinite Reality for $207 million. Infinite Reality CEO John Acunto told CNBC that the one-time file-sharing phenomenon will be used for marketing in the metaverse.

Infinite Reality plans to create virtual 3D spaces that allow music fans to enjoy concerts or listening parties together, and let musicians or labels sell physical and virtual merchandise.


Napster is the latest iconic technology brand from decades past to get a new life.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Apple announced that it will be integrating the Apple Music catalog with popular DJ tools, allowing DJs to create mixes using Apple's robust catalog.

Users will also be able to explore a new "DJ with Apple Music" page starting today.

With these changes, Apple Music subscribers will be able to mix their own sets using the Apple Music catalog. This integration will be available in some of the leading DJ software and hardware platforms.


Stephen Campbell, Global Head of Dance, Electronic & DJ Mixes at Apple Music, shared that Apple Music is committed to supporting DJs. He stated that this latest integration takes that commitment further by seamlessly connecting Apple Music with industry-leading DJ software and hardware.

There'll also be a new "DJ with Apple Music" category page within the Apple Music app beginning today, showcasing DJ-friendly editorial playlists, alongside curator pages for each DJ software and hardware platform.


Algoriddim CEO Karim Morsy says that this Apple Music integration "opens up a world of creative possibilities for both beginners and seasoned pros."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

DeepSeek did more than just show the AI industry you don’t have to spend billions to build artificial intelligence. It fired up a long-dormant Chinese tech industry — and now Western names from OpenAI Inc. to Nvidia Corp. may pay the price.

Since DeepSeek upstaged OpenAI in January with a powerful model that purportedly cost just several million dollars to build, China’s tech leaders have flooded the market with a rapid succession of low-cost AI services, undercutting premium offerings from the likes of OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Chinese companies have in the past two weeks rolled out no fewer than 10 major product updates or releases — and that’s just the big names.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old extremism researcher and video producer at Media Matters, was laid off last year.

Elon Musk personally chimed in on X to celebrate her misfortune, saying "Karma is real."

Abughazaleh announced her campaign for Congress on Monday, aiming to represent Illinois' Ninth District.

The current representative, Jan Schakowsky, was first elected before Abughazaleh was born.

Abughazaleh built her online audience through her work at Media Matters, where she made videos decoding the rhetoric and inaccuracies of Fox News.

However, when Musk sued Media Matters over an article about X's advertising practices, the nonprofit laid off Abughazaleh and 12 others due to mounting legal costs.


She has since amassed over half a million followers across platforms for her progressive political content.

Abughazaleh didn't expect her run-ins with Musk to be relatable to the broader public, but now more than 30,000 federal employees have lost their jobs due to the billionaire's machinations.

Abughazaleh thinks that Gen Z voters shifted conservative in last year's election due to poor outreach from Democrats.

She believes that the party needs a better digital strategy, which she thinks younger people like herself can provide.


Some critics may think her age is a double-edged sword since she's young enough to have a lengthy online footprint.

Abughazaleh isn't worried and instead sees it as an asset in a world where politicians are expected to be online personalities.


She's prioritizing Bluesky, where she has around 154,000 followers, over other social media platforms like X.


On Monday, Abughazaleh posted her campaign announcement exclusively on Bluesky for an hour and a half before moving to other platforms.

Bluesky has grown to over 33 million users, with former president Barack Obama joining the platform over the weekend.


Abughazaleh's strategy has proven successful thus far, raising $100,000 in the first seven hours of her campaign.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
