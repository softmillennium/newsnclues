Reducing the amount of agricultural sprays used by farmers — including fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides — could cut down the amount of polluting runoff that ends up in the environment while at the same time reducing farmers' costs and perhaps even enhancing their productivity. A classic win-win-win.

A team of researchers at MIT and a spinoff company they launched has developed a system to do just that. Their technology adds a thin coating around droplets as they are being sprayed onto a field, greatly reducing their tendency to bounce off leaves and end up wasted on the ground. Instead, the coated droplets stick to the leaves as intended.

The research is described today in the journal Soft Matter, in a paper by recent MIT alumni Vishnu Jayaprakash PhD '22 and Sreedath Panat PhD '23, graduate student Simon Rufer, and MIT professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi.

A recent study found that if farmers didn't use pesticides, they would lose 78 percent of fruit, 54 percent of vegetable, and 32 percent of cereal production. Despite their importance, a lack of technology that monitors and optimizes sprays has forced farmers to rely on personal experience and rules of thumb to decide how to apply these chemicals. As a result, these chemicals tend to be over-sprayed, leading to runoff and chemicals ending up in waterways or building up in the soil.

Pesticides take a significant toll on global health and the environment, the researchers point out. A recent study found that 31 percent of agricultural soils around the world were at high risk from pesticide pollution. And agricultural chemicals are a major expense for farmers: In the U.S., they spend $16 billion a year just on pesticides.

Making spraying more efficient is one of the best ways to make food production more sustainable and economical. Agricultural spraying essentially boils down to mixing chemicals into water and spraying water droplets onto plant leaves, which are often inherently water-repellent. “Over more than a decade of research in my lab at MIT, we have developed fundamental understandings of spraying and the interaction between droplets and plants — studying when they bounce and all the ways we have to make them stick better and enhance coverage,” Varanasi says.

The team had previously found a way to reduce the amount of sprayed liquid that bounces away from the leaves it strikes, which involved using two spray nozzles instead of one and spraying mixtures with opposite electrical charges. But they found that farmers were reluctant to take on the expense and effort of converting their spraying equipment to a two-nozzle system. So, the team looked for a simpler alternative.

They discovered they could achieve the same improvement in droplet retention using a single-nozzle system that can be easily adapted to existing sprayers. Instead of giving the droplets of pesticide an electric charge, they coat each droplet with a vanishingly thin layer of an oily material.

In their new study, they conducted lab experiments with high-speed cameras. When they sprayed droplets with no special treatment onto a water-repelling (hydrophobic) surface similar to that of many plant leaves, the droplets initially spread out into a pancake-like disk, then rebounded back into a ball and bounced away. But when the researchers coated the surface of the droplets with a tiny amount of oil — making up less than 1 percent of the droplet's liquid — the droplets spread out and then stayed put. The treatment improved the droplets' “stickiness” by as much as a hundredfold.

“When these droplets are hitting the surface and as they expand, they form this oil ring that essentially pins the droplet to the surface,” Rufer says. The researchers tried a wide variety of conditions, he says, explaining that they conducted hundreds of experiments, “with different impact velocities, different droplet sizes, different angles of inclination, all the things that fully characterize this phenomenon.” Though different oils varied in their effectiveness, all of them were effective. “Regardless of the impact velocity and the oils, we saw that the rebound height was significantly lower,” he says.

The effect works with remarkably small amounts of oil. In their initial tests they used 1 percent oil compared to the water, then they tried a 0.1 percent, and even .01. The improvement in droplets sticking to the surface continued at a 0.1 percent, but began to break down beyond that. “Basically, this oil film acts as a way to trap that droplet on the surface, because oil is very attracted to the surface and sort of holds the water in place,” Rufer says.

In the researchers' initial tests they used soybean oil for the coating, figuring this would be a familiar material for the farmers they were working with, many of whom were growing soybeans. But it turned out that though they were producing the beans, the oil was not part of their usual supply chain for use on the farm. In further tests, the researchers found that several chemicals that farmers were already routinely using in their spraying, called surfactants and adjuvants, could be used instead, and that some of these provided the same benefits in keeping the droplets stuck on the leaves.

“That way,” Varanasi says, “we're not introducing a new chemical or changed chemistries into their field, but they're using things they've known for a long time.”

Varanasi and Jayaprakash formed a company called AgZen to commercialize the system. In order to prove how much their coating system improves the amount of spray that stays on the plant, they first had to develop a system to monitor spraying in real time. That system, which they call RealCoverage, has been deployed on farms ranging in size from a few dozen acres to hundreds of thousands of acres, and many different crop types, and has saved farmers 30 to 50 percent on their pesticide expenditures, just by improving the controls on the existing sprays. That system is being deployed to 920,000 acres of crops in 2025, the company says, including some in California, Texas, the Midwest, France and Italy. Adding the cloaking system using new nozzles, the researchers say, should yield at least another doubling of efficiency.

“You could give back a billion dollars to U.S. growers if you just saved 6 percent of their pesticide budget,” says Jayaprakash, lead author of the research paper and CEO of AgZen. “In the lab we got 300 percent of extra product on the plant. So that means we could get orders of magnitude reductions in the amount of pesticides that farmers are spraying.”

Farmers had already been using these surfactant and adjuvant chemicals as a way to enhance spraying effectiveness, but they were mixing it with a water solution. For it to have any effect, they had to use much more of these materials, risking causing burns to the plants. The new coating system reduces the amount of these materials needed, while improving their effectiveness.

In field tests conducted by AgZen, “we doubled the amount of product on kale and soybeans just by changing where the adjuvant was,” from mixed in to being a coating, Jayaprakash says. It's convenient for farmers because “all they're doing is changing their nozzle. They're getting all their existing chemicals to work better, and they're getting more product on the plant.”

And it's not just for pesticides. “The really cool thing is this is useful for every chemistry that's going on the leaf, be it an insecticide, a herbicide, a fungicide, or foliar nutrition,” Varanasi says. This year, they plan to introduce the new spray system on about 30,000 acres of cropland.

Varanasi says that with projected world population growth, “the amount of food production has got to double, and we are limited in so many resources, for example we cannot double the arable land. … This means that every acre we currently farm must become more efficient and able to do more with less.” These improved spraying technologies, for both monitoring the spraying and coating the droplets, Varanasi says, “I think is fundamentally changing agriculture.”

AgZen has recently raised $10 million in venture financing to support rapid commercial deployment of these technologies that can improve the control of chemical inputs into agriculture. “The knowledge we are gathering from every leaf, combined with our expertise in interfacial science and fluid mechanics, is giving us unparalleled insights into how chemicals are used and developed — and it's clear that we can deliver value across the entire agrochemical supply chain,” Varanasi says  “Our mission is to use these technologies to deliver improved outcomes and reduced costs for the ag industry.”

Many businesses struggle to stand out in crowded markets and achieve significant growth due to ineffective brand differentiation and inefficient marketing strategies. This results in wasted resources and missed opportunities for expansion. Rival solves this problem by providing challenger marketing strategies that help businesses build strong, differentiated brands and implement effective go-to-market plans, enabling them to break through in competitive markets and drive sustainable growth.

Rival, a startup that develops technology to enable millions of users to create and share 3D content, has emerged from stealth today and announced it has raised $4.2 million in the pre-seed round, led by Speedinvest and with participation from New Renaissance Ventures and high-profile angels. The valuation was not disclosed to TFN. 

Operating in stealth mode allowed Rival to develop its groundbreaking technology away from competitors' scrutiny while refining its approach. This strategy enabled the company to perfect its 2D-to-3D conversion technology before revealing it to the market, giving it a significant competitive edge in the rapidly evolving spatial computing landscape.

With the new funding, the company plans to grow its team with more ML/AI engineers and expand its presence in the U.S. market.

Rival Technologies was founded in 2023 by Alexander Oppermann and Konrad Melzer (who previously developed security software for the German FBI) alongside a team of former Google, Meta, and Amazon engineers. Based in London, the startup aims to grow the spatial computing market by addressing the shortage of content for the expanding range of headsets.

Alexander Oppermann, CEO of Rival, told TFN: “Rival started as a small side project where we tried to produce 3D content for ourselves and our friends playing Population:One. After seeing how difficult it was to produce and distribute user-generated VR content, we developed the idea to build tools and a platform to help the creator economy transition to VR.”

The spatial computing market faces a paradox: while hardware capabilities advance rapidly with devices like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest, adoption lags due to insufficient compelling content. This content gap presents both a challenge and a massive market opportunity, with spatial computing expected to grow from approximately $110 billion in 2023 to $1.7 trillion by 2033. Rival's approach tackles this bottleneck by democratising 3D content creation.

Rival has created a platform that lets users browse immersive 3D short-form content in their spatial computing headset, similar to TikTok or Instagram Reels. Beyond uploading conventional 3D content, users can transform any 2D video into an immersive 3D experience using the startup's first-of-its-kind 2D-to-3D foundational AI model. This technology leverages recent breakthroughs in AI-driven image processing, using sophisticated depth estimation algorithms and neural rendering techniques to create realistic 3D representations with appropriate textures and lighting.

Oppermann told TFN: “Our product is built from the ground up around AI. To enable user-generated content, you must solve both production and distribution — it's difficult, and no one else is doing that. Content production and editing are especially challenging compared to 2D. AI will drastically change the trajectory of spatial computing—we're one of the first to build it for this space.”

While spatial computing hardware advances rapidly, limited content availability slows mass adoption. Rival's 3D AI technology catalyses the unlock of spatial computing's potential, enabling users to create, share, and explore immersive content.

Their comprehensive platform approach sets Rival apart in the 2D-to-3D conversion space. Rather than just providing conversion tools, Rival is building an entire ecosystem for creating, sharing, and experiencing 3D content. “There are several players, including YoutubeVR, whose products overlap with parts of what we do, but no one is building the entire value chain from tools to distribution to enable user-generated content in VR,” noted Oppermann.

“Rival will become the essential infrastructure for the spatial computing era, making 3D creation accessible to millions of everyday users. We're building a platform that removes technical barriers, enabling a new generation of creators to shape immersive digital experiences. Our technology solves the critical content gap currently limiting spatial computing's potential,” added Oppermann.

As spatial computing evolves, Rival's technology could enable applications ranging from immersive educational experiences to virtual shopping environments where products can be viewed in 3D. The technology could also support professional visualisation in architecture, medicine, and industrial design.

Oppermann concluded, “We will relentlessly release tech to truly enable users to produce AR/VR content, and bring millions of VR users currently scattered across the many games and hardware platforms together”

Victor Huerbe, Principal with Speedinvest's Marketplaces & Consumer investment team, says: “Spatial computing is at an inflection point, but the biggest gap is content. Rival is solving this with AI that makes 3D creation effortless, unlocking a whole new wave of immersive experiences.

“Alex, Konrad, and the team move fast, and they've quietly built something game-changing. We backed them because they're not just iterating on existing tools, they're building the foundation for how we'll create and consume 3D content in the future.”

Han Jong-hee, co-CEO of the South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 63 from a heart attack. This sad news was confirmed by the company, which noted that Han died while receiving treatment for cardiac arrest at the hospital. As of now, Samsung has not revealed who will succeed him.


Han Jong-hee was a seasoned veteran with over thirty years of experience at Samsung, beginning his career in the display division. Just three years ago, he was appointed co-CEO of the company, where he played a pivotal role in transforming Samsung Electronics into a leading player in the TV market, surpassing competitors like Sony Group Corp.

In addition to his success in the television sector, Han headed Samsung's consumer electronics and mobile device divisions, which stand in competition with Apple's smartphone offerings. Recently, he took significant strides to incorporate AI technology into Samsung's Galaxy devices. Under his guidance, the company began integrating AI chips into various home appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners.

Han's untimely passing comes at a crucial moment for Samsung, as the company faces heightened competition from SK Hynix Inc. in the AI memory sector and navigates sluggish demand in consumer electronics. Last week, during Samsung's annual shareholder meeting, Han expressed that 2025 could pose challenges for the company, but hinted at plans for mergers and acquisitions to spur growth.

Han Jong-hee shared the leadership of Samsung with co-CEO Jun Young-hyun, who oversees Samsung's semiconductor business, while Han managed all other areas of the company.

Online fraud costs businesses $40 billion annually, while false declines result in $443 billion in lost sales yearly. With Burbank technology (CPoI), a merchant-friendly solution, these financial losses can be significantly reduced, offering a promising return on investment.

Justin Pike, founder of Burbank, noted: “Burbank's Card-Present over Internet (CPoI) is the world's first PCI-certified technology enabling card-present transactions online. Unlike solutions using stored credentials or wallets, CPoI lets consumers simply tap their card to their mobile device and enter their PIN — just like in stores. This enables a full liability shift, drastically reduces fraud, and eliminates false declines, costing merchants over $443 billion yearly. The SDK integrates directly into apps or via QR codes, enabling seamless deployment for app- and web-based retailers.”

To launch this groundbreaking online payment technology, Burbank secured £5M in seed funding, led by Mouro Capital, with participation from Anthemis (supported by Foxe Capital), Portfolio Ventures, and others. This funding will be primarily used to expand our team, enhance our technology, and accelerate the global rollout of Burbank's platform. This innovation enables tap-and-PIN payments in online transactions, bringing the same security and trust as in-store payments to e-commerce. The company's valuation was not disclosed to TFN.

With backing from major industry players, Burbank is positioned for rapid scaling. The funding will accelerate global partnerships with acquirers and payment providers eager to integrate the technology. At a recent live demonstration before payment executives and industry leaders, Burbank completed the world's first online card-present transaction, a significant milestone in digital payments.

Burbank, a Welsh fintech company founded in 2021 by Justin Pike, operates from its headquarters in Cardiff, Wales. Pike, who serves as CEO, previously founded MyPinPad, developing the original technology behind PCI standards SPoC and MPoC. He also pioneered cloud-based HSM deployment and has over a decade of experience in payment innovation.

Talking with TFN, Justin Pike explained: “Burbank emerged from market necessity and personal insight. During COVID, my mother-in-law, uncomfortable with online shopping, asked why she couldn't simply ‘tap her card on her phone' like in stores. This question, combined with rising online fraud and inadequate authentication systems, inspired me to develop CPoI. This online tap-and-PIN payment method brings card-present security to digital transactions.”

Burbank aims to transform e-commerce by reducing fraud and eliminating false positives in online transactions. Their innovative Card-Present over Internet (CPoI) technology aligns in-store and digital payments, allowing consumers to tap their payment card against their mobile device and enter their PIN, enhancing security and reducing fraud risks.

Pike said, “We're thrilled to bring this payment evolution to the world. Payment experiences should be consistent across all channels. In-store tap-and-PIN is globally trusted and familiar, and now we're bringing that same process online. It's simple, secure, and scalable—exactly as it should be.”

Through this technology, Burbank aims to revolutionise online commerce by mitigating fraud and establishing new standards for secure transactions. The company prioritises delivering a frictionless customer experience while maintaining the highest level of online shopping protection.

While many companies strive to improve online payment security, Burbank is the first to deliver a PCI-certified, fully card-present online experience, making it category-defining. Traditional fraud prevention tools and authentication technologies often function as add-ons to a flawed system. CPoI replaces that system entirely.

Burbank's advanced platform combines unparalleled convenience with robust security, empowering businesses to innovate in customer experience and unlock new revenue opportunities. By merging ease of use with cutting-edge security, Burbank's technology helps companies deliver exceptional customer interactions that drive growth and set new market standards.

The company's flagship solution, Card-Present over Internet (CPoI), enables Card-Present payments in online channels for the first time. This reduces fraud, processing fees, and chargebacks while eliminating false positives, offering a compelling value proposition. The groundbreaking technology integrates directly into mobile applications, delivering a simple yet robust payment experience with bank-grade security and exceptional scalability.

Pike concluded: “Burbank plans to scale globally through white-labelled partnerships with acquirers, PSPs, and payment gateways. Our go-to-market model focuses on enterprise adoption.” 

Manuel Silva Martinez, General Partner at Mouro Capital, explained the investment: “I'm thrilled to support Justin and his team of payments experts. Burbank offers a simple, seamless integration through a single while-label SDK, which securely integrates into existing technology stacks and supports multiple schemes on iOS and Android. It's what the market needs.”

Ruth Foxe Blader, General Partner at Foxe Capital, added, “CPoI is the first protocol that legally shifts liability away from the merchant. It's a massively scalable approach, with global demand.”

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (commonly known as TRAI) has taken a major step to combat the growing troublesome spam calls. The government regulatory body has amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, by introducing stricter measures to protect consumers from Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC).

A low-profile yet fast-growing technology solution provider based in Cary, North Carolina is making waves in the hotel industry. Inn-Flow, a company providing integrated back-office management software for the hotel industry, has secured a $45 million growth capital investment from Mainsail Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm specializing in vertical SaaS. The funding marks the company's first institutional investment and sets the stage for major expansion across product, people, and market reach.

Founded in 2009 by John Erhart, a hospitality industry veteran with deep roots in hotel ownership through his family's company, CMC Hotels, Inn-Flow began as a solution to streamline operations within the family business. The platform officially launched to the broader industry in 2014, quickly gaining traction among hotel owners and operators seeking better tools to manage increasingly complex operations.

Fast forward to today, and Inn-Flow has evolved into a comprehensive, cloud-based platform designed specifically for hotel management companies. The software offers a suite of integrated modules covering accounting and bookkeeping, payroll, labor management, procurement, sales tracking, bank reconciliation, and business intelligence. These tools empower hotel operators to automate routine tasks, improve decision-making, control labor costs, and scale more efficiently.

In 2024 alone, Inn-Flow reportedly processed over 920,000 invoices, managed $2.7 billion in payables, and reconciled nearly 5,000 bank accounts across its customer base. It also supported over 100,000 labor-management users, tracking nearly 15 million labor hours and overseeing payroll volume in excess of $200 million. These metrics underscore the platform's growing impact on operational performance and financial visibility within the hospitality sector.

“This investment is a major milestone for our team and our customers,” said John Erhart, Founder and CEO of Inn-Flow in a statement. “We are committed to providing a robust, user-friendly platform that enables hotel owners and management companies to simplify their operations and grow their businesses profitably. Mainsail's experience in scaling vertical SaaS companies will help us take Inn-Flow to the next level.”

The investment will reportedly be used to accelerate product innovation, enhance customer experience, and expand the company's team, including the planned hiring of at least 20 new employees in the Cary area over the next 18 months. Mainsail's strategic support will also help Inn-Flow expand its presence in new market segments and further differentiate its platform in an increasingly competitive space.

As part of its expansion strategy, Inn-Flow will reportedly roll out new product offerings in the coming months, including solutions for facilities management, mobile access, and advanced business intelligence. These new capabilities aim to help hoteliers operate more efficiently, stay ahead of the technology curve, and ultimately drive higher profitability.

The hotel industry's push toward digital transformation—fueled by rising labor costs, leaner teams, and increased demand for automation—has created fertile ground for platforms like Inn-Flow. With a strong foundation, loyal customer base, and now, significant financial backing, the company is well-positioned to become a dominant force in hotel back-office technology.

From a family-owned hotel solution to a national leader in hospitality SaaS, Inn-Flow's journey is a compelling case study in how industry insiders can drive innovation by solving problems from the inside out.
