 The recent trade tensions could present an opportunity for American hardware manufacturers to help ramp up onshore Bitcoin mining, according to a US Bitcoin mining supplier. 

US President Donald Trump's trade war with China and efforts to ramp up on-shore Bitcoin mining will be a boon for US mining rig manufacturers, which currently only hold a small sliver of market share compared to their major Chinese counterparts. 

The United States accounts for over 40% of the Bitcoin network's global hashrate but still leans heavily on China-made mining rigs. China-based Bitmain reportedly holds as much as a 90% market share in the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. 

“Trump's continued focus to support the US BTC mining industry highlights the urgent need to address US reliance on foreign technology,” Auradine's chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, told Cointelegraph in a recent interview. 

US Bitcoin firms hit a major supply problem last year, with thousands of Bitcoin (BTC) miners held at ports of entry by the US Customs and Border Protection. 

One of the firms affected believed it was due to a mistaken belief that the chips were illegally imported Chinese radio frequency devices. It took months before they started being released. 

Gupta said that US-China trade tensions have also disrupted the flow of foreign Bitcoin miners. 

“These trade tensions have increased supply chain disruptions with many hardware shipments facing delays and uncertainties,” Gupta said.

The US was already competing with China to win the high-end chip manufacturing market, but the recent trade tensions have only “intensified” these challenges for US-based crypto miners, he added. 

China-based Bitmain is said to hold the majority of the Bitcoin mining manufacturing market. It expanded its production line into the US last December to improve supply chain efficiency.

Gupta said his firm could also stand well-positioned amid Trump's plan to ramp up onshore manufacturing as a “dramatic increase in demand” for electricity would, in turn, “put a tremendous deal of pressure on the electric grid” — making it more important for Bitcoin miners to operate off-grid. 

Auradine recently announced the launch of its new Teraflux AH3880 hydro-cooled Bitcoin miner, competing with the likes of Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan.

Asked whether a further uptick in Bitcoin mining activity in the US could hurt Bitcoin decentralization, Gupta said that securing the Bitcoin network with more energy-efficient solutions in the US would be a “net positive” for Bitcoin but said there could be risks if the increase outpaces technology in sustainability and decentralization. 

Over 95% of the network's hash power already comes from the US and China alone, according to the Hashrate Index.

Bitcoin (BTC) options worth billions of dollars will expire on Deribit on Friday. The impending settlement, though big, may not yield significant market volatility, the exchange told CoinDesk.

More than 139,000 BTC option contracts, worth $12.13 billion, representing nearly 45% of the total active BTC contracts across all expiries, are due for settlement this Friday, according to data source Deribit metrics. 

More than 65% of the total open interest is concentrated in call options that provide buyers with an asymmetric bullish exposure, while the rest is in put options offering downside protection.

Quarterly expiries of such massive magnitudes are known to breed market volatility, but that may not be the case this time, going by the continued decline in the bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (DVOL). The index has dropped from an annualized 62% to 48% in the weeks leading up to the expiry, suggesting subdued volatility expectations.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the annualized perpetual futures basis of around 5% on the exchange, signalling a calmer funding environment.

"Despite the size of the expiry, the overall setup—low DVOL, moderate basis, and balanced options positioning—points to a relatively subdued expiry unless external catalysts emerge," Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

Options skew, which measures the difference between implied volatility (pricing) for calls relative to puts, shows downside concerns in the lead-up to Friday's expiry.

That said, the broader outlook remains constructive.

"3-Day Put-Call Skew is Slightly Positive indicating some immediate downside protection demand while 30-Day Put-Call Skew is slightly Negative indicating a more bullish outlook over the medium term," Strijers said.

Also expiring Friday are ether (ETH) options worth $2.8 billion.

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.

Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector."

Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity."

“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ... More high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin as traders pare back bets on Donald Trump's bitcoin and crypto policy.

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.

Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.

Last week, Saylor predicted there's about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.</p>

As Bitcoin proxy BlackRock IBIT's correlation with the Nasdaq nears 70%, historical trends point to the likelihood of a soon-to-come divergence in performance.

Bitcoin's (BTC) correlation with the Nasdaq appears to be inching closer to a level that has only been reached twice before right before BTC price crashed 20%, data from Singapore-based blockchain firm Matrixport reveals.

In a recent X post, Matrixport revealed that the 30-day realized correlation between Bitcoin proxy IBIT and the Nasdaq is likely due to such factors as the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global economic conditions.

“This correlation reflects the recent repricing of earnings expectations ahead of Q1 earnings season, along with ongoing uncertainty and the negative overhang from tariff discussions. As a result, Bitcoin is trading in line with the tech sector.”

Matrixport

Despite the current trend, Matrixport cautions that such high correlations typically do not last for long, noting that “such high correlations have historically been short-lived, suggesting that a divergence in performance between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq may be on the horizon.” The last two times the correlation reached this level, Bitcoin's price dropped by more than 20%, according to data from crypto price aggregators.

While the latest correlation activity could point to Bitcoin potentially decoupling from the Nasdaq's influence in the near future, there's still no clear timeline or certainty that such a divergence will happen.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds returned to weekly inflows as BTC settled back above the crucial $85,000 support level, which analysts believe is necessary for the next leg higher. 10x Research's Markus Thielen noted in a March 23 report that Bitcoin's reversal indicators have turned bullish, with the 21-day moving average now at $85,200.

Oops, something went wrong

A newly launched reserve of 10 million Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), valued at approximately $1.83 million, has been established to advance the cryptocurrency's use in real-world payments.

What Happened: The initiative, spearheaded by House of Doge, a newly formed organization dedicated to expanding Dogecoin's adoption through business partnerships and integrations, aims to position DOGE as a mainstream payment tool for consumers and merchants alike, Decrypt reported on Monday.

Unlike traditional reserves such as the strategic Bitcoin reserve, which are primarily used as financial hedges, this Dogecoin reserve will serve as a liquidity pool to ease and support transactions across a global network of businesses.

"House of Doge is laying the groundwork for a robust payments ecosystem designed to deliver liquidity and reliability," said Michael Galloro, a board-elect member of House of Doge. "The reserve helps ensure that Dogecoin can be used practically for daily purchases by smoothing transaction processing times."

The reserve is intended to address blockchain-related delays, which House of Doge sees as a barrier to the widespread use of digital assets in retail payments.

Dogecoin has been gaining increased recognition in financial markets.

Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 7% as majors staged a relief rally on Tuesday driven by talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being more measured than initially expected.

As per reports, President Donald Trump's planned "reciprocal tariffs" set for April 2 may be more targeted than previously threatened, with some countries exempt and existing metal levies possibly not stacking.

The tariffs unsettled markets in February, shocking stocks and cryptocurrencies alike with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 17.6% to below $80,000 from its January peak.

Last week, the Federal Reserve raised inflation forecasts and lowered growth projections, likely due to Trump's trade stance, but described the tariff-driven inflation as temporary while maintaining plans for two rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets.

This, along with the possibility of milder tariffs, has boosted market optimism, and memecoins are leading the charge. DOGE, pepecoin (PEPE), mog (MOG), floki (FLOKI), among others, are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with the meme sector up 5.6% on average, per CoinGecko data.

That has beaten a 3% run in bitcoin, Solana's SOL and XRP, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index up 2.7%.

Memecoins jump or act as beta bets when ether (ETH) or bitcoin rise because they're highly speculative assets with amplified sensitivity to broader crypto market trends.

Retail traders often see relief in majors as a signal of bullish sentiment across the crypto ecosystem — chasing higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities like memecoins, which are typically cheaper and can deliver rapid gains in relatively shorter periods.

Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence (AI) majors are stable after Alibaba's Joe Tsai said he sees sign of a bubble forming in the ecosystem, the category is up 4.5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

“I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” Tsai said during an HSBC conference in Hong Kong. “I start to get worried when people are building data centers on spec. There are a number of people coming up, funds coming out, to raise billions or millions of capital.”

Investment in AI appears to be occurring ahead of current demand, Tsai believes.

NEAR protocol, the largest AI token by market cap, is flat in trading today, but up 14% in the last week as the market continues to positively digest news that Coinbase and the biggest names in AI were working together to collaboratively develop AI agent technology.

Story's IP token also continues to do well, up 8% on-day, as the project continues to secure notable Hollywood and Korean popstar intellectual property to monetize on its chain. Story has pitched its project as a way for rights holders to survive the AI revolution by easily creating frameworks to license their content for AI training.

Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a notable surge, gaining 3% in the last 24 hours, climbing from $84,000 to $88,600, following reports that upcoming US tariffs on major trading partners will be less severe than initially anticipated. 

However, altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have outperformed Bitcoin's surge in the 24-hour time frame, being the top gainers in the ten largest cryptocurrencies list. 

Bitcoin And Top Altcoins Experience Significant Gains

Scheduled for announcement on April 2, President Donald Trump had previously indicated that he would impose both reciprocal and sector-specific tariffs on countries including Canada, China, and Mexico. 

However, anonymous sources within the White House, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have suggested that the president may opt for a narrower approach, focusing solely on reciprocal tariffs. 

According to the reports, this shift in strategy appears to signal a tempering of the administration's approach to a “potential trade war”, which has historically led to increased volatility in both the cryptocurrency and equity markets.

Dan Greer, CEO of Defi App, a decentralized finance platform, noted the correlation between Bitcoin's recent price increase and the news of the tariff adjustments. “This surge in Bitcoin's price coincides with reports that the Trump administration is considering narrowing the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2,” he stated.

The positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has extended to the broader cryptocurrency market, with nearly all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization experiencing gains on Monday. 

Ethereum rose by 4%, XRP by 2%, Solana, DOGE and Cardano led the pack with increases of 8%, 7.8% and 4.5% respectively. The stock market reflected this optimism, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices rising 2% over the past 24 hours.

Expert Insights On BTC's Recent Fluctuations

Greer highlighted that this development has alleviated some market uncertainties, leading to increased investor confidence across both cryptocurrency and equity markets. 

The crypto sector, which has faced mixed reactions since Trump took office, has been grappling with the implications of his fluctuating tariff policies. These policies have introduced a considerable degree of economic uncertainty, prompting many investors to retreat from riskier assets.

The anticipated tariffs—expected to raise the prices of foreign goods—could lead to inflation, further complicating the economic landscape. Bitcoin, which reached an all-time high of $109,000 in January, has seen a decline, dropping to $78,000 earlier this month amid fears that aggressive economic policies could trigger a recession.

Colin Closser, investor relations manager at crypto wallet company Exodus, expressed his understanding of the crypto market's reaction to Trump's policies. “I expect markets to show emotion and volatility during times of change and stress in the United States, and you can see that volatility in Bitcoin this morning,” he remarked.

Since the spike, Bitcoin has seen a bit of a pullback towards the $86,930 level, with the most notable support floor between $83,000 and $84,000.

Oops, something went wrong

A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) wallet valued at $250 million has sprung back to life after an eight-year hiatus, triggering a wave of speculation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

What Happened: A Bitcoin wallet, initially valued at around $3 million in 2017, has recently become active after eight years of dormancy. The wallet now holds a staggering $250 million worth of Bitcoin.

Such occurrences usually set off a storm of speculation within the cryptocurrency community. Some members have suggested that the wallet's owner may have rediscovered their private keys, leading to the sudden activity.

Previously, a dormant Bitcoin whale holding $29.3 million also became active after several years of inactivity. In 2024, several Satoshi-era whales suddenly resumed activity, including a wallet containing 2,000 Bitcoins mined in 2010 that made a transfer for the first time in 14 years.

Earlier on Sunday, a massive $252 million was transferred to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert data. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,334.

Why It Matters: The sudden resurgence of dormant Bitcoin whales can significantly impact the cryptocurrency market. The movement of such large amounts of Bitcoin can create waves in the market, potentially leading to price volatility.

This could potentially signal selling pressure, which may affect Bitcoin's price. The re-emergence of these whales, coupled with the recent transfer of $252 million to an unknown wallet, underscores the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin could surge to $110,000 before pulling back to $76,500, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.

Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, believes Bitcoin may have already hit its local bottom and is now rebounding. He pointed to the Federal Reserve's dovish stance and President Trump's flexible position on tariffs as factors boosting confidence. He also highlighted a drop in selling pressure, with U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recording net inflows of around $744 million last week, including $537 million from BlackRock alone, according to Farside Investors.

Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Bitcoin's rise past $85,000 has been seen as a bullish signal. Analyst Emmanuel Cardozo expects liquidity conditions and discussions about a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve to drive Bitcoin toward $110,000. However, he also warned that a correction to $76,500 remains possible due to market volatility.

With Bitcoin trading around $87,000, investors are watching central bank policies and liquidity trends closely. While the outlook remains positive, market corrections could still happen as traders navigate price fluctuations.

XRP and Solana saw the highest inflows among altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the week ending March 21, with $6.71 million and $6.44 million.

Despite Ethereum's losses, the digital asset market ended a five-week streak of net outflows, bringing in $644 million. Bitcoin led the recovery, attracting $724 million in inflows—its largest since January. The bulk of this came from the U.S., where BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) played a significant role, contributing to the country's total inflows of $632 million. Switzerland recorded $15.9 million, Germany saw $13.9 million, and Hong Kong added $1.2 million. Meanwhile, Canada and Sweden experienced net outflows.

Ethereum's poor performance weighed on the altcoin market, with other assets also seeing losses. Sui and Polkadot each had $1.3 million in outflows, while Tron lost $950,000. However, Solana's strong inflows come amid anticipation of the first Solana futures ETF in the U.S., which could eventually pave the way for a spot Solana ETF.

XRP also benefited from regulatory developments. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, a case that had been ongoing for years. This decision likely increased investor confidence in XRP, contributing to its strong inflows for the week.

Bitcoin ETFs have been a major focus of the market, particularly with the SEC's shifting stance on spot ETFs. Initially, futures-based Bitcoin ETFs gained approval due to the regulated nature of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which eased concerns over market manipulation. However, a lawsuit from Grayscale challenged the SEC's rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs, forcing regulators to reconsider. This led to the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that has significantly impacted investor sentiment.

Bitcoin's strong inflows helped stabilize the digital asset market despite Ethereum's ongoing struggles. While the altcoin sector as a whole was dragged down by Ethereum's losses, XRP and Solana stood out as exceptions, benefiting from legal and market developments.
