The original lawsuit centered on allegations that Ripple conducted unregistered securities offerings through its XRP sales, leading to legal proceedings that lasted nearly four years.

The settlement marks the conclusion of one of the most closely watched cases in the crypto industry once the Commission votes and court documents are finalized.</p></b>

                <p>GameStop may be credited as the first meme stock, but the video game retailer's CEO seems to be hinting that the company could soon embrace Bitcoin.

The company is set to report Q4 earnings when the market closes at 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday. Analysts expect the Texas-based firm to disclose an earnings per share mark of $0.08, based on two analyst ratings compiled by FactSet.

 

GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending the video game retailer become a “premier Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector” by converting its cash reserves into Bitcoin. Last month, GameStop Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen acknowledged Strive's proposal on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Letter received,” he said, without elaborating further.

 

Several companies in the U.S. have embraced Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, but the practice was pioneered by Strategy, which has been buying Bitcoin since 2020 and now holds 506,137 BTC valued at $44.2 billion. Before acknowledging Strive’s proposal last month, Cohen posed alongside Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a photo he posted to X.

 

As of Nov. 2, GameStop held $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $900 million a year prior, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The company’s stock price jumped last month after people familiar with the matter told CNBC that the company was considering buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

 

GameStop did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. In early 2021, GameStop became a flashpoint for retail investors. Legions of users on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets—including Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty—partook in a coordinated effort to bet against Wall Street firms and trigger a short squeeze.

 

A short squeeze can occur when short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the stock price up further. GameStop’s stock price peaked in 2021 around $95, after trading around $5 a month before, according to Nasdaq.</p></b>

                <p>XRP investors have plenty to celebrate as Ripple’s recent victory over the SEC provides a strong foundation for an upcoming rally.

After surging to $2.57 in the wake of this landmark win, XRP remains stable around the $2.4 mark, with market analysts now eyeing a potential $5 target.

However, savvy traders have already identified an even bigger opportunity in the XRP ecosystem: the XRPTurbo presale, which is rapidly nearing its completion and promising explosive gains for early participants.


XRP has performed impressively, climbing nearly 1% over the past week despite wider crypto volatility. Although recent gains briefly pushed the token toward $2.57, the price faced resistance and consolidated around current levels.

Another positive catalyst for XRP is Bitcoin’s current market position. BTC is testing crucial resistance levels, and a confirmed breakout could inject significant momentum into XRP and other major altcoins.


With XRP’s strong fundamental backdrop and Bitcoin potentially driving market sentiment, XRP investors have a lot to look forward to in the months ahead.

The XRPTurbo platform is set to launch an exciting suite of DeFi products tailored exclusively to the XRP community, including: 

A simplified platform enabling users to mint XRP-native tokens and NFTs at minimal cost, opening doors for widespread blockchain adoption.

XRP holders will soon enjoy a Ce-DeFi staking model offering an attractive 25%+ APY, providing lucrative passive income without sacrificing liquidity.

Empowering innovative AI-driven projects and RWA platforms, XRPTurbo provides community-driven funding and rapid market entry via XRP Ledger’s advanced infrastructure.</p></b>

                <p>Ripple (XRP) has long been a dominant force in blockchain-based financial transactions, but recent developments suggest investors are exploring alternatives.

Rexas Finance (RXS) is gaining momentum as a strong contender in the growing tokenized asset sector.

The price of XRP is currently trading around $2.50, marking a 1.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Trading volume has also decreased by 7.5%, signaling lower investor enthusiasm.

Technical analysis indicates that XRP is facing resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. Analysts have pointed to bearish divergence signals, where price increases are not matched by momentum indicators.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 55, indicating weakening bullish momentum. If XRP fails to break past resistance, it may continue trading sideways or decline toward the $2.25 support level.

A further drop below this level could push the price toward $2.00. Despite these price challenges, whale accumulation has increased. Wallets holding 100 million to 1 billion XRP have added over 2 billion tokens in the past week.

Additionally, 99 million XRP was withdrawn from exchanges at an average price of $2.30, a 94.12% increase from the previous day.

Rexas Finance (RXS) is an emerging capital that is beginning to take its position in this market. It has disclosed the presale that the project has obtained more than 47 million dollars.

Currently, RXS is trading at $0.20, and the official exchange will start on June 19, 2025, with the value of $0.25.

Rexas Finance specialises in the creation of RWAs, through which it provides opportunities to purchase shares in real estate, commodities, and intellectual property.

It enhances market liquidity while allowing entry to what were hitherto closed off individual clients.

The Rexas Finance ecosystem encompasses various components that focus on improving the products’ tokenization and sales within the financial markets.

Rexas Token Builder is a software that is easy to use thus allowing anyone to issue tokens linked to physical assets they own.

Rexas Launchpad is an efficient solution to allow new blockchain projects to sell tokens securely.

Trading and Integrated Financial System Rexas Finance also provides decentralized finance (DeFi) services for trading tokenized assets across various blockchains.

The Rexas DeFi Treasury provides investment opportunities where token holders can share in the earnings.

Furthermore, Rexas Estate offers fractional ownership of the properties, making it an attractive investment opportunity.</p></b>

                <p>Berachain, a bear-themed layer-1 blockchain, went live with rewards for its proof of liquidity consensus mechanism on Monday.

A day after the launch, the BERA token has gained 14%, according to CoinGecko, and broken into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Proof of liquidity is a variation of the proof of stake consensus mechanism used on Ethereum. It uses two tokens in BERA for gas and network security as well as BGT for governance and rewards.

Validators stake BERA so they can propose blocks and earn rewards in BGT, which then get distributed to reward vaults.

Validators supply the liquidity to these reward vaults so that other users can stake assets, like BERA, and earn BGT rewards.

For supplying the liquidity, validators are provided with a receipt token which can also be staked into reward vaults—thus creating aligned incentives to secure the network via staking.

This feature went live on Monday, opening 37 reward vaults and starting the distribution of BGT across the ecosystem.

BGT, the governance token, can be used to vote on proposals.

Later this week, a second batch of reward vault whitelist requests will be voted on. The network claims the first batch were selected based on “economic value, security, and alignment with Berachain’s ecosystem.”

As of this writing, BERA is changing hands for $7.89 and still the 100th largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $858 million.

The launch of the first batch of reward vaults is a significant step in what the network is branding as the official launch of proof of liquidity.

Berachain launched its mainnet in February, airdropping $1.17 billion worth of BERA tokens to users who participated in its pre-launch initiatives.

The network claims this was a fairly limited launch with only its Berchain native decentralized exchange (also referred to as BEX) liquidity pools available to deposit assets into.

Berachain's founder Homme Bera wrote that the proof of liquidity is a major step in Berachain’s governance evolution, moving from a limited launch within native BEX pools to a more open ecosystem.</p></b>

                <p>DFZ Labs, the creators of the Ethereum NFT project Deadfellaz, will launch a new asset verification tool called Coldlink.

Coldlink enables blockchain users to connect their blockchain address to any asset in Web2, Web3, or real life without signing blind transactions or smart contract approvals.

“To ‘Coldlink’ something is to connect any digital asset safely to anything else without granting permissions to the wallet holding the asset,” Betty, pseudonymous CEO of DFZ Labs, said.


The solution has been in the works since 2022 when DFZ Labs began seeking a way for its community to safely and securely gain access to gaming developments without putting their assets at risk.

With Coldlink, users will be able to unlock a variety of new blockchain and real-world connections.

For example, they could connect a blockchain address to a PO box in order to receive a physical item without revealing their identity or connect a digital music collectible to a physical concert ticket number in order to gain rewards from an event organizer.

Instead, Coldlink uses unique transaction markers paired with database entries to link the assets.

Coldlink verification essentially works by pairing a serialized unique tracer transaction with a serialized unique database entry for each Coldlink submission.


The technology has been feasible for a long time–but DFZ labs is the first to handle it in this particular way.

For the DFZ Labs CEO, Coldlink is especially useful for participants of communities with rare or expensive digital items—like CryptoPunks.</p></b>

                <p>Whale.io has announced plans to migrate its Whale NFT collection from the TON blockchain to the Solana blockchain.

The cross-chain transition aims to expand the project's interoperability and accessibility by leveraging Solana's infrastructure.

The Whale NFT collection was initially launched on the TON blockchain, where all 20,000 NFTs were minted at no cost within hours of release.

Over the following year, the collection became one of the most visible projects on Getgems, TON's leading NFT marketplace.

According to platform data, the floor price increased approximately sevenfold during this period.

Whale.io has implemented several mechanisms to manage supply and maintain engagement with the collection, including token buybacks and supply reductions via burns.

These practices have been part of the project's ongoing strategy on the TON blockchain, and the team has indicated that similar measures will be introduced following the migration to Solana.

In addition, Whale NFTs have been available for trading with zero gas fees on supported platforms.

With the upcoming transition to Solana—known for its high throughput and low transaction costs—the collection is expected to remain active across major NFT marketplaces within the Solana ecosystem.

Whale NFTs aren't just pretty pictures—they're powerhouses of utility, deeply integrated into the Whale ecosystem.

At the heart of this is the Wheel of Whales miniapp on Telegram, a play-to-earn sensation that's taking the crypto gaming world by storm.

Owning a Whale NFT isn’t just a flex—it’s a ticket to amplified benefits within Wheel of Whales.

Holders enjoy boosted earnings and a suite of in-game perks, giving them a significant edge in this addictive play-to-earn game.

Highest rarity Golden NFT prices go up to 2000 TON that equals over 7000 USDT.

Whale.io has announced its intention to bridge its NFT collection to the Solana blockchain, recognized for its scalability and active NFT ecosystem.

The transition is designed to expand the project’s reach by integrating with Solana's infrastructure and user base.

According to the team, this cross-chain move reflects a broader strategy to enhance accessibility and engagement across multiple blockchain environments.

Whale.io will bring its established framework—which has included gas-free trading, supply reduction mechanisms, and various utility features—into the Solana environment.

The bridge from TON to Solana represents an effort to connect two blockchain ecosystems, enabling broader accessibility for the Whale NFT collection.

With Solana’s low transaction costs and high-speed processing, the transition is intended to streamline the user experience and support increased activity across NFT marketplaces.</p></b>

Over the following year, the collection became one of the most visible projects on Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace. According to platform data, the floor price increased approximately sevenfold during this period.

Hosted on Getgems.io (collection available here), Whale NFTs quickly became a cultural phenomenon within the TON ecosystem. With eye-catching designs and varying rarities, Whale.io’s collectibles became popular display pictures across Telegram.

The Whale team has implemented several mechanisms to manage supply and maintain engagement with the collection, including token buybacks and supply reductions via burns. These practices have been part of the project’s ongoing strategy on the TON blockchain, and the team has indicated that similar measures will be introduced following the migration to Solana.

In addition, Whale NFTs have been available for trading with zero gas fees on supported platforms, a feature that has contributed to repeated appearances on trending lists within Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace.

With the upcoming transition to Solana—known for its high throughput and low transaction costs—the collection is expected to remain active across major NFT marketplaces within the Solana ecosystem.

Whale NFTs aren’t just pretty pictures—they’re powerhouses of utility, deeply integrated into the Whale ecosystem. At the heart of this is the Wheel of Whales miniapp on Telegram, a play-to-earn sensation that’s taking the crypto gaming world by storm.

This innovative game offers players the exclusive chance to participate in the distribution of Whale tokens, making it a golden opportunity for anyone looking to dive into the project’s rewards system.

Owning a Whale NFT isn’t just a flex—it’s a ticket to amplified benefits within Wheel of Whales. Holders enjoy boosted earnings and a suite of in-game perks, giving them a significant edge in this addictive play-to-earn game.

Highest rarity Golden NFT prices go up to 2000 TON that equals over 7000 USDT.

Whale.io has announced its intention to bridge its NFT collection to the Solana blockchain, recognized for its scalability and active NFT ecosystem. The transition is designed to expand the project’s reach by integrating with Solana’s infrastructure and user base.

The bridge from TON to Solana represents an effort to connect two blockchain ecosystems, enabling broader accessibility for the Whale NFT collection.

Whale.io will bring its established framework—which has included gas-free trading, supply reduction mechanisms, and various utility features—into the Solana environment. With Solana’s low transaction costs and high-speed processing, the transition is intended to streamline the user experience and support increased activity across NFT marketplaces.

The Whale NFT bridge is a landmark moment for the broader NFT and blockchain gaming industries. It showcases how projects can evolve, adapt, and thrive across ecosystems while delivering consistent value to their communities.

With the upcoming bridge to Solana, Whale.io is transitioning its NFT collection into a new blockchain environment.

The project has encouraged community members, NFT collectors, and Telegram gaming participants to follow official channels for updates regarding the bridging timeline, marketplace listings, and upcoming developments within the Wheel of Whales ecosystem.

                <p>Bitcoin recently achieved its best weekly performance in over two months, climbing 4.24% to $88,804.

Analyst Axel Adler Jr. predicts Bitcoin could reach $130,000 within 90 days, based on onchain metrics.

A major Bitcoin whale purchased 2,400 BTC worth $200 million on March 24, 2025.

Another whale that had been inactive since 2017 moved 3,000 BTC valued at $250 million

BlackRock has acquired 4,054 BTC in seven days, growing their position to approximately 574,000 BTC worth over $50 billion.

Bitcoin has recently shown strong market performance, climbing 4.24% to reach an intra-day high of $88,804. This marks Bitcoin’s best weekly performance in over two months.

The cryptocurrency has reclaimed a bullish stance on the charts, closing above the daily chart’s 200-day exponential moving average.

With a weekly close above $84,600, experts suggest that Bitcoin has an increased likelihood of testing the $90,000 mark soon.

However, BTC must first overcome the descending resistance level to make a sustainable move at the range highs.

Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. views the current price action as healthy consolidation rather than the beginning of a bear market.

According to Adler’s analysis of onchain metrics, Bitcoin has not yet entered “overheated” territory in this cycle, as indicated by BTC’s Investor Price Model.

This particular model has flashed sell signals twice during 2021. It incorporates several key metrics: the realized cap, thermo cap, investor price, and Bitcoin supply.

Adler further supports his bullish outlook using Bitcoin’s cumulative value days destroyed (CVDD) metric.

This tool monitors selling activity among long-term holders. In the current bull cycle (2024-2025), it has triggered a sell signal just once, back in March 2024.

Based on his analysis, Adler predicts that Bitcoin could climb to $130,000 within 90 days.

He notes that we might see “seasoned investors taking profits once Bitcoin breaches key peak levels ($123K), potentially exerting downward pressure on the price.”

Recent data shows Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) jumped by over $1.5 billion in a 24-hour period.

Open interest represents the total value of outstanding futures contracts in the market.

The funding rate, which reflects the cost of holding leveraged positions, has stayed near neutral.

This suggests that neither bullish (long) nor bearish (short) traders are dominantly in control of the market at present.</p></b>

                <p>World Liberty Financial (WLFI) added 3.54 million Mantle (MNT) to its cryptocurrency holdings on March 23, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence.

The entity’s wallet also holds ETH, TRON, AVAX, and MOVE, among others.

It currently holds eleven digital assets in its wallet, including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), MOVE (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), Sei (SEI), Avalanche (AVAX), and MNT.

WLFI’s total holdings of Mantle (MNT) now stand at 5.99 million, worth over $5 million at current market prices.

Last week, the DeFi project acquired 2.45 million MNT tokens and 103,911 AVAX tokens.

Diversifying its crypto holdings across various blockchain projects is a way for the project to mitigate market volatility.

The project also wants to invest in innovative DeFi projects to support the development of DeFi and capitalize on business opportunities.

Lookonchain data reveals ETH as the dominant asset in WLFI’s portfolio, valued at approximately $134 million, followed by $69.5 million in WBTC.

WLFI’s team's ETH holdings incurred the heaviest unrealized losses, totaling $85 million at press time.

WLFI’s total portfolio losses have surpassed $111 million.

MNT and AVAX are the only holdings reporting unrealized profits, with a combined gain of over $113,800.

WLFI recently formed a strategic collaboration with Sui, the prominent Layer-1 blockchain.

The move focuses on integrating Sui’s technology and assets into WLFI’s ecosystem while exploring opportunities to build next-gen blockchain applications, specifically targeting decentralized finance (DeFi).

As part of the partnership, the project will soon add Sui tokens to its “Macro Strategy” reserve, which includes BTC, ETH, TRX, LINK, and ONDO tokens.

WLFI has already established relationships with blockchain protocols and institutions, including Ondo Finance, Ethena, Chainlink, and Aave.

World Liberty Financial announced on March 17 that it had successfully raised $550 million from two sets of token sales.

The first set sold $300 million of WLFI tokens, and the second set sold $250 million.

WLFI’s token sale drew over 85,000 participants, all of whom completed the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) process to verify their eligibility.

The completion came despite an initial struggling token sale.

The project once retargeted its goal from $300 million to $30 million, a 90% reduction, after facing challenges in meeting its original target.

WLFI launched with the goal of offering transparent, accessible, and secure financial solutions. 

It aims to democratize access to DeFi by creating user-friendly tools.

The WLFI token serves as the platform’s governance token.</p></b>

                <p>Crypto stocks soared on Monday, with Strategy (MSTR) up 10%, Coinbase up 7%, and mining companies like CleanSpark up 18%.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, announced surpassing 500,000 Bitcoin in holdings, valued at $44.2 billion.

Markets rallied after indications that the Trump administration may soften its stance on tariffs.

Analysts noted growing connections between crypto and traditional finance, with companies expanding their offerings.


Bitcoin traded at around $87,350, up 2.2% in 24 hours, while Ethereum and Solana rose 4% and 6% respectively.

Strategy's current Bitcoin holdings amount to 506,137 coins, at a value of approximately $44.2 billion.

The company has been funding these purchases by selling its stock.


Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, also benefited from the market upswing, with its stock rising by 7% on Monday afternoon Eastern Time.

Shares were trading at $203.


Public Bitcoin mining companies weren’t left out of the rally. Low-carbon miner CleanSpark (CLSK) saw an impressive 18% increase.

Its stock reached $8.79 during Monday trading.


Other mining companies performed well too. Riot Platforms (RIOT) jumped nearly 10% to $9.69 per share.

MARA Holdings (MARA) climbed 18% to reach $14.61 per share.


The broader U.S. stock market also traded higher on Monday, following reports that the Trump administration might narrow the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index jumped 2.2% on the day.


Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was trading at approximately $87,350.

This represented a 2.2% increase over the previous 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.

Ethereum saw gains of more than 4% during the same period.

Solana performed even better with a 6% price increase.


Earlier in March, economic data provided some relief to worried investors.

The Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, came in slightly lower than expected.

This encouraged markets that had been concerned about potential stagflation.</p></b>

                <p>Cronos (CRO) price surged 30-55% following a partnership announcement between Trump Media and Crypto.com to develop ETFs.

The proposed ETFs will offer exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and “diverse industries such as energy” under the “Truth.Fi” brand.

Trading volume for CRO increased nearly six times from $21 million to $126 million.

The rally coincides with an upcoming Cronos zkEVM mainnet upgrade scheduled for March 26.

Daily transactions more than doubled from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000 according to CronoScan.

Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com, has seen its price jump over 30% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.10 according to CoinGecko data.

The partnership aims to create “inventive funds” that will focus on “rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy,” according to TMTG CEO Devin Nunes.

These ETFs will provide exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and other industries including energy.

Trading data shows that CRO’s trading volume exploded from $21 million to $126 million on Monday evening.

Traders rushed to capitalize on the presidential connection, driving up both price and activity.

The daily transactions chart from CronoScan reveals that network activity has more than doubled.

Transactions increased from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000 as interest in the token surged.

Products from this partnership will launch under the “Truth.Fi” brand.

The ETFs will target markets across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, pending regulatory approval in each region.

This strategy aligns with President Trump’s economic agenda.

President Trump recently vowed to make America the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world” during video remarks at the Digital Asset Summit conference in New York.

The arrangement places President Trump’s media company in business with Singapore-based Crypto.com.

This comes just five months after the crypto firm faced SEC scrutiny over allegations of operating an unregistered securities exchange.

The CRO price rally also comes ahead of a scheduled Cronos zkEVM mainnet upgrade.

This upgrade is set for March 26 and will involve a 1-2 hour downtime for the network.</p></b>

                <p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beashear yesterday signed House Bill 701, which offers greater protections for users who self-custody their Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

To self-custody Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency means that a user has full control over the private key needed to authorize transactions.

Users who prefer that freedom also carry sole responsibility for protecting their holdings. A man in Wales has spent 12 years trying to get permission to excavate a landfill to retrieve a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin worth $696 million at today's price.

This new law will guarantee the rights of individuals to hold and manage cryptocurrencies in their self-hosted wallets.

Local governments will not be able to enact discriminatory laws that unfairly target crypto mining.

The law also clarifies that neither mining nor staking rewards are classified as securities. And operating blockchain nodes and staking will be exempt from Kentucky's money transmitter regulations.

Kentucky is also reviewing House Bill 376, which proposes the creation of a crypto reserve for the state. This would allow investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets with a market cap of $750 billion.

Other states considering Bitcoin reserves

A third of states are currently exploring crypto for public funds, with 19 states in ongoing legislative considerations.

Notably Utah passed a bill, on January 28, that will authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds to "qualifying digital assets." This is as long as they meet the main requirement of having over $500 billion in market capitalization, averaged over the past 12 months.

New Mexico is another example of Bitcoin support with Senator Anthony L. Thornton introducing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB275) on February 4, proposing a 5% allocation of public funds to Bitcoin.

At time of publishing there are 16 states actively being tracked by the Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.</p></b>

                <p>Mt. Gox transferred 11,501 Bitcoin worth approximately $1 billion on March 25.

This is the third major Bitcoin transfer by Mt. Gox this month.

Despite these large transfers, Mt. Gox still maintains about 35,000 Bitcoin worth approximately $3.1 billion.


The repayment deadline for creditors has been extended to October 31, 2025.

Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange before its collapse in early 2014 after suffering a devastating hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 Bitcoin.

Following the bankruptcy, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the proceedings.

The trustee's job includes compensating creditors with the exchange's remaining assets.


Last December, Mt. Gox also moved over 24,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $2.5 billion after Bitcoin reached the $100,000 price milestone.

One of the earlier transfers this month ended up at cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.


Data from Arkham shows that despite these large transfers, Mt. Gox still maintains about 35,000 Bitcoin worth approximately $3.1 billion.


Mt. Gox began repaying its creditors in July 2024 from its holdings, which included 142,000 Bitcoin and 143,000 Bitcoin Cash.

                <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB701) into law, protecting crypto self-custody rights.

The bill passed with unanimous support in both Kentucky’s House and Senate.


Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act passed the State House (77-15) and now heads to the Senate.

Multiple states including Arizona, Texas, and Missouri are advancing Bitcoin reserve legislation.

Kentucky has also introduced a bill to allow up to 10% of excess state reserves to be allocated to digital assets.


The new law protects several key rights for cryptocurrency users in Kentucky. It safeguards the right to use digital assets and self-custody wallets without fear of discrimination.

The legislation also bans local zoning changes that might discriminate against crypto mining. This provides certainty for mining operations in the state.

HB701 sets out guidelines for running a cryptocurrency node. It also specifically excludes crypto mining from money transmitter license requirements.


Another important aspect of the law is that it clarifies that mining and staking activities are not considered offering or selling a security. This helps protect miners and stakers from certain regulatory burdens.


The Satoshi Action Fund, a crypto advocacy group, praised the bill. They highlighted that it protects the “right to self-custody, run a node, and use of digital assets” without “fear of discrimination.”


Kentucky’s legislation mirrors similar laws already in place in other states. Oklahoma passed comparable legislation that was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt in May 2024.


Oklahoma is also moving forward with its own Bitcoin reserve legislation. The state’s House Bill 1203, known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, recently passed the State House of Representatives with a vote of 77 to 15.


The Oklahoma bill was introduced by state Representative Cody Maynard on January 15. It passed the Government Oversight Committee with a 12-2 vote on February 25.


For the Oklahoma bill to become law, it must now pass through the Senate. After that, the Oklahoma governor would need to sign it into law.


Arizona is currently in the lead in what they call the “State Bitcoin reserve race.” Arizona’s own efforts to create a Bitcoin reserve are advancing. Two strategic digital asset reserve bills cleared Arizona’s House Rules Committee on March 24.


These Arizona bills have now moved to the House floor for a full vote.</p></b>

                <p>Binance suspended a wallet team member following insider trading allegations.

The employee allegedly used non-public information from their previous BNB Chain role to make trades.

Whistleblowers identified suspicious transactions, prompting an internal investigation by Binance.

Binance received reports about suspicious trading activity on March 23.

According to Binance Wallet's statement, the suspended employee joined the team last month.

Before that, they worked in business development at BNB Chain, Binance's blockchain network.

The company claims the staff member knew about an upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) for a project.

They allegedly expected this event would create high interest among crypto traders.

Binance says the employee used multiple linked wallet addresses to buy large amounts of the project's tokens before any public announcement.

After the announcement, the employee quickly sold part of their holdings, earning them "high profits" from the price movement.

The investigation was prompted by claims circulating on social media platform X.

Several users had identified suspicious transactions and wallet addresses that pointed to possible insider trading.

Binance did not name the employee in its statement, but social media users have pointed to Freddie Ng.

One user shared transaction data showing profits of $82,400 from a token called U DEX Platform (UUU).

The wallet making these profits was linked to another wallet that had been funded by an address named "freddieng.bnb."

Transaction data shows the wallet sold holdings just minutes after the token debuted on March 23.

Binance said it has suspended the employee while it continues its investigation.

The company stated it may take further disciplinary action based on its findings.

Binance plans to work with authorities in the relevant jurisdiction and pursue legal action against the employee based on applicable laws.

As a gesture of appreciation, Binance will distribute $100,000 to four anonymous whistleblowers who contacted the company through its official reporting channels.</p></b>

                <p>Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels around $0.18-$0.19, with some analysts predicting a potential 100% price increase if these levels are broken.

Technical patterns suggest DOGE may be repeating historical bull cycles similar to 2017 and 2021.


A contradicting bear flag pattern indicates risk of a 30% decline to approximately $0.11


The Dogecoin Foundation launched an “Official Dogecoin Reserve” with a 10 million DOGE purchase ($1.8 million) to enhance stability


House of Doge aims to make transactions faster and more practical for everyday payments, with government entities showing interest in potential use cases

As of March, Dogecoin is priced at $0.1847, showing a 5.69% gain in 24 hours.


Trading volume for DOGE has surged by 123.45% to $1.58 billion over the past day.

The “World of Charts” analysis account on X (Twitter) points out that Dogecoin is testing a key resistance area.


This breakout level sits around $0.18 to $0.19. If DOGE can push through this range, it could generate strong buying momentum and potentially double in price.


Another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that Dogecoin’s current price action resembles patterns from previous bull cycles.


The analyst noted similarities to the 2017 and 2021 market movements when DOGE saw major price increases.

On March 24, 2025, Dogecoin briefly traded at $0.1887, hovering near the resistance level highlighted by crypto analysts.


Sustained momentum above this point could trigger a major price surge.


However, not all technical analysis is bullish.


A bear flag pattern on the DOGE/USD daily chart suggests a possible 30% decline in the coming weeks.

This bearish pattern formed after DOGE fell from a high of $0.214 in late 2024.


The price has since been consolidating between a descending upper trendline and lower support near $0.137.


On March 24, DOGE tested the upper trendline but closed with a red candle.


Technical Analysis

Technical indicators support this bearish outlook.


The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen from 58.71 to 47.45, showing weakening buying pressure.

A recent death cross between DOGE’s 50-day and 200-day moving averages further strengthens the bearish case.

The Dogecoin Foundation recently unveiled its “Official Dogecoin Reserve,” purchasing 10 million DOGE coins.


This initiative aims to enhance stability and attract institutional interest to the cryptocurrency.

Also known as House of Doge, this division invested $1.8 million to make Dogecoin faster and more usable for everyday transactions.

The goal is to speed up blockchain settlements and make payments more efficient for businesses and consumers.

Michael Galloro, a board member-elect at House of Doge, believes the reserve will increase Dogecoin’s appeal as a practical payment method.

Interest in Dogecoin extends beyond businesses.</p></b>

                <p>Circle Internet Financial has announced that its USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin will officially launch in Japan on March 26, 2025.

SBI VC Trade, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, received approval from the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA) to list USDC under the country's stablecoin regulatory framework.


This marks a key moment for the Japanese crypto market. USDC becomes the first global dollar stablecoin approved for use in Japan after two years of regulatory discussions.

SBI VC Trade will be the first exchange to list USDC, but expansion is already planned. Circle confirmed that Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer also plan to list and distribute USDC in the near future.


To support local operations, Circle has established Circle Japan KK. This entity will work closely with SBI Holdings through a joint venture announced in 2023.

Jeremy Allaire, Circle's co-founder and CEO, celebrated the news on social media. He stated that this development "unlocks tremendous opportunities not just in trading digital assets, but more broadly in payments, cross border finance and commerce, FX."


Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO and president of SBI Holdings, also commented on the launch. He said it would "enhance financial accessibility and drive crypto innovation" in Japan's evolving digital economy.


USDC currently maintains its position as the second largest stablecoin. It has a market cap of $59.7 billion, behind only Tether's USDT at $143.8 billion.


The stablecoin's entry into Japan could have wider market impacts. Jay Jo, a senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt that beyond trading, Japanese companies could "offer custody services and develop various stablecoin-based businesses."</p></b>

                <p>World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by President Trump, has deployed a USD-pegged stablecoin (USD1) on Ethereum and BNB Chain.

The token has approximately 3.5 million in supply on each network and shows activity with addresses linked to Wintermute and BitGo.

WLFI has stated the stablecoin is “not currently tradeable” and warned users about potential scams.

The launch coincides with the advancement of the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation in the Senate.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao highlighted the token’s deployment, triggering attention and copycat tokens.

Blockchain data shows the token, labeled as World Liberty Financial USD (USD1), was launched in early March on both Ethereum and BNB Chain networks.

The stablecoin currently has a supply of approximately 3.5 million tokens on each blockchain.

Some transfers included addresses linked to major crypto industry players.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, addresses connected to Wintermute, a large digital asset trading firm, and BitGo, a prominent crypto custodian, have interacted with the token.

WLFI quickly responded to growing public attention about the token.

The company stated in a post on X that USD1 is “not currently tradeable” and warned crypto users to be aware of potential scams attempting to capitalize on the attention.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao brought widespread notice to the token.

He welcomed the project to BNB Chain in a post shared with his 10 million followers, including a screenshot of the USD1 BscScan profile.

Zhao later noted that his post triggered a wave of copycat tokens.

These imitators were apparently trying to take advantage of the sudden attention on the World Liberty Financial stablecoin.

World Liberty Financial first made headlines last year as one of the first crypto projects with the backing of Donald Trump.

The protocol aims to create a blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools, and transact with stablecoins.

It has been known that WLFI was developing its own stablecoin.

However, until now, there had been no official communication about specific plans or timing for a public launch of the token.

The World Liberty Financial platform has completed two public token sales since its launch.

These sales have reportedly generated a combined $550 million for the company, showing strong investor interest in the Trump-backed project.

According to the project’s website, President Trump and some members of his family control 60% of the company’s equity interests.</p></b>

                <p>Cardano (ADA) is consolidating between $0.695 and $0.75 levels.

Traders remain bullish with $17M in long positions compared to $3M in short positions.

The White House Crypto Working Group's consideration for government crypto stockpile includes ADA.

Technical analysis shows a rounding-bottom pattern forming with consecutive bullish candles.

Open interest in ADA futures has increased to $785.91 million, indicating growing market participation.

Cardano (ADA) price has maintained steady ground around the $0.70 mark while many other cryptocurrencies have seen upward momentum.

The eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading in a consolidation range between $0.695 and $0.75 for some time now.

A daily candle close above $0.756 could trigger a 12% rally toward the $0.85 level according to technical analysis.

Conversely, if ADA drops below $0.69, it might fall to $0.65 in the near term.

Despite unclear price direction, market sentiment leans positive.

Data from on-chain analytics firm Coinglass shows traders have built $17 million worth of long positions compared to just $3 million in shorts.

This indicates strong bullish sentiment among market participants.

Trading volume has also picked up, with a 40% jump over 24 hours.

The increase in activity suggests heightened market interest even during the consolidation phase.

The price action reveals a short-term rounding-bottom pattern forming from the $0.70 support level.

Technical analysts have also identified a morning-star pattern that completed on Sunday with a 1.31% recovery, which is often viewed as a bullish reversal signal.

Open interest in ADA futures has climbed to $785.91 million.

The long-to-short ratio has reached a nearly neutral point at 1.0396, showing increasing bullish positions over recent days.

ADA currently faces resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe.

This technical indicator is acting as a ceiling that has so far capped upward movement.

The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 50 level.

This suggests neutrality in trend momentum as the market waits for the next significant move.</p></b>

                <p>The Pi Network's native cryptocurrency (PI) has fallen below the $1 threshold, currently trading at approximately $0.92.

The token has experienced considerable volatility since its launch, losing over 65% of its value from its all-time high of $3 reached earlier this year.

Market data shows that the token briefly touched a low of $0.911 before recovering slightly to its current price level.

Technical analysis indicates the token is struggling to maintain support above the $0.95 mark.

One of the main factors putting pressure on Pi's price has been the substantial token unlocks, but recent data suggests these unlocks have decreased from 13 million tokens daily to approximately 3.8 million.

This reduction in daily token unlocks could potentially ease selling pressure.

According to data from Pi Scan, nearly 99.3 million PI tokens are scheduled for unlock over the next 30 days.

This amount represents approximately $91 million at current prices.

The token unlock schedule shows an average of 3 million tokens will be released daily during this period.

The largest single-day unlock is set for April 3, when 6.8 million tokens will enter circulation.

Future months will see even larger unlocks, with 115.57 million tokens scheduled for April, 182 million in May, and 222 million in June.

On a more positive note, Pi Network recently announced an official partnership with PiDaoSwap, which aims to improve the network's governance process and increase transparency.

Other internal platforms, such as Pi News, have also joined this partnership.

Market analysts remain optimistic despite the current price difficulties, predicting that PI could potentially break out of its current downward trend and move toward the $2 mark in the near term.

Some analysts suggest a much higher long-term valuation, with Dr. Altcoin proposing that Pi Network's ultimate goal is to become an advanced stablecoin for peer-to-peer transactions.

Dr. Altcoin suggested the token could potentially reach values above $10 as the network matures.

Pi Network recently burned 10 million tokens, reducing the total supply to 6.77 billion, though this has not significantly impacted the price.</p></b>

                <p>Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,054 after reaching a peak of $2,104 on March 25, 2025.

Analysts predict ETH may retrace to approximately $1,900 before potentially surging to $3,000.

Strong on-chain metrics show daily volume over $10 billion and growing ETH futures open interest.

Institutional investors and whales have purchased nearly half a million ETH in recent weeks.

Key support zone exists between $1,871-$1,981, while resistance is found around $2,100-$2,150.


Ethereum’s price continues to show strength above the $2,000 level as of March 25, 2025. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $2,054, showing resilience despite a recent 3% pullback from its peak of $2,104 reached earlier the same day.

Market analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s price action for signs of where it might head next. Some experts believe ETH may experience a short-term retracement before making a significant move upward.


Trading data from CoinGlass shows two important liquidity zones that traders should watch. The first is between $2,135 and $2,106, where approximately $450 million worth of short positions would face liquidation if prices rise above this range.

The second zone lies between $1,980 and $1,833, where more than $700 million in long positions would be forced to close.


On-chain metrics for Ethereum remain strong, with daily trading volume exceeding $10 billion. This high volume indicates active market participation and healthy liquidity for the digital asset.


Futures market data also points to growing open interest in Ethereum contracts. This metric suggests more investors are taking positions in ETH derivatives, which often precedes major price movements.

The long-to-short ratio for Ethereum has reached 1.2287, with long positions now making up 55% of total contracts.


Whale activity has been increasing, with data showing nearly half a million ETH purchased by large investors in recent weeks. This accumulation by institutional investors and wealthy individuals often precedes price increases.

Another bullish indicator is the declining supply of ETH on exchanges. Over 1.2 million ETH has moved from exchange wallets into staking contracts and private wallets.


Technical analysis from crypto analyst Gert van Lagen highlights the potential formation of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart. This bullish pattern often precedes upward price movements, with a neckline near the $4,000 mark.

Another analyst, Michael van de Poppe, has identified a critical supply zone between $2,100 and $2,150. A breakout above this resistance could potentially trigger a 30% surge, pushing Ethereum toward $2,800.


For investors looking to buy Ethereum, the $1,900 area might present an opportunity if the price retraces as some analysts expect.

Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market reported a net-zero flow on March 24, marking the seventh day of balanced inflows and outflows since their launch.

The total net assets held by these ETFs now amount to $7.17 billion, representing about 2.85% of Ethereum’s market cap.


The overall outlook for Ethereum remains positive despite potential short-term volatility. With strong support levels, increasing institutional interest, and positive on-chain metrics, many market participants are expecting ETH to eventually test the $3,000 level in the coming weeks.</p></b>

                <p>XRP is trading at $2.45, showing a 2.14% increase in the last 24 hours and forming a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern.

72.28% of traders on Binance Futures hold long positions on XRP, indicating strong bullish sentiment.

Derivatives data shows surging volume (60.98% increase to $4.52 billion) and a 167.91% rise in Options volume.

The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has been dropped, removing a major bearish factor that had affected XRP since 2021.

Analysts predict potential short-term breakout to $3 and possible long-term targets up to $27, with XRP ETF approval speculation boosting investor confidence.

XRP has shown strong recovery on the price charts, trading at $2.45 with a 2.14% increase in the last 24 hours.

The critical neckline for this pattern sits at $2.45. A breakthrough above this level could open the door for a move toward $2.60 and potentially higher targets.

Currently, XRP has gained 6% over the past seven days. However, it has experienced a 2% drop on the daily chart and continues to struggle against the $2.50 barrier.

Market sentiment appears strongly positive.

Long/short ratio positions on Binance Futures reveal that 72.28% of traders hold long positions on XRP.

This means most traders believe XRP’s price will continue to rise.

Only 27.72% of traders are betting against XRP with short positions.

The derivatives market provides additional evidence of growing interest.

Trading volume for XRP has surged by 60.98%, reaching $4.52 billion.

Open interest stands at $3.97 billion.

Even more impressive is the 167.91% increase in Options volume.

These metrics suggest that market participants are actively speculating on XRP’s price movement, supporting the bullish outlook.

A major factor driving optimism is the resolution of XRP’s legal battle with the SEC.

The lawsuit, which had been ongoing since 2021, has been dropped by the SEC.

This development removes a significant bearish variable that had weighed on XRP.

Legal expert Jeremy Hogan speculated that if the victory includes nullifying previous rulings, XRP could return to the market stronger than before.

Earlier rulings had banned XRP from being sold to institutional clients and investors.

Analyst Egrag Crypto has projected that a breakout above the $3 resistance could send XRP to $6 in the short term.

His long-term prediction suggests XRP could reach as high as $27 in the coming years if conditions remain favorable.

Despite these positive signals, XRP has been moving sideways with short-term bounces.

A larger bearish divergence remains active on the 3-day chart, suggesting that significant upward momentum might face challenges in the near term.</p></b>

                <p>Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $138, up 5.87% in 24 hours but still down 20% for the month.

 

Polymarket has integrated Solana wallet deposits to lower transaction costs and improve user experience.

SOL’s trading volume increased by 130.42% to $3.33 billion with total futures at $5.25 billion (up 11.01%).

Active Solana wallets rebounded from 1 million to 3 million between March 20-23

 

Solana’s price has shown signs of recovery over the past 24 hours, currently trading at $138 with a 5.87% increase.

The uptick comes as Polymarket announced integration with Solana wallet deposits on March 24, allowing users to fund their accounts using SOL alongside the previously available USDC option.

Despite this recent price jump, SOL remains down 20% over the past month.

This indicates the market has been experiencing volatility and uncertainty in recent weeks.

Solana bounced back from a recent low of $128.49, showing some short-term strength.

However, the cryptocurrency is still struggling to break past the $140 resistance level, where sellers continue to apply downward pressure.

 

Trading volume for Solana has surged by 130.42% to $3.33 billion.

This indicates increased market activity, with more people buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Data from Coinglass reveals growing interest in Solana’s futures market.

The total money in Solana Futures has reached $5.25 billion, marking an 11.01% increase.

 

Network activity appears to be supporting the price recovery.

Over the past week, the number of active Solana wallets dropped to 1 million on March 20 before rebounding to 3 million by March 23.

New wallet creation followed a similar pattern.

After a drop around March 19-20, wallet creation has bounced back over the last few days.

 

Polymarket’s integration of Solana is designed to lower transaction costs and improve user experience.

The platform has become a leading venue for blockchain-based prediction markets.

“Starting today, you can now make deposits into your Polymarket wallet using Solana,” the company announced on March 24.

This integration positions Polymarket to scale its user base.

It could potentially introduce more users to the Solana ecosystem.

 

In the minutes following Polymarket’s integration announcement, Solana’s price spiked by nearly 7% to trade at $140.</p></b>

Beincom, the pioneering SocialFi project, has announced its upcoming 300 million BIC token airdrop.

Beincom is a next-generation social hub and community platform, powered by the friendliness of the web2 interface and the power of web3 decentralization.

At the heart of Beincom’s ecosystem is BIC Token, the utility token that fuels all activities and engagement within the platform.

The total supply of BIC Tokens is fixed at 5 billion tokens. Unlike many other projects where the core team holds a substantial share, Beincom’s core team allocation is capped at just 6% of the total supply.

Beincom has unveiled a 50-month token distribution initiative, allocating 6% of its total token supply—equivalent to 300 million BIC tokens—through a structured airdrop campaign.

Participants can earn Medals—platform-specific reward points—by contributing to the ecosystem through activities such as community engagement and content creation.

Beincom is built on Arbitrum, a leading Layer 2 scaling solution that enhances speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for blockchain transactions.

To ensure a fair launch and protect token holders, Beincom has introduced a dynamic liquidity protection model. 

BIC Token – The Economic Engine Driving Beincom Ecosystem

Beyond a transaction medium, BIC Token fuels the entire Beincom ecosystem with its diverse use cases. 

Beincom’s Vision and Roadmap: Pioneering the Future of Community Engagement

As part of its promising roadmap, Beincom will expand the utility of BIC Token, enhance NFT integrations, and introduce new monetization models that drive value for both creators and users.

Early user registration for the Beincom platform is currently open here.</p></b>

The new product comes after BlackRock debuted a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. last year, which has attracted over $50 billion in assets and become the largest spot bitcoin ETF globally.


BlackRock is giving institutional investors exposure to bitcoin's price performance in a familiar and regulated wrapper. Crypto ETPs have existed in Europe for years but lag U.S. bitcoin ETFs in assets.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP carries a management fee of 0.25%, reduced to 0.15% through a temporary fee waiver until year-end 2025.</p></b>

                <p>Back in 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocketed over 45,000%, turning early investments into life-changing wealth.

Now, the same bullish signal that sparked SHIB’s historic surge is flashing for a new under-the-radar altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently trading at just $0.015, analysts predict MUTM could soar 19,455%, reaching $3 in the next market cycle.

Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on meme hype, Mutuum Finance is a utility-driven DeFi platform.

Currently in its presale stage, this rapidly growing altcoin has already amassed almost $4.8 million, with Phase 3 progressing at $0.02.

More than 6600 investors have seized the opportunity, positioning themselves ahead of a 25% price increase in the next phase.

Over 70% of phase 3 has already been sold out and investors have less time before the phase ends.

Those joining at this stage are poised for a 200% return on investment when Mutuum Finance officially launches at $0.06.

Mutuum Finance is performing well in the decentralized finance market with its innovative dual-lending system.

Currently in its presale phase, this rising altcoin has already secured over $4.8 in funding, with more than 6600 investors joining.

The token is available at $0.02 in Phase 2, but with a 25% price increase set for the next phase, phase 3 buyers have a prime opportunity to maximize their gains.

Upon launch at $0.06, investors stand to gain a 200% return, and projections suggest a meteoric rise beyond $1 during the upcoming bull run.

As momentum builds, experts are eyeing MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi projects, with its unique lending model setting it apart from traditional competitors.

Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model system which unites Peer-to-Contract (P2C) along with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending to redefine decentralized lending operations.

Users can benefit from passive returns in P2C model liquidity pools by depositing stablecoins like USDT while borrowers use this system for efficient fund access.

Through P2P lending users establish straight deals between each other because this approach avoids using middle groups.

Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model structure which merges P2C with P2P lending activities to offer clients improved security together with enhanced efficiency and decentralization capabilities.

Users at Mutuum Finance can maintain full control over lending choices which establishes a more flexible system that supports different types of conservative and high-yield investors.

A Secure & Stable Ecosystem

Mutuum Finance launches a stablecoin on Ethereum that has complete collateral support for maintaining USD price equality.

Users must provide more value than the stablecoin value due to its resistance to volatility through over-collateralized methods which protect against any risks of liquidation.

The long-term sustainability of the platform receives strong support from this mechanism through its foundation of well-established value principles.

Full contract auditing and transparent financial structures at Mutuum Finance reinforce investor confidence thus preventing the risks which led to past issues at other DeFi lending platforms.

Strategic Tokenomics for Long-Term Success

Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics strategy is designed for sustainable growth, balancing liquidity, security, and partnerships while preventing inflation.

A structured presale and controlled token distribution create a framework for lasting value.</p></b>

                <p>Circle Internet Financial, the Boston-headquartered U.S. firm behind the USDC stablecoin, is deepening its ties to Japan's burgeoning digital assets market.

Japanese SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange operating as a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, a major internet-based financial conglomerate in the country, is expected to play a key role in Circle's commitments in Japan.

After receiving regulatory approval earlier this month, SBI VC Trade now plans to leverage USDC in Japan, marking the first token of its kind approved under Japan’s stablecoin regulatory framework.

Circle has established a Japanese entity, Circle Japan KK, to support the stablecoin's local operations. 

SBI VC Trade is set to launch USDC trading on March 26, 2025, the pair announced Monday.

Domestic exchanges Binance Japan, Bitbank, and BitFlyer also plan to list and distribute USDC in the near future, per the statement.

Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said on X that this development would unlock “tremendous opportunities” for Japan’s digital assets markets.

The approval builds on a partnership between Circle and SBI Holdings that began in 2023, combining USDC distribution with banking and Web3 technology for the Japanese market.

USDC is fully reserved and backed 100% by cash and cash-equivalent assets, with reserves held at regulated financial institutions that publish third-party monthly attestations, according to documentation from Circle.

Japanese companies could “offer custody services and develop various stablecoin-based businesses” once USDC is launched, Jay Jo, a senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt.</p></b>

                <p>Cronos (CRO) is up 30% over the last 24 hours to $0.10, CoinGecko data shows.

The daily transactions chart from CronoScan shows that transactions have more than doubled from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000.

The alliance between Trump Media and Technology Group and Crypto.com seeks to create “inventive funds” with firms that “concentrate on rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy," TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement.

TMTG also revealed that the ETFs underway would include exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and "diverse industries such as energy."

Products will launch under the "Truth.Fi" brand across U.S., European, and Asian markets, pending regulatory approval. 

The arrangement places President Trump's media company in business with a Singapore-based firm that previously faced SEC scrutiny just five months ago.

The SEC filed notice in October last year that it intended to sue Crypto.com for operating an unregistered securities exchange, allegations the company firmly rejected and countered in a lawsuit of its own.

In December, Trump transferred roughly $4 billion worth of his roughly 53% stake in TMTG through a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr., making him the company's largest shareholder of the media venture.</p></b>

                <p>Polymarket, a blockchain-based betting platform, has launched on Solana, allowing users to make deposits using the network.

The platform enables users to wager on various topics, adjusting odds dynamically based on market activity.


Current high-profile bets include the political futures of global leaders, the outcome of Canada's upcoming election, and cryptocurrency price movements.

More unconventional wagers include whether Jesus Christ will return in 2025, currently assigned a 3% probability.

Forecasted to grow to $133.59 billion by 2029 and amassing over 25 million users in 2022, the traditional market is exploding.


Polymarket has built a reputation for accurately predicting events, including the outcome of the U.S. presidential election last November.


However, the platform has also faced regulatory scrutiny.

Last year, authorities in Taiwan prosecuted an individual for using the platform to bet on the nation's presidential election, violating local gambling laws.

The platform is officially off-limits to U.S. users following a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In November 2024, the FBI raided the New York apartment of CEO Shayne Coplan, seizing his phone as part of an investigation into the platform's use by U.S. customers.


On March 8, Coplan participated in the White House Digital Roundtable, a crypto summit attended by President Trump and high-profile CEOs, founders, and investors in the industry.

Announcing the invitation on X, he praised the government's evolving stance, stating, "This admin's commitment to collaboration with American innovators is revitalizing the American dream. The future is bright."</p></b>

                <p>Raydium's native token, Ray, rose sharply on Monday, driven by the decentralized exchange's "deep liquidity," even as it faces stiff competition from the recently launched rival PumpSwap.

As the 133rd largest crypto by market capitalization, Ray is trading at about $1.95, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

It is up 25% over the past 14 days, recovering ground lost earlier this year as Pump.fun grew more popular.

Ray had dropped 7.6% over a five-minute period following last Friday’s launch of Pump.fun’s competing decentralized exchange.

The token previously fell 22% as rumors of the emerging Pump.fun competitor emerged last month.

However, Raydium’s numbers have held up relatively well.

On Sunday, the Solana-based exchange and automated market maker processed some $321.31 million worth of trading volume, a 4% decrease from the week prior, according to DefiLlama.

And on Monday, it surpassed last Monday’s trading volume for the same day a week ago.

Throughout 2024, Raydium established itself as the most popular DEX on Solana, generating $124 billion worth of trading volume by January this year amid a meme-coin-fueled market upturn.

Yet Pump.fun later solidified itself as the biggest token launchpad across all chains, becoming the fastest-growing app in crypto history toward the end of 2024.

Recently surpassing $600 million in revenue, according to Dune data.

Previously, when Pump.fun tokens completed their bonding curve and “graduated” from the platform, which currently happens at a $100,000 market cap, they would become tradable on Raydium.

At its January peak, according to Dune, Pump.fun created over 70,500 tokens with 1,168 of them graduating to Raydium.

Plus, the launchpad accounts for up to 70% of all tokens created on Solana or 55% as of March 23.

Pseudonymous core contributor for Raydium Stendhal told Decrypt that they aren’t surprised because all of Pump.fun’s previously migrated tokens have their liquidity locked on Raydium.

They also mentioned that Raydium has “deep liquidity” in tokens from “all asset classes” outside of the Solana launchpad.

Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt these figures are “reasonably accurate” and that its launch has been a “great success.”

It points to the emergence of the Morning Routine (ROUTINE) meme over the weekend as an example of the exchange at play.</p></b>

                <p>Ever since the pyramids of Egypt rose from the desert over 4,000 years ago, people have wondered how they were built—sparking centuries of speculation, fringe theories, and wild claims involving lost technologies and extraterrestrials.

That speculation got a modern boost last fall when a Chinese research team claimed to have used radar to detect plasma bubbles above the Great Pyramid of Giza. These reports reignited online theories and alternative histories.

Building on that momentum, a group known as the Khafre Project, led by Professor Corrado Malanga from Italy's University of Pisa and Researcher Filippo Biondi from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, attracted attention last week with its own dramatic claims of a vast network of underground structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre.

Accompanied by detailed graphics and viral videos, the group's assertions quickly spread across social media, breathing new life into old mysteries. X lit up with speculation, including theories that the chambers amplified Earth’s low-frequency electromagnetic waves—possibly functioning as an ancient power plant.

Some even suggested the find could rewrite our understanding of the pyramids.

Egyptologist and historian Flora Anthony wasn’t buying into the hype.

“Something seemed off, so I looked up the original source, read through it, and realized the paper had nothing to do with the images or claims being shared in the media,” she told Decrypt. “Turns out, the article isn’t peer-reviewed.”

Someone familiar with the journal where the report was published said they publish quickly and aren’t established in the field—which matters since peer review is important.

The pyramids on the Giza Plateau—built during Egypt’s Fourth Dynasty between 2600 B.C. and 2500 B.C.—were royal tombs for the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure.

The idea that extraterrestrials may have played a role in constructing the pyramids has long been a staple of fringe science and pop culture.

Proponents of this “Ancient Alien” theory point to the monuments’ precise alignment, massive scale, and engineering complexity as evidence that ancient civilizations couldn’t have built them alone.

Egyptologist Flora Anthony said: "The people behind this aren’t scientists. One is a UFO researcher who believes aliens are interdimensional parasites that hijack human souls."

Anthony added: “None of it is peer-reviewed, credible, or based in real science,” she said. “It’s not science. It’s not history.”

Ancient Aliens theory, Anthony said, is rooted in pseudo-archaeology, eugenics, and historical racism.

“These theories uphold white supremacy by pushing a false narrative of white superiority,” Anthony said.

Egyptologists, including Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, are unconvinced.

“It all sounds very improbable to me as most machinery cannot penetrate that deeply, and there is no evidence to support it,” Ikram said.</p></b>

                <p>BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has become available on Solana.

The expansion makes BUIDL available on seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum and Optimism.

The fund, officially the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, combines a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries with the settlement and transfer capabilities of blockchain.

Since its introduction on Ethereum in 2023, the fund has drawn in $1.7 billion and is on track to cross $2 billion by early April, according to Securitize.

In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain.

As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.

The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing nearly sixfold over the past year and recently crossing $5 billion in market capitalization.</p></b>

                <p>The United States government has purchased over $30 billion worth of Bitcoin, with plans to add more to its portfolio.

The Treasury Department's investment in Bitcoin is part of a broader effort to diversify the country's financial assets and reduce dependence on traditional currencies like the US dollar.


Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has been a key player in promoting Bitcoin as a viable investment option for companies and governments. He has stated that he believes Bitcoin will continue to increase in value over time.

Saylor's company, MicroStrategy, has invested heavily in Bitcoin, purchasing around 500,000 tokens with proceeds from the sale of common stock.


In recent months, Saylor's company has issued various financial products tied to its Bitcoin holdings. These products allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency.

One such product is a convertible bond offering that raised $711 million for the purchase of more Bitcoin. This bond comes with a higher coupon rate than previous offerings and does not have a common share conversion provision.


Strategy's (MicroStrategy) balance sheet has been engineered to be indestructible, meaning there is no margin call coming even if the price of Bitcoin falls significantly.

The company has eliminated any collateralized debt and liquidation risk associated with its Bitcoin assets. Strategy's goal is to continuously raise capital through a variety of financial instruments to purchase more Bitcoin.


Strategy is eyeing membership in the S&P 500, which would bring an influx of institutional investors into the company.

However, this also raises concerns about whether Strategy can continue to pay out dividends or bond maturities if markets become unfavorable.</p></b>

                <p>World Liberty Financial (WLFI) confirmed plans to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin.

The stablecoin, USD1, will be fully backed by short-term U.S. government securities, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents.

The reserves will be custodied at BitGo, while BitGo Prime will provide liquidity for the token.

The stablecoin will first be available on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with plans to expand to other networks.

WLFI is a decentralized finance protocol backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family.

WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said: "USD1 provides what algorithmic and anonymous crypto projects cannot—access to the power of DeFi underpinned by the credibility and safeguards of the most respected names in traditional finance.”

WLFI aims to provide a blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools, and transact with stablecoins.

The project made a splash last year as one of the first crypto projects backed by Trump.</p></b>

                <p>The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, has purchased over 10 million dogecoin (DOGE), worth just over $1.8 million, as part of a broader DOGE reserve strategy.

House of Doge is the Foundation’s corporate and commercialization unit, which was formed in February with a five-year deal in place. It hopes to position DOGE as a payment currency, away from its predominant existence as a memecoin, as part of a framework to show it can be used for everyday payments at very low fees.

House of Doge added it will unveil partnerships with various payment processors in the coming months.

“With a strategic reserve, the House of Doge is laying the foundation for a payments ecosystem that ensures liquidity, stability, and reliability,” said Michael Galloro, a Member of the Board-Elect of the House of Doge, in a release. “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases.”

DOGE was among the highest gains in the run-up to President Donald Trump’s election due to the possibility of its abbreviation becoming part of the administration: the “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E.

It has since seen profit-taking and a sell-off alongside the broader market, with prices down more than 30% since January, according to CoinDesk market data.</p></b>

                <p>Ripple, which utilizes XRP for cross-border transactions, said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its case against the company.

Many others shared the excitement, as the conclusion of the long-standing legal battle lifted a weight that hindered XRP's relative performance during the 2021 bull run.

That said, recent price action does not reflect the optimism, with XRP rangebound between $2.30-$2.50 and key momentum indicators flashing warnings of a major bearish shift in trend.


The first indicator signaling bearish trend reversal is the three-line break chart, which focuses only on price movements while filtering out short-term noise.

In XRP's case, a new red bar occurred early this month in the weekly time frame and has held intact following the SEC news.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line on the weekly chart, indicating strengthening downside momentum.

The indicator flipped positive in November, after which prices surged from $1 to above $3.

                <p>Stocks and crypto trading platform eToro filed to sell shares to the public for the first time on the Nasdaq, marking a renewed push for a listing after a previous attempt stalled in 2021.

Founded in 2007 by Yoni and Ronen Assia, eToro allows users to trade assets including stocks, crypto and commodities, and to copy other traders' portfolios. The company's IPO plans were revealed earlier this year through reports on a confidential filing with the SEC.

Net income jumped to $192 million in 2024, up from just $15.3 million in 2023 according to data from its recent Form F-1 filing. 

The company is looking to raise $300 million–$400 million at a valuation of $4.5 billion, Globes reported. That's below the $10.4 billion valuation it sought in 2021 during a planned merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, which was later shelved due to market conditions.

                <p>Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 7% as majors staged a relief rally on Tuesday driven by talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being more measured than initially expected.

The tariffs unsettled markets in February, shocking stocks and cryptocurrencies alike with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 17.6% to below $80,000 from its January peak.

Last week, the Federal Reserve raised inflation forecasts and lowered growth projections, likely due to Trump's trade stance, but described the tariff-driven inflation as temporary while maintaining plans for two rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets.

This, along with the possibility of milder tariffs, has boosted market optimism, and memecoins are leading the charge. DOGE, pepecoin (PEPE), mog (MOG), floki (FLOKI), among others, are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with the meme sector up 5.6% on average.

Memecoins jump or act as beta bets when ether (ETH) or bitcoin rise because they’re highly speculative assets with amplified sensitivity to broader crypto market trends.

Retail traders often see relief in majors as a signal of bullish sentiment across the crypto ecosystem — chasing higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities like memecoins, which are typically cheaper and can deliver rapid gains in relatively shorter periods.

AI Tokens Remain Stable Despite ‘Bubble’ Talk

Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence (AI) majors are stable after Alibaba’s Joe Tsai said he sees sign of a bubble forming in the ecosystem. The category is up 4.5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Investment in AI appears to be occurring ahead of current demand, Tsai believes.

NEAR protocol, the largest AI token by market cap, is flat in trading today, but up 14% in the last week as the market continues to positively digest news that Coinbase and the biggest names in AI were working together to collaboratively develop AI agent technology.</p></b>

                <p>Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, said it "offboarded" a market maker for Movement's MOVE token.

Market makers are middlemen who create liquidity so trades can take place smoothly without big delays or price swings, quoting prices to both buyers and sellers and taking the opposite side of transactions.

The market maker made a $38 million profit when the MOVE tokens were first offered for trading on the exchange, but instead of meeting its obligations, it placed sell orders for 66 million MOVE tokens one day after the initial listing and "little buy orders".

One-sided market-making activity is widely considered illicit and illegal, and Binance reiterated that strict rules are in place for defaulters.

The entity was offboarded on March 18, and both the Movement Labs and Movement Foundation teams were informed of the “irregularities with their market maker,” Binance said in a post.

All proceeds were frozen to compensate users, whose details will be available at a later date.</p></b>

                <p>For years, crypto has positioned itself as the next great technological revolution. However, with the explosive rise of AI, it's time to face the truth: the true technological revolution of our era is artificial intelligence.

This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin and operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI.

The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included.

With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability.

This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets. Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit, and they remain crypto’s truest demonstration of real tangible value to date.

As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity.

Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer.

Otherwise, there's AI. There's TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There's open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. 

There’s also open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI.

In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications.

This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.

While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world.

A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility.

While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation.</p></b>

                <p>CoreSky has raised $15 million in Series A funding to accelerate its platform development.

The funding was led by Tido Capital with participation from WAGMI Ventures, CoPilot Ventures Studio, Web3vision, and Parallel Ventures.

This brings the company's total backing to $21 million.

CoreSky's platform enables user voting to gauge public opinion in the early stages of a meme token's development.

Memecoins have experienced a significant surge in popularity in the last year, becoming a notable phenomenon in the cryptocurrency market.

Their rise is attributed to several factors, including high-profile endorsements, political developments, and the increasing influence of internet culture on financial markets.

Despite challenges presented by scams and rug pulls, the enthusiasm for memecoins persists.

For many observers, they represent the community aspect of the cryptocurrency market, as well as the blending of internet culture with financial innovation.</p></b>

                <p>More than 139,000 BTC option contracts, worth $12.13 billion, representing nearly 45% of the total active BTC contracts across all expiries, are due for settlement this Friday.

Deribit Metrics show that more than 65% of the total open interest is concentrated in call options that provide buyers with an asymmetric bullish exposure, while the rest is in put options offering downside protection.

Quarterly expiries of such massive magnitudes are known to breed market volatility, but that may not be the case this time, going by the continued decline in the bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (DVOL).

The DVOL has dropped from an annualized 62% to 48% in the weeks leading up to the expiry, suggesting subdued volatility expectations.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the annualized perpetual futures basis of around 5% on the exchange, signalling a calmer funding environment.

"Despite the size of the expiry, the overall setup—low DVOL, moderate basis, and balanced options positioning—points to a relatively subdued expiry unless external catalysts emerge," Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

Options skew, which measures the difference between implied volatility (pricing) for calls relative to puts, shows downside concerns in the lead-up to Friday's expiry.

Also expiring Friday are ether (ETH) options worth $2.8 billion.</p></b>

                <p>Decentralized lending platform Abracadabra.Finance suffered an attack that drained $13 million worth of cryptocurrency from pools tied to GMX liquidity tokens.

Blockchain security firm PeckShield flagged that contracts involving decentralized exchange GMX and Abracadabra were compromised, leading to the theft of 6,260 ETH, worth around $12.98 million at the time of writing.

GMX distanced itself from the incident. In a post on X, an account associated with the exchange said that GMX’s contracts themselves were unaffected. The team later said the breach was “solely related to the Abracadabra/Spell cauldrons,” which used GM tokens as collateral but did not involve GMX’s core infrastructure.

In a statement on X, Abracadabra confirmed the exploit and said core contributors and engineers were investigating the incident to its “fully audited” cauldron. The protocol noted that gmCauldrons had been audited by Guardian Audits — the same firm that audited GMX contracts — and were part of a broader security infrastructure involving monitoring and response tools.

Abracadabra is working with Guardian and GMX as well as other security partners in assessing the extent of the damage and how the attack was executed. A full post-mortem will follow once the investigation concludes, and no user collateral was affected, it said.

Last year Abracadabra.Finance suffered a $6.49 million exploit that caused its Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin to lose its peg to the U.S. dollar.</p></b>

                <p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is among the biggest drivers of value accrual and revenue creation for crypto projects, but its complexity often leaves users tangled in a web of blockchains, bridges, wallets and tokens.

However, a technical update by Hyperliquid is making that process easier for both developers and users, with the direct linking of tokens on HyperCore and HyperEVM platforms now being possible.

HyperCore is its native platform for spot assets (think tokens you can trade directly), and HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network that executes smart contracts on Ethereum.

Tokens on HyperCore, dubbed “Core spot,” can be linked to their counterparts on HyperEVM and are called “EVM spot.” Once linked, users can transfer them using simple actions — like a “spotSend” on HyperCore or a standard ERC-20 transfer on HyperEVM.

Linking a core spot token to an EVM spot token isn’t automatic. The process starts with the token’s “spot deployer,” or the entity behind it, which ensures the token’s supply matches up on both sides of the transaction.

Then, they send a “spot deploy action” to HyperCore, proposing an ERC-20 contract on HyperEVM to pair with their token.

Next comes verification. If the EVM contract was deployed directly by an individual, they confirm it with a specific transaction nonce (a unique number assigned to each transfer on a blockchain).

If it was deployed by another contract (say, a multisig for added security), the contract’s first storage slot must point to the HyperCore deployer’s address. Finally, a “finalize” action locks it all in place — ensuring both sides agree on the link.

Allowing linking lets users tap into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem — such as lending, borrowing, and trading — without leaving the Hyperliquid ecosystem entirely.

Take Ethereum as an example, with billions locked in protocols like Aave or Uniswap. But if someone wants to send a token from another network, say Solana, they need a bridge — a third-party service that locks your tokens on one side and mints a wrapped version on the other.

That comes with a security risk, as bridges remain one of the most exploited blockchain-based services in recent years.

Hyperliquid’s approach is different from just bolting on a bridge. HyperCore is a high-speed, purpose-built platform for spot trading, while HyperEVM is an EVM-compatible layer that taps into Ethereum’s DeFi toolkit.

By letting tokens move directly between them — without a third-party intermediary — developers can create products that cut out the technical chops required to move assets (which is easy for heavy crypto users, but may be challenging for beginners).

Tokens like HYPE, HyperEVM’s gas token, don’t need a separate ERC20 contract to work on both sides. Send HYPE from HyperCore, and it lands as native gas on HyperEVM. Send it back to HyperCore via a system address (0x222), and it’s credited instantly based on an event log.

It’s not perfect just yet; however, Hyperliquid warned in its technical documents that risks of unverified contracts or supply mismatches exist as of Tuesday.</p></b>

                <p>Fidelity Investments seeks to create a quoted bottom (ETF) fund that tracks the price of Solana (Sol), according to a 19B-4 request published by CBOE Exchange.

 

The firm, a 5 billion Wall Street veteran, has registered a Fidelity Solana fund in Delaware last Thursday. The company had not yet submitted an S-1 statement, necessary for companies seeking to issue new shares and trade on a public stock exchange.

 

Solana is currently the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a value of 74 billion dollars. Several asset managers have submitted applications to the SEC to launch funds that incorporate Solana's token, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Vaneck.

 

Two ETFs tracking Solana futures, Solz and Solt, were listed on the Nasdaq market last week, a significant step towards achieving approval for a cash-settled product.

                <p>The Actions and Crypto Etoro platform submitted applications to sell shares to the public for the first time at the NASDAQ.

The company, based in BNEI Brak, Israel, said its income was more than tripled last year, reaching US $ 12.6 billion.

Most of the cryptocurrency trade's income increased to US $ 12.1 billion in 2024, compared to US $ 3.4 billion in 2023.

Founded in 2007 by Yoni and Ronen Assia, Etoro allows users to operate with assets such as actions, crypt and raw materials, in addition to copying the portfolios of other operators.

The company's net income increased to US $ 192 million in 2024, compared to US $ 15.3 million in 2023.

The company seeks to raise between US $ 300 million and US $ 400 million with an assessment of approximately US $ 4.5 billion.

This figure is below the valuation of US $ 10.4 billion that Etoro sought in 2021 during a planned fusion with an acquisition company with special purpose (SPAC).

The offer will be led by important subscriber banks, including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS and Citigroup.

The company has requested to quote under the "ETOR" symbol.

Etoro's plans for its IPO were revealed earlier this year through reports on a confidential presentation before the SEC.</p></b>

                <p>BlackRock, the global asset manager behind the largest U.S. spot bitcoin ETF, listed a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe on Tuesday.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on Xetra and Euronext in Paris under the ticker IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN.


The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is by far the largest of the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., with net assets worth over $50 billion and cumulative net inflows of just under $40 billion, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. An equivalent product listed in Canada in January.

Coinbase will provide custody for BlackRock's European product, and the fee for the European ETP is temporarily reduced by 10 basis points to 0.15% until the end of 2025.

BlackRock's ETP introduction was reported earlier by Bloomberg.</p></b>

                <p>Fidelity Investments is looking to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of Solana (SOL), a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday shows.

Cboe Exchange uploaded a 19b-4 filing to list a Solana ETF proposed by Fidelity. This comes after the firm registered a Fidelity Solana Fund in Delaware last Thursday.

Fidelity has previously issued two spot crypto ETFs: the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). Both launched last year. FBTC has attracted nearly $17 billion in assets — or bitcoin — and FETH handles roughly $975 million.

Many of Fidelity’s clients are interested in owning cryptocurrencies and a large portion already does. The firm has been working on its digital asset ecosystem since 2014.

Several asset managers have filed applications with the SEC to launch funds holding the token, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and VanEck.</p></b>
