Ripple agreed to a settlement with the SEC, paying a $50M fine.

The SEC will request lifting of the injunction that required Ripple to register future securities.


Ripple and the SEC reached a settlement today, with Ripple agreeing to pay a reduced fine of $50 million — down from the original $125 million penalty imposed in the landmark crypto case — according to a tweet by Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty.

The final crossing of t's and dotting of i's – and what should be my last update on SEC v Ripple ever… Last week, the SEC agreed to drop its appeal without conditions. @Ripple has now agreed to drop its cross-appeal. The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine (already in an... 


Both parties have agreed to drop their respective appeals in the case that began in 2020.

The original lawsuit centered on allegations that Ripple conducted unregistered securities offerings through its XRP sales, leading to legal proceedings that lasted nearly four years.


The settlement marks the conclusion of one of the most closely watched cases in the crypto industry once the Commission votes and court documents are finalized.

The conclusion of this case also opens the door for potential XRP ETFs, with several issuers having submitted applications in recent months.

The SEC's decision to settle aligns with recent trends under the current administration, which has seen the agency drop several enforcement actions against crypto companies.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

GameStop is set to report Q4 earnings when the market closes at 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday.

 Analysts expect the Texas-based firm to disclose an earnings per share mark of $0.08, based on two analyst ratings compiled by FactSet.

GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending the video game retailer become a “premier Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector” by converting its cash reserves into Bitcoin.


Last month, GameStop Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen acknowledged Strive's proposal on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Letter received,” he said, without elaborating further.

Several companies in the U.S. have embraced Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, but the practice was pioneered by Strategy.

Before acknowledging Strive’s proposal last month, Cohen posed alongside Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a photo he posted to X.

Cohen has stockpiled cash at the video game retailer since stepping into the role nearly a year and a half ago. 

He was first named the company’s executive chairman after Matt Furlong, who tried unsuccessfully to launch NFT collectibles, was terminated.

As of Nov. 2, GameStop held $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $900 million a year prior, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The company's stock price jumped last month after people familiar with the matter told CNBC that the company was considering buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

GameStop did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

XRP investors have plenty to celebrate as Ripple’s recent victory over the SEC provides a strong foundation for an upcoming rally.

After surging to $2.57 in the wake of this landmark win, XRP remains stable around the $2.4 mark, with market analysts now eyeing a potential $5 target.

XRP has performed impressively, climbing nearly 1% over the past week despite wider crypto volatility. Although recent gains briefly pushed the token toward $2.57, the price faced resistance and consolidated around current levels.

Bitcoin Momentum Could Ignite XRP Rally

Another positive catalyst for XRP is Bitcoin’s current market position. BTC is testing crucial resistance levels, and a confirmed breakout could inject significant momentum into XRP and other major altcoins.

XRPTurbo: The Next Big Thing on XRP Ledger?

XRPTurbo ($XRT) is a revolutionary launchpad being built specifically to turbocharge decentralized finance (DeFi) on the XRP blockchain. Within just weeks of launching its presale, XRPTurbo has become one of the most talked-about opportunities in crypto.

Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Is Becoming the Go-To Alternative in March</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 14:30:52 <p>
The cryptocurrency market continues to shift as new projects challenge established digital assets. Ripple (XRP) has long been a dominant force in blockchain-based financial transactions.

However, recent developments suggest that investors are exploring alternatives. Rexas Finance (RXS) is gaining momentum as a strong contender in the growing tokenized asset sector.

Ripple (XRP) has struggled to maintain upward momentum despite positive news, including an executive order from the U.S. government supporting digital asset reserves. The price of XRP is currently trading around $2.50, marking a 1.8% decline over the past 24 hours.

Trading volume has also decreased by 7.5%, signaling lower investor enthusiasm. Technical analysis indicates that XRP is facing resistance between $2.65 and $2.80.

Analysts have pointed to bearish divergence signals, where price increases are not matched by momentum indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 55, indicating weakening bullish momentum.

If XRP fails to break past resistance, it may continue trading sideways or decline toward the $2.25 support level. A further drop below this level could push the price toward $2.00.

Despite these price challenges, whale accumulation has increased. Wallets holding 100 million to 1 billion XRP have added over 2 billion tokens in the past week.

Additionally, 99 million XRP was withdrawn from exchanges at an average price of $2.30, a 94.12% increase from the previous day. Market analysts suggest that this could indicate long-term confidence in the asset.

Rexas Finance (RXS) is gaining momentum as a strong contender in the growing tokenized asset sector. Rexas Finance specialises in the creation of RWAs, through which it provides opportunities to purchase shares in real estate, commodities, and intellectual property.

It enhances market liquidity while allowing entry to what were hitherto closed off individual clients. The initiative has received interest from retail and institutional investors interested in blockchain-enabled asset ownership.

Rexas Finance ecosystem encompasses various components that focus on improving the products' tokenization and sales within the financial markets. Rexas Token Builder is a software that allows anyone to issue tokens linked to physical assets they own.

Rexas Launchpad is an efficient solution to allow new blockchain projects to sell tokens securely. Trading and Integrated Financial System Rexas Finance also provides decentralized finance (DeFi) services for trading tokenized assets across various blockchains.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311486/berachain-jumps-proof-of-liquidity-rewards'>Berachain Jumps 14% as Proof of Liquidity Rewards Go Live</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 14:28:10 <p>
Berachain, a bear-themed layer-1 blockchain, went live with rewards for its proof of liquidity consensus mechanism on Monday.

A day after the launch, the BERA token has gained 14%, according to CoinGecko, and broken into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Proof of liquidity is a variation of the proof of stake consensus mechanism used on Ethereum. It uses two tokens in BERA for gas and network security as well as BGT for governance and rewards.

Validators stake BERA so they can propose blocks and earn rewards in BGT, which then get distributed to reward vaults.

For supplying the liquidity, validators are provided with a receipt token which can also be staked into reward vaults—thus creating aligned incentives to secure the network via staking.

This feature went live on Monday, opening 37 reward vaults and starting the distribution of BGT across the ecosystem.

BGT, the governance token, can be used to vote on proposals.

Later this week, a second batch of reward vault whitelist requests will be voted on. 

The first batch were selected based on “economic value, security, and alignment with Berachain’s ecosystem.”

Clearly, the market reacted well to the news as the BERA token climbed 14% on the day and 30% on the week, according to CoinGecko data.

That pushed the token as high as $8.03 earlier this morning.

As of this writing, BERA is changing hands for $7.89 and still the 100th largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $858 million.

“This marks a major step in Berachain’s governance evolution,” pseudonymous Berachain founder Homme Bera wrote in a blog post.

Berachain launched its mainnet in February, airdropping $1.17 billion worth of BERA tokens to users who participated in its pre-launch initiatives.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

DFZ Labs, the creators of the Ethereum NFT project Deadfellaz, will launch a new asset verification tool called Coldlink.

Coldlink enables blockchain users to connect their blockchain address to any asset in Web2, Web3, or real life without incurring the security risk of blind signing or smart contract approvals.


“To ‘Coldlink’ something is to connect any digital asset safely to anything else without granting permissions to the wallet holding the asset,” said Betty, pseudonymous CEO of DFZ Labs.

The solution has been in the works since 2022 when DFZ Labs began seeking a way for its community to safely and securely gain access to gaming developments without putting their assets at risk.


With Coldlink, users will be able to unlock a variety of new blockchain and real-world connections. For example, they could connect a blockchain address to a PO box in order to receive a physical item without revealing their identity.

Coldlink uses unique transaction markers paired with database entries to link the assets.


Coldlink verification essentially works by pairing a serialized unique tracer transaction with a serialized unique database entry for each Coldlink submission,” said Betty.


The technology has been feasible for a long time–but DFZ labs is the first to handle it in this particular way. Coldlink is especially useful for participants of communities with rare or expensive digital items—like CryptoPunks.

“You can immediately activate communities that have so far been unable to casually participate in anything that requires digital ownership," said Betty. "This is especially useful if you own rare or expensive items such as Punks.”


Coldlink will start with a public load test that allows anyone with a Solana or Ethereum address to create links to another Solana or Ethereum address at Coldlink.xyz. New blockchains, applications, and link types are expected to be rolled out and unveiled weekly.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Whale.io has announced plans to migrate its Whale NFT collection from the TON blockchain to the Solana blockchain.

The cross-chain transition aims to expand the project's interoperability and accessibility by leveraging Solana's infrastructure.

The Whale NFT collection was initially launched on the TON blockchain, where all 20,000 NFTs were minted at no cost within hours of release.

The rapid minting reflected strong early engagement from the community. 

Over the following year, the collection became one of the most visible projects on Getgems, TON's leading NFT marketplace.

According to platform data, the floor price increased approximately sevenfold during this period.


Hosted on Getgems.io (collection available here), Whale NFTs quickly became a cultural phenomenon within the TON ecosystem.

With eye-catching designs and varying rarities, Whale.io's collectibles became popular display pictures across Telegram.

The team has continued to deliver value, innovation, and utility to keep the project thriving.


In addition, Whale NFTs have been available for trading with zero gas fees on supported platforms, a feature that has contributed to repeated appearances on trending lists within Getgems.

With the upcoming transition to Solana—known for its high throughput and low transaction costs—the collection is expected to remain active across major NFT marketplaces within the Solana ecosystem.


Whale NFTs aren't just pretty pictures—they're powerhouses of utility, deeply integrated into the Whale ecosystem.

At the heart of this is the Wheel of Whales miniapp on Telegram, a play-to-earn sensation that's taking the crypto gaming world by storm.

Bitcoin has achieved its best weekly performance in over two months, climbing 4.24% to $88,804.

Analyst Axel Adler Jr. predicts Bitcoin could reach $130,000 within 90 days, based on onchain metrics.

A major Bitcoin whale purchased 2,400 BTC worth $200 million on March 24, 2025.

Another whale that had been inactive since 2017 moved 3,000 BTC valued at $250 million.


Bitcoin has recently shown strong market performance, climbing 4.24% to reach an intra-day high of $88,804. This marks Bitcoin’s best weekly performance in over two months. The cryptocurrency has reclaimed a bullish stance on the charts, closing above the daily chart’s 200-day exponential moving average.

With a weekly close above $84,600, experts suggest that Bitcoin has an increased likelihood of testing the $90,000 mark soon.


Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. views the current price action as healthy consolidation rather than the beginning of a bear market. According to Adler’s analysis of onchain metrics, Bitcoin has not yet entered “overheated” territory in this cycle.

Adler further supports his bullish outlook using Bitcoin’s cumulative value days destroyed (CVDD) metric.


Recent data shows Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) jumped by over $1.5 billion in a 24-hour period. Open interest represents the total value of outstanding futures contracts in the market.

The funding rate, which reflects the cost of holding leveraged positions, has stayed near neutral. This suggests that neither bullish (long) nor bearish (short) traders are dominantly in control of the market at present.


Short-Term Correction Likely Before $90K

Bitcoin experienced a surge in upward momentum late on Sunday, March 23rd. Weekend price rallies often occur with lower trading volume, as larger market participants tend to step back until the start of the week.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin registered a new high at $88,750 over the previous week’s top.


Cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has also noted Bitcoin’s solid upward trend. Van de Poppe expects this trend to continue toward the $90,000 mark in the coming days.


At a specific time on March 25, 2025, Bitcoin’s price reached $82,500, marking a 5% increase from its opening price of $78,500 earlier that day.

This upward movement came with a large trading volume of approximately 30,000 BTC traded within an hour.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

World Liberty Financial (WLFI) added 3.54 million Mantle (MNT) to its cryptocurrency holdings on March 23, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence.

The entity’s wallet also holds ETH, TRON, AVAX, and MOVE, among others.

It currently holds eleven digital assets in its wallet, including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), MOVE (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), Sei (SEI), Avalanche (AVAX), and MNT.

The latest MNT purchase brings WLFI’s total holdings to 5.99 million MNT, worth over $5 million at current market prices.

Last week, the DeFi project acquired 2.45 million MNT tokens and 103,911 AVAX tokens.

WLFI is diversifying its crypto holdings across various blockchain projects to mitigate market volatility.

The project also wants to invest in innovative DeFi projects to support the development of DeFi and capitalize on business opportunities.

Lookonchain data reveals ETH as the dominant asset in WLFI’s portfolio, valued at approximately $134 million, followed by $69.5 million in WBTC.

WLFI’s team’s ETH holdings incurred the heaviest unrealized losses, totaling $85 million at press time.

The total portfolio losses have surpassed $111 million.

MNT and AVAX, the most recently added cryptocurrencies, are the only holdings reporting unrealized profits, with a combined gain of over $113,800.

WLFI formed a strategic collaboration with Sui, the prominent Layer-1 blockchain.

The move focuses on integrating Sui’s technology and assets into WLFI’s ecosystem while exploring opportunities to build next-gen blockchain applications, specifically targeting decentralized finance (DeFi).

As part of the partnership, the project will soon add Sui tokens to its “Macro Strategy” reserve.

WLFI has established relationships with blockchain protocols and institutions, including Ondo Finance, Ethena, Chainlink, and Aave.

World Liberty Financial announced on March 17 that it had successfully raised $550 million from two sets of token sales.

The first set sold $300 million of WLFI tokens, and the second set sold $250 million.

Over 85,000 participants completed the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) process to verify their eligibility.

WLFI faced challenges in meeting its original target due to technical issues, regulatory restrictions, and low investor confidence.

The project once retargeted its goal from $300 million to $30 million, a 90% reduction.

Following Donald Trump’s election win and the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token, sales started to surge.

In January, WLFI announced the issuance of an additional 5 billion tokens due to increased investor demand.

These tokens were sold at an increased price of $0.05, up from $0.015.

The WLFI token serves as the platform’s governance token.

It allows holders to vote on important decisions related to the platform’s development and operations.

WLFI is based on the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of DeFi applications.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Vilnius, Lithuania, March 25th, 2025.

For the first time, the ICTC will be a live-streamed global crypto trading championship, with the top 8 traders facing off in real time for the top rankings.

WhiteBIT, the largest European cryptocurrency exchange by traffic and the official cryptocurrency partner of FC Barcelona, is proud to announce the first-ever International Crypto Trading Cup (ICTC)—the first live-streamed trading championship that brings crypto trading to the stage.

Crypto stocks soared on Monday with Strategy (MSTR) up 10%, Coinbase up 7%, and mining companies like CleanSpark up 18%.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) announced surpassing 500,000 Bitcoin in holdings, valued at $44.2 billion.

Bitcoin traded at around $87,350, up 2.2% in 24 hours, while Ethereum and Solana rose 4% and 6% respectively.

The rally came as the White House hinted at easing its position on trade tariffs against major trading partners.

Strategy trades under the ticker symbol ‘MSTR’. The software company made headlines by announcing it had crossed a major milestone. It now holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin in its treasury.

This makes it the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Strategy’s current Bitcoin holdings amount to 506,137 coins. At current market rates, this translates to approximately $44.2 billion in value.

Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, also benefited from the market upswing. Its stock rose by 7% on Monday afternoon Eastern Time. Shares were trading at $203.

Public Bitcoin mining companies weren’t left out of the rally. Low-carbon miner CleanSpark (CLSK) saw an impressive 18% increase. 

Its stock reached $8.79 during Monday trading. Other mining companies performed well too. Riot Platforms (RIOT) jumped nearly 10% to $9.69 per share.

MARA Holdings (MARA) climbed 18% to reach $14.61 per share.

The broader U.S. stock market also traded higher on Monday. This followed reports that the Trump administration might narrow the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was trading at approximately $87,350. 

This represented a 2.2% increase over the previous 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Other major cryptocurrencies also performed well.

Ethereum saw gains of more than 4% during the same period. Solana performed even better with a 6% price increase.

These gains contributed to the overall positive sentiment in crypto markets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cronos (CRO) price surged 30-55% following a partnership announcement between Trump Media and Crypto.com to develop ETFs.

The proposed ETFs will offer exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and “diverse industries such as energy” under the “Truth.Fi” brand.

Trading volume for CRO increased nearly six times from $21 million to $126 million.

The rally coincides with an upcoming Cronos zkEVM mainnet upgrade scheduled for March 26.

Daily transactions more than doubled from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000 according to CronoScan.


Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com, has seen its price jump over 30% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.10 according to CoinGecko data.

This surge follows an announcement that Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has signed a non-binding agreement to partner with Crypto.com in developing exchange-traded funds (ETFs).


The partnership aims to create “inventive funds” that will focus on “rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy,” according to TMTG CEO Devin Nunes.

These ETFs will provide exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and other industries including energy.


Products from this partnership will launch under the “Truth.Fi” brand.

The ETFs will target markets across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, pending regulatory approval in each region.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/311466/kentucky-bitcoin-ethereum-self-custody-law'>Kentucky Passes Bitcoin and Ethereum Self-Custody Law</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 10:28:18 <p>
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beashear yesterday signed House Bill 701, which offers greater protections for users who self-custody their Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

To self-custody Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency means that a user has full control over the private key needed to authorize transactions. It's more like having cash in a wallet than using a debit card to authorize your bank to send someone money.

Users who prefer that freedom also carry sole responsibility for protecting their holdings. A man in Wales has spent 12 years trying to get permission to excavate a landfill to retrieve a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin worth $696 million at today's price.

This new law will guarantee the rights of individuals to hold and manage cryptocurrencies in their self-hosted wallets. This should mean those in Kentucky can gain total control over their cryptocurrency, without any issues of interference.

As such, this means local governments will not be able to enact discriminatory laws that unfairly target crypto mining. The law also clarifies that neither mining nor staking rewards are classified as securities. And operating blockchain nodes and staking will be exempt from Kentucky's money transmitter regulations.

Kentucky is also reviewing House Bill 376, which proposes the creation of a crypto reserve for the state. This would allow investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets with a market cap of $750 billion.

Other states considering Bitcoin reserves 

Utah passed a bill, on January 28, that will authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds to "qualifying digital assets." This is as long as they meet the main requirement of having over $500 billion in market capitalization, averaged over the past 12 months.

New Mexico is another example of Bitcoin support with Senator Anthony L. Thornton introducing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB275) on February 4, proposing a 5% allocation of public funds to Bitcoin.

At time of publishing there are 16 states actively being tracked by the Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Mt. Gox transferred 11,501 Bitcoin worth approximately $1 billion on March 25.

This is the third major Bitcoin transfer by Mt. Gox this month. Mt. Gox still holds about 35,000 Bitcoin worth $3.1 billion.

Some transfers ended up at crypto exchange Bitstamp.

The repayment deadline for creditors has been extended to October 31, 2025.

Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange. Before its collapse, it handled between 70-80% of all Bitcoin trades globally. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in early 2014 after suffering a devastating hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 Bitcoin.


Following the bankruptcy, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the proceedings. The trustee’s job includes compensating creditors with the exchange’s remaining assets.

In October 2024, the trustee extended the deadline for repayments by a full year. The new deadline is October 31, 2025.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB701) into law, protecting crypto self-custody rights.

The bill passed with unanimous support in both Kentucky’s House and Senate.

Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act passed the State House (77-15) and now heads to the Senate.

Multiple states including Arizona, Texas, and Missouri are advancing Bitcoin reserve legislation.

Kentucky has also introduced a bill to allow up to 10% of excess state reserves to be allocated to digital assets.


The new law protects several key rights for cryptocurrency users in Kentucky. It safeguards the right to use digital assets and self-custody wallets without fear of discrimination.

The legislation also bans local zoning changes that might discriminate against crypto mining. This provides certainty for mining operations in the state.

HB701 sets out guidelines for running a cryptocurrency node. It also specifically excludes crypto mining from money transmitter license requirements.


The Satoshi Action Fund, a crypto advocacy group, praised the bill. They highlighted that it protects the “right to self-custody, run a node, and use of digital assets” without “fear of discrimination.”

Oklahoma is also moving forward with its own Bitcoin reserve legislation. The state’s House Bill 1203, known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, recently passed the State House of Representatives with a vote of 77 to 15.

The Oklahoma bill was introduced by state Representative Cody Maynard on January 15. It passed the Government Oversight Committee with a 12-2 vote on February 25.


For the Oklahoma bill to become law, it must now pass through the Senate. After that, the Oklahoma governor would need to sign it into law.

Oklahoma has other crypto-friendly legislation in the works as well. State Senator Dusty Deevers filed a bill on January 8 that would allow residents to receive their salaries in Bitcoin.


Arizona’s own efforts to create a Bitcoin reserve are advancing. Two strategic digital asset reserve bills cleared Arizona’s House Rules Committee on March 24.

These Arizona bills have now moved to the House floor for a full vote. This puts Arizona at the forefront of states looking to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.


Missouri is also evaluating a Bitcoin reserve bill. Their Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs is currently reviewing the proposed legislation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Binance suspended a wallet team member following insider trading allegations.

The employee allegedly used non-public information from their previous BNB Chain role to make trades.

Whistleblowers identified suspicious transactions, prompting an internal investigation by Binance.

Binance received reports about suspicious trading activity on March 23 and launched an investigation.

According to Binance Wallet's statement, the suspended employee joined the team last month.

Before that, they worked in business development at BNB Chain, Binance's blockchain network.

The company claims the staff member knew about an upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) for a project.

They allegedly used multiple linked wallet addresses to buy large amounts of the project's tokens before any public announcement.

After the announcement, the employee quickly sold part of their holdings and earned "high profits" from the price movement.

The investigation was prompted by claims circulating on social media platform X.

Several users had identified suspicious transactions and wallet addresses that pointed to possible insider trading.

While Binance did not name the employee in its statement, social media users have pointed to Freddie Ng as a potential suspect.

Transaction data shows profits of $82,400 from a token called U DEX Platform (UUU) made by a wallet linked to another wallet funded by an address named "freddieng.bnb."

This address had been shared on Ng's X account in the past.

The exchange said it has suspended the employee while it continues its investigation and may take further disciplinary action based on its findings.

Binance will pursue legal action against the employee based on applicable laws and work with authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.

As a gesture of appreciation, Binance will distribute $100,000 to four anonymous whistleblowers who contacted the company through its official reporting channels.

The company emphasized that no other Wallet team employees were involved in insider trading.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dogecoin is priced at $0.1847, showing a 5.69% gain in 24 hours.

It currently ranks as the 8th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $27.44 billion.

Trading volume for DOGE has surged by 123.45% to $1.58 billion over the past day.

The "World of Charts" analysis account on X (Twitter) points out that Dogecoin is testing a key resistance area.

The cryptocurrency is attempting to break above a downward trendline that has acted as resistance for several months.

This breakout level sits around $0.18 to $0.19.

If DOGE can push through this range, it could generate strong buying momentum and potentially double in price.

Another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that Dogecoin's current price action resembles patterns from previous bull cycles.

The analyst noted similarities to the 2017 and 2021 market movements when DOGE saw major price increases.

On March 24, 2025, Dogecoin briefly traded at $0.1887, hovering near the resistance level highlighted by crypto analysts.

A bear flag pattern on the DOGE/USD daily chart suggests a possible 30% decline in the coming weeks.

This bearish pattern formed after DOGE fell from a high of $0.214 in late 2024.

The Dogecoin Foundation recently unveiled its "Official Dogecoin Reserve," purchasing 10 million DOGE coins.

This initiative aims to enhance stability and attract institutional interest to the cryptocurrency.

House of Doge, also known as the Dogecoin Foundation, has invested $1.8 million to make Dogecoin faster and more usable for everyday transactions.

The goal is to speed up blockchain settlements and make payments more efficient for businesses and consumers.

Michael Galloro, a board member-elect at House of Doge, believes the reserve will increase Dogecoin's appeal as a practical payment method.

Unlike Bitcoin's fixed supply, Dogecoin's inflationary model makes it well-suited for daily transactions.

To encourage adoption, House of Doge is planning cashback incentives and merchant partnerships.

Interest in Dogecoin extends beyond businesses, with the Dogecoin Foundation reportedly having discussions with US government representatives about using DOGE for everyday payments like city parking and utility bills.

Three Dogecoin-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are currently awaiting review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Circle's USDC stablecoin will launch on Japan's SBI VC Trade exchange on March 26, 2025.

USDC is the first stablecoin approved under Japan's regulatory framework.


Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer also plan to list USDC soon.

Circle has established Circle Japan KK as its local entity to support operations.


The launch follows a partnership between Circle and SBI Holdings that began in 2023.

Circle Internet Financial has announced that its USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin will officially launch in Japan on March 26, 2025.


This marks a key moment for the Japanese crypto market. USDC becomes the first global dollar stablecoin approved for use in Japan after two years of regulatory discussions.


SBI VC Trade will be the first exchange to list USDC, but expansion is already planned.

Circle confirmed that Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer also plan to list and distribute USDC in the near future.


These are major players in Japan’s crypto ecosystem. Bitbank and bitFlyer are among the country’s largest exchanges, processing more than $25 million each per day with over 1.85 million monthly website visits.


To support local operations, Circle has established Circle Japan KK. This entity will work closely with SBI Holdings through a joint venture announced in 2023.


Jeremy Allaire, Circle's co-founder and CEO, celebrated the news on social media.

He stated that this development “unlocks tremendous opportunities not just in trading digital assets, but more broadly in payments, cross border finance and commerce, FX.”


The approval process wasn't quick. It took two years of negotiations with regulators, banking partners, and industry players to gain this approval.


Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO and president of SBI Holdings, also commented on the launch.

He said it would “enhance financial accessibility and drive crypto innovation” in Japan’s evolving digital economy.


This aligns with SBI's broader vision for blockchain-based finance in Japan. The partnership aims to combine USDC distribution with banking and Web3 technology for the Japanese market.


USDC currently maintains its position as the second largest stablecoin.

It has a market cap of $59.7 billion, behind only Tether’s USDT at $143.8 billion.


The stablecoin's entry into Japan could have wider market impacts. Jay Jo, a senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt that beyond trading, Japanese companies could “offer custody services and develop various stablecoin-based businesses.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by President Trump, has deployed a USD-pegged stablecoin (USD1) on Ethereum and BNB Chain.

The token has approximately 3.5 million in supply on each network and shows activity with addresses linked to Wintermute and BitGo.

WLFI has stated the stablecoin is “not currently tradeable” and warned users about potential scams.

The launch coincides with the advancement of the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation in the Senate.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao highlighted the token’s deployment, triggering attention and copycat tokens.

Blockchain data shows the token was launched in early March on both Ethereum and BNB Chain networks.

Several transactions involving the token have occurred over the past couple of weeks according to data from blockchain monitoring websites Etherscan and BscScan.

WLFI quickly responded to growing public attention about the token, stating that USD1 is “not currently tradeable” and warned crypto users to be aware of potential scams attempting to capitalize on the attention.

Blockchain analysts first noticed activity with the USD1 token on March 24, 2025.

Some transfers included addresses linked to major crypto industry players.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, addresses connected to Wintermute, a large digital asset trading firm, and BitGo, a prominent crypto custodian, have interacted with the token.

The company stated in a post on X that USD1 is “not currently tradeable” and warned crypto users to be aware of potential scams attempting to capitalize on the attention.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao brought widespread notice to the token by welcoming the project to BNB Chain in a post shared with his 10 million followers, including a screenshot of the USD1 BscScan profile.

Zhao later noted that his post triggered a wave of copycat tokens.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cardano (ADA) is consolidating between $0.695 and $0.75 levels.

Traders remain bullish with $17M in long positions compared to $3M in short positions.

The White House Crypto Working Group’s consideration for government crypto stockpile has included ADA.

Technical analysis shows a rounding-bottom pattern forming with consecutive bullish candles.

Open interest in ADA futures has increased to $785.91 million, indicating growing market participation.

Cardano (ADA) price has maintained steady ground around the $0.70 mark while many other cryptocurrencies have seen upward momentum.

The sideways movement has traders watching key levels closely.

A daily candle close above $0.756 could trigger a 12% rally toward the $0.85 level according to technical analysis.

Conversely, if ADA drops below $0.69, it might fall to $0.65 in the near term.

Despite the unclear price direction, market sentiment leans positive.

Data from on-chain analytics firm Coinglass shows traders have built $17 million worth of long positions compared to just $3 million in shorts.

This indicates strong bullish sentiment among market participants.

Trading volume has also picked up, with a 40% jump over 24 hours.

The price action reveals a short-term rounding-bottom pattern forming from the $0.70 support level.

Technical analysts have also identified a morning-star pattern that completed on Sunday with a 1.31% recovery, which is often viewed as a bullish reversal signal.

Open interest in ADA futures has climbed to $785.91 million.

The long-to-short ratio has reached a nearly neutral point at 1.0396, showing increasing bullish positions over recent days.

ADA currently faces resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe.

This technical indicator is acting as a ceiling that has so far capped upward movement.

The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 50 level.

Fibonacci analysis shows that if ADA breaks above the 61.80% retracement level at $0.7351, it could potentially rally toward the 78.60% Fibonacci level.

Some analysts have set even more bullish long-term targets, with Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello suggesting that ADA could reach $10 in the coming bull cycle.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Pi Network's native cryptocurrency (PI) has fallen below the $1 threshold, currently trading at approximately $0.92.

This represents a significant drop from its recent high of $1.2, marking a decline of about 4% in the past 24 hours.

Market data shows that the token briefly touched a low of $0.911 before recovering slightly to its current price level.

The token has experienced considerable volatility since its launch and lost over 65% of its value from its all-time high of $3 reached earlier this year.

Recent data suggests daily token unlocks have decreased from 13 million tokens daily to approximately 3.8 million, potentially easing selling pressure.

According to data from Pi Scan, nearly 99.3 million PI tokens are scheduled for unlock over the next 30 days.

This amount represents approximately $91 million at current prices and an average of 3 million tokens will be released daily during this period.

The largest single-day unlock is set for April 3, when 6.8 million tokens will enter circulation.

Future months will see even larger unlocks, with 115.57 million tokens scheduled for April, 182 million in May, and 222 million in June.

Pi Network recently announced an official partnership with PiDaoSwap to improve the network's governance process and increase transparency.

Other internal platforms, such as Pi News, have also joined this partnership, which is part of Pi Network's strategy to build a more extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications.

Some market analysts remain optimistic despite the current price difficulties and suggest that PI could potentially break out of its current downward trend.

Several technical analysts predict that PI could move toward the $2 mark in the near term.

Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has suggested a much higher long-term valuation, proposing that Pi Network's ultimate goal is to become an advanced stablecoin for peer-to-peer transactions.

Under this vision, he suggested the token could potentially reach values above $10 as the network matures.

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,054 after reaching a peak of $2,104 on March 25, 2025.

Analysts predict ETH may retrace to approximately $1,900 before potentially surging to $3,000.

Strong on-chain metrics show daily volume over $10 billion and growing ETH futures open interest.

Institutional investors and whales have purchased nearly half a million ETH in recent weeks.


Key support zone exists between $1,871-$1,981, while resistance is found around $2,100-$2,150.

Ethereum’s price continues to show strength above the $2,000 level as of March 25, 2025. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $2,054, showing resilience despite a recent 3% pullback from its peak of $2,104 reached earlier the same day.

Market analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s price action for signs of where it might head next.


One crypto analyst using the pseudonym MAXPAIN has suggested Ethereum price could pull back by nearly 9% from its recent peak. This would bring ETH to around the $1,900 area, which is identified as a key support zone.

Trading data from CoinGlass shows two important liquidity zones that traders should watch.

The first is between $2,135 and $2,106, where approximately $450 million worth of short positions would face liquidation if prices rise above this range.


The second zone lies between $1,980 and $1,833, where more than $700 million in long positions would be forced to close. This creates the potential for high volatility if price moves decisively in either direction.

On-chain metrics for Ethereum remain strong, with daily trading volume exceeding $10 billion. This high volume indicates active market participation and healthy liquidity for the digital asset.


Market Analysis

Futures market data also points to growing open interest in Ethereum contracts. This metric suggests more investors are taking positions in ETH derivatives, which often precedes major price movements.

The long-to-short ratio for Ethereum has reached 1.2287, with long positions now making up 55% of total contracts.


Whale activity has been increasing, with data showing nearly half a million ETH purchased by large investors in recent weeks. This accumulation by institutional investors and wealthy individuals often precedes price increases.

Another bullish indicator is the declining supply of ETH on exchanges. Over 1.2 million ETH has moved from exchange wallets into staking contracts and private wallets, suggesting a potential supply squeeze that could drive prices higher.


Technical analysis from crypto analyst Gert van Lagen highlights the potential formation of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart. This bullish pattern often precedes upward price movements, with a neckline near the $4,000 mark.

Another analyst, Michael van de Poppe, has identified a critical supply zone between $2,100 and $2,150.


For investors looking to buy Ethereum, the $1,900 area might present an opportunity if the price retraces as some analysts expect. This zone aligns with a value area identified in Time Price Opportunity (TPO) charts and coincides with strong historical support.

Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market reported a net-zero flow on March 24, marking the seventh day of balanced inflows and outflows since their launch.


The overall outlook for Ethereum remains positive despite potential short-term volatility. With strong support levels, increasing institutional interest, and positive on-chain metrics, many market participants are expecting ETH to eventually test the $3,000 level in the coming weeks.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $138, up 5.87% in 24 hours but still down 20% for the month.

Polymarket has integrated Solana wallet deposits to lower transaction costs and improve user experience.

SOL’s trading volume increased by 130.42% to $3.33 billion with total futures at $5.25 billion (up 11.01%).

Active Solana wallets rebounded from 1 million to 3 million between March 20-23.

Solana's price spiked nearly 7% following the Polymarket integration announcement.


Despite this recent price jump, SOL remains down 20% over the past month. This indicates the market has been experiencing volatility and uncertainty in recent weeks.

Two possible scenarios for Solana $SOL:  $144 is a key level for bulls to reclaim for more upside. 

If SOL can move above $140 and maintain that position, it could signal a shift toward more positive market sentiment.


Trading volume for Solana has surged by 130.42% to $3.33 billion. This indicates increased market activity, with more people buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Data from Coinglass reveals growing interest in Solana’s futures market. The total money in Solana Futures has reached $5.25 billion, marking an 11.01% increase.


According to CryptoQuant, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 67. This places the token in a neutral zone, not yet considered overbought but approaching levels where selling pressure could increase.

Network activity appears to be supporting the price recovery. Over the past week, the number of active Solana wallets dropped to 1 million on March 20 before rebounding to 3 million by March 23.


New wallet creation followed a similar pattern. After a drop around March 19-20, wallet creation has bounced back over the last few days.

This network activity is a positive sign for Solana. More users typically indicates higher demand, which could help maintain price strength.


Polymarket’s integration of Solana is designed to lower transaction costs and improve user experience. The platform has become a leading venue for blockchain-based prediction markets.


With near-instant finality and very low transaction costs, Solana’s addition positions Polymarket to scale its user base. This could potentially introduce more users to the Solana ecosystem.


For Solana to continue its upward movement, it needs to break past $140 with strong trading volume. The recent 130% jump in volume is a positive indicator, but sustained buyer interest will be needed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/blackrock-launches-bitcoin-etp-in-europe'>BlackRock Launches Bitcoin ETP In Europe</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-25 08:04:09 <p>
BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin product in Europe: a physically backed bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP).

The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading Tuesday on Germany’s Xetra exchange and Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.

The new product comes after BlackRock debuted a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. last year, which has attracted over $50 billion in assets and become the largest spot bitcoin ETF globally.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has voiced scepticism of bitcoin but appears to have warmed up to bitcoin amid client demand.

By launching a European bitcoin ETP, BlackRock is giving institutional investors in the region exposure to bitcoin’s price performance in a familiar and regulated wrapper.

Crypto ETPs have existed in Europe for years but lag U.S. bitcoin ETFs in assets.

BlackRock’s bitcoin ETP carries a management fee of 0.25%, reduced to 0.15% through a temporary fee waiver until year-end 2025.

The ETP uses Coinbase for custody.

As the largest asset manager globally with over $10 trillion under management, BlackRock brings significant scale and distribution power.

The move signals growing mainstream embrace of bitcoin as an emerging institutional asset class.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Back in 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocketed over 45,000%, turning early investments into life-changing wealth.

The same bullish signal that sparked SHIB’s historic surge is flashing for a new under-the-radar altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently trading at just $0.015, analysts predict MUTM could soar 19,455%, reaching $3 in the next market cycle.

Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on meme hype, Mutuum Finance is a utility-driven DeFi platform. Currently in its presale stage, this rapidly growing altcoin has already amassed almost $4.8 million, with Phase 3 progressing at $0.02.

More than 6600 investors have seized the opportunity, positioning themselves ahead of a 25% price increase in the next phase. Over 70% of phase 3 has already been sold out and investors have less time before the phase ends.

Those joining at this stage are poised for a 200% return on investment when Mutuum Finance officially launches at $0.06.

Mutuum Finance is performing well in the decentralized finance market with its innovative dual-lending system.

Currently in its presale phase, this rising altcoin has already secured over $4.8 million in funding, with more than 6600 investors joining.

The token is available at $0.02 in Phase 2, but with a 25% price increase set for the next phase, phase 3 buyers have a prime opportunity to maximize their gains.

Upon launch at $0.06, investors stand to gain a 200% return, and projections suggest a meteoric rise beyond $1 during the upcoming bull run.

As momentum builds, experts are eyeing MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi projects, with its unique lending model setting it apart from traditional competitors.

Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model system which unites Peer-to-Contract (P2C) along with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending to redefine decentralized lending operations.

Users can benefit from passive returns in P2C model liquidity pools by depositing stablecoins like USDT while borrowers use this system for efficient fund access.

Through P2P lending users establish straight deals between each other because this approach avoids using middle groups.

Mutuum Finance launches a stablecoin on Ethereum that has complete collateral support for maintaining USD price equality.

Users must provide more value than the stablecoin value due to its resistance to volatility through over-collateralized methods which protect against any risks of liquidation.

The long-term sustainability of the platform receives strong support from this mechanism through its foundation of well-established value principles.

Full contract auditing and transparent financial structures at Mutuum Finance reinforce investor confidence thus preventing the risks which led to past issues at other DeFi lending platforms.

Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics strategy is designed for sustainable growth, balancing liquidity, security, and partnerships while preventing inflation.

A structured presale and controlled token distribution create a framework for lasting value.

Staking rewards further enhance profitability, ensuring consistent yield for token holders and reinforcing community engagement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Polymarket, a blockchain-based betting platform, has launched on Solana, allowing users to make deposits using the network.

The platform enables users to wager on a broad range of topics, adjusting odds dynamically based on market activity.

Current high-profile bets include the political futures of global leaders and cryptocurrency price movements.

More unconventional wagers include whether Jesus Christ will return in 2025, currently assigned a 3% probability.

Polymarket has built a reputation for accurately predicting events, including the outcome of the U.S. presidential election last November.

The platform has faced regulatory scrutiny, with authorities in Taiwan prosecuting an individual for using the platform to bet on the nation's presidential election.

Polymarket is also officially off-limits to U.S. users following a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Raydium's native token, Ray, rose sharply on Monday, driven by the decentralized exchange's "deep liquidity," even as it faces stiff competition from the recently launched rival PumpSwap.

As the 133rd largest crypto by market capitalization, Ray is trading at about $1.95, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. It is up 25% over the past 14 days, recovering ground lost earlier this year as Pump.fun grew more popular.

Ray had dropped 7.6% over a five-minute period following last Friday’s launch of Pump.fun’s competing decentralized exchange. The token previously fell 22% as rumors of the emerging Pump.fun competitor emerged last month.

However, Raydium’s numbers have held up relatively well. On Sunday, the Solana-based exchange and automated market maker processed some $321.31 million worth of trading volume, a 4% decrease from the week prior, according to DefiLlama.

And on Monday, it surpassed last Monday’s trading volume for the same day a week ago. Raydium’s popularity endures; Pump.fun rises

Throughout 2024, Raydium established itself as the most popular DEX on Solana, generating $124 billion worth of trading volume by January this year amid a meme-coin-fueled market upturn.

Yet Pump.fun later solidified itself as the biggest token launchpad across all chains, becoming the fastest-growing app in crypto history toward the end of 2024. Recently surpassing $600 million in revenue, according to Dune data.

Previously, when Pump.fun tokens completed their bonding curve and “graduated” from the platform, which currently happens at a $100,000 market cap, they would become tradable on Raydium.

At its January peak, according to Dune, Pump.fun created over 70,500 tokens with 1,168 of them graduating to Raydium. Plus, the launchpad accounts for up to 70% of all tokens created on Solana or 55% as of March 23.

Pseudonymous core contributor for Raydium Stendhal told Decrypt that they aren’t surprised because all of Pump.fun’s previously migrated tokens have their liquidity locked on Raydium. They also mentioned that Raydium has “deep liquidity” in tokens from “all asset classes” outside of the Solana launchpad.

“I believe the reliance from Pump.fun has been overblown,” Stendhal said, adding that Raydium’s technical capabilities are being overlooked.

PumpSwap remains some distance from surpassing Raydium as the largest decentralized exchange on Solana. Over the past 24 hours, Raydium has accounted for 32.7% of all volume on Solana with Meteora close in second at 31.56% and Orca in third at 20.41%.

Pump.fun’s competitor, however, sits in fifth with just 5.74% of daily volume on Solana.

“It’s too early to assess the impact of a new player with a lot of mindshare joining the spot market landscape,” Stendhal added. “It is nonetheless interesting to see that the big disruption anticipated by the market didn’t happen.”

Some traders are starting to believe in meme coins again, as ROUTINE soared to $19 million over the weekend.

Volumes on PumpSwap have been increasing day-by-day, and I expect this trend to continue as more coins migrate and continue to generate trading volume,” Cohen said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ever since the pyramids of Egypt rose from the desert over 4,000 years ago, people have wondered how they were built—sparking centuries of speculation, fringe theories, and wild claims involving lost technologies and extraterrestrials.

That speculation got a modern boost last fall when a Chinese research team claimed to have used radar to detect plasma bubbles above the Great Pyramid of Giza. These reports reignited online theories and alternative histories.

Building on that momentum, a group known as the Khafre Project, led by Professor Corrado Malanga from Italy's University of Pisa and Researcher Filippo Biondi from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, attracted attention last week with its own dramatic claims of a vast network of underground structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre.

Accompanied by detailed graphics and viral videos, the group's assertions quickly spread across social media, breathing new life into old mysteries. X lit up with speculation, including theories that the chambers amplified Earth’s low-frequency electromagnetic waves—possibly functioning as an ancient power plant.

Some even suggested the find could rewrite our understanding of the pyramids. “The images suggest a hidden world under the feet of the Great Pyramids: halls and shafts that have waited millennia to be found,” technologist Brian Roemmele wrote in a blog post.

“Such a scenario has an almost storybook allure as if turning the page on a chapter that historians didn’t know existed.” Debunking the myth, Egyptologist and historian Flora Anthony wasn't buying into the hype.

“Something seemed off, so I looked up the original source, read through it, and realized the paper had nothing to do with the images or claims being shared in the media,” she told Decrypt. “Turns out, the article isn’t peer-reviewed.

Someone familiar with the journal where the report was published said they publish quickly and aren’t established in the field—which matters since peer review is important.” The pyramids on the Giza Plateau—built during Egypt’s Fourth Dynasty between 2600 B.C. and 2500 B.C.—were royal tombs for the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure.

The idea that extraterrestrials may have played a role in constructing the pyramids has long been a staple of fringe science and pop culture. Proponents of this “Ancient Alien” theory point to the monuments’ precise alignment, massive scale, and engineering complexity as evidence that ancient civilizations couldn’t have built them alone.

"The people behind this aren’t scientists," Anthony said. "One is a UFO researcher who believes aliens are interdimensional parasites that hijack human souls."

The other writes conspiracy books about a lost, pre-dynastic Egyptian civilization and recently promoted a so-called 'harmonic investigation' of the Great Pyramid using a technology he claims to have patented.” While their claims might sound impressive at first glance, there is no evidence to support them.

On the contrary, fact-checking website Snopes investigated the Khafre Project’s claims and declared them false in a recent report. “Despite the popularity of the claim, there is no evidence to support it,” the report said.

“No credible news outlets or scientific publications have reported on this rumor.” The idea of using radar technology to scan the pyramids is not new. Radar technology has been used multiple times to scan the pyramids of Giza, most notably in 2016 as part of the ScanPyramids project.

In 2022, researchers Corrado Malanga and Filippo Biondi conducted a synthetic aperture radar scan on the Khufu Pyramid, which many suspect is the basis for the Khafre Project’s images.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Since its introduction on Ethereum in 2023, the fund has drawn in $1.7 billion and is on track to cross $2 billion by early April.

Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said: "In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets."

As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana is a natural next step.

Money market funds typically allow investors to earn interest on idle cash, but they come with trading limitations.

Blockchain versions like BUIDL allow for constant access.

The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance protocol, confirmed plans to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin called USD1.

The token will be fully backed by short-term U.S. government securities, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents, and its reserves will be custodied at BitGo.

BitGo Prime, the firm's brokerage service, will provide liquidity for the token.

The stablecoin will first be available on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with plans to expand to other networks.

This announcement comes after crypto observers brought attention to test transactions involving a token named World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on Ethereum and BBN Chain.

WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff said, "USD1 provides what algorithmic and anonymous crypto projects cannot—access to the power of DeFi underpinned by the credibility and safeguards of the most respected names in traditional finance.”

The protocol aims to provide a blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools, and transact with stablecoins.

WLFI is a project spearheaded by Zachary Folkman and Chase Herro that made a splash last year as one of the first crypto projects backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The protocol's launch is seen as an effort to provide a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, has purchased over 10 million dogecoin (DOGE), worth just over $1.8 million, as part of a broader DOGE reserve strategy.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

House of Doge is the Foundation’s corporate and commercialization unit, which was formed in February with a five-year deal in place. It hopes to position DOGE as a payment currency, away from its predominant existence as a memecoin, as part of a framework to show it can be used for everyday payments at very low fees.

House of Doge added it will unveil partnerships with various payment processors in the coming months.

“With a strategic reserve, the House of Doge is laying the foundation for a payments ecosystem that ensures liquidity, stability, and reliability,” said Michael Galloro, a Member of the Board-Elect of the House of Doge, in a release. “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases.”

DOGE was among the highest gains in the run-up to President Donald Trump’s election due to the possibility of its abbreviation becoming part of the administration: the “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E.

It has since seen profit-taking and a sell-off alongside the broader market, with prices down more than 30% since January, according to CoinDesk market data.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"You're not bullish enough!" an XRP enthusiast exclaimed on X last week after Ripple, which utilizes the token for cross-border transactions, said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its case against the company.

Many others shared the excitement, and understandably so, as the conclusion of the long-standing legal battle lifted a weight that hindered XRP's relative performance during the 2021 bull run. Plus, there is XRP ETF hype and hopes that the token could become a part of the U.S. strategic reserve.

That said, recent price action does not reflect the optimism, with XRP rangebound between $2.30-$2.50 and key momentum indicators flashing warnings of a major bearish shift in trend.

XRP surged over 11% to $2.59 last Wednesday, cheering the SEC news. Since then, the follow through has been anything but bullish, despite optimism that expected reciprocal trade tariffs from President Donald Trump on April 2 could be more measured than initially expected.

The first indicator signaling bearish trend reversal is the three-line break chart, which focuses only on price movements while filtering out short-term noise.

A new red bar occurred early this month in the weekly time frame and has held intact following the SEC news. The "weekly" aspect means this chart aggregates price information over a week.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line on the weekly chart, indicating strengthening downside momentum.

The indicator flipped positive in November, after which prices surged from $1 to above $3.

The 5- and 10-week simple moving averages (SMAs) have crossed bearish as well, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside.

The Bollinger bands — volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below XRP's 20-week SMA — have widened in response to the sharp price rally in late 2024 and early this year.

Historically, prices have tended to move lower following the sharp widening of the Bollinger bands, as observed after mid-2021 and early 2018.

A firm move to $3, the high registered on March 2, would invalidate the bearish setup, negating the lower highs pattern to suggest a renewed bullish technical outlook.

Some analysts expect XRP to reach as high as $10 by the end of this decade.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Stocks and crypto trading platform eToro filed to sell shares to the public for the first time on the Nasdaq.

In a prospectus for the initial public offering (IPO), the Bnei Brak, Israel-based company said revenue more than tripled to $12.6 billion last year.

The lion’s share came from cryptocurrency-related revenue, which rose to $12.1 billion last year from $3.4 billion in 2023.

Founded in 2007 by Yoni and Ronen Assia, eToro allows users to trade assets including stocks, crypto and commodities, and to copy other traders' portfolios.

The company’s IPO plans were revealed earlier this year through reports on a confidential filing with the SEC.

Net income jumped to $192 million in 2024, up from just $15.3 million in 2023 according to data from its recent Form F-1 filing.

The company is looking to raise $300 million–$400 million at a valuation of $4.5 billion, Globes reported.

That’s below the $10.4 billion valuation it sought in 2021 during a planned merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, which was later shelved due to market conditions.

The firm has filed to list under the ticker “ETOR.”

The offering will be led by major underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 7% as majors staged a relief rally on Tuesday driven by talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being more measured than initially expected.

President Donald Trump's planned "reciprocal tariffs" set for April 2 may be more targeted than previously threatened, with some countries exempt and existing metal levies possibly not stacking.

The tariffs unsettled markets in February, shocking stocks and cryptocurrencies alike with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 17.6% to below $80,000 from its January peak.

Last week, the Federal Reserve raised inflation forecasts and lowered growth projections, likely due to Trump's trade stance, but described the tariff-driven inflation as temporary while maintaining plans for two rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets.

This, along with the possibility of milder tariffs, has boosted market optimism, and memecoins are leading the charge. DOGE, pepecoin (PEPE), mog (MOG), floki (FLOKI), among others, are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with the meme sector up 5.6% on average.

Memecoins jump or act as beta bets when ether (ETH) or bitcoin rise because they’re highly speculative assets with amplified sensitivity to broader crypto market trends.

Retail traders often see relief in majors as a signal of bullish sentiment across the crypto ecosystem — chasing higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities like memecoins, which are typically cheaper and can deliver rapid gains in relatively shorter periods.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, said it "offboarded" a market maker for Movement's MOVE token.

The market maker made a $38 million profit when the MOVE tokens were first offered for trading on the exchange, but failed to meet its obligations to ensure sufficient order size and place orders for both bid and ask prices.

Instead of meeting its obligations, the market maker placed sell orders for 66 million MOVE tokens one day after the initial listing and "little buy orders."

One-sided market-making activity is widely considered illicit and illegal, and Binance reiterated that strict rules are in place for defaulters.

The entity was offboarded on March 18, and both the Movement Labs and Movement Foundation teams were informed of the “irregularities with their market maker.”

Binance said all proceeds were frozen to compensate users, whose details will be available at a later date.

“Any project-authorized market makers who do not comply with or breach such principles and rules, Binance will take further actions against such market makers to best protect our users,” the exchange said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The author believes that crypto's positioned itself as the next great technological revolution, but the true revolution is artificial intelligence.

For years, crypto has been seen as the next big thing, but AI is now taking center stage.

The author helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin and has operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain, and they also earned a Ph.D. in AI.

Building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included.

With respect to pure crypto, DeFi is the only segment left standing, boasting better engineering, programmability, and composability than TradFi.

DeFi has shown exceptional product-market-fit with stablecoins and tokenization being its best demonstration of real tangible value.

Institutions such as BlackRock, Robinhood, and Coinbase are building out crypto products in anticipation of imminent regulatory clarity.

Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer.

The author notes that there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications.

AI apps like Cursor and Lovable, agents like Manus, robotics, and decentralized AI or Crypto x AI are all examples of the growing field.

A sobering reality for crypto is the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility, driven more by memetic appeal than genuine value creation.

This highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry.

The author believes that blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack.

They'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services rather than as standalone products.

Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again, including distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation, and decentralized storage of training data.

Distributed computing and DePIN architectures have proven their utility.

These systems will do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure.

Protocols built using blockchains could generate revenue through licensing or usage and be paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Memecoins have experienced a significant surge in popularity in the last year, becoming a notable phenomenon in the cryptocurrency market.

This rise is attributed to several factors, including high-profile endorsements, political developments, and the increasing influence of internet culture on financial markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) options worth billions of dollars will expire on Deribit on Friday.

More than 139,000 BTC option contracts, worth $12.13 billion, representing nearly 45% of the total active BTC contracts across all expiries, are due for settlement this Friday, according to data source Deribit metrics.

Quarterly expiries of such massive magnitudes are known to breed market volatility, but that may not be the case this time, going by the continued decline in the bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (DVOL).

The annualized perpetual futures basis of around 5% on the exchange, signalling a calmer funding environment.

"Despite the size of the expiry, the overall setup—low DVOL, moderate basis, and balanced options positioning—points to a relatively subdued expiry unless external catalysts emerge," Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

Options skew, which measures the difference between implied volatility (pricing) for calls relative to puts, shows downside concerns in the lead-up to Friday's expiry.

"3-Day Put-Call Skew is Slightly Positive indicating some immediate downside protection demand while 30-Day Put-Call Skew is slightly Negative indicating a more bullish outlook over the medium term," Strijers said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Decentralized lending platform Abracadabra.Finance suffered an attack that drained $13 million worth of cryptocurrency from pools tied to GMX liquidity tokens.

Blockchain security firm PeckShield flagged that contracts involving decentralized exchange GMX and Abracadabra were compromised, leading to the theft of 6,260 ETH, worth around $12.98 million at the time of writing.


GMX distanced itself from the incident. In a post on X, an account associated with the exchange said that GMX’s contracts themselves were unaffected. The team later said the breach was “solely related to the Abracadabra/Spell cauldrons,” which used GM tokens as collateral but did not involve GMX’s core infrastructure.


Abracadabra confirmed the exploit and said core contributors and engineers were investigating the incident to its “fully audited” cauldron. The protocol noted that gmCauldrons had been audited by Guardian Audits — the same firm that audited GMX contracts — and were part of a broader security infrastructure involving monitoring and response tools.


The protocol offered the attacker a 20% bug bounty and invited them to negotiate via email or an on-chain message. Abracadabra is working with Guardian and GMX as well as other security partners in assessing the extent of the damage and how the attack was executed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Fidelity Investments is looking to create an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of Solana (SOL), a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday shows.

Cboe Exchange uploaded a 19b-4 filing to list a Solana ETF proposed by Fidelity, which comes after the firm registered a Fidelity Solana Fund in Delaware last Thursday.


Solana is currently the sixth-largest crypto asset by market capitalization in the world at $74 billion. Several asset managers have filed applications with the SEC to launch funds holding the token, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and VanEck.

Last week, two ETFs (SOLZ and SOLT) tracking SOL futures hit the market on Nasdaq, a significant step in getting a spot exchange-traded product approved.


Fidelity has previously issued two spot crypto ETFs: the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). Both launched last year. FBTC has attracted nearly $17 billion in assets — or bitcoin — and FETH handles roughly $975 million.

Many of Fidelity’s clients are interested in owning cryptocurrencies and a large portion already does. The firm has been working on its digital asset ecosystem since 2014.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
