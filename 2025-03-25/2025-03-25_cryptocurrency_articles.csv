Cboe Exchange uploaded a 19b-4 filing to list a Solana ETF proposed by the $5 trillion Wall Street veteran. This comes after the firm registered a Fidelity Solana Fund in Delaware last Thursday.

Fidelity has yet to submit an S-1 filing, which is required for companies seeking to issue a new security and be listed on a public stock exchange.

Solana, at $74 billion, is currently the sixth-largest crypto asset by market capitalization in the world. Several asset managers have filed applications with the SEC to launch funds holding the token, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and VanEck.

Last week, two ETFs (SOLZ and SOLT) tracking SOL futures hit the market on Nasdaq, a significant step in getting a spot exchange-traded product approved.

Fidelity has previously issued two spot crypto ETFs: the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). Both launched last year. FBTC has attracted nearly $17 billion in assets — or bitcoin — and FETH handles roughly $975 million.

Many of Fidelity’s clients are interested in owning cryptocurrencies and a large portion already does. The firm has been working on its digital asset ecosystem since 2014.",coindesk

The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is by far the largest of the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., with net assets worth over $50 billion and cumulative net inflows of just under $40 billion, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. An equivalent product listed in Canada in January.

Although the listing of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. at the start of 2024 was considered a watershed moment for the crypto industry, similar products have existed in Europe for several years as ETPs.

Digital asset managers CoinShares and 21Shares have led the way, accounting for nine of the top 20 ETPs by assets between them, according to data tracked by ETFbook. CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP is the largest, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee.

Coinbase (COIN), which provides custody for IBIT, will do the same for the BlackRock's European product. The fee for the European ETP is temporarily reduced by 10 basis points to 0.15% until the end of 2025.

BlackRock's ETP introduction was reported earlier by Bloomberg.

This is the future imagined by bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy (MSTR). Saylor pioneered the bitcoin corporate treasury – turning his flailing software firm into a Nasdaq-listed $85 billion leveraged bitcoin powerhouse.

CoinDesk recently sat down with Saylor, Bitcoin’s ultimate maximalist, for a two-hour interview to break down his vision for global bitcoin domination.

Since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, bitcoin has maintained a 26% gain, peaking at a $2.1 trillion market cap, and touching a January all time high of $109,000. Strategy, a Wall Street proxy for bitcoin, remains strong with about a 50% gain, despite dropping approximately 30% from November highs amid a broader decline in U.S. equities, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, and oil.

The United States went from regulating crypto by enforcement and covertly de-banking digital asset firms, dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” by the industry, to declaring that the U.S. will become a bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world. For Saylor, the sea change means doors that were previously closed are opening. Governments and traditional institutional investors around the world that used to be afraid of engaging with digital assets are now curious.

Saylor said he is fielding invitations to speak at all the elite gatherings: South America’s 100 wealthiest families, Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, Morgan Stanley’s prestigious tech conference, CPAC, and the White House. He has gone from encouraging corporations to adopt bitcoin treasuries to advising nation states on establishing strategic bitcoin reserves.

Bitcoin has reached “escape velocity,” he said, because once the U.S. government begins to acquire it aggressively, the U.S. will become a beneficiary and force every country to adopt bitcoin as the global capital.

“It becomes a fait accompli,” said Saylor. “It's one of those geopolitical moves that when you embrace the network, you force all of your allies first to adopt it, and then all your enemies have to adopt it.”

U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve

President Trump’s executive order to establish a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve represents a milestone in realizing bitcoin’s manifest destiny. At one point, the U.S. held about 400,000 bitcoins, but sold half of it for proceeds of $366 million. Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks lamented that the cost to American taxpayers for selling this bitcoin prematurely is $17 billion at current market value.

The executive order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to never sell the United States’ bitcoin and to develop budget neutral ways to acquire more bitcoin. It further directs the creation of a digital asset stockpile, a portfolio of seized crypto assets that can be managed and rebalanced as necessary.

At President Trump’s White House Digital Assets Summit on March 7, Saylor proposed that the U.S. acquire 5%-25% of the total bitcoin supply by 2035 that could generate an estimated $100 trillion in economic value by 2045.

When asked about this proposal, Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, told CoinDesk the Trump administration wants the U.S. to acquire as much bitcoin “as we can possibly get” and is considering various creative methods, including Senator Cynthia Lummis’ (R-Wyo) proposal to use Federal reserve earnings and gold certificates to buy bitcoin.

As the U.S. embraces bitcoin, worldwide banks will inevitably follow.

“ Pandora's box has been opened,” said Saylor. “When bitcoin spreads… and there's a trillion dollars of digital capital in the banking system, it won't just be in the U.S. It's a virus. And so the virus spreads. And in this case, that means you're going to have hundreds of thousands of banks and trillions of dollars that are held by a billion people.”

‘Thermodynamically Sound’ Money

Michael Saylor was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. He grew up on Air Force bases across the Midwest, as well as in Japan and New Zealand. An Air Force scholarship sent Saylor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he obtained dual degrees in aeronautics, astronautics, and the history of science. A literal rocket scientist, Saylor’s systems mindset attracted him to bitcoin’s “thermodynamically sound” design.

After serving as an Air Force Reserve captain, Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy in 1989, a software firm that rode the dot-com bubble, until Saylor and two other MicroStrategy executives were embroiled in an accounting fraud scandal in 2000. Eventually, they settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for about $11 million.

At MicroStrategy, Saylor invented over 48 patents and deployed dozens of business ideas. Some succeeded, most of them failed. Saylor said the irony is that his greatest success was somebody else’s idea. Satoshi Namamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, created “digital gold” that Saylor discovered while under lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic. He grabbed onto it out of desperation, preferring MicroStrategy to have a quick death over a slow one if it failed.

In July 2020, MicroStrategy began to steadily and continuously purchase bitcoin through cash flows, equity and debt, basically any way it could. It climbed the highs of the 2021 bull run and withstood the impairment charges of the 2022 crypto winter. By 2024, the Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy emerged battle tested. It survived its first crypto market cycle and the Trump bump catapulted MicroStrategy from a $1 billion to a $100 billion market cap company.

“[Bitcoin] became an opportunity,” said Saylor. “Then it became a strategy, and then all of a sudden in the past 12 months, we realized it was a really good business.”

From MicroStrategy to Strategy

MicroStrategy, rebranded and doing business as “Strategy,” proved to be an incredibly desirable stock for institutional investors wanting exposure to the volatile ups and downs of bitcoin. In December, Strategy was admitted to the Nasdaq 100. It is now eyeing membership to the S&P 500, which would spark an additional tidal wave of public market access.

To generate positive momentum, Strategy is laser-focused on raising capital to buy more bitcoin through a plethora of fixed income securities, creating a casino of financial products for traders addicted to bitcoin’s volatility. By constantly weighing market conditions, tweaking yield parameters and conversion factors, Strategy has engineered ""intelligent leverage” designed to lure demand and ensure each successive series of securities amp each other up in an endless positive feedback loop.

“If you were to say, it sounds like financial engineering, it absolutely is financial engineering,” said Saylor. “ It creates more pressure to drive up the price of bitcoin, which drives up the price of MSTR, which drives up the leverage of MSTR, which drives up the value of the options, which drives up the demand for the equity, which drives up the demand and the value of the [convertible bonds], which drives up the price of and the demand for the preferred [shares].”

Strategy has raised approximately $33 billion to purchase half a billion bitcoins through this financial engineering. That has ignited online debate regarding Strategy’s ability to pay out dividends or bond maturities if markets sour or it cannot raise fresh capital. The money likely won’t come from existing company cash flows: Strategy’s software profits are negligible; in 2020-2023, they were negative, according to MarketWatch data.

All of this keeps Saylor up at night. So, Strategy is keeping all of its options open.

“ When the equity capital markets give us a massive premium, we'll sell the equity,” said Saylor. “If we get too levered, we will de-lever. If we feel that the capital markets aren't really favorable to sell any securities, we'll just stop and wait.”

Last week, Strategy brought its bitcoin holdings above 500,000 tokens by purchasing an additional 6,911 bitcoins for $584 million, using proceeds from the sale of MSTR common stock. They further announced their new STRF perpetual offering raised $711 million to buy more bitcoin, when its initial goal was to raise $500 million.

This latest series of preferred stock differs from the original STRK offering in that it comes with a higher coupon (10% versus 8%) and has no common share conversion provision. Spelled out in the prospectuses of both offerings are risk factors that include no obligation to pay accumulated dividends “for any reason.”

Strategy has also eliminated any collateralized debt and therefore liquidation risk of the company’s bitcoin assets.

”We've built an indestructible balance sheet. Bitcoin could trade down 99%. There’s no margin call coming. The instruments that are constructed don't have Bitcoin pledged as collateral,” said Saylor.

Strategy's debt: convertible bonds and maturity dates. (Strategy.com)

Ultimately, the dates to watch are when Strategy’s loans to bondholders become due. The first “put date” is September 16, 2027. If Strategy fails to incentivize bondholders to convert their bonds to MSTR stock or persuade them to await principal repayment the following year, these bondholders might demand Strategy buy back their $1.8 billion loan in cash. If the markets are still hungry for bitcoin exposure, it will be easier to raise capital and pay back investors. If there is a market downturn, and the Wall Street spigot runs dry, Strategy may have to consider selling its bitcoin or default.

‘Economic immortality’

But Saylor said Strategy, like the U.S. government, will “never sell” its bitcoin. He’s bet everything on BTC price going up forever, and the sovereignty, sound money, freedom, and property rights idealized by the community.

Before he dies, Saylor may burn bitcoin rather than give his assets away. That would be a “more ethically proper, ethically sound form of charity” and would bestow “economic immortality.”

“ If I believe that and I burn those keys, then I have made everybody in the [Bitcoin] network that much richer and more powerful forever,” said Saylor. “We're all in it together, from now to eternity. So yeah, that's my legacy.”",coindesk

The announcement came after crypto observers brought attention to test transactions with a token named World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with BitGo and market maker Wintermute being involved in transfers.

""USD1 provides what algorithmic and anonymous crypto projects cannot—access to the power of DeFi underpinned by the credibility and safeguards of the most respected names in traditional finance,” said Zach Witkoff, WLFI co-founder. “We’re offering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.”

That said, recent price action does not reflect the optimism, with XRP rangebound between $2.30-$2.50 and key momentum indicators flashing warnings of a major bearish shift in trend.

XRP surged over 11% to $2.59 last Wednesday, cheering the SEC news. Since then, the follow through has been anything but bullish, despite optimism that expected reciprocal trade tariffs from President Donald Trump on April 2 could be more measured than initially expected.

Three-line break chart

The first indicator signaling bearish trend reversal is the three-line break chart, which focuses only on price movements while filtering out short-term noise. That helps identify trend changes as suggested by the market and not arbitrary or discretionary trading rules.

The chart consists of vertical blocks called lines or bars (green and red). A bull reversal happens when a green bar occurs with prices moving higher than the highest point of the last three red bars. A bearish shift is represented by the emergence of a red bar that goes beyond the lowest point of the previous three green bars.

In XRP's case, a new red bar occurred early this month in the weekly time frame and has held intact following the SEC news. The ""weekly"" aspect means this chart aggregates price information over a week.

The new red bar indicates a bearish shift in momentum. Similar patterns characterized the beginnings of prolonged bear markets in 2021 and early 2018.

MACD

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, is producing deeper bars below the zero line on the weekly chart. That is also a sign of strengthening downside momentum.

The indicator flipped positive in November, after which prices surged from $1 to above $3.

The 5- and 10-week simple moving averages (SMAs) have crossed bearish as well, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside.

Bollinger Bands

The Bollinger bands — volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below XRP's 20-week SMA — have widened in response to the sharp price rally in late 2024 and early this year.

Historically, prices have tended to move lower following the sharp widening of the Bollinger bands, as observed after mid-2021 and early 2018.

When bullish?

A firm move to $3, the high registered on March 2, would invalidate the bearish setup, negating the lower highs pattern to suggest a renewed bullish technical outlook.

As per reports, President Donald Trump's planned ""reciprocal tariffs"" set for April 2 may be more targeted than previously threatened, with some countries exempt and existing metal levies possibly not stacking.

The tariffs unsettled markets in February, shocking stocks and cryptocurrencies alike with bitcoin (BTC) dropping 17.6% to below $80,000 from its January peak.

Last week, the Federal Reserve raised inflation forecasts and lowered growth projections, likely due to Trump's trade stance, but described the tariff-driven inflation as temporary while maintaining plans for two rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets.

This, along with the possibility of milder tariffs, has boosted market optimism, and memecoins are leading the charge. DOGE, pepecoin (PEPE), mog (MOG), floki (FLOKI), among others, are up more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with the meme sector up 5.6% on average, per CoinGecko data.

That has beaten a 3% run in bitcoin, Solana’s SOL and XRP, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index up 2.7%.

Memecoins jump or act as beta bets when ether (ETH) or bitcoin rise because they’re highly speculative assets with amplified sensitivity to broader crypto market trends.

Retail traders often see relief in majors as a signal of bullish sentiment across the crypto ecosystem — chasing higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities like memecoins, which are typically cheaper and can deliver rapid gains in relatively shorter periods.

AI Tokens Remain Stable Despite ‘Bubble’ Talk

Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence (AI) majors are stable after Alibaba’s Joe Tsai said he sees sign of a bubble forming in the ecosystem, the category is up 4.5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Investment in AI appears to be occurring ahead of current demand, Tsai believes.

NEAR protocol, the largest AI token by market cap, is flat in trading today, but up 14% in the last week as the market continues to positively digest news that Coinbase and the biggest names in AI were working together to collaboratively develop AI agent technology.

Market makers are middlemen who are responsible for creating liquidity so trades can take place smoothly without big delays or price swings. They do this by quoting prices to both buyers (bid) and sellers (ask) and taking the opposite side to the transactions.

The market maker, which wasn't identified, made a $38 million profit when the MOVE tokens were first offered for trading on the exchange, Binance said Tuesday. Instead of meeting its obligations to ensure sufficient order size and place orders for both bid and ask prices, it placed sell orders for 66 million MOVE tokens one day after the initial listing and “little buy orders.”

One-sided market-making activity is widely considered illicit and illegal, and Binance reiterated that strict rules are in place for defaulters.

The entity was offboarded on March 18, and both the Movement Labs and Movement Foundation teams were informed of the “irregularities with their market maker,” Binance said in the post. The market maker is no longer able to participate on the exchange and all proceeds were frozen to compensate users, whose details will be available at a later date.

“Any project-authorized market makers who do not comply with or breach such principles and rules, Binance will take further actions against such market makers to best protect our users,” the exchange said.

This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin, and I’ve operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI. The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included.

With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability. This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets. Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit, and they remain crypto’s truest (read: only) demonstration of real tangible value to date. As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity. Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer.

Otherwise, there’s AI. There’s TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There’s open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. There’s open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI (we’ll get to that in a minute…). In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications.

This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.

This shouldn't surprise us. While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world.

What’s more? A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility. While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation (there have been calls to get grounded in “fundamentals” as of late, but we’ll see if it has legs…). This isn't necessarily a criticism – meme value is real value in many ways – but it highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry.

This doesn't mean crypto’s rekt. In fact, blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack. But they'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services, rather than as standalone products.

Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again: distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation and data provenance, tokenized access to computational resources, decentralized storage of training data, and transparent reward mechanisms for contribution. Distributed computing and DePIN architectures as well as transparent verification systems have proven their utility. But – and this is crucial – they'll do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure.

We could envision protocols built using blockchains generating revenue through licensing or usage and being paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins – a model in stark contrast to the token-as-the-product model currently a la mode.

For founders and teams currently focused on crypto-native applications, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is expanding beyond the comfortable but limited crypto ecosystem, represented primarily by Crypto Twitter and [Insert Your Favorite Conference Here]. The opportunity is participating in the genuine technological revolution that AI represents.

What does this mean in practice? First, teams need to start thinking bigger. Founders should be asking themselves how AI can transform their target market, and then consider how crypto technology might help enable that transformation. This means fundamentally changing how we approach building and marketing crypto products.

Instead of starting with tokenization, tokenomics, or even blockchains in general, begin with real-world problems that AI could solve. Only then should teams identify where decentralized systems could enhance the AI, and implement these pieces of the stack where they genuinely add value.

Leverage crypto where it makes sense, especially where it can mitigate costs or improve efficiency, but keep the focus squarely on delivering value through intelligence and automation.

For example, companies could use blockchains to create decentralized marketplaces for critical processes, making AI more accessible and cost-effective (Vast.ai, a Nazaré portfolio company, does this for GPUs, and Orchid has been re-defining the internet and privacy with decentralized markets for years).

Agents might also use cryptographic verification or privacy systems to safely and securely act on our behalf online using our login information, identities and credit cards, or even private keys and wallets on-chain.

In both cases, crypto serves the larger goal of making AI systems more effective and trustworthy.

The companies that will thrive in this new landscape are those that understand this dynamic. They will either build AI-first products that incorporate crypto where it adds genuine value, or they will build crypto services explicitly designed to improve AI-based products or services. The market won’t support teams running around wielding the hammer that is blockchains treating everything like a nail.

Ultimately, this is about properly understanding the relationship between crypto and AI. The future belongs to AI as the primary framework while thoughtfully incorporating crypto where appropriate.

For much of the crypto industry, this is a moment of truth and a profound recalibration. We can either cling to the narrative of crypto as a standalone revolution and speculative tokens as retail products, or we can embrace crypto's supporting role as excellent technology in service of AI.

The latter may be less glamorous (and perhaps less valuable to investment portfolios), but it's ultimately more likely to create real lasting value and impact.

The sooner we accept this reality, the better positioned we'll be to contribute meaningfully to the technological transformation that's already underway. It's time for the crypto industry to think bigger than itself.

If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.

The fund, officially the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, combines a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries with the settlement and transfer capabilities of blockchain. Since its introduction on Ethereum in 2023, the fund has drawn in $1.7 billion and is on track to cross $2 billion by early April, according to Securitize.

“In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, in a statement. “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.”

Money market funds typically allow investors to earn interest on idle cash, but they come with trading limitations such as limited operating hours. Blockchain versions like BUIDL allow for constant access.

More than 65% of the total open interest is concentrated in call options that provide buyers with an asymmetric bullish exposure, while the rest is in put options offering downside protection.

Quarterly expiries of such massive magnitudes are known to breed market volatility, but that may not be the case this time, going by the continued decline in the bitcoin 30-day implied volatility index (DVOL). The index has dropped from an annualized 62% to 48% in the weeks leading up to the expiry, suggesting subdued volatility expectations.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the annualized perpetual futures basis of around 5% on the exchange, signalling a calmer funding environment.

""Despite the size of the expiry, the overall setup—low DVOL, moderate basis, and balanced options positioning—points to a relatively subdued expiry unless external catalysts emerge,"" Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk.

The exploit focused on so-called ""cauldrons,"" isolated lending markets in Abracadabra where users can borrow against crypto collateral. These particular cauldrons relied on GM tokens, which represent liquidity positions in GMX, a decentralized exchange platform.

GMX distanced itself from the incident. In a post on X, an account associated with the exchange said that GMX’s contracts themselves were unaffected. The team later said the breach was “solely related to the Abracadabra/Spell cauldrons,” which used GM tokens as collateral but did not involve GMX’s core infrastructure.

In a statement on X, Abracadabra confirmed the exploit and said core contributors and engineers were investigating the incident to its “fully audited” cauldron. The protocol noted that gmCauldrons had been audited by Guardian Audits — the same firm that audited GMX contracts — and were part of a broader security infrastructure involving monitoring and response tools.

The protocol offered the attacker a 20% bug bounty and invited them to negotiate via email or an on-chain message.

However, a technical update by Hyperliquid is making that process easier for both developers and users, with the direct linking of tokens on HyperCore and HyperEVM platforms now being possible.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

HyperCore is its native platform for spot assets (think tokens you can trade directly), and HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network that executes smart contracts on Ethereum.

Tokens on HyperCore, dubbed “Core spot,” can be linked to their counterparts on HyperEVM and are called “EVM spot.” Once linked, users can transfer them using simple actions — like a “spotSend” on HyperCore or a standard ERC-20 transfer on HyperEVM.

Linking a core spot token to an EVM spot token isn’t automatic. The process starts with the token’s “spot deployer,” or the entity behind it, which ensures the token’s supply matches up on both sides of the transaction.

Then, they send a “spot deploy action” to HyperCore, proposing an ERC-20 contract on HyperEVM to pair with their token.

Next comes verification. If the EVM contract was deployed directly by an individual, they confirm it with a specific transaction nonce (a unique number assigned to each transfer on a blockchain).

If it was deployed by another contract (say, a multisig for added security), the contract’s first storage slot must point to the HyperCore deployer’s address. Finally, a “finalize” action locks it all in place — ensuring both sides agree on the link.

Allowing linking lets users tap into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem — such as lending, borrowing, and trading — without leaving the Hyperliquid ecosystem entirely.

Why Does it Matter?

But how does that matter? It’s because moving tokens between ecosystems isn’t a straightforward process.

Take Ethereum as an example, with billions locked in protocols like Aave or Uniswap. But if someone wants to send a token from another network, say Solana, they need a bridge — a third-party service that locks your tokens on one side and mints a wrapped version on the other. That comes with a security risk, as bridges remain one of the most exploited blockchain-based services in recent years.

The above friction exists even within Ethereum’s ecosystem, as moving assets between its mainnet and layer 2 blockchain (such as Optimism or Arbitrum) isn’t always seamless.

Hyperliquid’s approach is different from just bolting on a bridge. HyperCore is a high-speed, purpose-built platform for spot trading, while HyperEVM is an EVM-compatible layer that taps into Ethereum’s DeFi toolkit.

By letting tokens move directly between them — without a third-party intermediary — developers can create products that cut out the technical chops required to move assets (which is easy for heavy crypto users, but may be challenging for beginners).

Tokens like HYPE, HyperEVM’s gas token, don’t need a separate ERC20 contract to work on both sides. Send HYPE from HyperCore, and it lands as native gas on HyperEVM. Send it back to HyperCore via a system address (0x222), and it’s credited instantly based on an event log.

It’s not perfect just yet; however, Hyperliquid warned in its technical documents that risks of unverified contracts or supply mismatches exist as of Tuesday.",coindesk

Willemstad, Curacao, March 25th, 2025, Chainwire

Whale.io has announced plans to migrate its Whale NFT collection from the TON blockchain to the Solana blockchain. The cross-chain transition aims to expand the project’s interoperability and accessibility by leveraging Solana’s infrastructure. This move represents a strategic shift in blockchain alignment for one of the more prominent NFT collections launched in recent years.

Initial Launch on TON Blockchain

The Whale NFT collection was initially launched on the TON blockchain, where all 20,000 NFTs were minted at no cost within hours of release. The rapid minting reflected strong early engagement from the community. Over the following year, the collection became one of the most visible projects on Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace. According to platform data, the floor price increased approximately sevenfold during this period.

Hosted on Getgems.io (collection available here), Whale NFTs quickly became a cultural phenomenon within the TON ecosystem. With eye-catching designs and varying rarities, Whale.io’s collectibles became popular display pictures across Telegram, where the team has continued to deliver value, innovation, and utility to keep the project thriving.

Buybacks, Supply Reductions, and Fee-Free Trading

The Whale team has implemented several mechanisms to manage supply and maintain engagement with the collection, including token buybacks and supply reductions via burns. These practices have been part of the project’s ongoing strategy on the TON blockchain, and the team has indicated that similar measures will be introduced following the migration to Solana.

In addition, Whale NFTs have been available for trading with zero gas fees on supported platforms, a feature that has contributed to repeated appearances on trending lists within Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace. With the upcoming transition to Solana—known for its high throughput and low transaction costs—the collection is expected to remain active across major NFT marketplaces within the Solana ecosystem.

Utility That Packs a Punch

Whale NFTs aren’t just pretty pictures—they’re powerhouses of utility, deeply integrated into the Whale ecosystem. At the heart of this is the Wheel of Whales miniapp on Telegram, a play-to-earn sensation that’s taking the crypto gaming world by storm. This innovative game offers players the exclusive chance to participate in the distribution of Whale tokens, making it a golden opportunity for anyone looking to dive into the project’s rewards system.

Owning a Whale NFT isn’t just a flex—it’s a ticket to amplified benefits within Wheel of Whales. Holders enjoy boosted earnings and a suite of in-game perks, giving them a significant edge in this addictive play-to-earn game. With rarities ranging from common to ultra-rare, each NFT brings its own unique flair and value to the game, making every Whale a prized possession. Highest rarity Golden NFT prices go up to 2000 TON that equals over 7000 USDT.

Bridging to Solana: A New Frontier

Whale.io has announced its intention to bridge its NFT collection to the Solana blockchain, recognized for its scalability and active NFT ecosystem. The transition is designed to expand the project’s reach by integrating with Solana’s infrastructure and user base. According to the team, this cross-chain move reflects a broader strategy to enhance accessibility and engagement across multiple blockchain environments.

https://cryptobriefing.com,Beincom kicks off 300M BIC token airdrop to drive Web3 adoption,https://cryptobriefing.com/beincom-kicks-off-300m-bic-token-airdrop-to-drive-web3-adoption/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:21:41 GMT","Share this article

Tortola, VG1110 British Virgin Islands, March 25th, 2025, Chainwire

Beincom, the pioneering SocialFi project, has announced its upcoming 300 million BIC token airdrop. Beincom introduces mechanisms aimed at safeguarding new token holders and highlights the multifaceted utility of its BIC Token within its ecosystem.

Beincom and BIC Token – A Breakthrough In the SocialFi Era

Beincom is a next-generation social hub and community platform, powered by the friendliness of the web2 interface and the power of web3 decentralization. By integrating blockchain, tokenization, NFTs, and Social Hub, Beincom empowers creators, communities, and businesses.

At the heart of Beincom’s ecosystem is BIC Token, the utility token that fuels all activities and engagement within the platform. More than just a token, $BIC incentivizes contributions and grants exclusive benefits, creating a sustainable and transparent economy for long-term growth.

The total supply of BIC Tokens is fixed at 5 billion tokens. Unlike many other projects where the core team holds a substantial share, Beincom’s core team allocation is capped at just 6% of the total supply. This reduces the risk of market manipulation and ensures a decentralized ecosystem.

Beincom Announces Long-Term Token Distribution Plan via Airdrop

Beincom has unveiled a 50-month token distribution initiative, allocating 6% of its total token supply—equivalent to 300 million BIC tokens—through a structured airdrop campaign. Under the program, 6 million BIC tokens will be distributed monthly. The first scheduled airdrop is anticipated to begin in May 2025 (date to be confirmed).

Participants can earn Medals—platform-specific reward points—by contributing to the ecosystem through activities such as community engagement and content creation. These Medals can be converted into BIC Tokens once the airdrop officially commences. Notably, accumulated Medals will not be reset, enabling continued eligibility throughout the subsequent 49 months of distribution. Further information is available on Beincom’s official website.

This structured, long-term approach differs from conventional short-term airdrop models, with the aim of facilitating broader participation, consistent engagement, and gradual distribution across the ecosystem.

Liquidity Fee Protection – A 35% Free To Prevent Market Dumps

Beincom is built on Arbitrum, a leading Layer 2 scaling solution that enhances speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for blockchain transactions. By leveraging Arbitrum’s technology, BIC Token transactions remain fast, low-cost, and highly scalable, ensuring seamless user experiences across the Beincom ecosystem.

To ensure a fair launch and protect token holders, Beincom has introduced a dynamic liquidity protection model. Initially, a 35% early withdrawal fee discourages quick sell-offs, but this gradually reduces by 1% each month, reaching 0% after 35 months.

BIC Token – The Economic Engine Driving Beincom Ecosystem

Beyond a transaction medium, BIC Token fuels the entire Beincom ecosystem with its diverse use cases. Here are key features that create value and foster a sustainable token-based economy:

Premium Features : Users can unlock advanced creation tools, analytics, and priority support with BIC Tokens, enhancing their platform experience.

: Businesses can use BIC Tokens to secure ad placements and sponsored opportunities within the ecosystem. Token-Paid Direct Messaging: Sending a prioritized message with the cost of some token, a feature to nurture meaningful conversation and filtered connection.

By integrating real-world utilities and a seamless Web3 experience, BIC Token moves beyond the speculation, creating a self-sustaining, decentralized digital economy.

Beincom’s Vision and Roadmap: Pioneering the Future of Community Engagement

Beincom is transforming the landscape of online communities by seamlessly bridging Web2 with Web3. By eliminating algorithmic barriers and prioritizing direct, meaningful engagement, users are empowered to take control of their digital presence like never before.

As part of its promising roadmap, Beincom will expand the utility of BIC Token, enhance NFT integrations, and introduce new monetization models that drive value for both creators and users. Key upcoming developments include Deep-Ads, Token-Paid Direct Messaging (TPDM V1), and Social Hub (V1)—a game-changing ecosystem designed to consolidate and strengthen online communities.

“Beincom does not compete with traditional social platforms—it rises above them. While others prioritize maximizing profits, we empower users with true ownership, meaningful connections, and a decentralized future. Because in the end, everyone needs a place to be in.” — shared Mr. Tran Dang Khoa, Chief Vision Officer of Beincom project.

With a strategic vision and passionate roadmap, Beincom is committed to continuously developing, innovating, and creating a sustainable ecosystem for all users.

https://decrypt.co,Berachain Jumps 14% as Proof of Liquidity Rewards Go Live,https://decrypt.co/311486/berachain-jumps-proof-of-liquidity-rewards,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 14:28:10 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

In a major milestone for the network, Berachain, a bear-themed layer-1 blockchain, went live with rewards for its proof of liquidity consensus mechanism on Monday. A day after the launch, the BERA token has gained 14%, according to CoinGecko, and broken into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Proof of liquidity is a variation of the proof of stake consensus mechanism used on Ethereum. It uses two tokens in BERA for gas and network security as well as BGT for governance and rewards. Validators stake BERA so they can propose blocks and earn rewards in BGT, which then get distributed to reward vaults.

Validators supply the liquidity to these reward vaults so that other users can stake assets, like BERA, and earn BGT rewards. For supplying the liquidity, validators are provided with a receipt token which can also be staked into reward vaults—thus creating aligned incentives to secure the network via staking. This feature went live on Monday, opening 37 reward vaults and starting the distribution of BGT across the ecosystem.

BGT, the governance token, can be used to vote on proposals.

Later this week, a second batch of reward vault whitelist requests will be voted on. The network claims the first batch were selected based on “economic value, security, and alignment with Berachain’s ecosystem.”

Proof of Liquidity is live. Berachain's block rewards now work for you, fueling the applications you use and rewarding economic activity. The era of earning more starts today. pic.twitter.com/MgfOgqUe70 — Berachain Foundation 🐻⛓ (@berachain) March 24, 2025

Clearly, the market reacted well to the news as the BERA token climbed 14% on the day and 30% on the week, according to CoinGecko data. That pushed the token as high as $8.03 earlier this morning. As of this writing, BERA is changing hands for $7.89 and still the 100th largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $858 million.

“This marks a major step in Berachain’s governance evolution,” pseudonymous Berachain founder Homme Bera wrote in a blog post. “[As we are] moving from a limited launch within native BEX pools to a more open, application-first ecosystem where projects can now drive sustainable growth through [proof of liquidity].”

Berachain launched its mainnet in February, airdropping $1.17 billion worth of BERA tokens to users who participated in its pre-launch initiatives. However, this was a fairly limited launch with only its Berchain native decentralized exchange (also referred to as BEX) liquidity pools available to deposit assets into.

The launch of the first batch of reward vaults is a significant step in what the network is branding as the official launch of proof of liquidity.

“This is just the beginning,” Homme Bera said, explaining that by the end of the week a second batch of reward vaults will have been reviewed. “With [proof of liquidity] live and governance scaling, dapps now have a permissionless way to attract liquidity and users, while BGT holders ultimately dictate where incentives flow.”

The native token Crypto.com outpaced most digital assets Monday after Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans to develop exchange-traded funds with the exchange.

Cronos (CRO) is up 30% over the last 24 hours to $0.10, CoinGecko data shows, following a significant surge on the announcement of Trump’s company, which runs Truth Social.

Trading volume for CRO exploded almost six times from $21 million to $126 million by Monday evening as traders raced to capitalize on the presidential connection.

The daily transactions chart from CronoScan shows that transactions have more than doubled from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000.

ETFs for Bitcoin, Cronos, and diverse industries

The alliance between the pair seeks to create “inventive funds” with firms that “concentrate on rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy,"" TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement.

TMTG also revealed that the ETFs underway would include exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and ""diverse industries such as energy,"" contradicting earlier announcements that omitted the inclusion of the CRO token.

Products will launch under the ""Truth.Fi"" brand across U.S., European, and Asian markets, pending regulatory approval in the hope of aligning with a strategy underscored by President Trump’s economic agenda.

The arrangement places President Trump's media company in business with a Singapore-based firm that previously faced SEC scrutiny just five months ago.

The SEC filed notice in October last year that it intended to sue Crypto.com for operating an unregistered securities exchange, allegations the company firmly rejected and countered in a lawsuit of its own.

By December, the crypto firm had dropped its suit right when its CEO met with then-President-elect Trump.

In the same month, Trump transferred roughly $4 billion worth of his roughly 53% stake in TMTG through a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr., making him the company's largest shareholder of the media venture, SEC filings show.

https://decrypt.co,GameStop Rumored to Buy Bitcoin After CEO Poses With BTC Bull Michael Saylor,https://decrypt.co/311505/gamestop-rumored-buy-bitcoin-ceo-poses-michael-saylor,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:50:20 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

GameStop may be credited as the first meme stock, but the video game retailer's CEO seems to be hinting that the company could soon embrace Bitcoin.

The company is set to report Q4 earnings when the market closes at 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday. Analysts expect the Texas-based firm to disclose an earnings per share mark of $0.08, based on two analyst ratings compiled by FactSet.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending the video game retailer become a “premier Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector” by converting its cash reserves into Bitcoin.

GameStop Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen acknowledged Strive's proposal on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Letter received,” he said, without elaborating further.

Several companies in the U.S. have embraced Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, but the practice was pioneered by Strategy, which has been buying Bitcoin since 2020 and now holds 506,137 BTC valued at $44.2 billion.

Before acknowledging Strive’s proposal last month, Cohen posed alongside Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a photo he posted to X.

Cohen, who founded the online pet supplies store Chewy, has stockpiled cash at the video game retailer since stepping into the role nearly a year and a half ago. He was first named the company’s executive chairman after Matt Furlong, who tried unsuccessfully to launch NFT collectibles, was terminated.

As of Nov. 2, GameStop held $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $900 million a year prior, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The company’s stock price jumped last month after people familiar with the matter told CNBC that the company was considering buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, GME is trading for $25.10 per share after having lost 2% since the opening ball.

GameStop did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

In early 2021, GameStop became a flashpoint for retail investors. Legions of users on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets—including Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty—partook in a coordinated effort to bet against Wall Street firms and trigger a short squeeze.

A short squeeze can occur when short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the stock price up further. GameStop’s stock price peaked in 2021 around $95, after trading around $5 a month before, according to Nasdaq.

The company’s stock changed hands at $25.35 on Tuesday morning Eastern, up 90% from a year ago. Still, GameStop shares have swooned 17% from $30.66 at the start of this year.

Gill’s return to posting online stoked interest in GameStop last year, as the influencer dropped cryptic videos and screenshots of GameStop positions on Reddit. He has not posted to X since Jan. 22, when he shared a video of a sad, lonely looking dog.

Years ago, Saylor was linked to several firms adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, including Tesla. The automaker owned by Elon Musk disclosed its first Bitcoin purchase in February 2021, months after Saylor publicly urged the firm to buy Bitcoin.

https://decrypt.co,Deadfellaz Creators Unveil New Tool to Link Real Life to Blockchain,https://decrypt.co/311413/deadfellaz-creators-unveil-new-tool-link-real-life-blockchain,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:01:03 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

DFZ Labs, the creators of the Ethereum NFT project Deadfellaz, will launch a new asset verification tool that allows users to connect online and offline assets without signing blind transactions or smart contract approvals.

Coldlink, now in beta, enables blockchain users to connect their blockchain address to any asset in Web2, Web3, or real life without incurring the security risk of blind signing or smart contract approvals, DFZ Labs said.

“To ‘Coldlink’ something is to connect any digital asset safely to anything else without granting permissions to the wallet holding the asset,” DFZ Labs pseudonymous CEO Betty told Decrypt.

“Among many other features, it allows digital asset ownership to be acknowledged and rewarded in real life without any complicated Web3 infrastructure or dev work,” they added.

The solution has been in the works since 2022 when DFZ Labs began seeking a way for its community to safely and securely gain access to gaming developments without putting their assets at risk.

Unlocking use cases

With Coldlink, users will be able to unlock a variety of new blockchain and real-world connections.

For example, they could connect a blockchain address to a PO box in order to receive a physical item without revealing their identity or connect a digital music collectible to a physical concert ticket number in order to gain rewards from an event organizer.

While other products like Delegate.xyz have provided users a way to secure on-chain assets by linking together wallets, Betty told Decrypt that Coldlink is more than delegation, and works very differently.

“There is no smart contract interaction, no blind signing—creating a safer, quicker, cheaper, and more interoperable solution that can be plugged into existing infrastructure to solve many problems,” she said.

Instead, Coldlink uses unique transaction markers paired with database entries to link the assets.

“Coldlink verification essentially works by pairing a serialized unique tracer transaction with a serialized unique database entry for each Coldlink submission,” she continued, adding that the technology has been feasible for a long time–but DFZ labs is the first to handle it in this particular way.

For the DFZ Labs CEO, Coldlink is especially useful for participants of communities with rare or expensive digital items—like CryptoPunks, which previously may have been reluctant to connect their wallets or sign transactions to verify ownership of an NFT.

“You can immediately activate communities that have so far been unable to casually participate in anything that requires digital ownership,"" Betty said. ""This is especially useful if you own rare or expensive items such as Punks.”

“Many web3 activations, no matter how valuable or entertaining, saw huge participation fall off with collectors simply being unwilling to connect their wallet to anything or use the current delegation options,” they added.

Coldlink will start with a public load test that allows anyone with a Solana or Ethereum address to create links to another Solana or Ethereum address at Coldlink.xyz. Because creating a Coldlink requires a transaction to verify an address, users can only create links from addresses they own. However, a coldlink creator can connect it to any other asset.

“This means while nobody can create links from your wallet, they can create links to your wallet, essentially gifting you access,” said the Coldlink CEO. “This allows for actions like giving your friend access to your Ape for a party you can’t attend.”

New blockchains, applications, and link types, including those to offline assets, are expected to be rolled out and unveiled weekly while more than 150 top projects like PunksDAO, NFC Lisbon, and others are expected to test the product’s advanced custom integrations.

“Digital asset ownership (both on and off-chain) has increased exponentially in recent years, with online spending on digital assets projected to continue to increase, especially in gaming and fashion,” Betty said.

“Before Coldlink there wasn’t a universally wallet agnostic, blockchain agnostic way of moving across all of the spaces we inhabit with the digital assets we own safely,"" they added.

https://decrypt.co,Kentucky Passes Bitcoin and Ethereum Self-Custody Law,https://decrypt.co/311466/kentucky-bitcoin-ethereum-self-custody-law,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:28:18 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beashear yesterday signed House Bill 701, which offers greater protections for users who self-custody their Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

To self-custody Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency means that a user has full control over the private key needed to authorize transactions. It's more like having cash in a wallet than using a debit card to authorize your bank to send someone money.

Users who prefer that freedom also carry sole responsibility for protecting their holdings. A man in Wales has spent 12 years trying to get permission to excavate a landfill to retrieve a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin worth $696 million at today's price.

But if that's the risk users are willing to take, the state of Kentucky wants to protect their rights.

Crucially, the new law received unanimous support at 91-0 in the House during a vote on Feb. 28 and again in the Senate on March 13 with 37-0, before being approved by the governor.

This new law will guarantee the rights of individuals to hold and manage cryptocurrencies in their self-hosted wallets. This should mean those in Kentucky can gain total control over their cryptocurrency, without any issues of interference.

As such, this means local governments will not be able to enact discriminatory laws that unfairly target crypto mining.

The law also clarifies that neither mining nor staking rewards are classified as securities. And operating blockchain nodes and staking will be exempt from Kentucky's money transmitter regulations.

Kentucky is also reviewing House Bill 376, which proposes the creation of a crypto reserve for the state. This would allow investment of up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets with a market cap of $750 billion.

Other states considering Bitcoin reserves

This new Kentucky law comes as a growing number of states are moving towards greater embrace of cryptocurrency.

A third of states are currently exploring crypto for public funds, with 19 states in ongoing legislative considerations.

Notably Utah passed a bill, on January 28, that will authorize the state treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain public funds to ""qualifying digital assets."" This is as long as they meet the main requirement of having over $500 billion in market capitalization, averaged over the past 12 months.

New Mexico is another example of Bitcoin support with Senator Anthony L. Thornton introducing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB275) on February 4, proposing a 5% allocation of public funds to Bitcoin.

At time of publishing there are 16 states actively being tracked by the Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

It's worth noting that while there is interest here, most are capped at 10%, and there are still the majority of states that are not looking into crypto at this stage.

And some states—like Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania—have already rejected the efforts to convert tax dollars into Bitcoin.

Willemstad, Curacao, March 25th, 2025, Chainwire

Whale.io has announced plans to migrate its Whale NFT collection from the TON blockchain to the Solana blockchain. The cross-chain transition aims to expand the project's interoperability and accessibility by leveraging Solana’s infrastructure. This move represents a strategic shift in blockchain alignment for one of the more prominent NFT collections launched in recent years.

Initial Launch on TON Blockchain

The Whale NFT collection was initially launched on the TON blockchain, where all 20,000 NFTs were minted at no cost within hours of release. The rapid minting reflected strong early engagement from the community. Over the following year, the collection became one of the most visible projects on Getgems, TON's leading NFT marketplace. According to platform data, the floor price increased approximately sevenfold during this period.

Hosted on Getgems.io (collection available here), Whale NFTs quickly became a cultural phenomenon within the TON ecosystem. With eye-catching designs and varying rarities, Whale.io’s collectibles became popular display pictures across Telegram, where the team has continued to deliver value, innovation, and utility to keep the project thriving.

Buybacks, Supply Reductions, and Fee-Free Trading

The Whale team has implemented several mechanisms to manage supply and maintain engagement with the collection, including token buybacks and supply reductions via burns. These practices have been part of the project’s ongoing strategy on the TON blockchain, and the team has indicated that similar measures will be introduced following the migration to Solana.

In addition, Whale NFTs have been available for trading with zero gas fees on supported platforms, a feature that has contributed to repeated appearances on trending lists within Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace. With the upcoming transition to Solana—known for its high throughput and low transaction costs—the collection is expected to remain active across major NFT marketplaces within the Solana ecosystem.

Utility That Packs a Punch

Whale NFTs aren’t just pretty pictures—they’re powerhouses of utility, deeply integrated into the Whale ecosystem. At the heart of this is the Wheel of Whales miniapp on Telegram, a play-to-earn sensation that’s taking the crypto gaming world by storm. This innovative game offers players the exclusive chance to participate in the distribution of Whale tokens, making it a golden opportunity for anyone looking to dive into the project’s rewards system.

Owning a Whale NFT isn’t just a flex—it’s a ticket to amplified benefits within Wheel of Whales. Holders enjoy boosted earnings and a suite of in-game perks, giving them a significant edge in this addictive play-to-earn game. With rarities ranging from common to ultra-rare, each NFT brings its own unique flair and value to the game, making every Whale a prized possession. Highest rarity Golden NFT prices go up to 2000 TON that equals over 7000 USDT.

Bridging to Solana: A New Frontier

Whale.io has announced its intention to bridge its NFT collection to the Solana blockchain, recognized for its scalability and active NFT ecosystem. The transition is designed to expand the project’s reach by integrating with Solana’s infrastructure and user base. According to the team, this cross-chain move reflects a broader strategy to enhance accessibility and engagement across multiple blockchain environments.

The bridge from TON to Solana represents an effort to connect two blockchain ecosystems, enabling broader accessibility for the Whale NFT collection. Whale.io will bring its established framework—which has included gas-free trading, supply reduction mechanisms, and various utility features—into the Solana environment. With Solana’s low transaction costs and high-speed processing, the transition is intended to streamline the user experience and support increased activity across NFT marketplaces.

Bridge Signals Strategic Expansion Across NFT and Gaming Ecosystems

The Whale NFT bridge is a landmark moment for the broader NFT and blockchain gaming industries. It showcases how projects can evolve, adapt, and thrive across ecosystems while delivering consistent value to their communities. For Whale holders, this is a chance to ride the tide of a project that’s already proven its worth and is now gearing up for an even bigger splash. For newcomers, it’s an invitation to dive into a collection that’s equal parts art, investment, and entertainment.

Preparing for the Solana Bridge

With the upcoming bridge to Solana, Whale.io is transitioning its NFT collection into a new blockchain environment. The project has encouraged community members, NFT collectors, and Telegram gaming participants to follow official channels for updates regarding the bridging timeline, marketplace listings, and upcoming developments within the Wheel of Whales ecosystem. Additional information about the bridging process is available at whale.io/thedailyfinn/nftbridging. Following its presence on the TON blockchain, the collection will now be accessible within Solana’s NFT ecosystem.

https://decrypt.co,Beincom Kicks Off 300M BIC Token Airdrop To Drive Web3 Adoption,https://decrypt.co/311465/beincom-kicks-off-300m-bic-token-airdrop-to-drive-web3-adoption,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:25:28 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Tortola, VG1110 British Virgin Islands, March 25th, 2025, Chainwire

Beincom, the pioneering SocialFi project, has announced its upcoming 300 million BIC token airdrop. Beincom introduces mechanisms aimed at safeguarding new token holders and highlights the multifaceted utility of its BIC Token within its ecosystem.

Beincom and BIC Token – A Breakthrough In the SocialFi Era

Beincom is a next-generation social hub and community platform, powered by the friendliness of the web2 interface and the power of web3 decentralization. By integrating blockchain, tokenization, NFTs, and Social Hub, Beincom empowers creators, communities, and businesses.

At the heart of Beincom’s ecosystem is BIC Token, the utility token that fuels all activities and engagement within the platform. More than just a token, $BIC incentivizes contributions and grants exclusive benefits, creating a sustainable and transparent economy for long-term growth.

The total supply of BIC Tokens is fixed at 5 billion tokens. Unlike many other projects where the core team holds a substantial share, Beincom’s core team allocation is capped at just 6% of the total supply. This reduces the risk of market manipulation and ensures a decentralized ecosystem.

Beincom Announces Long-Term Token Distribution Plan via Airdrop

Beincom has unveiled a 50-month token distribution initiative, allocating 6% of its total token supply—equivalent to 300 million BIC tokens—through a structured airdrop campaign. Under the program, 6 million BIC tokens will be distributed monthly. The first scheduled airdrop is anticipated to begin in May 2025 (date to be confirmed).

Participants can earn Medals—platform-specific reward points—by contributing to the ecosystem through activities such as community engagement and content creation. These Medals can be converted into BIC Tokens once the airdrop officially commences. Notably, accumulated Medals will not be reset, enabling continued eligibility throughout the subsequent 49 months of distribution. Further information is available on Beincom’s official website.

This structured, long-term approach differs from conventional short-term airdrop models, with the aim of facilitating broader participation, consistent engagement, and gradual distribution across the ecosystem.

Liquidity Fee Protection – A 35% Free To Prevent Market Dumps

Beincom is built on Arbitrum, a leading Layer 2 scaling solution that enhances speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness for blockchain transactions. By leveraging Arbitrum’s technology, BIC Token transactions remain fast, low-cost, and highly scalable, ensuring seamless user experiences across the Beincom ecosystem.

To ensure a fair launch and protect token holders, Beincom has introduced a dynamic liquidity protection model. Initially, a 35% early withdrawal fee discourages quick sell-offs, but this gradually reduces by 1% each month, reaching 0% after 35 months.

BIC Token – The Economic Engine Driving Beincom Ecosystem

Beyond a transaction medium, BIC Token fuels the entire Beincom ecosystem with its diverse use cases. Here are key features that create value and foster a sustainable token-based economy:

Premium Features : Users can unlock advanced creation tools, analytics, and priority support with BIC Tokens, enhancing their platform experience.

: Users can unlock advanced creation tools, analytics, and priority support with BIC Tokens, enhancing their platform experience. Digital Asset Marketplace : BIC Tokens power transactions for minting, buying, and selling innovative NFTs, which act as a protective mechanism for digital identity and reputation.

: Businesses can use BIC Tokens to secure ad placements and sponsored opportunities within the ecosystem. Token-Paid Direct Messaging: Sending a prioritized message with the cost of some token, a feature to nurture meaningful conversation and filtered connection.

By integrating real-world utilities and a seamless Web3 experience, BIC Token moves beyond the speculation, creating a self-sustaining, decentralized digital economy.

Beincom’s Vision and Roadmap: Pioneering the Future of Community Engagement

Beincom is transforming the landscape of online communities by seamlessly bridging Web2 with Web3. By eliminating algorithmic barriers and prioritizing direct, meaningful engagement, users are empowered to take control of their digital presence like never before.

As part of its promising roadmap, Beincom will expand the utility of BIC Token, enhance NFT integrations, and introduce new monetization models that drive value for both creators and users. Key upcoming developments include Deep-Ads, Token-Paid Direct Messaging (TPDM V1), and Social Hub (V1)—a game-changing ecosystem designed to consolidate and strengthen online communities.

“Beincom does not compete with traditional social platforms—it rises above them. While others prioritize maximizing profits, we empower users with true ownership, meaningful connections, and a decentralized future. Because in the end, everyone needs a place to be in.” — shared Mr. Tran Dang Khoa, Chief Vision Officer of Beincom project.

With a strategic vision and passionate roadmap, Beincom is committed to continuously developing, innovating, and creating a sustainable ecosystem for all users.

Circle Internet Financial, the Boston-headquartered U.S. firm behind the USDC stablecoin, is deepening its ties to Japan’s burgeoning digital assets market.

Japanese SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange operating as a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, a major internet-based financial conglomerate in the country, is expected to play a key role in Circle's commitments in Japan.

After receiving regulatory approval earlier this month, SBI VC Trade now plans to leverage USDC in Japan, marking the first token of its kind approved under Japan’s stablecoin regulatory framework.

Circle has established a Japanese entity, Circle Japan KK, to support the stablecoin's local operations. SBI VC Trade is set to launch USDC trading on March 26, 2025, the pair announced Monday.

Domestic exchanges Binance Japan, Bitbank, and BitFlyer also plan to list and distribute USDC in the near future, per the statement.

Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said on X the development would unlock “tremendous opportunities” for Japan’s digital assets markets, powering payments, cross-border finance, commerce, and FX, among other use cases for USDC.

The approval builds on a partnership between Circle and SBI Holdings that began in 2023, combining USDC distribution with banking and Web3 technology for the Japanese market.

USDC is fully reserved and backed 100% by cash and cash-equivalent assets, with reserves held at regulated financial institutions that publish third-party monthly attestations, according to documentation from Circle.

It also goes beyond just introducing a new crypto product in the country, Jay Jo, a senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt.

Once launched, besides the usual listing and trading on exchanges, Japanese companies could “offer custody services and develop various stablecoin-based businesses,” Jo explained.

While the country “still prohibits trust-based yen stablecoins,” future regulatory developments could help shape where its crypto and digital asset sector could go, Jo said.

However, the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen could create market dynamics, given the current tensions between it and the U.S. dollar.

If the yen shows sustained weakness, “Japanese investors might shift to USDC” as a hedge and potentially “increase selling pressure on JPY,” Jo added.

“Easier access to dollar-denominated assets” could lead to accelerated outflows from traditional yen investments, Jo said. This could happen “especially if interest rate differentials remain wide.”

Polymarket, the blockchain-based betting platform, has launched on Solana, allowing users to make deposits using the network, the company announced on Monday via X.

Known for its real-money prediction markets, Polymarket enables users to wager on a broad range of topics, adjusting odds dynamically based on market activity.

Current high-profile bets include the political futures of global leaders, the outcome of Canada’s upcoming election, and cryptocurrency price movements.

More unconventional wagers include whether Jesus Christ will return in 2025, currently assigned a 3% probability.

The number of users engaging with blockchain-based betting platforms has been on the rise, with aspirations of capturing a fraction of the figures from the traditional betting industry.

Forecasted to grow to $133.59 billion by 2029 and amassing over 25 million users in 2022, the traditional market is exploding, with estimates suggesting nearly 40 million users by 2025.

With more than $11.4 billion in trading volumes over the past year, Polymarket has built a reputation for accurately predicting events, including the outcome of the U.S. presidential election last November.

However, the platform has also faced regulatory scrutiny.

Last year, authorities in Taiwan prosecuted an individual for using the platform to bet on the nation’s presidential election, violating local gambling laws. Authorities in countries including Thailand, Singapore, and France have banned the site.

The platform is also officially off-limits to U.S. users following a 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission “for offering off-exchange event-based binary options contracts and failure to obtain designation as a designated contract market (DCM) or registration as a swap execution facility.”

In November 2024, the FBI raided the New York apartment of CEO Shayne Coplan, seizing his phone as part of an investigation into the platform’s use by U.S. customers.

Despite regulatory headwinds, Polymarket’s standing in political and financial circles appears to be shifting.

On March 8, Coplan participated in the White House Digital Roundtable, a crypto summit attended by President Trump and high-profile CEOs, founders, and investors in the industry.

Announcing the invitation on X, he praised the government’s evolving stance, stating, “This admin's commitment to collaboration with American innovators is revitalizing the American dream. The future is bright.”

https://decrypt.co,Solana DEX Raydium Token Jumps Despite Emergence of Rival PumpSwap,https://decrypt.co/311444/solana-dex-raydium-token-jumps-despite-emergence-of-rival-pumpswap,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:42:28 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Raydium's native token, Ray, rose sharply on Monday, driven by the decentralized exchange's ""deep liquidity,"" even as it faces stiff competition from the recently launched rival PumpSwap, according to one core contributor.

As the 133rd largest crypto by market capitalization, Ray is trading at about $1.95, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

It is up 25% over the past 14 days, recovering ground lost earlier this year as Pump.fun grew more popular.

Ray had dropped 7.6% over a five-minute period following last Friday’s launch of Pump.fun’s competing decentralized exchange. The token previously fell 22% as rumors of the emerging Pump.fun competitor emerged last month.

However, Raydium’s numbers have held up relatively well.

On Sunday, the Solana-based exchange and automated market maker processed some $321.31 million worth of trading volume, a 4% decrease from the week prior, according to DefiLlama.

And on Monday, it surpassed last Monday’s trading volume for the same day a week ago.

Raydium’s popularity endures; Pump.fun rises

Throughout 2024, Raydium established itself as the most popular DEX on Solana, generating $124 billion worth of trading volume by January this year amid a meme-coin-fueled market upturn.

Yet Pump.fun later solidified itself as the biggest token launchpad across all chains, becoming the fastest-growing app in crypto history toward the end of 2024, Recently surpassing $600 million in revenue, according to Dune data.

Previously, when Pump.fun tokens completed their bonding curve and “graduated” from the platform, which currently happens at a $100,000 market cap, they would become tradable on Raydium.

At its January peak, according to Dune, Pump.fun created over 70,500 tokens with 1,168 of them graduating to Raydium. Plus, the launchpad accounts for up to 70% of all tokens created on Solana or 55% as of March 23.

Pseudonymous core contributor for Raydium Stendhal told Decrypt that they aren’t surprised because all of Pump.fun’s previously migrated tokens have their liquidity locked on Raydium.

They also mentioned that Raydium has “deep liquidity” in tokens from “all asset classes” outside of the Solana launchpad.

“I believe the reliance from Pump.fun has been overblown,” Stendhal said, adding that Raydium’s technical capabilities are being overlooked.

“We have been hearing for a while that it is easy to launch a ‘vanilla’ [automated market maker]. I don’t think that most people understand how critical distribution is to volume,” he added.

As for PumpSwap, its figures are smaller, with $669,120 and $3.26 million daily trading volume on Saturday and Sunday, DefiLlama data shows.

'Great success'

Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen told Decrypt these figures are “reasonably accurate” and that its launch has been a “great success.” He points to the emergence of the Morning Routine (ROUTINE) meme over the weekend as an example of the exchange at play.

Still, PumpSwap remains some distance from surpassing Raydium as the largest decentralized exchange on Solana.

Over the past 24 hours, Raydium has accounted for 32.7% of all volume on Solana with Meteora close in second at 31.56% and Orca in third at 20.41%.

Pump.fun’s competitor, however, sits in fifth with just 5.74% of daily volume on Solana.

“It’s too early to assess the impact of a new player with a lot of mindshare joining the spot market landscape,” Stendhal added. “It is nonetheless interesting to see that the big disruption anticipated by the market didn’t happen.”

That said, we will likely see this gap close if the launchpad is able to foster another major meme like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), which peaked at over a $2 billion market cap.

And, with ROUTINE soaring to $19 million over the weekend, some traders are starting to believe in meme coins again.

“Volumes on PumpSwap have been increasing day-by-day, and I expect this trend to continue as more coins migrate and continue to generate trading volume,” Cohen said.

https://decrypt.co,Ancient Mystery or Modern Hoax? Experts Debunk Giza Pyramid Claims,https://decrypt.co/311432/ancient-mystery-modern-hoax-experts-debunk-giza-pyramid,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:12:49 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Ever since the pyramids of Egypt rose from the desert over 4,000 years ago, people have wondered how they were built—sparking centuries of speculation, fringe theories, and wild claims involving lost technologies and extraterrestrials.

That speculation got a modern boost last fall when a Chinese research team claimed to have used radar to detect plasma bubbles above the Great Pyramid of Giza. These reports reignited online theories and alternative histories.

Building on that momentum, a group known as the Khafre Project, led by Professor Corrado Malanga from Italy's University of Pisa and Researcher Filippo Biondi from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, attracted attention last week with its own dramatic claims of a vast network of underground structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre, reaching depths of up to 2,000 feet.

Accompanied by detailed graphics and viral videos, the group's assertions quickly spread across social media, breathing new life into old mysteries.

X lit up with speculation, including theories that the chambers amplified Earth’s low-frequency electromagnetic waves—possibly functioning as an ancient power plant. Some even suggested the find could rewrite our understanding of the pyramids.

“The images suggest a hidden world under the feet of the Great Pyramids: halls and shafts that have waited millennia to be found,” technologist Brian Roemmele wrote in a blog post. “Such a scenario has an almost storybook allure as if turning the page on a chapter that historians didn’t know existed.”

Debunking the myth

However, Egyptologist and historian Flora Anthony wasn’t buying into the hype.

“Something seemed off, so I looked up the original source, read through it, and realized the paper had nothing to do with the images or claims being shared in the media,” she told Decrypt. “Turns out, the article isn’t peer-reviewed. Someone familiar with the journal where the report was published said they publish quickly and aren’t established in the field—which matters since peer review is important.”

The pyramids on the Giza Plateau—built during Egypt’s Fourth Dynasty between 2600 B.C. and 2500 B.C.—were royal tombs for the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure.

The idea that extraterrestrials may have played a role in constructing the pyramids has long been a staple of fringe science and pop culture.

Proponents of this “Ancient Alien” theory point to the monuments’ precise alignment, massive scale, and engineering complexity as evidence that ancient civilizations couldn’t have built them alone.

""The people behind this aren’t scientists. One is a UFO researcher who believes aliens are interdimensional parasites that hijack human souls,” Anthony said. “The other writes conspiracy books about a lost, pre-dynastic Egyptian civilization and recently promoted a so-called 'harmonic investigation' of the Great Pyramid using a technology he claims to have patented.”

While their claims might sound impressive at first glance, there’s nothing solid underneath, Anthony added.

“None of it is peer-reviewed, credible, or based in real science,” she said. “It’s not science. It’s not history.”

Pseudoscience

Ancient Aliens theory, Anthony said, is rooted in pseudo-archaeology, eugenics, and historical racism, promoting the idea that African and Mesoamerican civilizations couldn’t have built monumental structures like the pyramids without help from extraterrestrials.

""These theories uphold white supremacy by pushing a false narrative of white superiority,” Anthony said. “No one questions how medieval European peasants—living in filth without basic sanitation—built intricate cathedrals. But when Africans or Mesoamericans build pyramids, suddenly it must be aliens.”

On March 16, The Khafre Project presented apparent evidence of five chambers and eight shafts, using annotated tomographic images and artist renderings to illustrate their findings.

Yet while social media continues to buzz with wild theories, Egyptologists, including Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, are unconvinced.

“It all sounds very improbable to me as most machinery cannot penetrate that deeply, and there is no data to evaluate this claim,” Ikram told Decrypt. “So far, it seems it is in the news, with no peer-reviewed paper or raw data to back this up. And the technology does not seem capable of what they claim.”

🚨This is the official PRESS RELEASE of the Massive Underground Structure Findings at the Giza Plateau from the Khafre Pyramid Project Speaker: Nicole Ciccole https://t.co/3DzgWFaU3Y pic.twitter.com/O8IqIbKi2E — Jay Anderson (@TheProjectUnity) March 20, 2025

Ikram added that Egyptian authorities confirmed they had not granted the Khafre Project permission to conduct any work at the site.

Likewise, the fact-checking website Snopes investigated the Khafre Project’s claims and declared them false in a recent report.

“Despite the popularity of the claim, there is no evidence to support it,” the report said. “In addition, no credible news outlets or scientific publications have reported on this rumor.”

Digging to the truth

The idea of using radar technology to scan the pyramids is not new.

Radar technology has been used multiple times to scan the pyramids of Giza, most notably in 2016 as part of the ScanPyramids project, revealing hidden voids and structural anomalies within the ancient monuments.

In 2022, researchers Corrado Malanga and Filippo Biondi conducted a synthetic aperture radar scan on the Khufu Pyramid, which many suspect is the basis for the Khafre Project’s images.

According to Snopes, the Khafre Project’s research has not been peer-reviewed or corroborated by credible archaeologists, pointing to what the organization called “Malanga's well-documented interest in UFO and alien abduction research as well as Dunn's ""power plant"" theory.”

“Additionally, one of the most popular images being shared in support of the claim, depicting a cross-section of the pyramid and the alleged structures, was generated using artificial intelligence,” Snopes said. “Uploading the image to the AI-detection platform Hive Moderation resulted in a 99.9% chance the image was generated using AI.”

Ultimately, the story says more about our appetite for mystery than it does about any discovery beneath the pyramids.

Until actual evidence surfaces, the only thing buried beneath the Giza Plateau is the truth—and for now, it’s staying that way.

Bitcoin recently achieved its best weekly performance in over two months, climbing 4.24% to $88,804

Analyst Axel Adler Jr. predicts Bitcoin could reach $130,000 within 90 days, based on onchain metrics

A major Bitcoin whale purchased 2,400 BTC worth $200 million on March 24, 2025

Another whale that had been inactive since 2017 moved 3,000 BTC valued at $250 million

BlackRock has acquired 4,054 BTC in seven days, growing their position to approximately 574,000 BTC worth over $50 billion

Bitcoin has recently shown strong market performance, climbing 4.24% to reach an intra-day high of $88,804. This marks Bitcoin’s best weekly performance in over two months. The cryptocurrency has reclaimed a bullish stance on the charts, closing above the daily chart’s 200-day exponential moving average.

With a weekly close above $84,600, experts suggest that Bitcoin has an increased likelihood of testing the $90,000 mark soon. However, BTC must first overcome the descending resistance level to make a sustainable move at the range highs.

Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. views the current price action as healthy consolidation rather than the beginning of a bear market. According to Adler’s analysis of onchain metrics, Bitcoin has not yet entered “overheated” territory in this cycle, as indicated by BTC’s Investor Price Model.

This particular model has flashed sell signals twice during 2021. It incorporates several key metrics: the realized cap, thermo cap, investor price, and Bitcoin supply.

Adler further supports his bullish outlook using Bitcoin’s cumulative value days destroyed (CVDD) metric. This tool monitors selling activity among long-term holders. In the current bull cycle (2024-2025), it has triggered a sell signal just once, back in March 2024.

Based on his analysis, Adler predicts that Bitcoin could climb to $130,000 within 90 days. He notes that we might see “seasoned investors taking profits once Bitcoin breaches key peak levels ($123K), potentially exerting downward pressure on the price.”

Recent data shows Bitcoin’s open interest (OI) jumped by over $1.5 billion in a 24-hour period. Open interest represents the total value of outstanding futures contracts in the market.

The funding rate, which reflects the cost of holding leveraged positions, has stayed near neutral. This suggests that neither bullish (long) nor bearish (short) traders are dominantly in control of the market at present.

Short-Term Correction Likely Before $90K

Bitcoin experienced a surge in upward momentum late on Sunday, March 23rd. Weekend price rallies often occur with lower trading volume, as larger market participants tend to step back until the start of the week.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin registered a new high at $88,750 over the previous week’s top. However, the price tested the upper Bollinger Band alongside the descending resistance. Additionally, BTC is oscillating within an ascending channel.

Based on these technical indicators, Bitcoin could witness a short-term correction to test the demand zone around $86,000-$87,000 before breaking through the $90,000 threshold.

Cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe has also noted Bitcoin’s solid upward trend. Van de Poppe expects this trend to continue toward the $90,000 mark in the coming days.

At a specific time on March 25, 2025, Bitcoin’s price reached $82,500, marking a 5% increase from its opening price of $78,500 earlier that day. This upward movement came with a large trading volume of approximately 30,000 BTC traded within an hour.

On-chain metrics further supported this bullish trend, with active addresses increasing by 10% compared to the previous day, reaching 1.2 million. The MVRV ratio, a key indicator of market valuation, stood at 3.2, suggesting Bitcoin was trading at a premium compared to its realized value.

The market has also seen key whale activity that supports the bullish case. On March 24, 2025, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence discovered that a major Bitcoin whale invested $200 million to purchase 2,400 BTC.

This whale now holds over 15,000 BTC in its digital wallet, worth more than $1.3 billion. Before this year, the whale had been selling Bitcoin until the market value fluctuated between $100,000 and $86,000. This change in buying behavior may signal confidence in upcoming price increases.

Another whale that had remained inactive since 2017 made a transaction of 3,000 BTC valued at $250 million on March 22, 2025. This was the whale’s largest Bitcoin transfer, moving assets that had been held in a single wallet since 2017.

Institutional interest continues to grow as well. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company with $11.6 trillion under management, acquired 4,054 BTC in seven days. This has grown their position to approximately 574,000 BTC worth more than $50 billion.

The persistent Bitcoin acquisitions by whales are creating both near-term and long-term changes in market sentiment. Bitcoin exchanges now have a reduced supply as large investors continue to make additional purchases. The buying activities demonstrate confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.

Bitcoin whales influence extends beyond Bitcoin itself to related systems. Their accumulation results in growing interest in additional cryptocurrencies as well. The market appears set for another upswing as Bitcoin shows a pattern of rising prices.",blockonomi

The entity currently holds eleven digital assets in its wallet, including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), MOVE (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), Sei (SEI), Avalanche (AVAX), and MNT.

Long Crypto!

The latest MNT purchase brings WLFI’s total holdings to 5.99 million MNT, worth over $5 million at current market prices. Last week, the DeFi project acquired 2.45 million MNT tokens and 103,911 AVAX tokens.

Diversifying its crypto holdings across various blockchain projects is a way for the project to mitigate market volatility. Plus, the project also wants to invest in innovative DeFi projects to support the development of DeFi and capitalize on business opportunities.

Lookonchain data reveals ETH as the dominant asset in WLFI’s portfolio, valued at approximately $134 million, followed by $69.5 million in WBTC.

The team’s ETH holdings also incurred the heaviest unrealized losses, totaling $85 million at press time. WLFI’s total portfolio losses have surpassed $111 million.

MNT and AVAX, the most recently added cryptocurrencies, are the only holdings reporting unrealized profits, with a combined gain of over $113,800.

WLFI recently formed a strategic collaboration with Sui, the prominent Layer-1 blockchain. The move focuses on integrating Sui’s technology and assets into WLFI’s ecosystem while exploring opportunities to build next-gen blockchain applications, specifically targeting decentralized finance (DeFi).

As part of the partnership, the project will soon add Sui tokens to its “Macro Strategy” reserve, which includes BTC, ETH, TRX, LINK, and ONDO tokens.

The project has also already established relationships with blockchain protocols and institutions, including Ondo Finance, Ethena, Chainlink, and Aave.

WLFI Completes $550 Million Token Sale

Following its WLFI token launch last October, World Liberty Financial announced on March 17 that it had successfully raised $550 million from two sets of token sales. The first set sold $300 million of WLFI tokens, and the second set sold $250 million.

The token sales drew over 85,000 participants, all of whom completed the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) process to verify their eligibility.

The completion came despite an initial struggling token sale. The project once retargeted its goal from $300 million to $30 million, a 90% reduction, after facing challenges in meeting its original target.

Early sales raised only $11–12 million due to technical issues, regulatory restrictions, and low investor confidence. However, sales started to surge following Donald Trump’s election win and the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) token.

In January, WLFI announced the issuance of an additional 5 billion tokens due to increased investor demand. These tokens were sold at an increased price of $0.05, up from $0.015.

Inspired by Trump and backed by the Trump family, WLFI launched with the goal of offering transparent, accessible, and secure financial solutions. It aims to democratize access to DeFi by creating user-friendly tools.

In a message celebrating the success of the token sales, Zach Witkoff, WLFI co-founder, said that the completion of these sales was simply the beginning, and WLFI plans to release a series of innovative technologies that will push the limits of what can be achieved with digital assets.

“This milestone proves that those who truly understand crypto and finance recognize what we’re building — and that WLFI is on track to supercharge DeFi as it transforms global finance in the coming years,” said Witkoff.

The WLFI token serves as the platform’s governance token. It allows holders to vote on important decisions related to the platform’s development and operations. WLFI is based on the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of DeFi applications.",blockonomi

Crypto stocks soared on Monday with Strategy (MSTR) up 10%, Coinbase up 7%, and mining companies like CleanSpark up 18%

Bitcoin traded at around $87,350, up 2.2% in 24 hours, while Ethereum and Solana rose 4% and 6% respectively

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) announced surpassing 500,000 Bitcoin in holdings, valued at $44.2 billion

Markets rallied after indications that the Trump administration may soften its stance on tariffs

Analysts noted growing connections between crypto and traditional finance, with companies expanding their offerings

Cryptocurrency-focused stocks experienced a major uplift on Monday as digital assets and other risk-based investments saw renewed interest. The rally came as the White House hinted at easing its position on trade tariffs against major trading partners.

Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, saw its shares jump more than 10%. The stock closed at $335.72 according to Nasdaq data. Strategy trades under the ticker symbol ‘MSTR’.

The software company made headlines by announcing it had crossed a major milestone. It now holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin in its treasury. This makes it the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

Strategy’s current Bitcoin holdings amount to 506,137 coins. At current market rates, this translates to approximately $44.2 billion in value. The Tysons, Virginia-based company has been funding these purchases by selling its stock.

Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, also benefited from the market upswing. Its stock, listed under NASDAQ: COIN, rose by 7% on Monday afternoon Eastern Time. Shares were trading at $203.

Public Bitcoin mining companies weren’t left out of the rally. Low-carbon miner CleanSpark (CLSK) saw an impressive 18% increase. Its stock reached $8.79 during Monday trading.

Other mining companies performed well too. Riot Platforms (RIOT) jumped nearly 10% to $9.69 per share. MARA Holdings (MARA) climbed 18% to reach $14.61 per share.

The broader U.S. stock market also traded higher on Monday. This followed reports that the Trump administration might narrow the scope of tariffs set to take effect on April 2. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index jumped 2.2% on the day.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was trading at approximately $87,350. This represented a 2.2% increase over the previous 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Other major cryptocurrencies also performed well.

Ethereum saw gains of more than 4% during the same period. Solana performed even better with a 6% price increase. These gains contributed to the overall positive sentiment in crypto markets.

Earlier in March, economic data provided some relief to worried investors. The Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, came in slightly lower than expected. This encouraged markets that had been concerned about potential stagflation.

Stagflation occurs when an economy experiences rising prices but stagnant economic growth. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, China, and Canada have contributed to these worries. These policies have partly offset the positive impact of his pro-crypto stance.

Trump Administration’s Mixed Impact on Crypto Markets

Bitcoin reached a new all-time high above $108,000 following Trump’s inauguration. This rally also boosted equity markets at the time. However, the cryptocurrency has retreated in recent weeks, at times falling below $80,000.

The Trump administration has taken several pro-crypto actions. These include reducing regulation and announcing plans for a special Bitcoin reserve. However, uncertainty remains around the details of the planned reserve.

Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure told CNBC that crypto’s mixed performance in 2025 is partly due to these uncertainties. She also noted increasing interest in the tokenization of traditional finance.

Bernstein analysts predict growing connections between crypto and traditional finance. “We see a world where crypto exchanges will offer spot crypto, crypto derivatives, and tokenized equities, while broker platforms will also scale up their crypto services,” they wrote.

Despite recent gains, some crypto stocks remain down for the year. Coinbase, despite being called “the clear blue chip” in crypto by Rosenblatt analyst Chris Brendler, is still down about 22% year-to-date.

Robinhood (HOOD) climbed 9.6% on Monday, recovering some recent losses. The company recently launched a prediction markets product within its app, expanding its crypto offerings.

Mining company Hut 8 (HUT) rose more than 7.3% during Monday trading. Earlier this month, the firm announced acquiring 592 acres in Louisiana for a new data center. The project represents a $2.5 billion investment in a 300MW facility.

The correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks remains strong. Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick suggested treating Bitcoin more like a tech stock than a hedge against market volatility. This advice reflects Bitcoin’s high correlation with the Nasdaq index.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Cronos (CRO) Price: Trump Media Partnership Fuels 30% Token Rally,https://blockonomi.com/cronos-cro-price-trump-media-partnership-fuels-30-token-rally/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 10:32:49 GMT","TLDR

Cronos (CRO) price surged 30-55% following a partnership announcement between Trump Media and Crypto.com to develop ETFs

The proposed ETFs will offer exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and “diverse industries such as energy” under the “Truth.Fi” brand

Trading volume for CRO increased nearly six times from $21 million to $126 million

The rally coincides with an upcoming Cronos zkEVM mainnet upgrade scheduled for March 26

Daily transactions more than doubled from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000 according to CronoScan

Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com, has seen its price jump over 30% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.10 according to CoinGecko data. This surge follows an announcement that Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has signed a non-binding agreement to partner with Crypto.com in developing exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The partnership aims to create “inventive funds” that will focus on “rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy,” according to TMTG CEO Devin Nunes. These ETFs will provide exposure to Bitcoin, Cronos, and other industries including energy.

Trading Analysis

Trading data shows that CRO’s trading volume exploded from $21 million to $126 million on Monday evening. Traders rushed to capitalize on the presidential connection, driving up both price and activity.

The daily transactions chart from CronoScan reveals that network activity has more than doubled. Transactions increased from roughly 40,000 to over 82,000 as interest in the token surged.

Products from this partnership will launch under the “Truth.Fi” brand. The ETFs will target markets across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, pending regulatory approval in each region.

This strategy aligns with President Trump’s economic agenda. Trump recently vowed to make America the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world” during video remarks at the Digital Asset Summit conference in New York.

The arrangement places President Trump’s media company in business with Singapore-based Crypto.com. This comes just five months after the crypto firm faced SEC scrutiny over allegations of operating an unregistered securities exchange.

The SEC filed notice in October last year that it intended to sue Crypto.com. The company rejected these allegations and filed a counter lawsuit.

By December, Crypto.com had dropped its lawsuit around the same time its CEO met with then-President-elect Trump. SEC filings show that in December, Trump transferred roughly $4 billion worth of his stake in TMTG through a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr.

The CRO price rally also comes ahead of a scheduled Cronos zkEVM mainnet upgrade. This upgrade is set for March 26 and will involve a 1-2 hour downtime for the network.

The upgrade will introduce smart account single sign-on (SSO). This feature will make it easier for users to log in with Google, Apple ID, and Mobile authentication.

It will also lay the foundation for a zero-knowledge gateway. This technology will set the stage for fast zk-chains interoperability, which could enhance the network’s performance.

There are signs that the Cronos DeFi ecosystem has started to stabilize. The total value locked (TVL) has increased to $424 million from this month’s low of $330 million.

The biggest players in the Cronos ecosystem are VVS Finance, Tectonic, Orby Network, and Veno Finance. However, Cronos zkEVM has not yet gained much traction among developers and users, with its TVL dropping to $13 million.

Technical analysis shows CRO has formed some strong support levels. It has bottomed at $0.0715, a level it has struggled to drop below several times since August last year.

This pattern suggests it has formed a quadruple-bottom with a neckline at $0.2332, which was its highest point on December 4. The price has also moved above the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has trended upward.

Some analysts predict the CRO price will continue rising toward a resistance point at $0.133. This target represents about a 30% increase from current levels.",blockonomi

Mt. Gox transferred 11,501 Bitcoin worth approximately $1 billion on March 25

This is the third major Bitcoin transfer by Mt. Gox this month

Mt. Gox still holds about 35,000 Bitcoin worth $3.1 billion

Some transfers ended up at crypto exchange Bitstamp

The repayment deadline for creditors has been extended to October 31, 2025

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has transferred 11,501 Bitcoin worth approximately $1 billion. This marks the third major Bitcoin movement by the exchange in March alone.

Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence reported the transfer on March 25. The company revealed that Mt. Gox sent 893 Bitcoin (about $78 million) to its cold wallet and 10,608 Bitcoin (around $929 million) to another wallet known as the Mt. Gox change wallet.

This latest transfer follows two similar large movements earlier this month. Mt. Gox moved 12,000 Bitcoin worth over $1 billion on March 6. The exchange then transferred another 11,833 Bitcoin on March 11.

According to blockchain platform Spot On Chain, one of the earlier transfers this month ended up at cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp. The same analytics firm suggested that the 893 Bitcoin sent to Mt. Gox’s warm wallet “will be moved out shortly too.”

Data from Arkham shows that despite these large transfers, Mt. Gox still maintains about 35,000 Bitcoin. This remaining Bitcoin is worth approximately $3.1 billion at current prices across wallets controlled by the exchange.

Many crypto market watchers believe these large movements could signal that creditor payouts are approaching. Creditors of the bankrupt exchange have the option to receive their repayments in Bitcoin rather than cash.

A Reddit poll conducted in July 2024 after Mt. Gox’s first payout found that many creditors were not in a rush to sell their Bitcoin. This suggests limited immediate selling pressure from these distributions.

The Legacy of a Fallen Exchange Giant

Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange. Before its collapse, it handled between 70-80% of all Bitcoin trades globally. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in early 2014 after suffering a devastating hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 Bitcoin.

Following the bankruptcy, a Tokyo court appointed a trustee to manage the proceedings. The trustee’s job includes compensating creditors with the exchange’s remaining assets.

In October 2024, the trustee extended the deadline for repayments by a full year. The new deadline is October 31, 2025. The extension was necessary because “many creditors still have not received their repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures.”

Last December, Mt. Gox also moved over 24,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $2.5 billion. This transfer happened after Bitcoin reached the $100,000 price milestone.

The recent large Bitcoin movements have led to speculation about potential market volatility. Cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez has identified $89,000 as a key resistance level for Bitcoin. This level represents the meeting point of the 50-day moving average and a descending trendline from Bitcoin’s all-time high.

Martinez suggests that Bitcoin needs to break through this level to gain strong bullish momentum. Failure to do so might result in continued price consolidation or a potential pullback.

The analyst also noted that Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index has recently entered overbought territory. Historically, the last six times this happened, Bitcoin experienced sharp price corrections afterward.

Meanwhile, the TD Sequential indicator, which helps identify market reversals, suggests Bitcoin may be approaching a short-term peak. This could lead to profit-taking by traders in the near future.

Mt. Gox began repaying its creditors in July 2024 from its holdings. These holdings included 142,000 Bitcoin (worth $11 billion), 143,000 Bitcoin Cash (worth $47 million), and 69 billion Japanese yen (worth $469 million).

Some creditors have already received repayments through exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp. However, many others are still waiting to complete the necessary procedures to receive their funds.

The current Bitcoin price is hovering around $86,500. This represents a roughly 7% decrease from early March when Mt. Gox made another large Bitcoin transfer while the price was near $92,000.

Bitcoin daily trading volumes have increased by 97%. They now stand at $33.37 billion, showing high market activity during these large transfers.",blockonomi

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB701) into law, protecting crypto self-custody rights

The bill passed with unanimous support in both Kentucky’s House and Senate

Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act passed the State House (77-15) and now heads to the Senate

Multiple states including Arizona, Texas, and Missouri are advancing Bitcoin reserve legislation

Kentucky has also introduced a bill to allow up to 10% of excess state reserves to be allocated to digital assets

Kentucky has taken a strong step forward for cryptocurrency users by signing the “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law, while several other states push ahead with Bitcoin reserve legislation. The movement shows growing acceptance of digital assets at the state level across America.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed House Bill 701, known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law on March 24. The bill received overwhelming support, passing with all 91 representatives and all 37 senators voting in favor of the legislation.

The new law protects several key rights for cryptocurrency users in Kentucky. It safeguards the right to use digital assets and self-custody wallets without fear of discrimination.

The legislation also bans local zoning changes that might discriminate against crypto mining. This provides certainty for mining operations in the state.

HB701 sets out guidelines for running a cryptocurrency node. It also specifically excludes crypto mining from money transmitter license requirements.

Another important aspect of the law is that it clarifies that mining and staking activities are not considered offering or selling a security. This helps protect miners and stakers from certain regulatory burdens.

The Satoshi Action Fund, a crypto advocacy group, praised the bill. They highlighted that it protects the “right to self-custody, run a node, and use of digital assets” without “fear of discrimination.”

Kentucky’s legislation mirrors similar laws already in place in other states. Oklahoma passed comparable legislation that was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt in May 2024.

The State Bitcoin Reserve Race Heats Up

Beyond protecting user rights, Kentucky is also exploring the creation of a Bitcoin reserve. A separate bill would allow the State Investment Commission to put up to 10% of excess state reserves into digital assets, including Bitcoin.

That Bitcoin reserve bill is still under review. If passed, it would join several other states considering or implementing state-level Bitcoin reserves.

Oklahoma is also moving forward with its own Bitcoin reserve legislation. The state’s House Bill 1203, known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, recently passed the State House of Representatives with a vote of 77 to 15.

The Oklahoma bill was introduced by state Representative Cody Maynard on January 15. It passed the Government Oversight Committee with a 12-2 vote on February 25.

For the Oklahoma bill to become law, it must now pass through the Senate. After that, the Oklahoma governor would need to sign it into law.

Oklahoma has other crypto-friendly legislation in the works as well. State Senator Dusty Deevers filed a bill on January 8 that would allow residents to receive their salaries in Bitcoin.

According to Bitcoin Laws, a group that tracks Bitcoin legislation, Oklahoma has now moved into a tie for second place with Texas in what they call the “State Bitcoin reserve race.” Arizona is currently in the lead.

Arizona’s own efforts to create a Bitcoin reserve are advancing. Two strategic digital asset reserve bills cleared Arizona’s House Rules Committee on March 24.

These Arizona bills have now moved to the House floor for a full vote. This puts Arizona at the forefront of states looking to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

Missouri is also evaluating a Bitcoin reserve bill. Their Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs is currently reviewing the proposed legislation.

Bitcoin Laws notes that the Oklahoma bill “has a good chance to pass into law.” They point to the Republican majority in the Oklahoma Senate and the Republican governor as factors that could help the bill succeed.

The movement toward state-level Bitcoin adoption shows growing acceptance of cryptocurrency. These legislative actions aim to provide clear rules for users and businesses in the crypto space.

As more states adopt Bitcoin-friendly legislation, it may create a competitive environment where states try to attract crypto businesses and users. This could lead to further innovations in state cryptocurrency policies.

The broad support for Kentucky’s bill, with unanimous votes in both chambers, suggests strong bipartisan interest in embracing cryptocurrency technology and protecting user rights at the state level.",blockonomi

Binance suspended a wallet team member following insider trading allegations

The employee allegedly used non-public information from their previous BNB Chain role

The staff member purchased tokens before a Token Generation Event and sold for profit

Whistleblowers identified suspicious transactions, prompting an internal investigation

Binance is rewarding $100,000 to four whistleblowers who reported the violation

Crypto exchange Binance has suspended a staff member from its Wallet team after launching an internal investigation into claims of insider trading. The company announced on March 25 that the employee allegedly used non-public information from a previous role to make trading profits.

The investigation began on March 23 when Binance received reports about suspicious trading activity. Whistleblowers pointed to transactions that showed signs of front-running, a practice where someone trades based on advance knowledge of upcoming events that will affect prices.

According to Binance Wallet’s statement, the suspended employee joined the team last month. Before that, they worked in business development at BNB Chain, Binance’s blockchain network.

The company claims the staff member knew about an upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) for a project. They allegedly expected this event would create high interest among crypto traders.

Binance says the employee used multiple linked wallet addresses to buy large amounts of the project’s tokens. This happened before any public announcement about the token launch.

After the announcement, the employee quickly sold part of their holdings. This sale earned them what Binance described as “high profits” from the price movement.

Trading Scheme Exposed

The investigation was prompted by claims circulating on social media platform X. Several users had identified suspicious transactions and wallet addresses that pointed to possible insider trading.

While Binance did not name the employee in its statement, social media users have pointed to Freddie Ng. According to his LinkedIn profile, Ng recently moved from a role at BNB Chain to Binance Wallet’s business development team.

One X user with the handle “py” shared transaction data showing profits of $82,400 from a token called U DEX Platform (UUU). The wallet making these profits was linked to another wallet that had been funded by an address named “freddieng.bnb.”

This address had been shared on Ng’s X account in the past. Transaction data shows the wallet sold holdings just minutes after the token debuted on March 23.

The token reached a peak value of $31.5 million before dropping in value. The timing of the sales suggests the trader had advance knowledge of the token’s launch schedule.

Binance said it has suspended the employee while it continues its investigation. The company stated it may take further disciplinary action based on its findings.

The exchange also plans to work with authorities in the relevant jurisdiction. Binance said it will pursue legal action against the employee based on applicable laws.

As a gesture of appreciation to those who reported the suspicious activity, Binance will distribute $100,000. This reward will be shared equally among four anonymous whistleblowers who contacted the company through its official reporting channels.

This case brings to mind a similar situation at Coinbase in 2023. In that instance, a former manager named Ishan Wahi admitted to leaking information about token listings to family members and contacts for trading purposes.

The Binance investigation found no evidence that other Wallet team employees were involved in insider trading. The company emphasized that the information used came from the employee’s previous role, not from their current position.",blockonomi

Dogecoin is testing key resistance levels around $0.18-$0.19, with some analysts predicting a potential 100% price increase if these levels are broken

Technical patterns suggest DOGE may be repeating historical bull cycles similar to 2017 and 2021

A contradicting bear flag pattern indicates risk of a 30% decline to approximately $0.11

The Dogecoin Foundation launched an “Official Dogecoin Reserve” with a 10 million DOGE purchase ($1.8 million) to enhance stability

House of Doge aims to make transactions faster and more practical for everyday payments, with government entities showing interest in potential use cases

Dogecoin, the market’s leading meme cryptocurrency, finds itself at a critical price juncture that could determine its short-term trajectory. Technical analysts are offering competing viewpoints on where DOGE might head next as it tests important price levels.

As of March, Dogecoin is priced at $0.1847, showing a 5.69% gain in 24 hours. It currently ranks as the 8th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $27.44 billion.

Trading volume for DOGE has surged by 123.45% to $1.58 billion over the past day. This spike in trading activity indicates growing investor interest, possibly driven by positive market sentiment.

The “World of Charts” analysis account on X (Twitter) points out that Dogecoin is testing a key resistance area. The cryptocurrency is attempting to break above a downward trendline that has acted as resistance for several months.

This breakout level sits around $0.18 to $0.19. If DOGE can push through this range, it could generate strong buying momentum and potentially double in price.

$Doge #Doge Testing Crucial Multi Resistance Area, After Successful Breakout It Can Easily Give 2x. pic.twitter.com/2E5vuAgnRM — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) March 24, 2025

Another analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has observed that Dogecoin’s current price action resembles patterns from previous bull cycles. The analyst noted similarities to the 2017 and 2021 market movements when DOGE saw major price increases.

On March 24, 2025, Dogecoin briefly traded at $0.1887, hovering near the resistance level highlighted by crypto analysts. Sustained momentum above this point could trigger a major price surge.

However, not all technical analysis is bullish. A bear flag pattern on the DOGE/USD daily chart suggests a possible 30% decline in the coming weeks.

This bearish pattern formed after DOGE fell from a high of $0.214 in late 2024. The price has since been consolidating between a descending upper trendline and lower support near $0.137.

On March 24, DOGE tested the upper trendline but closed with a red candle. This rejection reinforces bearish momentum and could trigger a drop to $0.11 if the lower trendline breaks.

Technical Analysis

Technical indicators support this bearish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen from 58.71 to 47.45, showing weakening buying pressure. A recent death cross between DOGE’s 50-day and 200-day moving averages further strengthens the bearish case.

The Dogecoin Foundation recently unveiled its “Official Dogecoin Reserve,” purchasing 10 million DOGE coins. This initiative aims to enhance stability and attract institutional interest to the cryptocurrency.

Also known as House of Doge, this division invested $1.8 million to make Dogecoin faster and more usable for everyday transactions. The goal is to speed up blockchain settlements and make payments more efficient for businesses and consumers.

Michael Galloro, a board member-elect at House of Doge, believes the reserve will increase Dogecoin’s appeal as a practical payment method. The organization plans to push for broader use of DOGE in global payments.

Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin’s inflationary model makes it well-suited for daily transactions. To encourage adoption, House of Doge is planning cashback incentives and merchant partnerships.

Interest in Dogecoin extends beyond businesses. The Dogecoin Foundation has reportedly had discussions with US government representatives about using DOGE for everyday payments like city parking and utility bills.

Three Dogecoin-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications are currently awaiting review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 75% chance these DOGE ETFs will be approved by year-end.

Dogecoin’s price is currently consolidating in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Some experts predict DOGE could rise by 16%, reaching between $0.19 and $0.20, if a bullish breakout occurs.

External factors may also impact DOGE’s price. Elon Musk’s close association with Dogecoin has historically tied the cryptocurrency’s performance to his business ventures, particularly Tesla (TSLA).

Tesla’s stock has fallen over 50% since late 2024 due to declining sales, production challenges, and Musk’s political involvements. Given Dogecoin’s correlation with Tesla, this stock crash may have damaged long-term confidence in DOGE.",blockonomi

This comes after SBI VC Trade, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, received approval from the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA) to list USDC under the country’s stablecoin regulatory framework.

This marks a key moment for the Japanese crypto market. USDC becomes the first global dollar stablecoin approved for use in Japan after two years of regulatory discussions.

SBI VC Trade will be the first exchange to list USDC, but expansion is already planned. Circle confirmed that Binance Japan, bitbank, and bitFlyer also plan to list and distribute USDC in the near future.

These are major players in Japan’s crypto ecosystem. Bitbank and bitFlyer are among the country’s largest exchanges, processing more than $25 million each per day with over 1.85 million monthly website visits.

To support local operations, Circle has established Circle Japan KK. This entity will work closely with SBI Holdings through a joint venture announced in 2023.

Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, celebrated the news on social media. He stated that this development “unlocks tremendous opportunities not just in trading digital assets, but more broadly in payments, cross border finance and commerce, FX.”

BREAKING NEWS: Circle becomes the first and only stablecoin to be approved for use in Japanese markets, with Circle launching new operations, a strategic JV with SBI Holdings, and imminent launch of USDC by SBI VC Trade, with other major exchanges to follow. We have spent 2+… — Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) March 24, 2025

The approval process wasn’t quick. It took two years of negotiations with regulators, banking partners, and industry players to gain this approval.

Bridging Digital Dollars to Japan

Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO and president of SBI Holdings, also commented on the launch. He said it would “enhance financial accessibility and drive crypto innovation” in Japan’s evolving digital economy.

This aligns with SBI’s broader vision for blockchain-based finance in Japan. The partnership aims to combine USDC distribution with banking and Web3 technology for the Japanese market.

USDC currently maintains its position as the second largest stablecoin. It has a market cap of $59.7 billion, behind only Tether’s USDT at $143.8 billion.

The stablecoin’s entry into Japan could have wider market impacts. Jay Jo, a senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt that beyond trading, Japanese companies could “offer custody services and develop various stablecoin-based businesses.”

This comes at an interesting time for Japan’s currency. The continued weakening of the Japanese yen against the US dollar creates unique market dynamics.

If the yen continues to show weakness, Japanese investors might turn to USDC as a hedge. This could potentially “increase selling pressure on JPY,” according to Jo.

Easy access to dollar-denominated assets might accelerate outflows from traditional yen investments. This effect could be stronger “especially if interest rate differentials remain wide.”

USDC is fully reserved and backed by cash and cash-equivalent assets. The reserves are held at regulated financial institutions that publish third-party monthly attestations, providing transparency.

This isn’t Circle’s only recent regulatory win. In February, both USDC and Circle’s euro-backed EURC stablecoin were recognized under the Dubai Financial Services Authority’s new regime.

This recognition allows companies in Dubai’s International Financial Centre to integrate these stablecoins into various applications. These include payments, treasury management, and financial services.

Circle has also expanded its financial products through acquisition. In January 2025, the company acquired Hashnote, issuer of USYC, described as the “world’s largest tokenized money market fund.”

USYC is backed by U.S. Treasury debt and reverse repurchase agreements. It has a total asset value of over $1.25 billion, positioning Circle strongly in the real-world asset tokenization market.",blockonomi

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by President Trump, has deployed a USD-pegged stablecoin (USD1) on Ethereum and BNB Chain

The token has approximately 3.5 million in supply on each network and shows activity with addresses linked to Wintermute and BitGo

WLFI has stated the stablecoin is “not currently tradeable” and warned users about potential scams

The launch coincides with the advancement of the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation in the Senate

Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao highlighted the token’s deployment, triggering attention and copycat tokens

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the decentralized finance platform backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, has deployed a dollar-pegged stablecoin on two major blockchain networks. Blockchain data shows the token, labeled as World Liberty Financial USD (USD1), was launched in early March on both Ethereum and BNB Chain networks.

The stablecoin currently has a supply of approximately 3.5 million tokens on each blockchain. This deployment marks a key development for the project, which has been anticipated since WLFI’s launch in September 2024.

Blockchain analysts first noticed activity with the USD1 token on March 24, 2025. Several transactions involving the token have occurred over the past couple of weeks according to data from blockchain monitoring websites Etherscan and BscScan.

Some transfers included addresses linked to major crypto industry players. According to Arkham Intelligence data, addresses connected to Wintermute, a large digital asset trading firm, and BitGo, a prominent crypto custodian, have interacted with the token.

WLFI quickly responded to growing public attention about the token. The company stated in a post on X that USD1 is “not currently tradeable” and warned crypto users to be aware of potential scams attempting to capitalize on the attention.

USD1 is not currently tradable. Beware of scams and follow us here for all official announcements 🦅https://t.co/msnj0zLSp7 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) March 24, 2025

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao brought widespread notice to the token. He welcomed the project to BNB Chain in a post shared with his 10 million followers, including a screenshot of the USD1 BscScan profile.

Zhao later noted that his post triggered a wave of copycat tokens. These imitators were apparently trying to take advantage of the sudden attention on the World Liberty Financial stablecoin.

Welcome to @BNBChain! According to BSCScan, the smart contract was deployed 20 days ago. Build! 👏https://t.co/qr22y4pXqE https://t.co/J0TvwEnUin — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 24, 2025

World Liberty Financial first made headlines last year as one of the first crypto projects with the backing of Donald Trump. The protocol aims to create a blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools, and transact with stablecoins.

It has been known that WLFI was developing its own stablecoin. However, until now, there had been no official communication about specific plans or timing for a public launch of the token.

The World Liberty Financial platform has completed two public token sales since its launch. These sales have reportedly generated a combined $550 million for the company, showing strong investor interest in the Trump-backed project.

According to the project’s website, President Trump and some members of his family control 60% of the company’s equity interests. This ownership structure has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest since Trump took office.

Trump’s Stablecoin Strategy

The stablecoin launch comes as the Trump administration has made crypto regulation a priority. The GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) has advanced in the Senate, moving out of the Banking Committee on March 13.

Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, has stated he expects the GENIUS bill to reach President Trump’s desk by June. This legislation would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emphasized the importance of stablecoins. He stated that they have a key role in preserving the U.S. dollar’s global position as a reserve currency.

Stablecoins have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the crypto industry. With their prices pegged to external assets, primarily the U.S. dollar, they are widely used for crypto trading, everyday payments, remittances, and savings.

The stablecoin market has seen major growth over the past year. Analytics platforms Artemis and Dune reported that the number of active stablecoin wallets increased by more than 50% from February 2024 to February 2025.

The total market capitalization of stablecoins surpassed $200 billion in January 2025. Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) remain the two most popular stablecoins on the market.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Cardano (ADA) Price: Technical Analysis Shows Consolidation Between $0.695 and $0.75,https://blockonomi.com/cardano-ada-price-technical-analysis-shows-consolidation-between-0-695-and-0-75/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:31:57 GMT","TLDR

Cardano (ADA) is consolidating between $0.695 and $0.75 levels with potential for a 12% surge if it breaks above $0.756

Traders remain bullish with $17M in long positions compared to $3M in short positions

ADA has been included in the White House Crypto Working Group’s consideration for government crypto stockpile

Technical analysis shows a rounding-bottom pattern forming with consecutive bullish candles

Open interest in ADA futures has increased to $785.91 million, indicating growing market participation

Cardano (ADA) price has maintained steady ground around the $0.70 mark while many other cryptocurrencies have seen upward momentum. The eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading in a consolidation range between $0.695 and $0.75 for some time now.

The sideways movement has traders watching key levels closely. A daily candle close above $0.756 could trigger a 12% rally toward the $0.85 level according to technical analysis. Conversely, if ADA drops below $0.69, it might fall to $0.65 in the near term.

Despite the unclear price direction, market sentiment leans positive. Data from on-chain analytics firm Coinglass shows traders have built $17 million worth of long positions compared to just $3 million in shorts. This indicates strong bullish sentiment among market participants.

Trading volume has also picked up, with a 40% jump over 24 hours. This increase in activity suggests heightened market interest even during the consolidation phase.

The price action reveals a short-term rounding-bottom pattern forming from the $0.70 support level. Technical analysts have also identified a morning-star pattern that completed on Sunday with a 1.31% recovery, which is often viewed as a bullish reversal signal.

Open interest in ADA futures has climbed to $785.91 million. The long-to-short ratio has reached a nearly neutral point at 1.0396, showing increasing bullish positions over recent days.

ADA currently faces resistance from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. This technical indicator is acting as a ceiling that has so far capped upward movement.

The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 50 level. This suggests neutrality in trend momentum as the market waits for the next significant move.

Trading Analysis

Fibonacci analysis shows that if ADA breaks above the 61.80% retracement level at $0.7351, it could potentially rally toward the 78.60% Fibonacci level. This sits just below the psychologically important $1 mark at $0.9216.

Some analysts have set even more bullish long-term targets. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello has suggested that ADA could reach $10 in the coming bull cycle, representing a 1,300% increase from current prices.

Do you think Cardano can go to $10? — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) March 23, 2025

This projection is based on several factors, including Cardano’s recognition by government entities. The Executive Director of the White House Crypto Working Group, Bo Hines, recently mentioned ADA among cryptocurrencies being considered for the government’s crypto stockpile alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana.

Hines explained that these tokens were selected based on market capitalization, calling them “the five largest market caps in this space.” This official recognition could boost market confidence in Cardano.

Additionally, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is set to moderate a discussion with Donald Trump Jr. and World Liberty Financial at the DC blockchain summit on March 26. The event will focus on digital liberty and expanding global access to digital assets.

Some market observers point to macroeconomic factors that could benefit cryptocurrencies like ADA. The Federal Reserve’s planned reduction in quantitative tightening beginning in April might serve as a catalyst for price growth.

While maintaining long-term bullish outlooks, analysts acknowledge that short-term volatility remains likely. Key support levels between $0.50 and $0.60 may be tested before a sustained uptrend materializes.

Whales and long-term holders appear to be accumulating ADA despite market fluctuations. This continued buying pressure could signal confidence in future price appreciation.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Pi Network (PI) Price: Token Falls Below $1 Despite Reduced Unlocks,https://blockonomi.com/pi-network-pi-price-token-falls-below-1-despite-reduced-unlocks/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:21:11 GMT","TLDR

Pi coin dropped from $1.2 to around $0.92, showing price volatility

Daily token unlocks have decreased from 13 million to 3.8 million, potentially reducing selling pressure

New partnership with PiDaoSwap aims to improve governance and transparency

Analysts predict potential recovery to $2 in short term, with some making extremely optimistic long-term predictions

Upcoming token unlocks of 99.3 million PI (worth $91 million) scheduled over the next 30 days

The Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency (PI) has fallen below the $1 threshold, currently trading at approximately $0.92. This represents a significant drop from its recent high of $1.2, marking a decline of about 4% in the past 24 hours.

This downward trend comes despite some positive developments in the broader cryptocurrency market. The price movement has confused many investors who expected Pi to follow the general market trend.

The token has experienced considerable volatility since its launch. Pi has lost over 65% of its value from its all-time high of $3 reached earlier this year.

Market data shows that the token briefly touched a low of $0.911 before recovering slightly to its current price level. Technical analysis indicates the token is struggling to maintain support above the $0.95 mark.

PI Network $PI has broken out from the falling wedge 🔹 If price holds the trendline as support, it can push toward the first resistance level at $1.22 🔹 If bulls flip this level into support, we could see a test of $1.50 🚀 pic.twitter.com/JJjzsuOXdr — Trader Edge (@Pro_Trader_Edge) March 25, 2025

One of the main factors putting pressure on Pi’s price has been the substantial token unlocks. However, recent data suggests these unlocks have decreased from 13 million tokens daily to approximately 3.8 million.

This reduction in daily token unlocks could potentially ease selling pressure. With fewer new tokens entering circulation each day, the market may have a chance to absorb the supply more effectively.

According to data from Pi Scan, nearly 99.3 million PI tokens are scheduled for unlock over the next 30 days. This amount represents approximately $91 million at current prices.

The token unlock schedule shows an average of 3 million tokens will be released daily during this period. The largest single-day unlock is set for April 3, when 6.8 million tokens will enter circulation.

Future months will see even larger unlocks, with 115.57 million tokens scheduled for April, 182 million in May, and 222 million in June. These upcoming unlocks may continue to put downward pressure on the price.

On a more positive note, Pi Network recently announced an official partnership with PiDaoSwap. This community-driven platform aims to improve the network’s governance process and increase transparency.

Other internal platforms, such as Pi News, have also joined this partnership. These collaborations are part of Pi Network’s strategy to build a more extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications.

Market Analysis

Some market analysts remain optimistic despite the current price difficulties. Several technical analysts suggest that PI could potentially break out of its current downward trend and move toward the $2 mark in the near term.

More ambitious predictions have also emerged within the community. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin, who claims to have been involved during Pi Network’s development, has suggested a much higher long-term valuation.

Dr. Altcoin proposed that Pi Network’s ultimate goal is to become an advanced stablecoin for peer-to-peer transactions. Under this vision, he suggested the token could potentially reach values above $10 as the network matures.

Even more optimistic predictions have circulated, with some suggesting a symbolic price target of $314.159, a number linked to the mathematical constant π. However, such predictions would require an extremely large market capitalization and seem highly speculative.

Some community members have suggested token burns to help stabilize the price. Pi Network recently burned 10 million tokens, reducing the total supply to 6.77 billion, though this has not significantly impacted the price.

Uncertainty regarding exchange listings has also affected investor sentiment. Many community members had hoped for a listing on major exchanges like Binance, but no such announcements have materialized.",blockonomi

After surging to $2.57 in the wake of this landmark win, XRP remains stable around the $2.4 mark, with market analysts now eyeing a potential $5 target.

However, savvy traders have already identified an even bigger opportunity in the XRP ecosystem: the XRPTurbo presale, which is rapidly nearing its completion and promising explosive gains for early participants.

XRP Holds Firm with Key Levels to Watch

XRP has performed impressively, climbing nearly 1% over the past week despite wider crypto volatility.

Although recent gains briefly pushed the token toward $2.57, the price faced resistance and consolidated around current levels.

Bitcoin Momentum Could Ignite XRP Rally

Another positive catalyst for XRP is Bitcoin’s current market position. BTC is testing crucial resistance levels, and a confirmed breakout could inject significant momentum into XRP and other major altcoins.

With XRP’s strong fundamental backdrop and Bitcoin potentially driving market sentiment, XRP investors have a lot to look forward to in the months ahead.

However, forward-thinking crypto traders are already positioning themselves in the market’s next big thing: XRPTurbo.

XRPTurbo: The Next Big Thing on XRP Ledger?

XRPTurbo ($XRT) is a revolutionary launchpad being built specifically to turbocharge decentralized finance (DeFi) on the XRP blockchain.

Within just weeks of launching its presale, XRPTurbo has become one of the most talked-about opportunities in crypto, raising over 50% of its presale hard cap—more than 190,000 XRP—reflecting overwhelming investor interest.

The XRPTurbo platform is set to launch an exciting suite of DeFi products tailored exclusively to the XRP community, including:

XRP Token & NFT Minting Engine: A simplified platform enabling users to mint XRP-native tokens and NFTs at minimal cost, opening doors for widespread blockchain adoption.

$XRT Token—Your Gateway to Ripple’s Next Bull Run

The $XRT token serves as the heart of the XRPTurbo ecosystem. Investors holding $XRT will enjoy numerous benefits, including discounted minting fees, exclusive early investment opportunities, and robust staking rewards.

What makes XRPTurbo particularly appealing is that the presale price isn’t fixed—the final token valuation will be determined based on the total XRP raised.

Once the presale ends, XRPTurbo has confirmed plans to list the $XRT token on at least two exchanges, at prices 25% higher than the final presale price—instantly rewarding early backers.

Presale Ending Soon—Secure Your $XRT Now!

With less than 5 days remaining in XRPTurbo’s rapidly filling presale, the window to acquire $XRT tokens at optimal prices is quickly closing.

Investors from projects such as PI Network ($PI) and Dogecoin ($DOGE)—both of which recently saw declining momentum—are already flocking to XRPTurbo, recognizing its immense potential as the next explosive altcoin on the XRP Ledger.

How To To participate in the Xrpturbo presale:

Acquire XRP from an exchange like Binance or Coinbase.

Set up an XRP-compatible wallet (Xaman Wallet recommended) and send the purchased XRP to the wallet.

Visit the XRPTurbo presale portal (xrpturbo.com/presale) and click on Buy XRT token.

Send XRP to the presale address and receive your $XRT tokens upon presale completion.

The XRPTurbo team has also confirmed plans to reveal a first-look demo of their innovative DeFi platform in the coming week—heightening anticipation even further.

Ripple (XRP) has long been a dominant force in blockchain-based financial transactions. However, recent developments suggest that investors are exploring alternatives. Rexas Finance (RXS) is gaining momentum as a strong contender in the growing tokenized asset sector.

XRP Faces Resistance Despite Market Developments

Ripple (XRP) has struggled to maintain upward momentum despite positive news, including an executive order from the U.S. government supporting digital asset reserves. The price of XRP is currently trading around $2.50, marking a 1.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Trading volume has also decreased by 7.5%, signaling lower investor enthusiasm. Technical analysis indicates that XRP is facing resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. Analysts have pointed to bearish divergence signals, where price increases are not matched by momentum indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 55, indicating weakening bullish momentum.

If XRP fails to break past resistance, it may continue trading sideways or decline toward the $2.25 support level. A further drop below this level could push the price toward $2.00. Despite these price challenges, whale accumulation has increased. Wallets holding 100 million to 1 billion XRP have added over 2 billion tokens in the past week. Additionally, 99 million XRP was withdrawn from exchanges at an average price of $2.30, a 94.12% increase from the previous day. Market analysts suggest that this could indicate long-term confidence in the asset. However, short-term traders remain cautious due to continued resistance at key price levels and an overall 12% drop in network activity over the past month.

Rexas Finance (RXS) Gains Investor Interest as a Strong Alternative

Rexas Finance (RXS) is an emerging capital that is beginning to take its position in this market. It has disclosed the presale that the project has obtained more than 47 million dollars, and, it has sold 90% of tokens. Currently, RXS is trading at $0.20, and the official exchange will start on June 19, 2025, with the value of $0.25.

Rexas Finance specialises in the creation of RWAs, through which it provides opportunities to purchase shares in real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. It enhances market liquidity while allowing entry to what were hitherto closed off individual clients. The initiative has received interest from retail and institutional investors interested in blockchain-enabled asset ownership. The Rexas Finance ecosystem encompasses various components that focus on improving the products’ tokenization and sales within the financial markets. Rexas Token Builder is a software that is easy to use thus allowing anyone to issue tokens linked to physical assets they own. Rexas Launchpad is an efficient solution to allow new blockchain projects to sell tokens securely.

Trading and Integrated Financial System Rexas Finance also provides decentralized finance (DeFi) services for trading tokenized assets across various blockchains. Specifically, the Rexas DeFi Treasury provides investment opportunities where token holders can share in the earnings. Furthermore, Rexas Estate offers fractional ownership of the properties, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Also, the project has been audited by the blockchain security firm to improve its transparency and protect investors. Some of the analysts’ expectations indicate that RXS could witness a higher price rise in the future, with some estimations stating that the value could surpass $10 by the year-end.

Whale.io has announced plans to migrate its Whale NFT collection from the TON blockchain to the Solana blockchain. The cross-chain transition aims to expand the project’s interoperability and accessibility by leveraging Solana’s infrastructure. This move represents a strategic shift in blockchain alignment for one of the more prominent NFT collections launched in recent years.

Initial Launch on TON Blockchain

The Whale NFT collection was initially launched on the TON blockchain, where all 20,000 NFTs were minted at no cost within hours of release. The rapid minting reflected strong early engagement from the community. Over the following year, the collection became one of the most visible projects on Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace. According to platform data, the floor price increased approximately sevenfold during this period.

Hosted on Getgems.io (collection available here), Whale NFTs quickly became a cultural phenomenon within the TON ecosystem. With eye-catching designs and varying rarities, Whale.io’s collectibles became popular display pictures across Telegram, where the team has continued to deliver value, innovation, and utility to keep the project thriving.

Buybacks, Supply Reductions, and Fee-Free Trading

The Whale team has implemented several mechanisms to manage supply and maintain engagement with the collection, including token buybacks and supply reductions via burns. These practices have been part of the project’s ongoing strategy on the TON blockchain, and the team has indicated that similar measures will be introduced following the migration to Solana.

In addition, Whale NFTs have been available for trading with zero gas fees on supported platforms, a feature that has contributed to repeated appearances on trending lists within Getgems, TON’s leading NFT marketplace. With the upcoming transition to Solana—known for its high throughput and low transaction costs—the collection is expected to remain active across major NFT marketplaces within the Solana ecosystem.

Utility That Packs a Punch

At the heart of this is the Wheel of Whales miniapp on Telegram, a play-to-earn sensation that’s taking the crypto gaming world by storm. This innovative game offers players the exclusive chance to participate in the distribution of Whale tokens, making it a golden opportunity for anyone looking to dive into the project’s rewards system.

Owning a Whale NFT isn’t just a flex—it’s a ticket to amplified benefits within Wheel of Whales. Holders enjoy boosted earnings and a suite of in-game perks, giving them a significant edge in this addictive play-to-earn game. With rarities ranging from common to ultra-rare, each NFT brings its own unique flair and value to the game, making every Whale a prized possession. Highest rarity Golden NFT prices go up to 2000 TON that equals over 7000 USDT.

Bridging to Solana: A New Frontier

Whale.io has announced its intention to bridge its NFT collection to the Solana blockchain, recognized for its scalability and active NFT ecosystem. The transition is designed to expand the project’s reach by integrating with Solana’s infrastructure and user base. According to the team, this cross-chain move reflects a broader strategy to enhance accessibility and engagement across multiple blockchain environments.

The bridge from TON to Solana represents an effort to connect two blockchain ecosystems, enabling broader accessibility for the Whale NFT collection. Whale.io will bring its established framework—which has included gas-free trading, supply reduction mechanisms, and various utility features—into the Solana environment. With Solana’s low transaction costs and high-speed processing, the transition is intended to streamline the user experience and support increased activity across NFT marketplaces.

Bridge Signals Strategic Expansion Across NFT and Gaming Ecosystems

The Whale NFT bridge is a landmark moment for the broader NFT and blockchain gaming industries. It showcases how projects can evolve, adapt, and thrive across ecosystems while delivering consistent value to their communities. For Whale holders, this is a chance to ride the tide of a project that’s already proven its worth and is now gearing up for an even bigger splash. For newcomers, it’s an invitation to dive into a collection that’s equal parts art, investment, and entertainment.

Preparing for the Solana Bridge

With the upcoming bridge to Solana, Whale.io is transitioning its NFT collection into a new blockchain environment. The project has encouraged community members, NFT collectors, and Telegram gaming participants to follow official channels for updates regarding the bridging timeline, marketplace listings, and upcoming developments within the Wheel of Whales ecosystem.

https://blockonomi.com,Beincom Kicks Off 300M BIC Token Airdrop To Drive Web3 Adoption,https://blockonomi.com/beincom-kicks-off-300m-bic-token-airdrop-to-drive-web3-adoption/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:21:05 GMT","Tortola, VG1110 British Virgin Islands, March 25th, 2025, Chainwire

Beincom, the pioneering SocialFi project, has announced its upcoming 300 million BIC token airdrop. Beincom introduces mechanisms aimed at safeguarding new token holders and highlights the multifaceted utility of its BIC Token within its ecosystem.

Beincom and BIC Token – A Breakthrough In the SocialFi Era

Beincom is a next-generation social hub and community platform, powered by the friendliness of the web2 interface and the power of web3 decentralization. By integrating blockchain, tokenization, NFTs, and Social Hub, Beincom empowers creators, communities, and businesses.

At the heart of Beincom’s ecosystem is BIC Token, the utility token that fuels all activities and engagement within the platform. More than just a token, $BIC incentivizes contributions and grants exclusive benefits, creating a sustainable and transparent economy for long-term growth.

The total supply of BIC Tokens is fixed at 5 billion tokens. Unlike many other projects where the core team holds a substantial share, Beincom’s core team allocation is capped at just 6% of the total supply. This reduces the risk of market manipulation and ensures a decentralized ecosystem.

Beincom Announces Long-Term Token Distribution Plan via Airdrop

Beincom has unveiled a 50-month token distribution initiative, allocating 6% of its total token supply—equivalent to 300 million BIC tokens—through a structured airdrop campaign. Under the program, 6 million BIC tokens will be distributed monthly. The first scheduled airdrop is anticipated to begin in May 2025 (date to be confirmed).

Participants can earn Medals—platform-specific reward points—by contributing to the ecosystem through activities such as community engagement and content creation. These Medals can be converted into BIC Tokens once the airdrop officially commences. Notably, accumulated Medals will not be reset, enabling continued eligibility throughout the subsequent 49 months of distribution. Further information is available on Beincom’s official website.

This structured, long-term approach differs from conventional short-term airdrop models, with the aim of facilitating broader participation, consistent engagement, and gradual distribution across the ecosystem.

Liquidity Fee Protection – A 35% Free To Prevent Market Dumps

https://blockonomi.com,Bullish Signal That Started Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Rally in 2021 Predicts 19455% Rise for Emerging Token,https://blockonomi.com/bullish-signal-that-started-shiba-inus-shib-rally-in-2021-predicts-19455-rise-for-emerging-token/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:00:49 GMT","Back in 2021, Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocketed over 45,000%, turning early investments into life-changing wealth. Now, the same bullish signal that sparked SHIB’s historic surge is flashing for a new under-the-radar altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently trading at just $0.015, analysts predict MUTM could soar 19,455%, reaching $3 in the next market cycle. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on meme hype, Mutuum Finance is a utility-driven DeFi platform. Currently in its presale stage, this rapidly growing altcoin has already amassed almost $4.8 million, with Phase 3 progressing at $0.02. More than 6600 investors have seized the opportunity, positioning themselves ahead of a 25% price increase in the next phase. Over 70% of phase 3 has already been sold out and investors have less time before the phase ends. Those joining at this stage are poised for a 200% return on investment when Mutuum Finance officially launches at $0.06.

The DeFi Breakthrough Attracting Major Attention

Mutuum Finance is performing well in the decentralized finance market with its innovative dual-lending system. Currently in its presale phase, this rising altcoin has already secured over $4.8 in funding, with more than 6600 investors joining. The token is available at $0.02 in Phase 2, but with a 25% price increase set for the next phase, phase 3 buyers have a prime opportunity to maximize their gains. Upon launch at $0.06, investors stand to gain a 200% return, and projections suggest a meteoric rise beyond $1 during the upcoming bull run. As momentum builds, experts are eyeing MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi projects, with its unique lending model setting it apart from traditional competitors.

Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model system which unites Peer-to-Contract (P2C) along with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending to redefine decentralized lending operations. Users can benefit from passive returns in P2C model liquidity pools by depositing stablecoins like USDT while borrowers use this system for efficient fund access. Through P2P lending users establish straight deals between each other because this approach avoids using middle groups. Mutuum Finance uses a dual-model structure which merges P2C with P2P lending activities to offer clients improved security together with enhanced efficiency and decentralization capabilities. Users at Mutuum Finance can maintain full control over lending choices which establishes a more flexible system that supports different types of conservative and high-yield investors.

A Secure & Stable Ecosystem

Mutuum Finance launches a stablecoin on Ethereum that has complete collateral support for maintaining USD price equality. Users must provide more value than the stablecoin value due to its resistance to volatility through over-collateralized methods which protect against any risks of liquidation. The long-term sustainability of the platform receives strong support from this mechanism through its foundation of well-established value principles. Full contract auditing and transparent financial structures at Mutuum Finance reinforce investor confidence thus preventing the risks which led to past issues at other DeFi lending platforms.

Strategic Tokenomics for Long-Term Success

Mutuum Finance’s tokenomics strategy is designed for sustainable growth, balancing liquidity, security, and partnerships while preventing inflation. A structured presale and controlled token distribution create a framework for lasting value. Staking rewards further enhance profitability, ensuring consistent yield for token holders and reinforcing community engagement. The team has also implemented deflationary mechanisms that reduce supply over time, helping drive scarcity and long-term appreciation of the token.

Mutuum Finance is set to revolutionize DeFi lending, combining innovation with strong fundamentals. With $4.8 million raised and 6,600+ investors onboard, its presale at $0.02 offers a 200% return potential at launch. As momentum builds, experts predict a 19,455% surge.

https://blockonomi.com,"Ethereum (ETH) Price: Holding Above $2,000 with Analysts Predicting Retracement Before $3,000 Target",https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-eth-price-holding-above-2000-with-analysts-predicting-retracement-before-3000-target/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:13:05 GMT","TLDR

Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,054 after reaching a peak of $2,104 on March 25, 2025

Analysts predict ETH may retrace to approximately $1,900 before potentially surging to $3,000

Strong on-chain metrics show daily volume over $10 billion and growing ETH futures open interest

Institutional investors and whales have purchased nearly half a million ETH in recent weeks

Key support zone exists between $1,871-$1,981, while resistance is found around $2,100-$2,150

Ethereum’s price continues to show strength above the $2,000 level as of March 25, 2025. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $2,054, showing resilience despite a recent 3% pullback from its peak of $2,104 reached earlier the same day.

Market analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s price action for signs of where it might head next. Some experts believe ETH may experience a short-term retracement before making a significant move upward.

One crypto analyst using the pseudonym MAXPAIN has suggested Ethereum price could pull back by nearly 9% from its recent peak. This would bring ETH to around the $1,900 area, which is identified as a key support zone.

Trading data from CoinGlass shows two important liquidity zones that traders should watch. The first is between $2,135 and $2,106, where approximately $450 million worth of short positions would face liquidation if prices rise above this range.

The second zone lies between $1,980 and $1,833, where more than $700 million in long positions would be forced to close. This creates the potential for high volatility if price moves decisively in either direction.

On-chain metrics for Ethereum remain strong, with daily trading volume exceeding $10 billion. This high volume indicates active market participation and healthy liquidity for the digital asset.

Market Analysis

Futures market data also points to growing open interest in Ethereum contracts. This metric suggests more investors are taking positions in ETH derivatives, which often precedes major price movements.

The long-to-short ratio for Ethereum has reached 1.2287, with long positions now making up 55% of total contracts. This shift indicates growing bullish sentiment among traders over the past four hours.

Whale activity has been increasing, with data showing nearly half a million ETH purchased by large investors in recent weeks. This accumulation by institutional investors and wealthy individuals often precedes price increases.

Another bullish indicator is the declining supply of ETH on exchanges. Over 1.2 million ETH has moved from exchange wallets into staking contracts and private wallets, suggesting a potential supply squeeze that could drive prices higher.

Technical analysis from crypto analyst Gert van Lagen highlights the potential formation of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart. This bullish pattern often precedes upward price movements, with a neckline near the $4,000 mark.

Another analyst, Michael van de Poppe, has identified a critical supply zone between $2,100 and $2,150. A breakout above this resistance could potentially trigger a 30% surge, pushing Ethereum toward $2,800.

$ETH [1W] bounces off the ~$1800-$2000 support range while having formed a complex iH&S structure, targeting ~$18k. This support level acted as resistance during the 'head' phase. Now price successfully retested it as support. Now the Left and Right shoulders are well-aligned. pic.twitter.com/909aRoeajD — Gert van Lagen (@GertvanLagen) March 24, 2025

For investors looking to buy Ethereum, the $1,900 area might present an opportunity if the price retraces as some analysts expect. This zone aligns with a value area identified in Time Price Opportunity (TPO) charts and coincides with strong historical support.

Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market reported a net-zero flow on March 24, marking the seventh day of balanced inflows and outflows since their launch. The total net assets held by these ETFs now amount to $7.17 billion, representing about 2.85% of Ethereum’s market cap.

The overall outlook for Ethereum remains positive despite potential short-term volatility. With strong support levels, increasing institutional interest, and positive on-chain metrics, many market participants are expecting ETH to eventually test the $3,000 level in the coming weeks.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,XRP Price: Technical Analysis Points to Potential Break Above $2.50 Resistance,https://blockonomi.com/xrp-price-technical-analysis-points-to-potential-break-above-2-50-resistance/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:09:35 GMT","TLDR

XRP is trading at $2.45, showing a 2.14% increase in the last 24 hours and forming a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern

72.28% of traders on Binance Futures hold long positions on XRP, indicating strong bullish sentiment

Derivatives data shows surging volume (60.98% increase to $4.52 billion) and a 167.91% rise in Options volume

The SEC lawsuit against Ripple has been dropped, removing a major bearish factor that had affected XRP since 2021

Analysts predict potential short-term breakout to $3 and possible long-term targets up to $27, with XRP ETF approval speculation boosting investor confidence

XRP has shown strong recovery on the price charts, trading at $2.45 with a 2.14% increase in the last 24 hours. This upward movement has sparked interest among traders about whether XRP can break through the key $2.50 resistance level and trigger a more extended rally.

Technical analysis shows XRP forming an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which is often a reliable signal of bullish momentum. The pattern shows the head at $1.99, while the right shoulder formed near $2.20.

The critical neckline for this pattern sits at $2.45. A breakthrough above this level could open the door for a move toward $2.60 and potentially higher targets.

Currently, XRP has gained 6% over the past seven days. However, it has experienced a 2% drop on the daily chart and continues to struggle against the $2.50 barrier.

Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern on $XRP with a target of $3.05 Price has broken the neckline, send it!! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fM9bIUXyJi — Trader Edge (@Pro_Trader_Edge) March 25, 2025

Market sentiment appears strongly positive. Long/short ratio positions on Binance Futures reveal that 72.28% of traders hold long positions on XRP. This means most traders believe XRP’s price will continue to rise.

Only 27.72% of traders are betting against XRP with short positions. This ratio shows growing confidence in XRP’s potential to break through resistance levels.

The derivatives market provides additional evidence of growing interest. Trading volume for XRP has surged by 60.98%, reaching $4.52 billion. Open interest stands at $3.97 billion.

Even more impressive is the 167.91% increase in Options volume. These metrics suggest that market participants are actively speculating on XRP’s price movement, supporting the bullish outlook.

After five weeks of withdrawals, digital asset investment products have recorded massive inflows. XRP and Bitcoin led this positive trend, bringing in a combined $730 million. Ripple secured the second spot in these inflows.

A major factor driving optimism is the resolution of XRP’s legal battle with the SEC. The lawsuit, which had been ongoing since 2021, has been dropped by the SEC. This development removes a significant bearish variable that had weighed on XRP.

Legal expert Jeremy Hogan speculated that if the victory includes nullifying previous rulings, XRP could return to the market stronger than before. Earlier rulings had banned XRP from being sold to institutional clients and investors.

Another potential catalyst for XRP is the speculation around XRP ETF approval. Polymarket bettors have reached a new high of 87%, betting that the SEC will approve a spot ETF for XRP in 2025.

If approved, these ETFs could accelerate institutional adoption of XRP and attract significant investments. This would give XRP more legitimacy and potentially push it into mainstream status.

Technical Analysis

On the technical side, XRP has broken an important resistance level represented by the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This EMA can now serve as a support level and potentially boost XRP above the $3 mark.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows 59, representing a neutral condition for the XRP market. This, combined with the recent breakout, suggests that a price surge may occur in the coming days.

Other technical indicators also point to positive momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 0.334 indicates strong short-term momentum. The Rate of Change indicator has recorded 10%, marking positive price movement.

Analyst Egrag Crypto has projected that a breakout above the $3 resistance could send XRP to $6 in the short term. His long-term prediction suggests XRP could reach as high as $27 in the coming years if conditions remain favorable.

Despite these positive signals, XRP has been moving sideways with short-term bounces. A larger bearish divergence remains active on the 3-day chart, suggesting that significant upward momentum might face challenges in the near term.

Support levels for XRP are found between $2.24 and $2.30, with additional support in the $1.95 to $2.05 range. On the resistance side, key levels include $2.59, followed by stronger resistance between $2.65 to $2.80, and another barrier at the $3 mark.

In summary, XRP shows promising signs for a potential breakout above $2.50, with both technical patterns and market sentiment supporting bullish momentum.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Solana (SOL) Price: Trading Volume Surges 130% as Market Shows Recovery Signs,https://blockonomi.com/solana-sol-price-trading-volume-surges-130-as-market-shows-recovery-signs/,"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:05:00 GMT","TLDR

Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $138, up 5.87% in 24 hours but still down 20% for the month

Polymarket has integrated Solana wallet deposits to lower transaction costs and improve user experience

SOL’s trading volume increased by 130.42% to $3.33 billion with total futures at $5.25 billion (up 11.01%)

Active Solana wallets rebounded from 1 million to 3 million between March 20-23

SOL price spiked nearly 7% following the Polymarket integration announcement

Solana’s price has shown signs of recovery over the past 24 hours, currently trading at $138 with a 5.87% increase. The uptick comes as Polymarket announced integration with Solana wallet deposits on March 24, allowing users to fund their accounts using SOL alongside the previously available USDC option.

Despite this recent price jump, SOL remains down 20% over the past month. This indicates the market has been experiencing volatility and uncertainty in recent weeks.

Solana bounced back from a recent low of $128.49, showing some short-term strength. However, the cryptocurrency is still struggling to break past the $140 resistance level, where sellers continue to apply downward pressure.

Two possible scenarios for Solana $SOL: 🔹 $144 is a key level for bulls to reclaim for more upside. 🔹 This price level has the highest trading volume since March 2024. pic.twitter.com/vQX60XwYOx — Trader Edge (@Pro_Trader_Edge) March 23, 2025

If SOL can move above $140 and maintain that position, it could signal a shift toward more positive market sentiment. This key price level will be important to watch in the coming days.

Trading Analysis

Trading volume for Solana has surged by 130.42% to $3.33 billion. This indicates increased market activity, with more people buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Data from Coinglass reveals growing interest in Solana’s futures market. The total money in Solana Futures has reached $5.25 billion, marking an 11.01% increase.

This rise in Open Interest could potentially support further price growth. However, it might also trigger sharp corrections if liquidation events occur in the futures market.

According to CryptoQuant, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 67. This places the token in a neutral zone, not yet considered overbought but approaching levels where selling pressure could increase.

If the RSI exceeds 70, Solana may enter overbought territory. This could lead to a temporary price drop as some traders take profits.

Network activity appears to be supporting the price recovery. Over the past week, the number of active Solana wallets dropped to 1 million on March 20 before rebounding to 3 million by March 23.

New wallet creation followed a similar pattern. After a drop around March 19-20, wallet creation has bounced back over the last few days.

This network activity is a positive sign for Solana. More users typically indicates higher demand, which could help maintain price strength.

Polymarket’s integration of Solana is designed to lower transaction costs and improve user experience. The platform has become a leading venue for blockchain-based prediction markets.

“Starting today, you can now make deposits into your Polymarket wallet using Solana,” the company announced on March 24. The integration brings one of the industry’s fastest, lowest-cost networks to the platform.

With near-instant finality and very low transaction costs, Solana’s addition positions Polymarket to scale its user base. This could potentially introduce more users to the Solana ecosystem.

In the minutes following Polymarket’s integration announcement, Solana’s price spiked by nearly 7% to trade at $140. On the seven-day charts, Solana is up 10%.

For Solana to continue its upward movement, it needs to break past $140 with strong trading volume. The recent 130% jump in volume is a positive indicator, but sustained buyer interest will be needed.

If traders remain active, the RSI continues to rise, and network usage grows, SOL price could climb toward the next resistance level. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Solana can maintain its recovery or face renewed selling pressure.",blockonomi
