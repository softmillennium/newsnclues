M23 rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) have claimed they captured hundreds of Burundian soldiers during recent fighting near the border town of Uvira, marking a major escalation in a conflict that has continued despite a US-brokered peace deal.

Officials from the Congo River Alliance (AFC), a rebel coalition which includes the M23 movement, said the Burundian troops were seized during clashes with forces backing the Congolese Army in South Kivu province.

Burundi has deployed troops to eastern Congo for several years in support of Kinshasa's campaign against armed groups operating in the region.

“The AFC/M23 declares its readiness to hand over to the government of Burundi military personnel captured on the battlefield,” the group's spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said in a statement on Monday.

Busu Bwa Ngwi, the M23-appointed governor of South Kivu, also said on Saturday that the rebels still intend to “reclaim all provinces” and warned Burundian soldiers and other foreign forces “to return to their countries immediately.”

The reported capture comes days after M23 fighters seized Uvira, a strategic city on Lake Tanganyika close to the Burundi border. The DR Congo government said more than 100 people have been killed and thousands forced to flee in the offensive, which it said was backed by Rwanda's Defense Forces.

The fighting has unfolded despite Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame signing an accord in Washington earlier this month, aimed at easing tensions and halting violence in eastern DR Congo. US President Donald Trump, who mediated the deal, hailed it as a “historic” end to three decades of armed conflict in the region.

Congolese officials have since accused Rwanda of breaching its commitments under the deal by failing to halt actions that undermine security in eastern Congo. Kigali has repeatedly denied involvement, insisting the escalation is the result of attacks by the Congolese army and its Burundian allies.

On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Rwanda's actions in DR Congo were a “clear violation of the Washington Accords” and vowed to “take action to ensure promises made to the president are kept.”

Germany's reunification in 1990 was carried out in a way that overwhelmingly benefited the western part of the country and amounted to a betrayal of East Germans by the Soviet Union, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.

Speaking to Iranian state broadcaster IRIB on Monday, Lavrov argued that the process laid the groundwork for modern Germany's renewed militarism, which Moscow views with growing concern.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to the unification of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic after receiving assurances that NATO would not expand further eastward – promises that were later broken.

“This was a mistake and betrayal on the part of the Soviet Union, when almost half a million troops were withdrawn without any compensation, and the opportunity to maintain their presence in the eastern part of united Germany was ignored,” Lavrov said.

He added that West German authorities mishandled the integration of the former GDR. “The authorities of what was then West Germany made a grave mistake when after taking over the eastern part they treated their compatriots as second-class people,” he said. “The German authorities, as conquerors, took all the lands of the former GDR under their control, while getting rid of all the political figures. No future was offered to them. It was a takeover, not a merger.”

Berlin is now among the strongest advocates of the European Union's large-scale militarization drive, which the bloc's leaders justify by claiming the need to prepare for a possible Russian attack. Moscow says such rhetoric is designed to intimidate the public and suppress dissent amid domestic political failures.

Lavrov criticized recent statements by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, calling some of them “blatantly racist” and reminiscent of Nazi-era rhetoric.

“The DNA that runs in his family is still there,” the foreign minister said, referring to Merz's maternal grandfather, Josef Paul Sauvigny, whom historical records describe as an enthusiastic Nazi Party member. “This is about contempt, arrogance, and I can go as far as to call this an attitude of a person pretending to represent a superior race,” Lavrov stated.

The US has given Ukraine a “take it or leave it” ultimatum, warning that an offer of NATO-style security guarantees could be withdrawn if Kiev does not agree to Washington's proposed peace terms, according to The Telegraph.

On Monday, Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky met with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin to discuss US President Donald Trump's peace proposal. While the details have not been made public, American officials cited by the newspaper have described the proposed security guarantees as “platinum standard.”

However, the negotiators reportedly warned Zelensky that the offer “will not be on the table forever,” urging him to accept Washington's terms. The guarantees are said to be modeled on NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and justifies retaliation by the entire bloc.

American officials told The Telegraph that around 90% of the broader peace deal has already been agreed upon by both Moscow and Kiev. However, there has reportedly been no progress on the territorial issue or on a proposed “50-50” split of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant.

Washington has reportedly been pressing Kiev to withdraw its forces from the Donbass region as a condition for peace. According to the Wall Street Journal, US negotiators have been “unwilling to compromise” on this point. The Donbass joined Russia following a referendum in 2022.

Trump pointed out on Monday that Ukraine has “already lost the territory” and that his guarantee proposal is meant to prevent the conflict from restarting. He noted that he wants a deal reached before the end of the year.

Zelensky recently indicated he could abandon Kiev's NATO ambitions in exchange for binding security guarantees, but has continued to rule out recognizing Russia's borders or holding a long-delayed presidential election beforehand. However, he has suggested that after receiving the assurances, Kiev could organize a referendum on territorial concessions and possibly a new vote.

Moscow has rejected Zelensky's proposal as a ploy to prolong the conflict, insisting on Kiev's withdrawal from all Russian territories and pledging to push Ukrainian troops out one way or another.

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has set off for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian officials in Moscow, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali announced.

""Stable relations between Iran and Russia are getting stronger thanks to continued high-level meetings. Following last week's consultations between the two countries' presidents in Ashgabat, Dr. Araghchi set off today for a meeting with this country's foreign minister and other officials in Moscow,"" the Iranian embassy quoted the ambassador as saying on its Telegram channel.

At present, the agenda includes a wide range of political issues and economic projects, as the two countries maintain regional and international cooperation to promote shared goals and approaches designed to take bilateral relations to a new level, he emphasized.

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Politicians in Germany and other European countries are starting to remember their ancestors who were active members of the Nazi party, which causes much concern, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).

He also noted that the situation around Russia's frozen assets made it clear that ""stealing is in the Europeans' blood.""

TASS has compiled the main points from the top diplomat's remarks.

Politicians in Germany and other European countries are starting to remember their ancestors who were active members of Nazi party, which ""causes much concern.""

""The ideas and practices of Nazism"" are being revived in Europe as efforts are being made to unite it and send it to fight against Russia the way Hitler and Napoleon did in the past: ""It's about openly Nazi approaches and flagrant disregard for what the Nazi regime in Ukraine is doing.""

Europe, united ""under the Nazi flag,"" is once again waging a war against Russia, which involves ""European money and European instructors,"" but Ukrainians are being used as proxies.

Europe has had a lot of opportunities to become part of the process to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but it ignored them all.

Russia has nothing to communicate about with the current European leadership.

Western media allegations that Russia cannot be trusted are ""empty words.""

The West has no evidence to prove that Russia ever failed to implement any of its obligations.

The goal of the new US National Security Strategy ""is to make sure that Europe knows its place and doesn't try to impose its liberal ways, <...> but minds its own business, without dragging the US in its rather dirty games.""

In its new National Security Strategy, the US is telling Europe, ""Go about your own business and don't expect the US to keep supporting your reckless ventures because it has more important affairs to attend to, primarily in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.""

US sanctions on Russia's oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft stem from the desire ""to suppress its competitors by using dirty methods.""

The US is pursuing a policy of confronting China, which is becoming economically and politically stronger with every year, but ""competition must be fair.""

Imposing tariffs of 100% and 500% to suppress competitors runs counter to the principles of globalization, which is what the US promoted for Russia after World War II: ""When sanctions are introduced and no one is hiding that the political positions of countries and individuals are the reason, it's not even inequality, it's disrespect for human rights.""

The situation around Russia's frozen assets makes it clear that ""stealing is in the Europeans' blood."" ""Our Western ‘colleagues' seem to have a bent towards stealing in their genes.""

Many global media outlets don't call European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen anything but ""Fuhrer Ursula.""

Reasonable people in the US and Europe call for restoring ""the principle of arms control,"" and Russia shares this approach.

Moscow is confident that Tehran should remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: ""We believe it's worth it.""

Russia seeks to boost security cooperation with Iran, particularly through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO): ""We are open to cooperation.""

The normalization of relations between Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council would mark ""an important contribution to strengthening peace"" in the region.

Moscow expects that Tehran will ratify the Convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea in the coming months: ""I hope that the convection will come fully into force"" before a Caspian nations' summit in Tehran, set for August 2026.

Western countries seek to divide the five Caspian nations ""in order to impose decisions that won't be based on a consensus.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

News of Ahmed al-Ahmed's selfless act quickly reached al-Nayrab, where locals say it proves religion or birthplace no barrier to heroism

A man who risked his life to wrestle a gun from a shooter in the Bondi beach terror attack on Sunday has become a hero in his home town in Syria.

Video of Ahmed al-Ahmed's selfless act quickly reached his birthplace of al-Nayrab, a small town in the countryside of Idlib, north-west Syria. Ahmed, a 44-year-old father of two children, left the village to emigrate to Australia in 2007. He initially worked in construction, but soon opened a fruit and vegetable shop in Sydney.

“His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” said farmer Mohammed, a 60-year-old uncle of Ahmed. Mohammed said he discovered his nephew's bravery through social media, coming across the video on his feed.

On Sunday, two gunmen, alleged to be 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, attacked a Hanukah celebration on the Sydney beach, killing 15 people. One of the alleged gunmen also died.

Ahmed was having lunch in the area when the shooting started, his brother Huthaifa told the Australian broadcaster ABC. Upon hearing the shots, Ahmed crept closer using cars for cover, before launching himself at one of two gunmen. Ahmed disarmed the attacker, pulling the rifle out of his hands and pointing it at the gunman, before laying the weapon against a tree. 
 Ahmed was shot in the shoulder at least twice during his attempt to wrest the gun out of the shooter's grip.

The act of heroism has made him famous in Australia and in Syria, where Syrians have been widely sharing the video of him disarming the gunman with pride.

In Nayrab, Ahmed is the talk of the town. The small village was under the control of Syrian rebels during the country's civil war and much of it is destroyed. Ahmed's own home is ruined, with the roof still patchy from bombs and no windows or doors surviving.

“This incident caused a global sensation. He is from Syria and he is a Muslim, and he had no motivation for doing this other than heroism and bravery,” Mohammed said.

Another relative recalled Ahmed as a heroic man and praised him for saving “innocent lives.”

“We are proud of what Ahmed, the son of our village did … his act was heroic and no one else could have done it,” Abdul Rahman al-Mohammed, a 30-year-old resident of Nayrab, told AFP.

In a video recorded while he was being wheeled in a bed through hospital corridors, Ahmed greets his Syrian relatives in Arabic. 
  “What can I say? I have passed through a very difficult phase, but thank God for everything,” Ahmed says while wishing specific family members well.

Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visited Ahmed in the hospital, shaking his hand and telling him that his “bravery is an inspiration for all Australians”. An online fundraiser to pay for his medical bills has received more than £1.2m in donations, with the GoFundMe being shared around the world.

The attack on Bondi beach, allegedly carried out by a father and son who reportedly underwent military training in an Islamist militant hotbed in the southern Philippines, seemed to be “motivated by Islamic State ideology,”, said Albanese.

The PM went on to say that Ahmed's heroism proved that coexistence, not extremism, was the essence of Australian society.

“At the best of times, what we see is Australians coming together. And what I want is for Australians to come together, for this to be reinforcing the need for us to promote national unity, and that is critical. There is no place in Australia for anti-semitism. There is no place for hatred,” Albanese said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As the sun sank on the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday, people gathered at a playground facing Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach for an event melding characteristically Jewish and Australian traditions: Free donuts, ice cream, kosher food, a petting zoo, face painting — and the main event, a menorah lighting.

What happened instead was unthinkable violence. Two gunmen stalked the beachside park raining gunfire into the crowd for more than 10 minutes, leaving 15 dead and 42 in hospital. Among those killed were a 10-year-old girl and Rabbi Eli Schlanger, head of Bondi's Chabad mission.

The alleged shooters were a father and son. Sajid Akram, aged 50, was shot by police at the scene. Naveed Akram, 24, was taken to hospital in a critical condition. Naveed had been investigated six years ago over links to a Sydney-based self-proclaimed Islamic State terror cell, Australian Broadcasting Corp reported on Monday without saying where it got the information.

Bondi — a suburb of low-rise apartments, multimillion-dollar family homes, and surfers strung between cliffs and sand on the azure waters of the Pacific — has been a center of Jewish life in Australia for more than a century.

As early as 1921, about one-third of Sydney's Jewish community lived there and in neighboring suburbs in the city's east, then a solidly working-class area. Thousands of migrants fleeing rising European anti-Semitism in the 1930s and 1940s joined them, building synagogues, social clubs and businesses.

In the years after World War II, billionaire property developers Frank Lowy and Harry Triguboff rose from, respectively, a Hungarian ghetto and Tianjin's Russo-Jewish community to become two of Australia's five richest people. Each has long-standing connections to the area and built up much of the neighboring suburb of Bondi Junction. One of the country's most famous swimwear brands, Seafolly, was started in Bondi in 1975 by a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor.

Bondi Beach has broader meaning to Australia, too. In an overwhelmingly secular nation, beaches represent something close to a sacred space. On the sand, there are no divisions of race, class or creed, and people from every corner of the planet can come together to barbecue, swim, sunbathe and socialize.

Sunday's shootings feel like a conscious attack on both sides of that escapism: Australia as a physical refuge from political violence, and as a mental retreat from a world where polarization and hatred seem to be relentlessly rising.

The flip side was always a certain complacency. Jews fleeing the rise of Nazism in Europe were not always welcomed in a society whose official migration policy favored white northern Europeans until the 1970s.

The country has become increasingly polarized since the Hamas attack on a music festival in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza that has so far killed more than 70,000 Palestinians.

A report released earlier this month by the Executive Council for Australian Jewry found there had been more anti-Jewish incidents in the past two years than in the previous 10 put together, including the torching of vehicles, graffiti sprayed on synagogues and homes, windows smashed, and myriad incidents of verbal and physical abuse. In the past 12 months alone there have been 1,654 such incidents.

Just last month, police authorized a neo-Nazi rally on the steps of the New South Wales parliament building in which black-shirted thugs hoisted a flag reading: “Abolish the Jewish Lobby.”

Such hatred is spreading on every side. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese presides over a comfortable center-left hegemony that seems a world away from the far-right politics on the rise in Chile, France, Germany, the UK and the US. And yet the One Nation party, whose founder, Pauline Hanson, has vilified Asian, indigenous and Muslim people since the 1990s, would be the third-biggest faction in Australia's House of Representatives if an election were held tomorrow, according to one recent poll.

There were 309 Islamophobic incidents in roughly two years through November last year, about double the rate of previous years.

Even Australia's vaunted gun laws — passed in the wake of the 1996 Port Arthur shootings, in which a lone gunman killed 35 people — are looking increasingly threadbare. There are now more guns in the country than there were back then. The older of Sunday's Bondi attackers had six firearms licensed to him.

The government has worked hard to halt the rising tide of anti-Semitic attacks, despite what some of its critics have alleged. It expelled Iran's ambassador and three other diplomats in August after concluding that the country's Revolutionary Guard directed at least two attacks, including the firebombing of a Jewish restaurant a few minute's walk from Bondi Beach. Clearly, though, it has not been enough.

More can be done to investigate and prevent that, without violating Australia's guarantees on free speech and civil liberties. A country that has just implemented a ban on most social media usage by under-16s also needs to take a hard look at how online platforms are being used to spread prejudice.

Let us not throw out the promise of safety and optimism that led people to gather at Sunday's Hanukkah festival in the first place, though. If that tradition represents the triumph of light over darkness — the rededication of a sacred space despoiled by violence — then upholding that spirit now seems a fitting rebuke to this vile attack.

European leaders including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were to meet yesterday in The Hague, Netherlands, to launch an International Claims Commission to compensate Kyiv for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks and alleged war crimes.

The one-day conference, cohosted by the Netherlands and the 46-nation Council of Europe, the continent's top rights group, was to be attended by dozens of senior figures, including  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas.

The meeting coincides with ongoing US-backed peace diplomacy aimed at stopping the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Russian officials were not immediately reachable to comment on the plan, but have repeatedly rejected allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes during the conflict.

The possible inclusion of an amnesty for wartime atrocities in a peace deal, which was at one point proposed by the administration of US President Donald Trump, could complicate Europe's plans to also compensate victims of abuses in Ukraine ranging from sexual violence and child deportations to destruction of religious sites.

The two-year-old Register of Damage, which is to become part of the commission, has received more than 80,000 claims submitted by individuals, organizations and public bodies in Ukraine under a wide range of categories.

More than 50 states and the EU have drafted a Council of Europe convention to create the commission, which is to take force after it has been ratified by 25 signatories, as long as sufficient funds have been secured to finance the work.

Dozens of countries have indicated support for the commission, likely to be based in The Hague. As many as 35 nations have indicated they would sign the convention at yesterday's meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said.

The commission — the second part of an international compensation mechanism for Ukraine — is to review, assess and decide on claims submitted to the Register of Damage for Ukraine, which was created by the Council of Europe in 2023, and determine compensation awards on a case-by-case basis.

Claims can be filed for damage, loss or injury caused by Russian acts committed in or against Ukraine on or after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. The claims, which cover violations of international law, can be brought by affected individuals, companies or the Ukrainian state, a draft of the proposal said.

The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction in the coming decade at US$524 billion, or nearly three times Ukraine's economic output last year. 

However, that figure is through December last year only and does not include damage caused this year, when Russian attacks escalated as part of a campaign targeting utilities, transport and civilian infrastructure.

Details on how any damages awarded by the commission would be paid still need to be worked out, but the source said Russian assets frozen by the EU were among the options being discussed.


PARLIAMENT CHAOS:

Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since last month after his conviction for a scheme to stop Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 election.
Lawmakers had been discussing a bill that would significantly reduce sentences for several crimes, including attempting a coup d'etat — opening up the prospect that Bolsonaro, 70, could have his sentence cut to

Beijing has raged at Tokyo since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi last month said that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Japan.
China and Japan have long sparred over their painful history. China consistently reminds its people of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in which it says Japanese troops killed 300,000 people in what was then its capital.

The incidents came after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi triggered a dispute with Beijing last month with her remarks on how Tokyo might react to a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan.

Chinese embassy staffers earlier this month attempted to interrupt an award ceremony of an international tea competition in France when the organizer introduced Taiwan and displayed the Republic of China flag, a Taiwanese tea farmer said in an interview published yesterday. 

Hsieh Chung-lin (謝忠霖), chief executive of Juxin Tea Factory from Taichung's Lishan (梨山), on Dec. 2 attended the Teas of the World International Contest held at the Peruvian embassy in Paris. 

Hsieh was awarded a special prize for his Huagang Snow Source Tea by the nonprofit Agency for the Valorization of Agricultural Products (AVPA).

During the ceremony, two Chinese embassy staffers in attendance stood up and shouted: “Taiwan is just a province of China” and “Taiwan is part of China,” video of the event showed. 

The organizers ignored the disruption and continued the ceremony, while attendees booed the staffers and gave Hsieh a round of applause. 

During a post-event dinner, Hsieh said he learned that many people learned about Taiwan through its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

He said the people he talked at the event said that the more China acted in such a way, the more it would breed resentment, adding that they advised him not to pay any mind to the protest. 

Reflecting on the incident, Hsieh said that as long as Taiwanese do things well and to perfection — just as Taiwan contributed to the world during the pandemic — the world would see Taiwan. 

In Taipei, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hsiao Kuang-wei (蕭光偉) called on Chinese to abide by international norms of etiquette to avoid becoming a “laughingstock” of the global community. 

Beijing can only improve cross-strait relations by engaging in respectful and equal dialogue with Taiwan, and rationally viewing the reality of the situation, he added. 

Hsieh's tea factory originated in Nantou County's Songboling (松柏嶺) and has been passed down to him, the fifth generation. 

It flourished under his father, Hsieh Hsi-hung (謝錫宏), and boasts a century-long tea-making tradition, with plantations spread across Fushou Mountain (福壽山), Lishan and Dayuling (大禹嶺). 

AVPA is a non-governmental organization founded in 2005 that holds contests attracting more than 700 producers from around the world every year, its official Web site says. 

This year's competitors also included tea producers from the US, Japan and Sri Lanka.

Investors wade through busy economic week

- Reuters

Canada's main stock index dipped for the third successive session on Tuesday, as heavyweight energy stocks followed oil prices lower.

At 11:19 a.m. ET, the S&P/TSX Composite index was down 144.46 points, or 0.46 per cent, at 31,338.98, and was set for its lowest close in a week.

Canada's energy sector tumbled 3 per cent as oil prices sank below US$60 after prospects of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen.

Meanwhile, shares of cannabis firms Canopy Growth (WEED-T), Trulieve Cannabis (TRUL-CN) and Curaleaf Holdings (CURA-T) rose between 4.8 per cent and 9.3 per cent, extending their recent gains, after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he is considering an executive order to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.

U.S. stocks were lower on Tuesday after data showed jobs growth rebounded in November, but the unemployment rate stood at 4.6 per cent.

Canada's retail sales data for October is due later this week. The Bank of Canada held its key policy rate steady last week as widely expected, and Governor Tiff Macklem said the economy was proving resilient overall to the effect of U.S. trade measures.

Macklem is set to speak later in the day.

“It's just going to be a data-driven market for a little while,” said Ian Chong, portfolio manager at First Avenue Investment Counsel Inc.

After a strong year, doubts about valuation could prompt investors book profits, he said.

Wells Fargo global investment strategist Douglas Beath explains why it's completely reasonable to be worried about market concentration in AI-related stocks,

“1 .The world's largest company and Al bellwether has a market capitalization higher than the Energy, Materials, and Real Estate sectors combined (in addition to the Utilities sector as of this writing). The Magnificent 7 (Mag 7; a group of 7 stocks (Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia) weighting reached an all-time high of 36 per cent of the S&P 500 Index in November. As of November 30, the S&P 500 Information Technology sector accounts for 34 per cent of the S&P 500 Index market-cap weight — slightly higher than its share at the peak of the dot.com bubble in 2000. 

“2. Earnings concentration: The two dominant sectors related to the Al theme (Information Technology and Communication Services) have accounted for 27.4 per cent and 10.6 per cent of S&P 500 earnings to date this year through November 30. According to Ned Davis Research, they are projected to account for 21.3 per cent and 9.5 per cent in 2026, respectively. 

“3. Performance. Since ChatGPT was released on November 30,2022, the three-year total return through November 30,2025 for Al-related stocks has dominated that of the benchmark S&P 500 Index 

Mr. Beath is predicting a widening of market leadership. He notes that the S&P 500 equal weight index is closing in on an all-time high and the number of stocks above their 50 day moving average is steadily increasing. Only two of the Magnificent seven stocks outperformed the index year-to-date to Nov. 30.

Pfizer's (PFE-N) profits will fall short of Wall Street estimates next year, as it faces weaker sales of COVID products and squeezed margins stemming from its deal with the U.S. government to lower prescription drug costs.

The stock fell nearly 5 per cent in Tuesday trading. Pfizer shares have dropped more than 50 per cent since early 2023 as demand for COVID vaccines and treatments waned, leaving the company trailing peers in performance.

The drugmaker does not expect to return to growth until 2029, facing looming generic competition on several older medicines set to lose patent protection in coming years.

Its pipeline has not produced a game-changing drug since it helped to develop COVID vaccine Comirnaty and produced COVID treatment Paxlovid. The company is working to save more than US$7-billion annually through 2027 as it tries to control costs.

The drugmaker expects 2026 adjusted profit per share to be between US$2.80 and US$3, below analysts' average estimate of US$3.05 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Wall Street's main indexes were little changed in volatile trading on Tuesday as healthcare and energy stocks led losses, while investors assessed a jobs report that signaled a cooling labor market and kept hopes for future interest rate cuts alive.

A Labor Department report showed U.S. job growth rebounded in November after nonfarm payrolls declined in October because of government spending cuts.

But the unemployment rate was at 4.6 per cent in November as the labor market weakened against the backdrop of economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy.

The data offered clarity on the state of the labor market after a recent historic government shutdown deprived both investors and the Federal Reserve of official figures. Policymakers broadly acknowledged signs of a weakening jobs market when the central bank lowered rates last week.

“When the unemployment rate moves up like this, it does fuel the potential for continued rate cuts. But as we've seen in the past, this is not a consistent trend,” said Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management.

Investors raised expectations for rate cuts next year, according to data compiled by LSEG, and are now pricing in at least 58 basis points of reductions, higher than the 25 bps signaled by the central bank last week.

A separate survey showed U.S. business activity growth hit a six-month low in December.

Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, also one of Trump's top contenders for the Fed chair post, said the central bank's independence was important, amid concerns he might be too close to the president.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.66 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 48,406.44. The S&P 500 lost 1.97 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 6,814.54, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 33.47 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 23,090.89.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hovered near their three-week lows as persistent uncertainty over rate cuts and concerns about lofty tech valuations continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

North America's main indexes slipped at the open on Tuesday after data broadly signaled a cooling U.S. economy, paving the way for more monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.4 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 48,380.17 at the open. The S&P 500 fell 16.4 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 6,800.12​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 75.6 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 22,981.819.

At 9:31 a.m. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.3 per cent at 31,399.073 points.

On the inflation front, average earnings rose by a less-than-expected 0.1 per cent on a monthly basis, while a separate delayed report showed retail sales in October were unchanged.

- Reuters

U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in October, though consumer spending appears to have remained on a solid footing at the start of the fourth quarter despite the rising cost of living that is forcing some households to scale back.

The unchanged reading in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department's Census Bureau on Tuesday followed a downwardly revised 0.1-per-cent gain in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, edging up 0.1 per cent after a previously reported 0.2-per-cent rise in September.

The report, originally due in mid-November, was delayed by the 43-day shutdown of the government. Americans are facing higher prices for food, furniture and a range of other imported goods, the result of President Donald Trump's sweeping import duties. Healthcare and housing costs have also surged.

Economists say lower- and middle-income households have been disproportionately impacted by the soaring cost of living. Trump, who last year swept to election victory on promises to tame inflation, has in recent weeks alternated between dismissing affordability problems as a hoax, blaming former President Joe Biden, and promising his economic policies will benefit Americans next year.

U.S. stock index futures turned positive on Tuesday, as investors assessed a long-delayed jobs report and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

A Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased 64,000 in November, compared with an estimated 50,000 rise, according to economists polled by Reuters.

The unemployment rate stood at 4.6 per cent, compared with estimates of 4.4 per cent. Year-on-year average earnings came in at 3.5 per cent versus estimates of 3.6 per cent.

A separate reading from the Commerce Department also showed retail sales for October were flat, compared with an estimate of a 0.1 per cent increase.

At 8:31 a.m., Dow E-minis were up 70 points, or 0.14 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were up 8.5 points, or 0.12 per cent and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 32.25 points, or 0.13 per cent.

 U.S. job growth rebounded in November after nonfarm payrolls declined in October because of government spending cuts, but the unemployment rate was at 4.6 per cent as the labour market weakens against the backdrop of economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy.

The delayed employment report for November and a partial update for October published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday did not include the unemployment rate and other metrics for October after the 43-day shutdown of the government prevented the collection of data from households.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 64,000 jobs last month, the BLS said. The economy shed 105,000 jobs in October, reflecting the departure of more than 150,000 federal employees who took deferred buyouts as part of the Trump administration's push to shrink the government's footprint. Most of them dropped off government payrolls at the end of September.

Payrolls were not impacted by the furloughing of workers during the longest shutdown in history as they were retroactively paid when the government reopened.

The unemployment rate was at 4.4 per cent in September. The BLS made changes to weights for labor force estimates because no data was collected in October.

BMO chief economist Doug Porter highlighted climbing food costs,

“For the past two years, much of the affordability discussion in Canada has centred around the cost of housing. The good news on that front is that home prices continue to drift down nationally, market rents are easing, and of course interest rates have come down heavily since spring 2024. Housing affordability is not yet back to ‘normal', but it's moving into the same hemisphere. Accordingly, the shelter component of the CPI is calming quickly—it's almost all the way down to 2 per cent year-over-year, and looks to moderate further. Alas, the main villain of the inflation episode of 2021-23 has come roaring back onto the scene—food costs. Grocery inflation has been slowly building over the past year, after holding almost steady in 2024. But November saw a large monthly rise across many categories, and groceries are now up a meaty 4.7 per cent year-over-year. That's a big deal for monetary policy, as food prices are a key driver of inflation expectations”

BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett compiled the results of his monthly survey of global fund managers with his usual punchy writing style,

“Most bullish FMS [fund manager survey] of past 3½ years, macro optimism highest since Aug'21 on ‘run-it-hot' belief, allocation to stocks+commodities highest since Feb'22, cash level at record-low 3.3 per cent (down from 3.7 per cent); Dec FMS pushes BofA Bull & Bear Indicator up to 7.9, v close to ‘sell signal'; bullish positioning remains biggest headwind for risk assets. 

“On Macro & Policy: profit expectations (net 29 per cent) highest since Aug'21 as 57 per cent predict macro soft landing, 37 per cent say no landing and record-low 3 per cent say hard landing; liquidity conditions rated 3rd best of past 17 years as most investors since Apr'22 predict higher bond yields, 69 per cent of investors expect Kevin Hassett to be the next Fed Chairman.

“On Crowds & Risks: AI bubble (37 per cent) = biggest tail risk; most likely source of credit event = private credit (40 per cent) & hyperscaler capex (29 per cent); long Magnificent 7 (54 per cent) & long gold (29 per cent) = most crowded trades.

“On AA: investors most OW [overweight] stocks since Dec'24, most UW bonds since Oct'22.”

Citi strategist Adam Pickett compiled what he believes will be the 12 most important market themes in 2026,

“#1 AI Everywhere, All the time — We see the AI bubble likely building further in 2026. The big sector rotation happens after the bubble peaks, not before. While diversification is likely still helpful next year, tech should be part of the longs … 

#2 Sector rotation around reflation — It will not be only about AI in 2026. We think cyclicals can do well in a reflating economy, as shown by our regime work … 

#3 Election cycles into the midterms — Midterm election years are typically subpar for both bonds and equities. Downside in equity markets typically occurs in Q3 and is more likely when the incumbent party keeps control. 

#4 Global cyclical strength — We see long copper as a clean expression of global cyclical strength, and is an all-weather trade, somewhat independent of US growth developments.

#5: Fading central bank pricing — The average length between the last cut and first hike may be shorter than recent history suggests … 

#6 IEEPA and trade concerns – We await the IEEPA decision. The overhang of USMCA renegotiations will keep the BoC from moving quickly ... 

#7 ‘Tis the season for more spending —We think the European continent offers some opportunities on fiscal, monetary and political divergence, particularly in UK and France … 

#8 Trading a new Fed Chair — We see the new Fed Chair as a cap on hikes, rather than a turbo-dove base case, and are skeptical of Fed independence fears. We see the run-it-hot stance as an H2 risk to term premia and inflation expectations (both higher).

#9 FX – divergence and USD correlations — We see a year of three thirds for the USD: weaker Q1, stronger summer, weaker again Q4. USD correlations fall as we move into the ‘recovery' regime, so we sell USD correlations in dual digitals to leverage up our pro-cyclical view. 

#10 AI power demand crowding – Chinese aluminium production capacity is capped by policy tradeoffs on power usage and the environment. Power pricing more in-line with datacenter costs can add more than $1,000/t to aluminium production costs and will filter through to prices.

#11 Long Equity vs Credit – Equities and credit have become increasingly interconnected. The distribution of possible outcomes from the AI boom is likely to be skewed negatively for credit relative to equities. 

#12 Europe energy rotation – We see strong micro and macro fundamentals for European carbon credits next year, and risks of an imminent EU intervention may be overstated.""

National Bank Financial analyst Richard Tse sees “more risks” for Canada's technology sector heading into 2026 than a year ago, believing “uncertainty around AI's potential disruption ... won't abate until there's short-term proof one way or the other around the pace of potential disruptions.

“We think the opportunities at the time of writing will continue to be narrow and likely come from firm market leaders and inflection candidates — the latter being names with inflecting revenue growth and operating leverage, or earlier-cycle sensitivity to IT spending recoveries,"" he added.

Global fund managers are the most bullish in three and a half years this month, Bank of America's survey showed on Tuesday, as optimism over a “run-it-hot” macro backdrop and policy expectations drove allocations to risk assets.

Cash holdings tumbled to a record low of 3.3 per cent from 3.7 per cent in November, as exposure to equities and commodities hit the highest since February 2022, the bank said.

The survey's “Bull & Bear” indicator climbed to 7.9, close to a “sell signal”, suggesting that bullish investor positioning remains the biggest headwind for risk assets.

Profit expectations are at their strongest since August 2021, with 57 per cent of respondents predicting a soft landing for the global economy and just 3 per cent bracing for a hard landing, according to BofA.

AI bubbles topped the list of tail risks for the coming year. Private credit and hyperscaler spending were seen as the most likely sources of a credit event, which ranked fourth among tail risks.

203 participants with US$569-billion in assets under management responded to the global survey.

 European stocks fell in early trading on Tuesday, struggling to make gains as traders took a cautious position ahead of key U.S. jobs data, while the dollar stayed near its lowest in two months.

In a busy week for market data, investors were waiting for the October and November U.S. employment reports due later in the session, following delays to data collection during the U.S. government shutdown.

The data could influence expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy next year, after the Fed's commentary when it cut rates last week was interpreted as less hawkish than anticipated, strengthening expectations for more rate cuts in 2026. 

Stock markets fell during Asian trading, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropping to its lowest in three weeks. Growth in China's factory output stalled to a 15-month low in November, data showed. European indexes also opened lower, before edging slightly higher. 

At 4:56 a.m. ET, the STOXX 600 was down 0.1 per cent on the day , London's FTSE 100 was down 0.3 per cent and Germany's DAX was down 0.5 per cent. Progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks contributed to a fall in European defense stocks. Still, the pullback comes in the context of stock markets hitting record highs in 2025, with the STOXX 600 on track for a 14.8 per cent gain in 2025 overall.

The MSCI world equity index was down by 0.3 per cent on the day , and up 19.8 per cent on the year as a whole. 

Economists predict that the U.S. jobs data will show that federal government cost-cutting led to a decline in nonfarm payrolls in October, followed by a rebound in job growth in November.

“Either you get strong numbers, so the economy re-accelerates. Or you have not that good of a number and hence expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates even more,” said Kevin Thozet, a member of Carmignac's investment committee.

Investors are also watching out for U.S. inflation data on Thursday, although a number of key details will be missing, and central bank meetings including rate policy decisions from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan

Global markets were lower amid investor caution ahead of a slate of U.S. data, including the jobs report, that may help signal the path for Federal Reserve policy next year.

Wall Street futures were in negative territory after major North American markets closed in the red yesterday. Dow futures were down 0.17 per cent, S&P 500 futures declined 0.36 per cent and Nasdaq futures were 0.57 per cent lower as of 4 a.m. ET.

TSX futures followed sentiment lower after sagging oil prices weighed on Canada's main stock market yesterday.

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Lennar Corp.

“The most important question is whether the [jobs] report opens the door for more rate cuts in the early part of next year,” said analysts at Deutsche Bank.

“As it stands, the Fed have only signalled one further cut for 2026 in the dot plot, but we've repeatedly seen in this cycle how a softer labour market has pushed them back in a dovish direction.”

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.09 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.34 per cent, Germany's DAX gave back 0.42 per cent and France's CAC 40 inched up 0.04 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 1.56 per cent lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.54 per cent.

Oil prices fell on Tuesday, adding to the previous session's losses, as prospects for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen, raising expectations of a potential easing of sanctions.

Brent crude futures fell 89 US cents, or around 1.5 per cent, to US$59.67 a barrel at 4:42 a.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was trading at US$55.90 a barrel, down 92 US cents, or 1.6 per cent. Both contracts were near their lowest since May this year.

“Brent has dropped this morning to below $60 per barrel for the first time in months, as the market assesses a potential peace deal resulting in additional Russian volumes becoming available and oversupplying the market further,” said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah.

The U.S. offered to provide NATO-style security guarantees for Kyiv and European negotiators reported progress in talks on Monday to end Russia's war in Ukraine, sparking optimism that an end to the conflict was closer.

Russia, meanwhile, said it was not willing to make any territorial concessions in talks on ending the Ukraine war, state news agency TASS quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.

“The grind in talks will be matched with the continued grind lower in prices as we enter 2026 with all it associated predictions of ‘glut.' Brent will make a fresh year-to-date low, but will not break below $55 a barrel before the year is out,” said PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans. 

Adding to the pressure, soft Chinese economic data released on Monday further fueled concerns that global demand may not be strong enough to absorb recent supply growth, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore in a note.

China's factory output growth slowed to a 15-month low, official data showed. Retail sales also grew at their slowest pace since December 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic

Stocks closed lower on Monday as investors braced for a slew of U.S. economic data later this week while assessing reports on Federal Reserve candidates and commentary from policy makers for clues on the interest-rate outlook.

The non-farm payroll figures for October and November are due later this week, along with reports on retail sales, business activity and inflation. October's jobs data was delayed by the government shutdown earlier this quarter. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had logged their steepest daily declines in more than three weeks on Friday amid concerns about inflation and debt-fuelled AI investments.

Traders also assessed Monday a report that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett's candidacy for the Fed chair role received some pushback from people close to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Speculation has been rife over a possible frontrunner as Jerome Powell's term ends in May. Expectations for a dovish Fed chair have fuelled bets for interest rate cuts next year. Also on Monday, New York Fed President John Williams said the central bank's interest rate cut last week leaves it in a good position, while Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued that current inflation does not reflect the true supply-demand dynamics.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.49 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 48,416.56, the S&P 500 lost 10.90 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,816.51 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 137.76 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 23,057.41.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended down 43.95 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 31,843.44, slightly extending its pullback from a record closing high on Thursday.

Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Berlin for talks with Germany's Friedrich Merz and other European allies. European leaders proposed a multinational force to enforce a Ukraine peace deal. Follow DW for more.

This blog is now closed. Below is a roundup of the latest developments from Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, December 15.

A German-Ukrainian joint venture is set to establish Europe's first industrial-scale droneproduction line for Ukraine.

According to a statement by the two companies involved, Quantum Systems and Frontline Robotics, all drones produced in the factory will be delivered to Ukraine's military.

""The production line will combine Ukrainian battlefield-proven technology with German industrial automation,"" the statement reads, also calling it a ""major step"" towards a European drone base ""driven by Ukrainian frontline innovation and German engineering.""

The drone factory's location will not be disclosed for security reasons.

Ukraine is known to be a world leader in drone technologies due to its experience in the war with Russia.

US President Donald Trump said an agreement to end the war between Russia and Ukraine is ""closer now than we have ever been.""

Speaking after having ""very long and very good talks"" with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as several European leaders, Trump told reporters that Europe is providing ""tremendous support"" to achieving peace between the two countries.

According to Trump, European leaders want to ""get it ended,"" adding he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin several times.

European leaders have proposed a European-led multinational force, with US support, to help enforce a potential peace agreement in Ukraine.

In a joint statement issued after talks in Berlin, they said the force would form part of robust security guarantees designed to prevent Russia from violating any deal to end the war.

The statement was released as European leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the German capital.

They said any decisions on possible territorial concessions could only be taken by the people of Ukraine and only once strong security guarantees are in place.

According to the statement, the proposed force would be made up of contributions from willing nations.

Its tasks would include helping ""in securing Ukraine's skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine,"" according to the statement.

The leaders also agreed Ukraine's military should continue receiving extensive support and retain a peacetime strength of about 800,000 troops. They said peace would be upheld through a US-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism to identify violations and provide early warning of any future attack.

The leaders said the guarantees would be backed by both European countries and the United States.

Participating in talks on Monday evening along with Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz were British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The statement was signed by the leaders of Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, as well as the heads of the European Council and the European Commission.

Britain's new MI6 chief has said Russia is deliberately prolonging negotiations over Ukraine while shifting the cost of the war onto its own population.

Speaking on Monday, Blaise Metreweli said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is dragging out negotiations and shifting the cost of war onto his own population.""

She warned that Moscow was intensifying pressure below the threshold of open conflict.

""Russia is testing us in the grey zone with tactics that are just below the threshold of war,"" Metreweli said.

She pointed to what she described as efforts to ""bully, fearmonger and manipulate"" through cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, drones flying near European airports, aggressive activity at sea, and state-sponsored arson.

""Across the globe, we are now confronting not one single danger, but an interlocking web of security challenges — military, technological, social, ethical even — each shaping the other in complex ways,"" she said.

Metreweli said Russia had pushed the world into an era of instability. ""We are now operating in a space between peace and war,"" she said, adding that Russia had propelled the world into an ""age of uncertainty.""

She warned that Moscow's behavior was deliberate and likely to persist. ""The export of chaos is a feature, not a bug, in this Russian approach to international engagement, and we should be ready for this to continue until Putin is forced to change his calculus,"" she added.

In a separate address on Monday evening, the new head of Britain's armed forces warned that ""more"" Britons will need to be ready to fight for their country due to an increasingly dangerous world.

Richard Knighton, chief of the defence staff since September, called for ""national resilience"" in his speech at the Royal United Services Institute

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Kyiv and Washington remain divided over territorial issues after two days of talks in Berlin on ending Russia's war.

Speaking to reporters after the talks in Berlin, Zelenskyy said, ""There has been sufficient dialogue on the territory, and I think that, frankly speaking, we still have different positions, but I believe that my colleagues have heard my personal position.""

He said the issue of territory remains painful but added he believes the United States will help Ukraine find a compromise. Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ready for fair work toward a strong peace agreement and that talks with US counterparts will continue. 

Zelenskyy also said the United States is not making its own territorial demands on Ukraine. He said the US delegation had conveyed Russian demands and he stressed that Ukraine needs clear security guarantees before any decisions are made about front lines.

Earlier, Zelenskyy said negotiations with the US delegation would continue and repeated that while positions differ on territory, Ukraine remains committed to achieving a fair and lasting peace deal.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said diplomatic momentum on Ukraine has intensified, calling it possibly the strongest since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Speaking after talks in Berlin, Merz said there was now a real chance for a peace process, adding, ""This plant is still small, but the chance is real."" 

Merz thanked US President Donald Trump, saying the progress would not have been possible without his engagement.

He said he was satisfied with talks in Berlin between US and Ukrainian representatives on ending Russia's war.

At a joint news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Merz said any ceasefire must be backed by strong guarantees.

""This ceasefire must be secured by substantial legal and material security guarantees from the USA and the Europeans,"" he said.

Merz added that proposals presented by the United States in Berlin marked significant progress.

""What the USA has put on the table here in Berlin in terms of legal and material guarantees is really remarkable. That is a very important step forward, which I very much welcome,"" he said.

""Negotiators from President Trump played a key role, and I want to make this clear: without their tireless efforts and without President Trump's commitment, we would not have the positive momentum we are experiencing here at this very moment,"" Merz said.

Ukraine talks in Berlin have been really positive, with broad consensus emerging on a number of issues, a US official has told the Reuters news agency.

The official said discussions had produced agreement in several areas, while some issues had been delegated to working groups for further talks.

The official praised European participants, saying European representatives had been outstanding, and added that President Trump was pleased with the current state of negotiations.

The official said there was hope the process was on a path to peace.

Security guarantees have made significant progress, according to the official, including work on Article 5-like guarantees.

The official said these guarantees would not remain on the table indefinitely and added that Trump was focused on stopping Russian forces from moving west.

AP news agency reported, also citing the US side, that Russia indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the EU as part of a peace deal.

Ukraine's security service has carried out what it calls a unique special operation in the port of Novorossiysk, using underwater drones to strike a Russian submarine.

The SBU said in a statement on Telegram that underwater drones known as ""Sub Sea Baby"" hit a Project 636.3 submarine, known as the Varshavyanka class, or Kilo class in NATO terminology.

""For the first time in history, underwater drones 'Sub Sea Baby' blew up a Russian Project 636.3 Varshavyanka-class submarine,"" the SBU said.

""As a result of the explosion, the submarine sustained critical damage and has effectively been put out of action.""

The SBU said the submarine was carrying four Kalibr cruise missile launchers, which Russia has used to strike targets in Ukraine.

The latest round of talks between Ukrainian and US officials in Berlin has ended, Ukrainian media have reported.

The top Ukrainian negotiator with the United States has said two days of discussions in Berlin had been ""constructive and productive, with real progress achieved."" 

Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, in a post on X, also thanked US President Trump and praised the US team led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for "" working extremely constructively to help Ukraine find a way to a peace agreement that lasts.""

Germany will deepen its commitment to Ukraine's defense through joint ventures, market integration and possible investment guarantees under a 10-point plan unveiled on Monday during  Zelenskyy's visit to Berlin.

""A strong Ukrainian defense industry is crucial for defense against Russia's war of aggression and is an important element of security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression,"" said the document.

Both countries' defense ministries will hold regular, high-level consultations and will cooperate more closely on defense-related research, joint ventures and procurement, with Germany, Ukraine's largest supporter in Europe, looking into the use of federal investment guarantees, according to a statement.

Berlin and Kyiv would also take measures to prevent corruption, the document said, acknowledging concerns about Kyiv's biggest graft scandal of the war that prompted the resignation of two ministers and Zelenskyy's chief of staff.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier received Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while the Ukrainian leader is in Berlin for talks with US envoys and European leaders.

Steinmeier welcomed Zelensky at Bellevue Palace, where the two leaders embraced on the steps upon Zelensky's arrival. 

Police cordoned off the area around Bellevue Palace, the president's official residence, while snipers were positioned on the building's roof, and a helicopter circled overhead.

As the head of state, Steinmeier has mainly ceremonial duties while Chancellor Friedrich Merz is responsible for the day-to-day running of the country. Merz is scheduled to host Zelenskyy at an economic forum and talks with other European leaders later on Monday (see entry below for Zelenskyy's schedule in Berlin).

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy took part in talks with US special envoy Steve Wikoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in Berlin.  

There were no immediate public statements on the talks, which lasted roughly 90 minutes after a five-hour session on Sunday.

An official briefed on the discussions told the AFP news agency the US is continuing to push Ukraine to withdraw from the eastern Donbas region as a condition of peace talks with Russia. Zelenskyy has earlier made clear that such a step is a non-starter for Kyiv. 

""Putin wants territory,"" the official told AFP, adding that Ukraine was ""not agreeing"" to the demand.

""It's a bit striking that the Americans are taking the Russians' position on this issue,"" the official added.

The most recent uptick in international negotiations for an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine began when Witkoff presented a plan drafted with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev that was widely regarded as favorable to Russia.

That plan was later revised by Zelenskyy and European leaders and presented to the US.

Russia declared the anti-Kremlin feminist protest punk band Pussy Riot ""extremist"" — a label often used in Russia to outlaw critics of President Vladimir Putin. The label makes any interaction with the band, even posts on social media, illegal in Russia

A Moscow court upheld prosecution submissions ""to recognize the punk band Pussy Riot as an extremist organization and ban its activities on the territory of the Russian Federation.""

The ruling makes it easier for authorities to go after the band's supporters inside Russia or people who have worked with them in the past.

Pussy Riot's exiled members have repeatedly spoken out against the Russian war in Ukraine, and the band's songs and videos have been banned in Russia since 2012.

A court in September issued them jail sentences in absentia of up to 13 years after convicting them of telling lies about the Russian army. Pussy Riot gained international notoriety in 2012 after performing an anti-Putin protest in a church.

Leonid Solovyov, the band's lawyer, told the independent outlet SOTAvision that the ruling was ""another action that shuts up those who speak out of turn.""

Band members, long-time opponents of the Kremlin, were expecting the decision.

""The law is designed to erase Pussy Riot from the minds of Russian citizens"" they said on social media last week.

Founding member Nadya Tolokonnikova, who has recently been performing in the United States and whose arrest the Russian authorities are seeking even after having spent two years in jail for the church protest song, shrugged off the move to designate the group as extremist.

""Extremism is invading other countries and committing war crimes. Punks, artists, tricksters, blissful people — they are the voice of common sense in the country,"" she wrote on X late last month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why China's property crash must be kept top secret","https://www.dw.com/en/why-chinas-property-crash-must-be-kept-top-secret/a-75074157","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 06:16:09 GMT","

As home sales continue to plummet, Beijing has curbed independent reporting of real estate figures. The gag order masks a deepening property slump that continues to erode household wealth and strain China's banks.

The bigger the boom, the deeper and longer the bust. After two decades of runaway growth, by 2020, China's real estate bubble had pushed home prices to more than 17 times the average salaries.

A perfect storm drove the boom, including reforms in 1998 that shifted housing from state provision to private ownership, the migration of nearly half a billion Chinese from rural areas to cities and abundant credit from state banks.

A frenzy of construction transformed China's skyline, families poured savings into apartments and property speculation became the norm, helping millions of middle-class households to feel richer and spend more.

The turning point came during the country's first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns when President Xi Jinping's government imposed sweeping new rules on how much debt property developers could take on. The result of the ""three red lines"" reforms was brutal. Real estate giants like Evergrande, Country Garden and dozens of smaller firms defaulted, with more than 70 developers either going bust or needing state-backed bailouts to survive.

More than five years later, the subsequent bust shows no sign of easing. According to Barclays, a British bank, more than $18 trillion (€15.38 trillion) in household wealth has evaporated as home values collapse. Meanwhile, construction activity — once a key driver of gross domestic product (GDP) — has slumped so badly that it now drags overall growth below Beijing's targets.

In a sign of just how sensitive the downturn has become, Chinese officials last month told private data providers to stop publishing home sales figures, cutting off one of the few independent windows into the current woes in the real estate market.

The move followed a 42% year-on-year drop in new home sales by the top 100 builders in October, the largest monthly drop in 18 months, according to China Real Estate Information.

Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder and research director of the Taipei-based J Capital Research, thinks this move helps mask the true price decline.

""You likely have a market-wide drop of 50%, which could go down to 85% before it balances out,"" she told DW.

Giving an example of a colleague from the central city of Xi'an who was offered three homes for the price of one by a developer, Stevenson-Yang said it was the equivalent of a two-thirds drop on each property.

In Tier‑1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai, average home prices have slipped by about 10% from their peak, Oxford Economics wrote in September, with cooling demand for luxury units spurring even steeper markdowns. The worst effect is, however, felt in Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 cities, including Chengdu and Dongguan, where values plunged by up to 30%.

Across China, the crash has left half‑finished projects, ghost cities and millions of households trapped in negative equity, sparking public anger and sporadic protests as buyers hope that Beijing will step in with stimulus measures to shore up demand.

""There's still a lot of excess supply — up to 3-5 years of unsold apartments and housing, mostly in the smaller cities,"" George Magnus, research associate at the UK's University of Oxford China Center, told DW. ""It'll take a long time to clear, especially as the cohort of first-time buyers — 20-35 year olds — is now declining.""

Having climbed to 1.41 billion, China's population is now slipping backwards, marking the end of decades of growth.

Real estate once accounted for up to a quarter of China's GDP, helping growth remain in double digits for more than a decade during the 2000s and early 2010s. The slowdown has since dragged economic growth to around 5% last year — still impressive, but down sharply from the boom years due to the knock-on effects on the rest of the country.

“[Chinese] steel and cement prices and output are dropping, employment and [business] investment are weak — all of them collateral damage [from the property crash],"" Stevenson-Yang told DW.

China was the world's largest consumer of iron ore, copper, steel, and cement, much of it tied to construction. Exporters Australia, Brazil and Chile are among the global players suffering from the falloff in Chinese demand. As homeowners feel the pinch, the slowdown weakens household consumption, reducing imports of foreign luxury brands and autos.

Beijing is keen to avoid another speculative bubble, so stimulus measures to prop up the real estate market have not been as generous as in previous downturns. The Chinese government stepped in after the 2008 global financial crisis, the 2015 stock market crash and during the pandemic. 

Rather than coming to the rescue this time, many China watchers believe the government is allowing home prices to deflate gradually so that policymakers can prioritize stability and long‑term restructuring over short-term stimulus.

""You get to a point that you can't stimulate because the amount of money required would be too great — it would be inflationary,"" said Stevenson-Yang.

Bloomberg reported last month that Beijing is, however, considering subsidizing mortgage interest payments, lowering transaction fees and offering bigger income tax rebates for borrowers.

Property crashes typically take around five years to play out. In the United States, the housing bust that began in 2007 took until 2012 for prices to stabilize. In Spain, the post‑2008 collapse also dragged on for roughly five years before recovery signs appeared.

Japan's post-bubble collapse, from 1991 to the 2000s, is often cited as the most prolonged real estate crisis, with home values stagnating for more than a decade and never fully regaining their pre‑bubble highs.

Stevenson-Yang believes the Chinese property sector is on course for another ""10 years of negative or flat growth,"" while analysts at S&P Global Ratings believe the downturn could persist well into the late 2020s. Some forecasts hint at recovery next year or in 2027.

That's a hard pill for ordinary Chinese families to swallow. Many of them poured their savings into apartments that have lost value, leaving them stuck with mortgages they can't escape and homes they can't sell. Worse still, property values may remain far below the dizzying highs of 2020 for the foreseeable future.

The story is the same the world over, according to Magnus, where homeowners often assume that prices will continue to rise forever.

""When the party ends and the cycle goes into reverse … the consequences can be very serious,"" he told DW.

			Following president's legal action against the broadcaster, US news organisations offer lessons about whether to fight or fold

At best, the video editing is sloppy. At worst the cuts are a deliberate attempt to harm Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2024 election.

A legal complaint in a US court followed, in tandem with a demand for a massive payout to make matters right.

This scenario will be painfully familiar to the BBC but it actually played out months ago at CBS, its sister network in the US. The broadcaster eventually agreed to pay $16m (£12.1m) to make its Trump problem go away.

After Mr Trump filed a $10bn (£7.4bn) lawsuit against the corporation on Monday, the experience of American news organisations offers different lessons about whether to fight or fold.

Legal experts in the US say the president has no chance of winning a case against the BBC. But the corporation still has a huge political problem, as media organisations try to navigate a changed media landscape.

Mr Trump was more likely to win $10bn with a lottery ticket than in his legal action against the broadcaster, said Gregory Germain, professor at the Syracuse University College of Law.

He said the case would fail the test of whether or not the report was factually false.

“No, the facts were not false,” he said. “Editing video to change the order of quotes to make a point is what video editors do every day.”

But that is not the only issue. Nor does it mean that the BBC should not change, said Chris Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump confidant.

“The best defence is a good offence, get out in front of the story, admit the mistakes. Don't do what US media does by doubling down on their bias,” he said. “Create a real advisory group from all political sides to make sure reports are fair, balanced and accurate.”

The video at at the heart of the case is of Mr Trump's speech on Jan 6, shortly before his supporters stormed the Capitol in 2021.

The edited version shows him apparently urging a crowd to walk up to the Capitol and “fight like hell”.

In fact, it comprises two separate parts of the speech and omits his message to make their voices heard “peacefully”.

Last month, the BBC apologised to the president and retracted the Panorama report. But it said the editing was not defamatory and it would not pay compensation.

Mr Trump fired back a day later. “We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably sometime next week,” he told The Telegraph aboard Air Force One.

The Telegraph revealed that the BBC Newsnight programme also doctored footage of Mr Trump's speech.

The BBC has reportedly told the president's lawyers that he has no case, because the Panorama programme did not air in the US.

In response to his legal threat, the broadcaster argued that it did not have the rights to show it in the US and that American audiences were also unable to watch it online via iPlayer because it was “geo-blocked”.

The BBC has also claimed that Mr Trump did not suffer “overwhelming, reputational harm” as a result of the clip because he went on to win the 2024 presidential election, The Times reported.

The president's lawyers lodged the suit in Florida. The location is significant. It is where Hulk Hogan, the wrestler, sued Gawker after the website published an excerpt from a sex tape. Hogan won, bankrupting Gawker in the process.

Since then, it has been cited as an example of how Florida is an easier place to win defamation cases than elsewhere in the US, where freedom of speech considerations usually carry the day, particularly when public figures are involved.

Even so, most legal experts say Mr Trump would have a hard time demonstrating his reputation was damaged by a programme that was not widely disseminated in the US.

But lack of merit does not mean a case will not follow.

“Pardon me for laughing,” said Michael J Socolow, professor of communication and journalism at the University of Maine. “I don't mean to be dismissive, but there was no merit in the Stephanopoulos complaint, the CBS complaint …”

Last year, ABC News settled a defamation suit for $15m after George Stephanopoulos, its star anchor, falsely said the president had been found “liable for rape”.

The CBS News case is striking in its similarities to the BBC. It was accused of deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris, Mr Trump's 2024 election opponent.

One version of the interview removed chunks of what her critics called “word salad,” tidying up some of her rambling.

Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, eventually paid $16m to settle a lawsuit that many outside lawyers deemed “frivolous”.

Many of its own journalists were outraged, but the deal removed a different headache: A legal hurdle to the company's takeover by Skydance.

The new owners quickly installed a new head at CBS News. Bari Weiss, an iconoclastic critic of “woke” culture who had risen to prominence with the Free Press, signalled a pivot to less confrontational coverage of the president.

Within months it won an interview with Mr Trump for its 60 Minutes show – the very same programme accused of doctoring the words of Ms Harris to show her in a more flattering light.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal has pursued a more aggressive tack.

Its reporters are currently banned from travelling on Air Force One as it fights a $10bn action accusing it of a “deliberate smear campaign” for the way it reported the president's ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

A White House official recently told The Telegraph that the BBC's reporters could face similar sanctions.

Another calculation would be whether the BBC wants to spend licence fee-payers' money on what could still be a lengthy legal case.

Most civil cases in the US are settled before reaching court to avoid spending millions of dollars on lawyers' fees, and to avoid embarrassing internal communications being unearthed during “discovery”, a deeper dive than the handover of relevant documents called “disclosure” in the UK.

Recommended

It all means that the facts of the case are only a part of the dilemma facing the BBC, said Prof Socolow.

A lawsuit would put it in a no-win situation, he said.

“If they fight the Trump lawsuit, that validates the charge that it has a bias against the American president,” he said. “If they settle, like CBS and ABC, it hands cash from the British citizenry directly to an American president.”

It's less a legal problem, he added, than a political one.

“They need a very, very sophisticated political persuasion campaign much more than they need a sophisticated legal defence,” he said.

Officials said they were considering such a move last week, but the plan was widely condemned by health experts.

Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top official Marty Makary announced that the agency has opted not to put “black box” warnings on coronavirus vaccines, despite reports that FDA officials were considering such a move last week.

Black box warnings are considered the most serious designation from the FDA. Such warnings are placed on opioid medication, for example, to warn users about the risks of overusing the drug, including addiction, overdose, and death.

The news that the FDA was considering black box labels for COVID vaccines was widely condemned by medical experts as yet another attempt by the Trump administration to undermine public trust in the vaccine, which studies have consistently shown is safe and effective.

Following last week's report, FDA commissioner Marty Makary told Bloomberg News on Monday that the heads of the agency had determined that there isn't a need for the black box warnings after all. 

Among the agency leaders who decided that the designation isn't necessary is noted anti-vaxxer Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA.

However, the news comes as Prasad has pursued other avenues to sow distrust in the vaccine. A recently leaked FDA memo, authored by Prasad, announced that the agency would investigate whether there is a link between COVID vaccinations and deaths in the U.S. The memo sparked concerns from medical experts, who noted that many of Prasad's claims are not backed by evidence.

Prasad claimed, for instance, that COVID itself “was never highly lethal for children” and that its effects “are comparable” to other respiratory viruses — despite one study indicating that the virus was more lethal to children than the flu.

The memo also claimed that the agency has found “at least 10 children [who] have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination.” But an investigation from Inside Medicine discovered that Prasad's statement was made before a preliminary examination of deaths — and that the actual number of deaths from adverse reactions to the vaccine could be as high as seven or as low as zero.

Notably, a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report has demonstrated, like many others before it, that vaccines are both safe and beneficial for children. That report examined hundreds of children who had received dosages of COVID vaccines and compared outcomes with children who hadn't received them. Researchers found that “vaccine effectiveness…was an estimated 76 percent against COVID-19-associated emergency department or urgent care visits” among kids 9 months to 4 years old. The vaccines also had 56 percent effectiveness against such visits for kids 5-17 years old, versus those who did not receive a vaccine. 

The memo is just one of many anti-vaccination moves by agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the leadership of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The memo also comes as the U.S. is dealing with a resurgence of measles — which were deemed virtually eradicated in the U.S. just two decades ago — in large part due to Kennedy's disinformation campaign about vaccines.

Hundreds are currently quarantined in communities in northern parts of South Carolina, and an outbreak along the Utah-Arizona border has also led to quarantines in that area. In both places, low mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates have likely led to the outbreaks.

Spartanburg County, South Carolina, for example, has an MMR vaccine rate around 90 percent — 5 points below the 95 percent vaccine rate that health experts say is needed to protect against community-level outbreaks. Mohave County, Arizona, has a 79.4 percent rate of MMR vaccination, while Washington County, Utah, has a rate of 82.7 percent. 

As of December 9, there have been 1,912 measles cases confirmed across the U.S., a 570 percent increase from the total number of cases counted in 2024.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different.

A US military attack “would bring more chaos, more poverty,” one Caracas resident said. 

Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

President Donald Trump has escalated threats against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks, and reports now say the Trump administration is preparing for the days after a potential Maduro overthrow.

What might happen in such a scenario? In November, Michael Crowley at The New York Times pursued this question by reminding readers that, during Trump's first term, U.S. officials were asked to run a war game to examine what Venezuela in a post-Maduro era would look like. According to Douglas Farah, a national security consultant who specializes in Latin America, the war game showed that the overthrow of Maduro would yield “chaos for a sustained period of time with no possibility of ending it.” Crowley, at his end, adds that the results of the exercise note that “chaos and violence were likely to erupt within Venezuela, as military units, rival political factions and even jungle-based guerrilla groups jockeyed for control of the oil-rich country.”

Currently, no such chaos has erupted in Venezuela despite at least 95 people having been killed by the United States military in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific as of December 16. Although the White House has repeatedly alleged that those targeted have been involved in smuggling narcotics into the U.S. mainland, the Trump administration has yet to produce any evidence to support its claims.

At least 95 people have been killed by the United States military in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.

At the end of November, Trump took to social media, stating: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.” And on December 10, Trump told journalists that the U.S. had recently “seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually.” The Venezuelan government condemned the seizure as “blatant theft and an act of international piracy.”

With the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier group in the Caribbean Sea in November, and media reports indicating that there are now 15,000 U.S. troops in the region and approximately 5,000 personnel at bases in Puerto Rico, there are two likely outcomes: Trump is either bluffing to see if the Venezuelan military will carry out a coup against Maduro, or worse, is actually planning for the U.S. to attack Venezuela militarily. Meanwhile, a recent poll conducted by CBS News concluded that 70 percent of people in the United States are opposed to the Trump administration taking military action against Venezuela.

Inside Venezuela, the people Truthout spoke to for this article said that, while they are certainly following the crisis, most people are continuing with their daily lives. According to Fanny Chacón Sánchez, a 39-year-old mother of two who works for a government bank, “the way [the] international media portray things on social networks looks like a completely different reality.” Chacón notes that although the U.S. Navy's actions are on people's minds, this is “just another chapter of the illegal blockade we already know” that “suffocate[s] us” — a reference to the U.S. economic sanctions on Venezuela which commenced in 2005.

Living in a state-built apartment, which she is paying off at affordable rates though the government's massive housing program known as Gran Misión Vivienda Venezuela (Great Mission Housing Venezuela), Chacón used to live in New Horizon, which is part of Catia, one of Venezuela's largest, poorest and most densely populated areas. A supporter of the Maduro government, Chacón says on the streets of Caracas:

People are focused on their own stuff: working, making ends meet, and now, even more so, getting Christmas ready for the kids. Making sure there are Christmas bonuses and the Nativity scene. Life continues on its “normal” course, as much as this harsh reality allows. It's not that we ignore everything else; it's that we've been resisting for years and we're not going to stop now.

Anais Márques, a communal leader at the 5 de Marzo Commune in Caracas, a grassroots community organization in El Valle neighbourhood that comprises around 2,270 working class families, shared a similar perspective with Truthout. With life continuing largely as normal, Márques notes the recent November election in which more than 5,300 community circuits (communes) voted to pick which community proposed projects will obtain state funding. According to Márques, the election saw “civic participation” as “several communal councils renewed their spokespersons through secret ballots.”

In Márques's opinion, “both Chávez and now Maduro have always had the support and backing of an organized, mobilized people,” which “is why they still haven't defeated us.” Believing that Maduro will resolve the crisis, Márques highlights the civic-military union that exists between the government and the armed forces, stating: “We have a people and we have soldiers, and the soldiers have the people.”

Although mainstream reporting in favor of overthrowing Maduro often (and rather conveniently) ignores this fact, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's political movement was originally born in the barracks when he was a soldier in the 1980s. Chávez's came to power through an election in 1999, then suffered a short-lived U.S.-backed coup d'etat in 2002 headed by the upper echelons of the armed forces. Subsequently Chávez proceeded to purge the army and cement his doctrine of Latin American-style socialism. From 2007, Venezuela's armed forces adopted the slogan: “Patria, socialismo o muerte! Venceremos!” (“Fatherland, socialism or death! We will prevail!”)

With a different perspective from those of Chacón and Márques, Antonio Gonzalez Plessmann, a human rights activist in Caracas and militant leftist since the 1980s, no longer supports Maduro. Plessmann thinks Venezuelans' main anxiety remains “economic precariousness” and says household incomes for an average family of four cannot cover the cost of food and basic necessities. As a result, Plessmann told Truthout, many people have “several jobs to make ends meet,” a situation that is not uncommon throughout many Latin American countries. 

“Madurismo is a mutation of Chavismo, which separates from the strategic postulates of the Bolivarian Revolution: popular participation, democratic radicalism, and anti-capitalist orientation,” Plessmann says. Former President Chávez, in his view, “was hated by Fedecámaras [the main business association] and loved by the poor” while Maduro is “loved by Fedecámaras” and “despised by the majority of the popular sectors, many of whom were once Chavistas.” While Washington has attempted “regime change” on several occasions against Venezuela's head of state, Plessmann says, Maduro now finds himself “at one of his weakest moments: He lacks popular support and real backing from much of Latin America.”

According to one survey in September, 65 percent of Venezuelans rated Maduro's management of the country positively, 28 percent said they had a negative opinion, while 7 percent answered with either don't know or no answer.

“Democracy Now! co-host Juan González asserted in a recent interview with Jyotishman Mudiar, host of the “India & Global Left” podcast, that if the United States attacks Venezuela militarily, the conflict will broaden throughout Latin America. Observing that Maduro has already “put out a call for international volunteers to come to Venezuela to support the Bolivarian Revolution,” González argued that Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Colombians “will be a part of that resistance.” Elaborating on his comments on Colombia, González stated that, up until recently, the country had the “single largest and most extensive revolutionary movement in the history of Latin America,” as was the case with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia that demobilized in 2016 after reaching a peace agreement with the government.

Colombia's second-largest guerrilla movement, the Army of National Liberation (ELN) has yet to reach an agreement with the administration of Gustavo Petro, who presides over a broad-left coalition. According to a report from the International Crisis Group, whose analysis is often in line with U.S. political establishment, the ELN “has repeatedly stated its commitment to defend the Maduro government, and has promised to turn its fire on any foreign forces that intervene in the region; its expertise includes use of improvised explosives and, more recently, armed drones.”

While there is no hard evidence of complicity between the Maduro administration at the highest levels and the ELN, the current government in Caracas and the guerrillas are, broadly speaking, both influenced by liberation theology, the Cuban Revolution, and the 18th-century independence fighter Simón Bolívar's calls for regional unification among Latin American countries. According to the Washington Office on Latin America, the ELN in April this year numbered over 6,000 active guerrillas, while a local report in Colombia claims about 20 percent of the rebels operate in the region of Catatumbo, on the northern border with Venezuela.

González also noted that China has become an important factor in Washington's calculations and aggression toward Venezuela, given that it has become the main purchaser of the country's oil. “At one point, something like 70 percent of Venezuela's oil was going to China,” says González, with that figure now down to “about 45 percent” However, it still remains the largest buyer of the South American country's oil. As with the case of Panama, where the government ended the Central American country's participation in China's Belt and Road Initiative after Trump issued a series of threats ranging from increasing trade tariffs to an outright military invasion to take back the Panama Canal, Trump's advisers cannot be looking at Beijing's growing economic presence in Latin America kindly. 

Miguel Tinker Salas, a professor of Latin American history at Pomona College in Claremont, California, told Truthout that the massive military deployment off the coast of Venezuela, the exuberant negative press campaign against the Maduro administration, and the crushing economic sanctions all look to “expose fissures within the Venezuelan military and the political apparatus of the governing party.” He adds that despite this pressure, “the concerted campaign fissures have not materialized” as the majority of “Venezuelans are firmly opposed to a U.S. intervention.” From Tinker's perspective, the majority of Venezuelans reject violence as a tactic to obtain political change.

At Washington's end, Tinker says Trump's new approach “involves efforts to isolate China, which has gained an important foothold in the past 20 years” while “investing close to a billion dollars to produce oil in Lake Maracaibo,” — a region located in the northwest of Venezuela in the state of Zulia, which accounts for most of the country's oil production. Tinker told Truthout he thinks U.S. military forces are aiming for an extended stay in the Caribbean as part of a “Western Hemisphere Strategy.”

Any administration imposed through force will face a “crisis of legitimacy, especially if they begin to implement neoliberal economic policies as they have proposed.”

The problem, he says, is that “U.S.-led efforts at regime change have been disastrous” and any administration imposed through force will face a “crisis of legitimacy, especially if they begin to implement neoliberal economic policies as they have proposed.” He adds that while “important segments of the population may be critical of Maduro,” these Venezuelans “will not stand idly by and allow their rights to be subverted.”

Steve Ellner is a retired professor of economic history and political science from the Universidad de Oriente in Venezuela, where he lived for over 40 years. As things currently stand in the crisis, “the most likely scenario is an extended siege,” because “the other options at this point are too risky for Washington,” Ellner told Truthout. Elaborating on this point, he added:

Venezuela has advanced weapons systems from Russia and training which Washington claims comes from the Wagner mercenaries. It doesn't matter who does the training; from Caracas's viewpoint the training is absolutely justifiable, given the intensity and prolonged nature of the threat. From a political viewpoint it's unlikely that Trump would just pull out, since he would face intense criticism and a loss of MAGA support given everything that has been done up until now.

Back in Caracas, according to Ellner, “many non-Chavistas and anti-Chavistas are enrolling in the militia.” Asked about an article published in The New York Times in October that claimed that secret negotiations around Venezuela's resources were taking place in order to avoid a military conflict, Ellner said the chance they succeed should not be dismissed entirely. “Maduro,” claimed Ellner, “is willing to make concessions … which would allow Trump to spin a narrative that the U.S. got what it wants.” Such concessions might include handing over individuals accused of being involved in the drug trade as well as “concessions regarding Venezuela's oil reserves.”

Márques, like all the Venezuelans Truthout spoke to, is hopeful the crisis will be resolved. “It has taken so much effort to achieve our independence, and we cannot believe that a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela would bring stability,” she said. “Without a doubt,” she added, a U.S. military attack “would bring more chaos, more poverty — especially for the working class.”

Aging doesn't happen in a straight line. One moment, you feel strong and energetic; the next, fatigue, stress, or hormonal shifts seem to age you overnight. But what if aging follows predictable milestones—and you could adjust your habits at each stage to stay younger, sharper, and more resilient?

Dr. Tsung-Han Chou, an attending physician at Taiwan's Mingtang Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, said that wellness is never one-size-fits-all. In an episode of “Health 1+1” on NTD, a sister outlet of The Epoch Times, he explained that each decade of life brings unique biological and emotional challenges—and requires its own strategy for preserving vitality.

Chou identifies two major turning points in the aging process: “The first comes after having children, and the second is menopause.”

For both men and women, the years following parenthood demand extra support to maintain energy and hormonal balance. Later, menopause—driven by dramatic hormonal shifts—ushers in the next major stage of aging.

In traditional Chinese medicine, the spleen and stomach represent the body's digestive and metabolic strength—the ability to convert food into energy. A strong digestive system buffers against stress, supports immunity, and helps maintain stable energy throughout demanding work years.

 A Response to “Europe's Bad Nuclear Options”

  Jan/Feb 2026 

To the Editor:

In their article “Europe's Bad Nuclear Options” (July/August 2025), Florence Gaub and Stefan Mair argue that the U.S. nuclear umbrella “for decades has shielded the continent from outside threats.” The underlying assumption is that having a nuclear umbrella is desirable and that nuclear deterrence theory is valid.

But nuclear weapons have not prevented conflict between nuclear states, as fighting between India and Pakistan has shown, and there are many possible explanations other than deterrence for the absence of nuclear war among such states, including luck. If one sets aside the faulty assumption that nuclear deterrence will hold, then increasing Europe's reliance on nuclear weapons—or even just maintaining it—becomes an untenable proposition.

Instead, more European governments should join the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which bans all nuclear weapons activities. Austria, Ireland, and Malta have already joined the TPNW, which has 96 other signatories, and local governments in Berlin, Paris, and Rome have passed resolutions calling on their governments to do the same. In polling conducted by YouGov in April 2025, majorities in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden opposed their countries' developing their own nuclear arsenals, and even higher percentages opposed American nuclear weapons being stationed in their country. As long as nuclear weapons exist, so does the risk of their use. Europe's only good nuclear option is joining the TPNW.

 A Response to “The Real China Model”

  Jan/Feb 2026 

To the Editor:

Dan Wang and Arthur Kroeber (“The Real China Model,” September/October 2025) convincingly detail the impressive industrial capacity China has built over the past few decades. But their analysis focuses on the results of China's successful development while overlooking the political economy that made it possible: an authoritarian state based on unequal citizenship for migrants and the systematic extraction of surplus value created by workers. The “process knowledge” that Wang and Kroeber show China has relied on to grow and innovate wasn't free. It came at an enormous social cost.

The authors' prescription for how the United States can compete with China—that Washington should think in the same ways Beijing has—rests on a dangerous fallacy. The United States cannot replicate the outcomes of China's development model without adopting its political system. China's success is inseparable from the coercive power of its party-state. Emulating its strategy would require suppressing consumption, extending massive subsidies to businesses, accepting wasteful investments, and allowing the state to dictate how capital is used. The authors' proposed reforms, such as expediting permitting, ignore how procedural safeguards can be essential tools to hold the state accountable and protect individual rights.

An effective strategy to establish an industrial ecosystem that works for the United States should leverage its foundational strengths: an open society, market competition, and universal citizenship. Rather than selectively copying China, U.S. policymakers should build on the American innovation ethos, its deep capital markets, and the manufacturing capacity of its allies. This approach is more likely to succeed because it aligns with core U.S. values of freedom, private property, and democracy.

 What Really Threatens Authoritarians?

 Stephen Kotkin

  Jan/Feb 2026 

Not long ago in the sweep of history, countries that had once been buried behind the Iron Curtain, and even some Soviet republics, were transformed into members of the solidly democratic club. Some of those that weren't, such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan, experienced mass revolts against rigged elections and corrupt misrule amid widespread public yearning to join the West. Free trade was again celebrated as an instrument of peace; Kant's “democratic peace theory” enjoyed a revival.

Western democracy promotion, inept as it could be, struck fear into authoritarian corridors of power. Ever-shriller authoritarian denunciations of supposed Western conspiracies to foment “color revolutions” seemed to confirm a direction toward democracy. In the early 2010s, spontaneous uprisings rocked the heavily autocratic Middle East and North Africa. Hopes for political loosening persisted in the stubborn holdouts of China, Iran, and Russia. Large-scale demonstrations had broken out in Iran in 2009 and, in 2011–12, similar protests accompanied Vladimir Putin's announcement that he would return to the Russian presidency after a brief stint as prime minister. Many clung to what they considered signs that Xi Jinping, who rose to become China's top leader in 2012, would be a reformer.

In the blink of an eye, however, the authoritarians flipped the dynamic, driving the democracies onto the back foot, where they remain. Arab autocrats, Iran's mullahs, and Putin cracked down viciously. In China, Xi elevated himself to something akin to emperor, driving an even more resolute version of authoritarianism. In well-established democracies, meanwhile, fear spread about the decay of liberal institutions and norms.

The authoritarians relied on an innovative set of tactics to suppress democratic influence from abroad or from within their societies: branding organizations that receive overseas funding as “foreign agents” (essentially, traitors) and using tax inspections to disqualify opposition candidates from running for office. These techniques were combined with the tried-and-true practice of dominating the media. And then, the coup de grâce: continuing to decry nonexistent Western plots to take them down, the authoritarians—thanks to technological innovations produced by free societies—developed new ways to meddle forcefully in democratic polities and sometimes even destabilize them. Now, the authoritarians watch as freely elected democratic leaders praise and emulate them.

And yet: beware those who once hailed “the age of democracy” and now proclaim “the age of autocracy.” Formidable as these regimes appear—and, in fact, can be—they are shot through with weaknesses. They can mobilize vast resources and personnel in pursuit of ambitious national projects but suffer debilitating incapacity stemming from corruption, cronyism, and overreach. They last far longer than generally anticipated but all the while remain prone to sudden runs on their political banks. With the right strategies, they can be jolted off balance. Democracies, despite a growing loss of confidence bordering on despair, retain innumerable strengths and deep resilience, and can get back on the front foot.

What is authoritarianism? And what—and who—is an authoritarian? Given how important this phenomenon has always been and the prominence it has recently reacquired, it might seem surprising how difficult it can be to answer those questions. At the most basic level, authoritarianism involves weak or near-absent institutional limits on executive power. Initially, authoritarians unabashedly ruled in the name of the few, but ever since the French Revolution, nondemocratic regimes have taken on the trappings of democracy: staged elections, rubber-stamp legislatures, constitutions granting nominal rights. “Modern authoritarianism,” as the political scientist Amos Perlmutter defined it, is the rule of the few in the name of the many.

Perlmutter, writing in 1981, singled out “authoritarianism/totalitarianism” as “this century's most remarkable political phenomenon.” But the slash separating (or combining) the two terms concealed a challenge: namely, explaining the difference between them. As it happens, the sociologist Juan Linz had already taken this up, and his experience offers a cautionary tale. Born in 1926 in Weimar Germany, where hyperinflation bankrupted his father's business, the young Linz witnessed the breakdown of democracy and the onset of Hitler's dictatorship. Linz and his Spanish mother relocated to Spain in 1932, where Linz lived through the 1936 military putsch and the civil war that it provoked. During Franco's dictatorship, he graduated from the University of Madrid. In 1950, he crossed the Atlantic to pursue a Ph.D. at Columbia University, where he soon began to teach. He later shifted to Yale and, in the decades that followed, became one of the world's foremost experts on regime types and democratic stability.

When Linz entered the profession, the world was seen as divided between two basic regime types: democratic and totalitarian. Where, he wondered, should one place Franco's Spain? It was patently not democratic, but also not totalitarian like Nazi Germany or the Stalinist Soviet Union. The classic schema advanced by the likes of Hannah Arendt, as well as Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, had no room for Iberia. In 1963, Linz presented a long paper titled “An Authoritarian Regime: Spain.” Despite its banal title, it constituted a breakthrough in explicating a third type. Linz offered a mostly negative definition: unlike totalitarianism, authoritarianism didn't have a concentrated single source of power or a pervasive ideology, and it could muster only minimal mass mobilization. The major attribute authoritarian regimes possessed, rather than lacked, Linz suggested, was limited pluralism. The distinction remained uncertain, and for all his achievements, Linz never nailed it down. He tried “Sultanistic regimes,” which fell flat, and by 2000 had come up with “chaocracy” (the rule of chaos and mobs). All the while, a consensus built around the too-broad rubric of “hybrid regimes.”

Typologies can sometimes help one grasp how such regimes sustain themselves or implode or are overthrown. For example, scholars have shown that authoritarian regimes that rely on hereditary succession tend to be more stable. But such insights do not translate into policy action. For that purpose, it is better to identify not types but constituent parts—what can be thought of as the five dimensions of authoritarianism—and their susceptibility to countermeasures. Admittedly, a policy-oriented framework will not satisfy those who prefer strict definitions and typologies. Nonetheless, it could serve as a foundation from which to push today's authoritarian regimes onto the back foot.

The first dimension is obvious: no authoritarian regime could survive without security police and military forces capable of domestic repression. Compared with their social spending or economic investment, authoritarian regimes extravagantly overcommit funds to the agencies, equipment, and training they need for massive repression. They expend staggering resources on surveillance and censorship of the Internet, social media, and related technologies and services, often alongside paid and voluntary human monitoring of neighborhoods and workplaces. Coercive apparatuses vary widely among authoritarian countries, which inherit legacy structures from previous regimes or previous incarnations of their own regimes. Think of the Iranian shah's secret police, the SAVAK, which the revolutionaries angrily dissolved in 1979 only to carry over many of its practices, prisons, and even personnel into a new organization, SAVAMA.

Authoritarian regimes relentlessly reorganize their repressive apparatuses, but rarely to streamline their functions. On the contrary, they deliberately assign agencies and operatives to overlapping jurisdictions, ensuring that they are, to an extent, at daggers drawn. Sometimes such agencies engage in sabotage against one another, as officials regard going on the offensive as the best defense against colleagues poised to go after them. In communist China, the jockeying for supremacy between the security police and the People's Liberation Army has at times been decisive in power struggles. In Russia, the civilian repressive apparatus persecutes the military, which leaps at every chance for revenge. Meanwhile, anticorruption bodies—always more than one—are feared by all, including one another.

Professionals in repression, whether fingernail pullers or computer hackers (sometimes one and the same), have the means to take down not just their rivals but also their superiors and even their country's ruler. They at once ensure regime survival and pose the greatest threat to it. That is why, for example, presidential bodyguards are almost never integrated into the main repressive apparatus. In Russia under Putin, just as it was under Stalin, the bodyguard directorate (today known as the FSO) stands alone, separate from the main successors to the KGB (the FSB and SVR), the multiple counterintelligence units, and the also self-standing National Guard. Paranoia rules.



Cronies and mediocrities might run the critical security police or armed forces, a circumstance observed in Putin's war against Ukraine, which was planned and overseen until May 2024 by a former construction foreman with whom the dictator had spent some bare-chested time in the Siberian wilderness. But it would be a mistake to underestimate the repressive muscle or the capacity for learning and correction of these mechanisms and militaries. They monitor, disappear, imprison, and butcher. They are highly fractious, however, roiling with jealousies, resentments, and enmities, which rulers aggravate to exercise control. Intelligence agencies in the United States and other Western countries closely follow these cleavages, of course, and can sometimes recruit the disaffected or the ambitious to provide insider information.

These regimes take great pains to cultivate façades of unity and approval, which makes them vulnerable when disunity and disapproval are exposed. Many officials in authoritarian regimes chafe at the conflation of the ruler's interests with the country's, at cronies hoarding all the spoils, and at the concealed national debilitation that ensues. Washington and its allies should systematically call out these divisions, as well as the deep resentments felt within regimes over malfeasance and corruption, aiming to drive wedges between the elites and the ruler. Of course, naming specific disaffected individuals could cause their imprisonment or execution. Carelessness could backfire. Still, discontent, thwarted ambition, and offended patriotism are no secret, and available to exploit. When such regimes figuratively or literally push their officials out of windows—as they do without any Western pressure—democracies need to emphasize how such barbarism reveals weakness, how it constitutes a tacit admission that dissatisfaction suffuses officialdom, and how the regimes fear its spread. “Outwardly strong, inwardly brittle,” an internal Chinese critique, should be the name of a relentless public campaign that forces the Chinese regime to continually deny it.

The second dimension of an authoritarian regime is the nature of its revenue streams. All governments require sources of funding, of course, and most get them through a wide array of taxes. Taxes render governments dependent on their people, and although authoritarian regimes do not mind obtaining revenues that way, they are loath to depend on the consent of the people if they can get away without doing so—and many can. They have alternative sources of revenue, often gushing right out of the ground.

Among the most stubborn misconceptions about authoritarian regimes is the idea that they rest on a de facto social contract, whereby the regimes raise living standards and in exchange the people surrender their freedom. Obviously, if an authoritarian regime fails to raise living standards, its ruling circle does not admit its failure to fulfill its side of the contract and leave power. Nor can the people force its exit by taking the rulers to court for failure to comply. Authoritarians are happy to have GDP growth, but they do not require it, and they feel no imperative to satisfy the material aspirations of ordinary people. Unfree people can sometimes be more easily pacified if their incomes are rising and opportunities for their children are expanding. But in China, the authoritarian country where such a contract is most frequently alleged to exist, those conditions have never held for large segments of society. The Chinese people understand the true contract under which they live: if they keep disappointments and doubts largely to themselves and publicly profess loyalty, then the authorities might not come after them.

Authoritarian regimes can survive with little or no economic growth, thanks to those wielding truncheons, but not without cash flow—and the best source of that comes from material that nature deposited into the earth hundreds of millions of years ago, which can be sold on world markets for hard currency. Beyond mother lodes of oil or natural gas, ready cash can also be generated with diamond or gold mines, precious metals, and rare minerals. All it takes is some extraction equipment, labor (often forced), railroads, and ports. But these regimes also find new ways to generate cash flow. North Korea once counterfeited U.S. $100 bills at scale. Then it innovated, discovering that it could hack its way into foreign central bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchanges. The regime also rakes in cash, especially in foreign currencies, the old-fashioned way: by dispatching soldiers and laborers abroad for a fee.



In the case of Putin's Russia, oil and gas exports help fund the regime—so much so that such revenues have covered as much as a quarter of the costs of the war against Ukraine. China, India, and Turkey have together purchased close to $400 billion in Russian oil since 2023, sometimes to consume it, sometimes to resell it at a markup. Moscow has innovated, too, assembling a shadow fleet of decrepit tankers as well as a coterie of sketchy insurers and shell companies (a time-honored Western invention) to evade a U.S.-devised price cap.

But the need for cash also creates vulnerabilities. Oil becomes money only when it traverses seas or crosses international land borders and is then refined and shipped to consumers. Washington and its partners could sanction oil refineries in China, India, and Turkey, raising those countries' costs and lowering Russia's revenues while helping coordinate alternative sources. A new EU draft proposal would allow member states to board and detain shadow-fleet tankers, which are already under sanctions. As for pipelines, cyber-capabilities can cause repeated temporary disruptions, reducing Russia's revenues.

At first glance, China might look like an exception to the idea that Western countries can exploit an authoritarian regime's need for cash. China consumes most of its own natural resources, and is the world's largest importer of raw materials. It also collects taxes, including a value-added tax that is its biggest source of income. But its other big source is what it earns from finished-product exports, which account for roughly 20 percent of China's GDP and on which corporations pay taxes. Retaliatory tariffs and other trade restrictions could thus choke off much of the regime's cash flow if they are executed by a broad coalition of cooperating countries, which would need to invest substantially in their own reindustrialization and in alternative supply chains—which they should be doing, anyway.

The third dimension of authoritarianism is the stories a regime tells about itself, its people, its history, and its place in the world. Authoritarians always try to suppress the stories they do not want their people to see. But they understand that even effective suppression is insufficient on its own; they also need to propagate visions of the nation and the world that resonate with ordinary people. These stories vary across regimes, but elements recur. They aim to spread fear to bolster national cohesion, featuring the collusion of internal and external enemies: ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities, labeled as terrorists; elites, intellectuals, democrats (usually but not always in scare quotes); the International Monetary Fund, Jews, George Soros, foreigners; the Great Satan (the United States), the Little Satan (Israel). Authoritarian narratives also evoke a period of national greatness in the past that was undone by hostile forces but will be restored as soon as today's enemies are vanquished by the nation's sole savior: the regime and current ruler.

Anti-Westernism is the core trope of today's authoritarian regimes, and they can frequently draw on Western sources for material. Some of the greatest hits: NATO attacked Russia, the West encourages coups and installs puppet governments, the West is striving to maintain hegemony over the world majority. And then there is the simplest and most effective of all the authoritarian stories: “The East is rising, the West is declining.”

People living under these regimes, however, do not accept regime narratives at face value. Plausible enemies, saboteurs, and spies must occasionally be paraded before them, and plausible tales of U.S. hostility toward China or Russia (preferably straight from the mouths of Americans themselves) must be cited alongside implausible ones. Regime stories must speak to ordinary people, to their sense of violated fairness, their struggles and aspirations. Not everything in these narratives will comport with their experiences, but many people will excuse discrepancies as long as some of it does. The Chinese nation and the Russian nation were, in fact, great imperial civilizations, and few inhabitants of those places dispute that they deserve to be great again.

The centrality of narrative in the operation, legitimacy, and survival of authoritarian regimes makes them vulnerable. They are especially exposed where they are most active: in wielding history. China drills home stories of what it calls its “century of humiliation” beginning in the 1800s, and these resonate with large numbers of Chinese people. But there are also compelling stories about the more than half century of self-humiliation under Chinese Communist Party rule: the CCP has killed far more Chinese people than foreign interventions ever did. Similarly, the CCP takes credit for China's economic miracle, but the boom resulted primarily from the diligence and ingenuity of the Chinese people; party officials have often been parasitic on the country's economic success, expropriating businesses once they have become successful. The party casts itself as the great defender of Chinese civilization and Confucianism. But the CCP continues to be the desecrator of philosophical and religious traditions as well as innumerable monuments, and the persecutor of monks, writers, artists.

To tell those stories, democracies would have to invest more in penetrative communications and persuasive content. The glory days of the Voices, as American and European radio stations broadcasting into the Soviet Union were known, were gone even before the Trump administration eliminated their funding earlier this year. It has become difficult to maintain virtual private networks (VPNs) that allow people to evade Internet restrictions in countries such as China; then again, Washington has barely tried. The CCP, meanwhile, controls the algorithm on the app TikTok, which serves as a dominant source of news for nearly half of Americans under the age of 30.

The fourth dimension of authoritarianism is the control that a regime exerts over life chances: the way the state reaches deep into the lives of its subjects. The more the state serves as the principal employer, the harder it is for people to refuse to praise it, let alone speak out against it. In regime hands, housing becomes a weapon, whether via state ownership, licenses to register property ownership, or residency permits, such as in China's urban hukou system of household registration. State-controlled education means that the authorities can deny children admission to school if a parent or family refuses to perform whatever political tasks might be demanded of them. Individuals and families begin to volunteer to serve the regime, even if they detest it, in the hopes of obtaining or retaining employment, a place to live, or educational opportunities; having a chance to vacation at state-owned resorts; or just securing a passport or an exit visa. In some ways, control over quotidian affairs empowers regimes more than their repressive apparatuses—and does not require far-reaching forms of “tech authoritarianism.”

Few states control life chances fully, of course. Black markets and corruption flourish, providing alternative spaces and options. But the more the state controls your life chances, the more the state has power over you and the less power you have. At the highest levels of such control, authoritarian states become totalitarian. They push subjugation to the maximum, incentivizing denunciations of any perceived nonconformity. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor, coworker against coworker, as the people themselves undermine the social bonds and trust that might otherwise enable a modicum of autonomy from the state.

An authoritarian regime's control over its subjects' life chances is yet another source of strength that also creates weaknesses—albeit fewer than do the other dimensions. The private sector can, in theory, provide a vital antidote. If you can start your own business, join others in doing so, or move freely from one private employer to another based on your qualifications and hard work, you are less subject to state control. The same holds for one's ability to buy or rent private housing, attend nonstate schools, or form nongovernmental organizations.

But authoritarian regimes can exert massive influence over the private economy, and particularly over the largest employers, when a single person or a small group sometimes owns the enterprise (or the housing stock). What is more, harsh economic sanctions designed to punish regimes often instead end up punishing ordinary people and driving private enterprises either out of business or into the hands of the regime for help. That is what happened in Russia after the imposition of Western sanctions following Putin's widening of the war against Ukraine in February 2022. Moreover, even when private markets are allowed to flourish, they can entrap people, as happened when Xi decided to puncture China's property bubble, leaving untold millions with crushing debts, incomplete homes, and job losses—and thus often more vulnerable to and dependent on the regime. Still, the freedom that derives from legal, smaller-scale market activity can be a godsend.

The fifth and final dimension of authoritarianism is not a feature of a regime per se but the geopolitical environment in which it exists. A global order can be conducive to or corrosive for authoritarian regimes, and is almost always some combination of both, but what matters is the degree and the trendlines.

This is the dimension in which the United States has the most potential wherewithal to unsettle the autocrats. For a system putatively constructed to ensure that democratic ideals and free markets flourished, the U.S.-led world order has for a long time been remarkably conducive to authoritarian regimes. Consider, for example, the fact that such regimes usually require mass transfers of technology, since they have generally lagged behind the world's most advanced economies, which are democracies. The latter have been more than happy to have their private sectors supply nondemocracies, including Putin's Russia and communist China, with what they needed to develop. In 2016, according to the Financial Times journalist Patrick McGee, Apple pledged to invest $275 billion over five years to help Xi transform China into a crucial supply-chain hub and skilled-worker behemoth.

Authoritarian regimes also desperately need access to the lucrative markets of the West to sell their commodities and finished goods. The decisive U.S. domestic market was opened to communist China in 1980 and to Russia in 1992, when they were respectively granted “most favored nation” trading status. Both were also eventually admitted to the World Trade Organization without having to meet all the conditions required for admission and without being part of the U.S. security order. Authoritarians were allowed to make free use of the global financial system and receive foreign direct investment, which in the case of China was often routed through British-ruled Hong Kong. Today, Chinese-language commentary on the country's trade with and investment in India pointedly warns not to repeat the mistakes that Washington made with China.

European countries, in particular Germany, became the crucial customers of Russian energy products, which could be developed at scale solely in cooperation with Western oil majors and service firms. At its peak before the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian gas accounted for 45 percent of European imports in terms of volume. Even some four years into the Kremlin's attempted eradication of Ukrainian sovereignty, Russia is still responsible for around 12 percent of European gas imports. In 2024, European countries spent more money importing Russian energy than they did aiding Ukraine financially, effectively footing the bill for Russia's aggression.



Japan proved to be one of authoritarian China's most important sources of technology transfer and foreign direct investment, but Europe deepened its dependence on China, too, becoming a lucrative market for Chinese exports as they advanced up the value chain. In this regard, however, the United States is the main offender. The deliberate transfer of American manufacturing and critical supply chains to a country ruled by a communist monopoly regime was one of the most breathtaking gifts ever given to an authoritarian country, greater even than the bonanza of advanced technologies that the United States and European countries bestowed on Stalin's Soviet Union. The wealth generated by Western technology transfers made China the first country in history to become the world's greatest trading nation without a real navy; China gladly relied on the U.S. Navy to secure global sea-lanes. Beijing then used the proceeds to build its own navy, which is now eclipsing the American one.

Criticizing such folly comes easily. The intention, however, was never to support authoritarianism but to undermine or at least soften it—to carry out what the West Germans dubbed Wandel durch Handel, or “change through trade.” Western governments and pundits could look back on the spectacular successes of postwar West Germany and Japan, as well as those of the latter's two former colonies, South Korea and Taiwan, and imagine that related transformations could be brought about in postcommunist Russia and even communist China. But Eurasian landmass empires have been stubbornly autocratic for nearly their entire existence, despite repeated attempts at democratic revolutions. They have refused to bend to the West, even as they borrowed technologies and ideas from it, and proudly uphold their civilizations as superior.

When Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping articulated a policy of “reform and opening,” in the late 1970s, it was not a commitment to become a responsible stakeholder in the U.S.-led international order. It was a strategy to use that order to modernize a woefully poor China, depressed by Communist rule, while hiding its intentions and biding its time, for however long it took, before assuming its rightful place in an alternate international order shaped by Beijing. It happened far faster than Deng or anyone else had imagined it could. The CCP was also mindful that past communist parties that had pursued political liberalization had come to realize that they were in fact liquidating themselves, as happened in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Had the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev never come to power or never attempted to liberalize, the CCP might have embarked on its own suicidal political liberalization. Instead, the Chinese leadership learned history's lesson.

In warmly welcoming closed, illiberal regimes into the open, liberal global order, Washington and its allies were not demonstrating an ignorance of history. They just chose the wrong history as a guide. Sometimes the global order was, as designed, corrosive to authoritarianism. Still, it allowed and even incentivized the United States and other democratic countries to make choices that were conducive to autocrats. Vital market and tech access constituted the greatest leverage the United States and the West had over the authoritarians. It was essentially squandered.



The opportunity remains, however, to push back vigorously. Russia's exports of oil and gas and China's exports of manufactured goods remain their lifelines. China can ramp up its purchases of Russian oil and gas, for instance, but it cannot make up for all the revenue that Russia would lose if Europe managed to wean itself off imports of Russian energy. And Russia can buy more finished goods from China, but it cannot make up for all the revenue that China would lose if the United States and European countries significantly reduced their own imports of such goods.

Despite the clarity of these vulnerabilities, the United States and its friends cannot make up their minds on whether (and how) to “de-risk” their relationships with China or to effectuate a rapprochement or even some sort of grand bargain. They struggle to gird themselves against Russia as global energy demand continues to rise, especially with China controlling much of the alternative energy supply chain. At the same time, Washington has turned on its allies over their security free-riding and shortcomings in trade reciprocity, both of which the United States itself had partly encouraged. The failure of the West's big bet on corroding the great Eurasian authoritarians has, for the time being, turned the West against itself. Meanwhile, authoritarian cooperation, above all between Beijing and Moscow, keeps getting deeper. Yet those countries ultimately face significant limits, which become visible when their partnerships are stacked up against the combined wherewithal of Western countries and their partners.

Alliances are built on trust and attraction, otherwise known as soft power, and they are the most effective tools that democracies have in their struggle with autocracies. To be sure, anti-Western and particularly anti-American sentiment retains perennial purchase in all corners of the globe (and in the United States, too), owing to the very real histories of European and American imperialism and the sheer preponderance of U.S. power. This ideology provides considerable opportunity for authoritarian regimes—but many of the people living under them continue to be attracted to Western ideals, institutions, and lifestyles. That soft power is largely an emergent property, rather than something that can be guided by a government. Still, a successful democratic example with good governance, high living standards, social mobility, and freedom will always be the most corrosive force against authoritarianism. But the United States is perhaps as far from that, in various ways, as it was in the 1970s.

Now comes the elephant in the room: U.S. President Donald Trump, whose second term has aroused domestic and international trepidation about American authoritarianism. After all, if the president is an authoritarian, or if the United States is becoming an authoritarian country, how could it lead the democratic world in a fight against authoritarianism?

Warnings about the breakdown of American democracy derive partly from disappointments over policy reversals on contentious issues: immigration, crime-fighting, energy, abortion, foreign alliances. The ferocity and scope of Trump's counterrevolution have stunned progressive revolutionaries and the far larger number of Americans on the center-left who for decades had complied (or had been intimidated into silence) as left-wing orthodoxies swept through and reshaped establishment institutions. What many of them see as an authoritarian assault on such institutions, more Americans see as an overdue restoration of common sense. This back-and-forth struggle to dominate American institutions testifies to their surpassing value and to their insusceptibility to permanent subordination.

One American institution, however, could be viewed as problematic, just as the Antifederalists argued in the 1780s and Linz argued two centuries later: namely, presidentialism. Trump's exercise of presidential power should surprise no one. Executive orders—which are not expressly provided for in the Constitution—go back to George Washington, and too many presidents have had recourse to them. Impoundment (the delaying or withholding of congressionally mandated spending) is also absent from the Constitution, but presidents of both parties have practiced it. The power to issue absolute pardons, explicitly stipulated in the founding document, has been exploited with bipartisan intemperance. Trump is a shameless, concerted abuser of this lamentable executive inheritance. But his predecessors would recognize it.



The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., published The Imperial Presidency in 1973. He went easy on the phenomenon's gold standard, Franklin Roosevelt, whose policies he favored. (Democrats tend to like presidential power when their party holds the office.) The Caesarism inherent in the original American presidency got turbocharged not just by the New Deal but also by the country's ascension to superpower status. Still, it would matter far less if Congress were doing its job. Following Richard Nixon's abuses, Congress did seek to constrain the imperial presidency, but as the decades have passed it has largely failed to stick to the task. On the contrary, congressional majorities have often sacrificed the institution's prerogatives to presidents of their own party and sabotaged their institution's operations with debilitating procedural changes, such as centralizing power away from congressional committees.

Trump's second term does have novel aspects: for example, his assertions of absolute authority over all federal government bodies and personnel, the so-called administrative state. These actions claim support from a theory known as “the unitary executive.” The current Supreme Court has generally shown strong backing for this form of sweeping presidential power, in the name of holding career officials accountable. Conservatives have long decried how Republicans get elected president only for the federal bureaucracy to obstruct their policies. The problem is real, although exaggerated. And Trump's response—political purges and enforced sycophancy across the executive branch—offers no remedy. The unitary theory might add a veneer of legitimacy to his commanding the Department of Justice to pursue vindictive indictments of his critics and ease up on his law-breaking supporters, but it will bequeath that same validation to his successors.

Trump has also made a show of deliberately exceeding his constitutional authority, including by imposing, suspending, and reimposing tariffs and using fig-leaf declarations of “emergencies.” (One standout in his sewer of social media posts: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”) His strong-arming of universities, law firms, and media companies is a response to real problems, but his actions seem aimed more at harming those entities—and expanding his dominion over them—than at crafting enduring fixes. Although the courts move slowly and through multiple levels, judges appointed by presidents of both parties have ruled many of these steps illegal.

Critics of Trump's authoritarian wishes and methods have a significant point, one shared by a solid majority of voters, who justifiably look askance at his pathetic envy of strongmen, demonstratively brutal enforcement of immigration law, performative deployment of National Guard units to urban areas, bullying, and epic self-dealing. Trump and his supporters celebrate his singular imperative to transgress—then, when institutions move to hold him to account, they complain that he is being singled out. Still, even at his picaresque worst, Trump's presidency has not placed the United States on some irreversible slide to authoritarianism.



Nothing delivers a better appreciation of democratic resilience than close study of authoritarian regimes. The United States has no real coercive apparatus, let alone one that consumes the lion's share of its budget. For revenue, the government depends not on some cash-flow machine but entirely on taxpayers (and voters) who operate in a vast, open-market economy. Storytelling is endlessly contested, and recourse to propaganda provokes resistance and derision. The state exercises little control over life chances. Nothing the term-limited, lame-duck Trump has done, or might yet try, could significantly move the needle on any of those dimensions. As for the fifth dimension, China's power is having a corrosive effect on democracies, including in the United States, which has clumsily adopted measures that resemble the CCP's mercenary mercantilism. But such steps cannot coalesce into wholesale self-destruction of the open U.S. model.

Rather than institutionalized authoritarianism, what threatens the United States is bipartisan fiscal insanity, a deep erosion of basic government performance, severely diminished public trust in institutions, and the absence of a shared national narrative, all of which are interrelated. Trump didn't start these fires, and he won't put them out. He and too many of his opponents feed off and contribute to the country's extreme distraction and its resulting inability to craft a robust strategy of national renewal that would put the authoritarians on the back foot.

The seductions of immutable hierarchies, an imagined golden age, or the transformative power of violence can persist in open, tolerant societies, and political entrepreneurs can, for a time, make hay with them. Populism in all its guises surfaces problems but rarely solves them. The erosion of government performance helps get populists elected, but their governing tends to worsen that erosion, and this dynamic, alongside flagrant corruption, erodes their popularity. One of the abiding strengths of any genuinely liberal order—domestic or international—is that within it illiberalism can exist, and do damage, without posing an existential threat to it. Institutions and citizens of such an order should neither overrate the risk nor underrate their own strength and potential to prevail.

Linz's primary subject, Franco, is long dead, and so is his authoritarian Spain. Every strongman and would-be strongman in power today will be dead, at some point. For authoritarian regimes, survival is uncertain, and never more so than during inescapable successions.

But combating authoritarianism requires patience and resolve. It does not entail overthrowing every such regime or, indeed, any of them. The United States can topple weaker authoritarian regimes, but it cannot ensure their replacement by a better alternative. Time and again, Washington has demonstrated that it lacks the complex toolkit, cultural understanding, and sustained attention to establish enduring rule-of-law institutions and democratic political cultures on foreign soil, whether by force of arms, diplomacy, trade, or some combination thereof. Besides, Washington cannot directly bring down nuclear-armed authoritarian adversaries such as China and Russia without risking Armageddon. Instead, the goal should be to shape an environment that makes authoritarian regimes even less confident about their continued existence and, therefore, more preoccupied with their domestic affairs and less able to risk acting coercively abroad. The desired outcome is proactive multidomain competition and occasional cooperation—in other words, cold war instead of hot war.

Combating authoritarianism also requires that democracies get their own houses in order, which is particularly urgent in the United States because of its weight. No single country in recorded history has amassed so much power across so many domains simultaneously. That Americans profoundly disagree on what promotes or threatens their country's strength, and also on the appropriate degree of U.S. involvement in world affairs, is itself a strength. What is not, however, is a loss of a shared sense of a positive national identity and purpose. Some argue that instead of expending resources and effort to knock its adversaries off balance, the United States should invest in itself and its distinct advantages, including existing and new relationships with allies, friends, and partners. That position relies on a false binary: reinvigorating national purpose and solidifying relationships is, in fact, knocking one's adversaries off balance.

Neither the United States nor China is going to vanish. Therefore, they must share the planet. Washington's path could not be clearer: build substantial leverage with which to negotiate (or, if necessary, enact with like-minded countries) more advantageous and stable terms for planet sharing. These should favor an open and secure global commons, economic arrangements that foster opportunity at home and abroad, and sovereignty—which coercive spheres of influence (masquerading as a multipolar world) profoundly threaten but which alliances enhance for all.



The U.S.-led postwar order did not fail. It succeeded. It aimed to facilitate “the rise of the rest,” and it did, spectacularly so. But the countries that built and led the order did not prepare for the predictable results of that success: a relatively smaller share of global GDP for the advanced, wealthy countries of the G-7 and a relatively larger share for everyone else, with corresponding demands for more voice. Now the global order must be updated for a new era, one in which China—a supreme beneficiary of the existing order—possesses the wherewithal, and not just the ambition, to try to supplant it.

After World War II, ordered liberty took hold across much of the world because the United States became a superpower and acted like one, for worse but also for better. Today, the demand for U.S. power is essentially unlimited: bring Ukraine into NATO, defend Taiwan, sign a security treaty with Saudi Arabia. The supply, however, is not. And so Washington must adjust. Commitments must come into alignment with capabilities. This is finally happening. As the United States necessarily (albeit erratically) rebalances its global posture to deal with new circumstances, it is possible to see the advent of what might be called middle-power horizontalism: deeper economic and security cooperation, especially among the countries of northern Europe and the Indo-Pacific. This is a highly encouraging development, partly galvanized by Trump—a kind of latticework of additional integration that does not entail displacing the United States but enhancing its ability to lead. This will be the work of a generation.

All the major authoritarian regimes have shown themselves to be committed to achieving unencumbered sovereignty by driving U.S. power from their immediate regions and collapsing Washington's alliances. All share the goal of undermining and weakening the United States and its allies in any way they can. Despite not being subjected to aerial bombardment or amphibious invasion, open societies are under constant attack. China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and other anti-Western authoritarian regimes spread disinformation, exfiltrate confidential personnel files, purloin intellectual property, harass and sometimes abduct their own nationals on Western soil for exercising free-speech rights, pay criminals and gang members in Western societies to commit arson or sabotage, plant malware in financial, electrical, and water systems, and much more. “Peace” in the sense of that blissful time between wars has been lost. The gray zone is the new twilight zone.

Nonetheless, the future can still be shaped, and the open and secure global commons can be reinvented for another long run. The Ukrainians stood up to a full-scale Russian invasion and dragged the entire West into the fight. The Israelis knocked the teeth out of Iran's manifold proxies and even the Islamic Republic itself, and then pulled Washington in. The Taiwanese for three consecutive elections have selected the presidential candidate most despised by the CCP. The United States can neither eliminate nor transform the Eurasian authoritarians, but it can reenergize itself and, in the process, make it harder for the authoritarians to marshal their strengths and easier for their weaknesses to hold them back. The American experiment has always had to contend with bouts of disorder, disarray, and doubt. But the United States has also periodically rediscovered and renewed itself, sometimes in profound ways, and it must do so again. Its authoritarian adversaries are displaying audacity and resolve, but the nature of their regimes always presents an opportunity: their loyalists are their true enemies within.

            After months of speculation about his future on the radio, Howard Stern has signed a new contract with SiriusXM.
    


            Stern announced his new deal with the satellite radio giant on his show Tuesday morning. “I'm happy to announce that I figured out a way to have it all, more free time, and continuing to be on the radio,” Stern said. “So, yes, we are coming back for three years.”
    


            SiriusXM had no immediate comment on the terms of the new deal.
    


            Stern, 71, had been the subject of rumor-mongering because his current five-year deal is due to expire in a couple of weeks.
    


            In August, the US Sun claimed that “The Howard Stern Show” was “set to be canceled after a stunning 20-year run.” The story also suggested that Stern's exit might be related to his outspoken criticism of President Trump.
    


            The Sun story drew a lot of attention despite its thin sourcing. A SiriusXM executive then said of Stern and his crew, “We'd love them to stay,” but “it certainly has to make sense” financially.
    


            When Stern returned to his mic after Labor Day, he punked his listeners by having Andy Cohen pretend to take over the show. Several news outlets fell for the prank, much to Stern's delight. When he returned to the air, Stern said his deal talks have been “fantastic,” but didn't address his future beyond that.
    


            The contract talks continued out of public view. Stern said Tuesday that he feels “very loyal” to SiriusXM, which has paid him hundreds of millions of dollars for exclusive rights to his content over the years.

Live Updates


            • The US economy lost 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. The unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6% last month.
    


            • Almost all economic reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau have been delayed due to the historically long federal shutdown, which hamstrung data collection.
    


            • The October report now marks the first time in almost eight decades that a monthly snapshot has not included the unemployment rate.
    


            • The Census Bureau also reported October retail sales remained flat, the lowest reading in five months.
    


            The already-hurting oil market took another hit Tuesday as energy traders brace for a potential Russia-Ukraine deal that worsens the supply glut.
    


            US crude oil dropped 2.5% to $55.40 a barrel, leaving it on track to finish at the lowest level since February 2021.
    


            Brent crude, the world benchmark, is also on pace to settle at a fresh four-and-a-half year low below $60 a barrel.
    


            The sell-off comes after President Donald Trump said Monday night “we're closer now than we have been, ever” to ending the Ukraine war.
    


            Although key sticking points remain, an agreement to ending the war could allow Russian oil sidelined by sanctions to return to the global market.
    


            “The market is afraid of free-flowing Russian energy,” Robert Yawger, executive director and commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities, told CNN in a phone interview. “It's looking grim. We already have a way oversupplied market. Now we are looking at something that could get to the point of ridiculous.”
    


            Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said that if oil prices keep falling, OPEC+ may reverse course and start pulling back the producer group's recent supply increases.
    


            Cheap oil is providing a bright spot on the affordability front for consumers.
    


            The national average price of regular gasoline has dropped to $2.91 a gallon this week, the lowest price since May 2021, according to AAA.
    


            GasBuddy expects gas prices on Christmas Day to drop to $2.79 a gallon, the lowest since 2020.



            The longest-ever federal shutdown cast a large shadow over the November jobs report: Statistical agencies went dark during that time and critical data couldn't be collected, leading to a situation where the Bureau of Labor Statistics delivered 1.5 jobs reports on a mid-December Tuesday morning.
    


            So how much did the shutdown skew the months' data? In detailed technical notes pockmarking Tuesday's release, BLS officials went into great detail about the known and unknown effects.
    


            But first, a quick refresher: The BLS' monthly snapshot of the labor market is generated from two robust surveys: one of businesses and the other of households. The establishment survey responses are largely submitted electronically while the household surveys are conducted mostly in person and over the phone. (The data from the latter survey was scrapped for October)
    


            Back to the potential effects – in simplest terms, the November household survey data required more back-end math, potentially affecting the reliability; and the establishment data is possibly more accurate because response rates increased during the expanded collection period.
    


            BLS officials also noted that the overall payroll numbers for October and November weren't influenced by the hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. Those workers were eventually paid, so they were counted as employed for both months.
    


            Rather, October's hefty job losses (the economy shed 105,000 jobs that month) were the result of another, separate – and months-old – action by the federal government. The negative total was driven by the deferred resignations taken earlier in the year that were effective as of September 30.
    


            Wall Street is parsing through the partial jobs data for October and full report for November, in addition to data on retail sales.
    


            US stocks were lower Tuesday morning. The Dow was down 220 points, or 0.45%. The S&P 500 slid 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%.
    


            Here's what strategists and economists are saying:
    


            In addition to releasing delayed October and November employment figures, on Tuesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics published new, downwardly revised figures for September and August.
    


            In August the number of net jobs shed was 26,000, a 22,000 increase from earlier figures. And in September the number of people hired was revised down by 11,000 to 108,000.
    


            Each month's initially reported change in employment is subject to multiple revisions as the government collects more data that enables more accurate estimates. The first two revisions occur in the subsequent job reports.
    


            Collectively, the August and September revisions suggest the labor market is weaker than previously known.
    


            Economists, business leaders and politicians have debated the best solution to make America's cost-of-living feel affordable again, including increasing health care and housing subsidies and reducing tariffs.
    


            But Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the solution is to pay people more money.
    


            “We are going to need to have some years where real compensation is higher … for people to start feeling good about the affordability issue,” Powell said last week at a press conference after the Fed cut rates.
    


            “We are trying to keep inflation under control, but also support the labor market and strong wages, so that people are earning enough money and feeling economically healthy again.”
    


            The Fed hopes that by reducing interest rates, businesses will spend less to borrow money, freeing up more capital to spend on hiring. A better labor market would give Americans more choices in jobs, increasing the amount of pay companies would need to shell out to keep and attract workers.
    


            If that keeps up, then over time, people will adjust to the higher prices, which will feel relatively affordable as their paychecks grow, Powell argued.
    


            Of course, that's easier said than done. Americans' average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in November, the slowest rate in over four years, according to Tuesday's jobs report.
    


            Read more here.
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday the Federal Reserve has “plenty of room” to lower rates.
    


            “The reason they can be lower is not just mumbo jumbo,” he said in a CNBC interview. Rather, it's because there's an increase in demand for workers as a result of President Donald Trump's policies, including corporate tax cuts, he said.
    


            Hassett is one of Trump's top picks to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May.
    


            Hassett also said he spent an hour and a half meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday. Trump has repeatedly expressed he wants interest rates to be much lower and would ideally like the next head of the Fed to consult with him before monetary policy meetings.
    


            Hassett said he'd be open to hearing the president out. “If he's got a good reason … and I found that I agreed with the reason, then I would present it to the others and see what they think,” Hassett said, referring to other members of the Fed's rate-setting committee. But he said the central bank's independence is still “really important.”
    


            By all indications, the employment prospects for young workers remained grim in November, as the unemployment rate for 16-to-24 year olds rose to 10.6%, the highest since 2021, with more than 2 million young workers looking for jobs last month.
    


            The unemployment rate for 16-to-19 year olds climbed to 16.3% in November from 13.2% in September, the highest level since August 2020, indicating that high school graduates trying to enter the workforce are facing mounting challenges, as many traditionally blue-collar sectors, like manufacturing and trucking, see job losses.
    


            While the jobs picture for 20-to-24-year-olds improved slightly last month, falling from 9.2% in September to 8.3%, the reading was still the highest figure for the month of November since 2020, and it follows a pattern of increases, and worries about the effects of artificial intelligence on the entry-level job market persist.
    


            In recent months, wage gains for young workers has come down rapidly, with workers between the ages of 16 and 24 seeing a yearly average wage growth of 6.0% in September, lower than at any other time in the past decade, including during the pandemic, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
    


            The job prospects for young workers and minorities have long been indicators of a weakening economy, a point that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized as the central bank lowers interest rates in an attempt to support a flagging labor market.
    


            The US economy is failing to add enough jobs to keep up with the supply of new workers.
    


            Job growth over the past three months slowed to an average of just 22,333 through November, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
    


            On a six-month basis, job growth is averaging just 16,666 per month.
    


            This is shy of the breakeven rate of roughly 30,000 to 50,000 jobs that economists estimate is needed to keep the unemployment rate stable.
    


            When job growth slips below the breakeven pace, it means job creation is not keeping up with the growth of the labor force as new workers enter or renter the job market.
    


            This helps explain why the unemployment rate has climbed from 4.4% in September to a four-year high of 4.6% in November.
    


            The breakeven rate of job growth has dropped significantly in recent years as a result of fewer immigrants and aging demographics marked by the retirement of baby boomers.
    


            That means the US economy needs fewer jobs to keep the unemployment rate stable than it did a few years ago. And yet job growth has dropped below even that lowered bar.
    


            Hiring is so weak that the US economy is on track for its worst year of job growth since Covid.
    


            The economy has only added an average of 55,455 jobs per month through November, according to new data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    


            That leaves the job market on pace for its weakest year of job growth since 2020 during the pandemic. Beyond that, this would be the worst job growth since 2009 during the Great Recession.
    


            The economy has outright lost jobs in three out of the past six months: June, August and October. This follows a stretch of four-plus years without any monthly job loss.
    


            The latest jobs report “paints a sobering picture of a job market that may officially be turning frigid after a prolonged cooling period,” Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote in a note on Tuesday.
    


            Ullrich noted that while the incomplete report may need an “asterisk attached to it” due to the shutdown and federal worker buyouts, the data shows “weak overall” job growth in November concentrated largely in health care.
    


            US stocks opened lower Tuesday as traders digested long-delayed data on the job market that showed the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November.
    


            The Dow fell 32 points, or 0.07%. The S&P 500 fell 0.18%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.24%.
    


            Stock futures had briefly inched higher after the data release before wavering and resuming trading lower.
    


            Wall Street traders are keen for insight into whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in January. However, the Fed is likely to put more weight on the December jobs report, set to be released early next month.
    


            “This is a mixed bag for the Fed,” Thomas Simons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said in a note. “The combined message of all of this data is sufficiently muddled that it does not give a sense of whether broader downside risks to the labor market have intensified.”
    


            “The picture will be somewhat clearer next month,” Simons said.
    


            Traders are pricing in a roughly 24% chance that the Fed cuts rates in January, according to CME FedWatch. That's unchanged from a 24% chance yesterday.
    


            Elsewhere in markets:
    


            Federal Reserve officials, who are actively trying to preserve the US labor market's strength, probably weren't too spooked by the latest batch of employment figures.
    


            The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday reported that the US economy lost 104,000 jobs in October, recouping only about half of those losses in November. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate last month rose to a four-year high.
    


            While the latest jobs report underscores a slowing labor market, it probably won't sway what the Fed decides on interest rates at its policy meeting at the end of January.
    


                    The Fed is unlikely to put much weight on today's report, given data disruptions.
                


                    Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management
                


            The Fed earlier this month lowered rates for the third consecutive time, but signaled that further rate cuts in the near term are less likely and will be tougher to justify.
    


            After lowering rates three times this year, policymakers likely want to see how those rate moves affect the US economy, meaning they may hold off on further rate cuts. Central bankers projected just one rate cut in 2026, according to their latest economic projections.
    


            Fed officials will also have more employment data by their January 27-28 meeting
    


            “The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,” Haigh said.
    


            The November jobs report showed employers hired 64,000 new workers that month, exceeding economists' expectations for 40,000 hires.
    


            This came after the economy lost 105,000 workers in October, according to data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    


            “The nation has added a mere 100,000 jobs in the past six months,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in a note Tuesday. “The bulk of those jobs were in health care, an industry that is almost always hiring due to America's aging population. Almost all other sectors are flatlining or laying workers off right now.”
    


            Here's a closer look, sector by sector:
    


            While Americans' earnings are still outpacing inflation, they're growing at the slowest rate in over four years, according to new data released Tuesday in the delayed November jobs report.
    


            Americans' average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in November, whereas inflation grew at a 3% rate in September. The wedge between the two has significantly narrowed as inflation has been reaccelerating and the labor market has tightened, prompting employers to dole out less generous raises and starting salaries.
    


            The last time average annual wage growth was this slow was May 2021, when that rate clocked in at 2.3%.
    


            Tuesday's jobs data “is nothing but bad, bad news for the economy and the outlook in 2026,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds.
    


            The November increase in the unemployment rate shows there are “no jobs out there for American workers that have been laid off,” he said in a note Tuesday.
    


            There are now 7.8 million Americans out of work, he wrote, citing President Donald Trump's clampdown on foreign labor.



            “It stands to reason that if you deport workers from the country there will be fewer jobs showing up in the labor statistics and more unemployment, and that is exactly what we are seeing,” Rupkey wrote.
    


            Sales at US retailers were flat in October, in a sign that America's economic engine is sputtering.
    


            Retail sales were unchanged in October from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, down from September's 0.1% increase. That's the weakest monthly reading since May, when retail sales declined.
    


            The October figure was roughly in line with the 0.05% gain economists predicted in a poll by data firm FactSet. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.
    


            Retail sales overall were pulled down by falling sales at car dealerships and gas stations; so, excluding those purchases, retail sales were up 0.5% in October. Sales also declined at home improvement stores, restaurants, bars and personal care shops.
    


            Tuesday's report was originally due in mid-November, but was delayed for a month because of the government shutdown.
    


            While spending has been on the weaker side, Americans haven't cut back outright in the face of low consumer sentiment and higher inflation spurred by President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs. That should keep economic growth afloat for now: Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy.
    


            In October, retail sales were up in the majority of categories tracked by the Commerce Department, rising the most at furniture stores (2.3%), sporting goods retailers (1.9%) and online (1.8%).
    


            Still, the double whammy of a slowing labor market and higher tariff inflation poses a risk to consumer spending.
    


            Unemployment rose to a four-year high of 4.6% in November and the economy added just 64,000 jobs, new Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed Tuesday.
    


            Tuesday's jobs report also included partial data for October, after the government shutdown complicated data collection issues for that month.
    


            BLS data shows an estimated 105,000 jobs were lost in October, partly due to deferred resignations from the Department of Government Efficiency that were put in place earlier this year but were effective September 30.
    


            And, for the first time in nearly 80 years, no unemployment rate was released for October due to a lack of data collection during the shutdown.
    


            Economists were looking for a net gain of 40,000 jobs for November and for the unemployment rate to stay unchanged from its September rate of 4.4%, according to FactSet.
    


            The Federal Reserve has been facing two concurrent problems: The job market is getting worse, while inflation is on the rise.
    


            Through its various tools, the central bank can support the job market or control inflation – but it can't do both at the same time.
    


            As Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted, “there is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension.”
    


            But at its policy meeting last week, the Fed ultimately determined that concerns about the labor market outweighed fears of inflation.
    


            “First of all, gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,” Powell explained. “Unemployment is now up three-tenths from June through September.”
    


            He also suggested that the labor market is cooling even more than that.
    


            “We think there is an overstatement in these numbers by 60,000 (jobs per month,” Powell said in a Wednesday press conference.
    


            That would turn the April to September gains into losses, at about 20,000 jobs per month – revealing a considerably weaker labor market.
    


            Main Street and Wall Street may be rooting for different outcomes from today's jobs report.
    


            While a strong report could relieve consumers concerned about rising unemployment, it may also reignite concerns among investors about whether the Fed can continue cutting rates in early 2026.
    


            “We are now firmly back in a good is bad/bad is good regime,” Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “Moderate labor market weakness is likely to be viewed in a bullish context by equity markets.”
    


            On the other hand, Wilson cautioned that one risk to stocks is a “hot jobs print” that lowers the odds of rate cuts.
    


            Coming into today, the Nasdaq has dropped three days in a row amid continued concerns about the high price tag on tech stocks.
    


            US stocks were to set open slightly lower Tuesday morning as traders awaited a slew of long-delayed economic data.
    


            Dow futures were down 19 points. S&P 500 futures fell 0.07%. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.13%.
    


            Stocks are coming off a day in the red. Wall Street will be attuned to partial jobs data for October and a full report for November, both set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.
    


            “This week is loaded with long-delayed government data releases, including on employment and inflation, which will provide a reality check on the economy's performance in the final weeks of 2025,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note.
    


            “Neutral” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN's Fear and Greed Index.
    


            With just two weeks left in 2025, the S&P 500 is up almost 16% this year. The benchmark US stock index is trading roughly 1.24% away from a record high set on December 11.
    


            Tuesday morning's jobs report is expected to show that just 40,000 jobs were added last month and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4% – historically low but still higher than in recent years.
    


            “I think the September jobs number was probably a high-water mark for what we're going to see in the more recent data,” said Tyler Schipper, an associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.
    


            “I think my estimation is somewhere between 0 and 50,000 jobs between the two reports. One of them might end up being negative and one of them might end up being positive,” he told CNN.
    


            “But I don't expect a change from this stalemate where we're not creating enough jobs to keep the unemployment rate down,” he added.
    


            Wage growth is also expected to slow, which could further put pressure on future consumer spending.

            Retiring Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Monday her engagement to Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump pundit who works for the far-right news network Real America's Voice.
    


            “Happily ever after!!!” Greene posted on X. Glenn, who is chief White House correspondent for the MAGA-aligned network, also shared the engagement on social media with a photo of him embracing Greene while she shows off her engagement ring.
    


            The announcement comes weeks after Greene had a public falling out with President Donald Trump an dsaid she would resign from office in January, noting that she wanted to avoid a nasty primary. Trump has called her a “traitor” and said he'd support a GOP challenge to her House seat.
    


            Greene, who had been an ardent Trump supporter since arriving on Capitol Hill in 2021, now insists the president has been too focused on foreign policy in his second term and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home. She, along with fellow Republican Rep. Thomas Massie has been one of the most vocal critics of the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene will leave Congress after five turbulent years



            Glenn notably called out Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for not wearing a suit to the White House, at a contentious Oval Office event in February.
    


            Greene and Glenn met in 2022 and began publicly dating early the next year, after both had begun divorce proceedings for their first marriages, according to the Washington Post.
    


            The next steps in Greene's career remain unclear. CNN has previously reported that the Georgia congresswoman, who earlier this year had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state's high-stakes Senate race, currently has no known plans to run for office.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Halting work on Trump's ballroom could risk White House security, Secret Service official says","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/15/politics/white-house-ballroom-construction-filings-secret-service","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:40:00 GMT","


            A Secret Service official involved in the construction of President Donald Trump's massive new White House ballroom said Monday that any temporary pause on the project could hamper the agency's ability to carry out its protective mission.
    


            The warning – made in a sworn statement by USSS Deputy Director Matthew Quinn – comes a day before a federal judge in Washington, DC, is set hold an emergency hearing to consider whether to order the White House to pause work on the ballroom pending a lawsuit challenging how the project has unfolded thus far.
    


            Quinn, who oversees USSS' role in the ballroom project, said a contractor involved in the construction is still working to provide temporary security and safety measures around the site and that “any pause in construction, even temporarily, would leave the contractor's obligation unfulfilled … and consequently hamper the Secret Service's ability to meet its statutory obligations and protective mission.”
    


            The lawsuit filed last week by the nation's top historic preservation group claims Trump is pursuing the project unlawfully because he hasn't gotten approval from Congress or submitted his plans to the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts for review, which would give the public a chance to weigh in.
    


            The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, to issue a temporary restraining order that would pause any further work on the ballroom until Congress authorizes it, the commissions review it and environmental assessments are completed.
    


            In a separate sworn statement filed by the government in the case on Monday, an official with the National Park Service, which is a named defendant in the case, revealed that above-ground work on the ballroom would not begin until at least April and said that efforts were underway for the White House to coordinate with the pair of commissions.
    


            That official, John Stanwich, noted that the Commission on Fine Arts does not currently have a quorum but that “plans are underway to appoint new members” to it. The White House fired all six members of the commission in October, CNN previously reported, amid Trump's push to impose his style on the nation's capital through a slate of construction projects, including the ballroom.
    


            The declaration also confirms the White House plans to bring the project before the National Capital Planning Commission before vertical construction begins, as officials have previously said.
    


            The declaration from Stanwich, who is the NPS' liaison to the White House, gave the most thorough public accountings yet of the work that was undertaken before construction crews tore down the historic East Wing of the White House this fall, prompting outrage among Democrats and preservationists.
    


            Stanwich said that in August and September his staff worked with the White House to “identify and remove museum objects, including paintings and historic furniture, from the East Wing, East Colonnade, and the Ground Floor State Rooms of the White House to be stored or curated” off-site.
    


            Crews also worked to salvage “historic materials” from the East Wing before it was torn down, Stanwich said, which included “stone columns, doors, and other items that are planned to be reincorporated into the new facility.”
    


            Extensive documentation of the East Wing was undertaken pre-demolition, he told the court, through photography and the creation of a 3D scan of the building to create “a digital twin … for future preservation and interpretive purposes.”
    


            The massive project, Stanwich said, has caused a ripple effect across the White House's professional and historic spaces. Public-facing parts of the building that used to be stops on White House tours, including the famous China Room, are now being used as office spaces.
    


            “If progress on the project were halted, this would prolong these impacts to the experiences of Park visitors,” he told the court.

            • Police are pursuing a new lead based on photos and videos of an individual taken around 2 p.m. Saturday, hours before the deadly mass shooting at Brown University, authorities said today. The FBI, which announced a $50,000 reward leading to an arrest and conviction, also released a description, saying the person is “approximately 5'8” with a stocky build.”
    


            • Earlier, a person of interest detained in connection with the attack was released, and has been cleared in the investigation, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.
    


            • The shooting left two students dead and nine others injured at the Ivy League school, where classes and exams have been canceled.  The campus remains on edge.



Our coverage of the ongoing search for a suspect in the shooting at Brown University has moved.
    


            When Brown freshman Khimari Manns heard about the shooting on campus, he immediately reached out to his wrestling teammates, his classmates and his roommate, MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, while sheltering in a restroom.
    


            But when Umurzokov didn't respond during the lockdown, Manns began to worry. “Something didn't feel right. I texted him and he didn't text back,” Manns told CNN affiliate WBZ.
    


            “What I do know is that Brown is grieving. I am grieving,” he said, adding that Umurzokov was a “ball of joy” and that his absence is felt throughout the Brown community.
    


            “His soul truly did reverberate throughout the community,” he said.
    


            Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee has ordered a sweeping review of school safety measures after the Brown University shooting left the campus on edge.
    


                    “As a parent who has sent my children off to college – I can only imagine how families are feeling right now. And I will assure you: The safety and well‑being of your children and all Rhode Islanders are my priority,” McKee said in a post on X.
                





            He directed the state's top education officials to “work with both K-12 and higher education to conduct a full review of their school safety and security plans.”
    


            The governor said the state is committing “every resource available” to assist Providence and Brown University as the manhunt for the gunman continues. He also called for an increased police presence at schools to steady anxious students, families and educators.
    


                    “I know that many people are feeling anxious right now,” McKee added. “Given the emotional toll that a tragedy like this can take, it is essential that mental health resources are visible, accessible and responsive.”
                





            Authorities on Monday released photos and videos of a new person of interest, described as “approximately 5'8” with a stocky build.” A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
    


            The images show an individual dressed in dark clothing and masked. The person's distinctive gait and consistent rhythm could be recognizable to someone close to them, a CNN senior law enforcement analyst said.
    


            The new lead comes after the release of a person of interest previously detained in connection to the shooting, a decision that has sparked confusion and concern within the Brown community.
    


            With a manhunt underway, here's what we know:
    


Victims



            Brown University officials are asking anyone who was in the Barus and Holley Hall - the site of Saturday's shooting - to assist investigators in their efforts to track down the suspect.
    


            “We ask that anyone who was in Barus & Holley building on Friday or Saturday, Dec. 12-13, immediately contact the Providence police to arrange for an interview,” the university said in an update Monday evening. “Even what seems like an incidental detail may ultimately be helpful in law enforcement's efforts to protect our community.”
    


            The university also emphasized that campus safety remains its foremost priority. It said reports circulating about additional intruders and violence on and around campus were unfounded and that police have responded to several calls about reported threats, each determined to be baseless. Brown has also experienced an uptick of “swatting” calls, it said.
    


            The university said it has put in place additional safety measures, including an enhanced security presence on campus and restricted building access.
    


            Brown University student Annie Johnson's sense of security was “completely destroyed” after news that an initial person of interest was released from custody, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday.
    


                    “It felt like just the smallest amount of comfort to know, well, like, at least they found the guy and they have him and they know who it was, but now it's like that one sense of sort of security was just completely destroyed,” she said.
                





            Johnson said being in the airport to fly home “was a really weird experience” as she was surrounded by people who may have read about the university shooting on their phones and likely “didn't understand what it was like to live through it.”
    


            “I have to have sympathy for those people, and I have to understand them because like, just a week before, I probably would have done the same thing,” Johnson added.
    


            New videos of an individual police are calling a person of interest provide a fresh look at the person's size, how they walk and other details that may help the public to identify them, CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe said.
    


            The individual has a distinctive gait with a consistent rhythm that someone close to them might be able to identify, McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
    


            “He kind of walks the same way when he's on the sidewalk or crossing the street, and he appears to favor his left leg just slightly, not so much that it would be indicative of any sort of permanent disability, but maybe the remnant of an old surgery or a knee injury or something like that,” McCabe said.
    


            The videos also reveal the individual's size and build, and more detail of their dark clothing.
    


            “It's those kind of details that I think could maybe trip somebody's recollection that this is someone they know in their lives,” McCabe said.
    


            Authorities released the videos Monday afternoon, describing the individual in them as “approximately 5'8” with a “stocky build.” The FBI also announced Monday a $50,000 reward for information leading to “the identification, arrest, and conviction of the individual.”
    


            The FBI continues to assist in the investigation into the Brown University shooting, with the Providence Police Department leading the investigation, Director Kash Patel wrote in a post on X.
    


            The agency sent additional resources to the area today “to help track down leads, canvass neighborhoods, and develop intelligence,” and the Evidence Response Team is still helping to process evidence, he said.
    


            “Anything Rhode Island authorities need from this FBI, we will be there,” Patel said.
    


            Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha told CNN's Erin Burnett that he was “confident” law enforcement would be able to find the person of interest in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University.
    


            He called the person shown in videos released by police “a significant person of interest, possibly more than that.”
    


            “Hopefully very quickly, we can get this person identified, detained, questioned if possible, but certainly he is our primary person of interest right now,” the attorney general said.
    


            Responding to comments President Donald Trump made about Brown University being to blame for the failure to quickly identify a suspect, Neronha said the shooting was instead a symptom of a greater problem.
    


                    “It's not a Brown problem, it's a national problem, a symptom that happened here in Rhode Island,” he said. “What we're focused on here is solving this crime. It's not Brown's fault. It's the fault of this gunman.”
                





            Authorities provided significant new information in their latest news briefing on the shooting at Brown University, and announced a $50,000 reward from the FBI for information that leads to the identification, arrest and conviction of the suspect who is believed to be armed and dangerous.
    


            The shooter in Saturday's attack “definitely” targeted Brown University, Chief of Police Oscar L. Perez, Jr.
    


If you're just tuning in for a quick roundup of the key details, here's the rundown:



Suspect's movements:



Community safety:



About the suspect:



Additional clarifications:



CNN's Danya Gainor, Zoe Sottile and Michelle Watson contributed to the report.



            Videos released by the Providence Police Department show a person of interest walking around the area on Saturday hours before the deadly shooting at Brown University.
    


            In the video, the person is walking on a sidewalk by a picket fence around 2 p.m. on Saturday, officials say.
    


            Surveillance video shown during the Monday press conference showed an individual wearing what appears to be a mask crossing a street.
    


            In another clip, the same individual is seen walking on the sidewalk next to an iron gate.
    


            Additionally, officials displayed photos of the individual, who appeared to be wearing dark clothing.
    


            The FBI released a description of a person they described as the suspect in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University, along with photos.
    


            The shooter is “approximately 5'8” with a stocky build,” reads a poster released by the bureau.
    


            Images show a person dressed in dark clothing with a face mask and beanie.
    


            The FBI is urging members of the public to contact them with any information related to the shooting.
    


            Rhode Island Rep. Seth Magaziner urged the public on Monday to not pay attention to theories “floating around online” about who the suspect might be, warning some people may use “tragedies” like this “to stoke more fear and to stoke more division.”
    


            “Unless there is official notification or official guidance, we shouldn't be guessing or making assumptions about what the motive might have been or who the shooter might be,” Magaziner, a Democrat, told CNN's Jake Tapper.
    


            “So I would say, you know, follow those those regular press conferences from the local officials to get the real information, not the noise online,” he continued.
    


            At Monday's afternoon news conference, a journalist asked officials about the timing of the release of photos the FBI says show the suspect in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University.
    


            The photos were released Monday, two days after a gunman opened fire in the Ivy League school's engineering building, killing two students and injuring nine others.
    


            “It takes time,” Providence police chief  Oscar L. Perez Jr.  said. “Investigations are very complex, and when you're doing canvassing areas or when you're developing evidence, sometimes you get directed to another direction, and then that's what makes you go back to certain areas and continue to investigate.”
    


            Asked a pointed question about surveillance footage at Brown University, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley emphasized the hard work all agencies were putting into tracking down the suspect and their commitment to transparency.
    


            “We continue to answer your questions,” he said during a tense moment. “We will continue to do so, but the best way to inform the public and to ask for their help is for these opportunities to not degrade into baseless accusations.”
    


            Mayor Brett Smiley said Providence officials will not provide another news briefing Monday unless there is a “significant update” to the situation.
    


            Chief of Police Oscar L. Perez, Jr. said Monday the shooter in Saturday's attack “definitely” targeted Brown University.
    


            “What I can tell you is that this individual definitely targeted Brown University, because clearly we're here speaking about that, and I can also tell you that obviously it's something that we're looking into – as far if there was anything else that he was targeting, but it's all open” Perez said.
    


            Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he and other officials have “all been working for 49 hours, we're tired – we're serious about the task at hand.”
    


            “I know that people are weary, and so I'm asking please for a little bit of patience and grace,” the mayor said. “We have been fully transparent. We continue to answer your questions.”
    


            Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said authorities are working to reconstruct the person's movements both before and after Saturday's shooting.
    


            “What's critical here is that we reconstruct … this man's movements, both before and afterwards,” Neronha said Monday.
    


            “My hope is that we will eventually have that pattern,” he added.
    


            Providence Police Chief Oscar L. Perez, Jr. said reports that a second person of interest was taken into custody in connection to the shooting at Brown University were false.
    


            One person was taken into custody Sunday before later being released and cleared.
    


            Providence Police Chief Oscar L. Perez, Jr. told reporters on Monday that investigations can take different paths.
    


            “All detectives throughout this nation and in the world understand that when you investigate in a case, it takes different paths,” Perez said.
    


            “You know, you start somewhere, you start here, and all of a sudden, something else pops off, and you're going in a different direction. And that's what happens. It's complex,” he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Howard Stern will spend another three years on SiriusXM, telling listeners Tuesday that he's “figured out a way to have it all.”

And reps confirmed that he's not trolling us again like he did back in August when he brought on Andy Cohen as a fake replacement host. This time, he went the sincere route without providing many details of his latest contract extension.

“I am happy to announce that I have figured out a way to have it all. More free time and continuing to be on the radio. Yes, we are coming back for three years,” Stern said on air.

Stern, 71, said he was able to create a “more flexible schedule,” adding: “And I'm excited about it because you know what. I do still love radio.”

He made the announcement during his last show of the year. He'll be back live on the air Jan. 5. 

Stern joined what was then Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. in 2006. It helped make him one of the highest-paid personalities in broadcasting and was a game-changer for both the company and the nascent satellite radio industry. 

He's recently had newsy and intimate chats with Lady Gaga and Bruce Springsteen. In August, he tried to convince listeners that he had left by having Cohen at the top of “The Howard Stern Show” pretending to be his successor. 

Stern said Tuesday he checked in with his co-host, Robin Quivers, to make sure “she was up for it” before deciding to stay on another three years.




“If Robin wasn't up for it, then I wasn't going to do it,” he said.

SiriusXM's subscriber base has been slowly contracting, with the company reporting 33 million paid subscribers in the third quarter of 2025, some 100,000 fewer than the year before. It is battling a saturated satellite market and competition from free, ad-supported platforms like Spotify.

Stern rose to national fame in the 1980s. He had a 20-year stint at the then-WXRK in New York. At its peak, “The Howard Stern Show” was syndicated in 60 markets and drew over 20 million listeners. 

He was lured to satellite radio by the lucrative payday and a lack of censorship, following bruising indecency battles with the Federal Communications Commission and skittish radio executives. His past on-air bits had included parading strippers through his New York studio and persuading the band then known as The Dixie Chicks to reveal intimate details about their sex lives.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Additional police were sent to Providence schools on Tuesday to reassure worried parents that their kids will be safe with the Brown University shooter on the loose and no indication yet that investigators have zeroed in on a specific suspect.

Authorities on Monday released several new videos of the man suspected in Saturday's mass shooting inside of a Brown classroom, which killed two students and wounded nine others. After releasing a person of interest in the case because the evidence pointed elsewhere, they once again pleaded with the public for any tips that might help them catch the attacker.

Tensions remain high in Providence. With the investigation in its third day Monday, officers were still knocking on doors and poring through dumpsters and backyards near the Ivy League campus in search of additional video evidence or other clues.

But some locals expressed defiance.

“Of course it feels scary. But at the same time, I think that if the person really wanted to scare us, we shouldn't allow him or her to win,” said Tatjana Stojanovic, a Providence parent who lives next door to the Brown campus. “Despite all of that, we should just go about our lives. I mean, obviously, you cannot forget this. But I think we shouldn't cower and just sort of stop living despite what has happened.

In the five videos authorities have released of the suspect, he was wearing a mask or his face was turned. The FBI described him as about 5 feet, 8 inches (173 centimeters) tall, with a stocky build.

The attack and the shooter's escape have raised questions about campus security, including a lack of security cameras, and led to calls for better locks on campus doors. Others pushed back, though, saying such efforts do little to address the real issue.




“The issue isn't the doors, it's the guns,” said Zoe Kass, a senior who fled the engineering building as police stormed in Saturday. “And all of this, like, ‘Oh, the doors need to be locked.' I get it, parents are scared. But any of us could have opened the door for the guy if the doors had been locked.”

After spending of her life in schools where every door was locked and school shootings continued to persist, Kass said such security measures only created “the illusion of safety.”

Meanwhile, details have emerged about the victims, who were in the first-floor classroom in the school's engineering building studying for a final.

Only one of the wounded students had been released as of Sunday, Brown President Christina Paxson said. One was in critical condition and the other seven were in critical but stable condition. 

One of the wounded students, 18-year-old freshman Spencer Yang of New York City, told the New York Times and the Brown Daily Herald that there was a mad scramble after the gunman entered the room. Many students ran toward the front, but Yang said he wound up on the ground between some seats and was shot in the leg. He expected to be discharged within days.

Jacob Spears, 18, a freshman from Evans, Georgia, was shot in the stomach, “but through sheer adrenaline and courage, he managed to run outside, where he was aided by others,” according to a GoFundMe site organized for him.

Ella Cook, a 19-year-old sophomore who was one of the two students killed, was vice president of the Brown College Republicans and was beloved in her church in Birmingham, Alabama. In announcing her death Sunday, the Rev. R. Craig Smalley described her as “an incredible grounded, faithful, bright light” who encouraged and “lifted up those around her.”

The other student killed was, MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, an 18-year-old freshman from Brandermill, Virginia, who was majoring in biochemistry and neuroscience. His family immigrated to the U.S. from Uzbekistan when he was a kid.

As a child, Umurzokov suffered a neurological condition that required surgery, and he later wore a back brace because of scoliosis, his sister Samira Umurzokova told The Associated Press by phone. He knew from an early age that he wanted to be a neurosurgeon to help others like him. 

“He had so many hardships in his life, and he got into this amazing school and tried so hard to follow through with the promise he made when was 7 years old,” she said.

NEW YORK (AP) — An on-duty Customs and Border Protection officer fired his gun several times during a confrontation with another motorist Tuesday on an access road for New York's Kennedy Airport, police said.

The CBP officer told authorities that he pulled his weapon after the other driver attacked him over a minor traffic crash, Port Authority police said. 

It wasn't clear if the shots hit anything. The other driver fled the scene after the shooting, according to the CBP officer, who was unhurt.

The two-vehicle crash happened shortly before 5 a.m. near the airport's main car rental facilities on the tangle of roads and ramps that lead to the airport's terminals, administration buildings and cargo areas.

JFK's roadways are currently undergoing a major construction overhaul and navigating the thicket of detours and traffic changes has been a source of frustration and confusion for many drivers. 

The Port Authority didn't say if the officer was driving an official vehicle. His name has not been released.

The investigation led to traffic delays in the area during the morning commute, but those issues lessened as the morning progressed.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a deal to end the fighting in Russia's nearly 4-year-old invasion of his country could be finalized within days, after which American envoys will present them to the Kremlin before possible further meetings in the U.S. next weekend. 

A draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin on Monday is “not perfect” but is “very workable,” Zelenskyy told reporters hours after the discussions. He cautioned, however, that some key issues — notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces — remain unresolved.

U.S.-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But as the spotlight shifts to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said that after the Berlin talks, “we are very close to (a deal on) strong security guarantees.”

The security proposal will be based on Western help in keeping the Ukrainian army strong, an official from a NATO nation said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

“Europeans will lead a multinational and multi-domain force to strengthen those troops and to secure Ukraine from the land, sea and air, and the U.S. will lead a ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, with international participation,” the official said.




Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.

If Ukraine seeks “momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,” he said.

“We want peace — we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,” he told reporters. “We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.”

American officials said Monday there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. U.S. President Donald Trump said: “I think we're closer now than we have been, ever” to a peace settlement.

Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, notably the land issue.

Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either but Trump has previously indicated that Ukraine will have to cede territory.

“The Americans are trying to find a compromise,” Zelenskyy said, before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. “They are proposing a ‘free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a ‘free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.”

Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.

Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense, such as enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons.

Zelenskyy said that what's driving Kyiv officials in the negotiations is for Russia to be “held accountable for what it has done — for this war, for all the killings, for all the suffering.”

Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.

He was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks.

“Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,” Zelenskyy said. “It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and nutrition and fitness specialist Dr. Paul Saladino discuss the Trump administration's $1 billion airport upgrade plan on ‘Fox & Friends.'

Once a rare luxury reserved only for premium international travelers, the ability to shower at airports is gaining new attention as fliers look for ways to refresh during long-haul trips and extended layovers — especially amid the MAHA push for healthier living in virtually any venue. 

Travelers are even sharing TikTok videos detailing the amenities offered by a variety of airports, including private stalls and toiletries.

Others are asking why airports haven't widely adopted more wellness-focused amenities such as publicly accessible shower suites or dedicated gyms.

Frequent fliers on Reddit have also compared their experiences using lounge showers — noting that access can vary widely depending on airline status and airport.

The Trump administration recently spotlighted a $1 billion initiative for family-friendly improvements, unveiled during a pull-up event at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C.

Frequent fliers say the ability to shower between flights can make a dramatic difference on long travel days, especially after overnight routes or lengthy international connections.

Peter Shankman, a New York–based corporate keynote speaker and author, said he logs more than 250,000 miles a year.

He said travelers need to know a few things before using an airport shower for the first time.

Numerous fliers said they appreciate having a comfortable space to freshen up between connections. (iStock)

Some of the best airport shower facilities are found overseas, he said, where long flights and connections make it essential for travelers to reset between journeys.

""You've been on a plane all night, you're greasy, you're gross,"" said Shankman. ""To get a shower and let the hot water wash all the ‘plane' off you makes a world of difference.""

Many lounges now notify passengers through an app or buzzer when a shower suite is ready.

Zurich Airport is one of his top picks, he said. 

It offers private shower rooms in its lounges that allow passengers to freshen up before continuing on, he said.

Several major U.S. airport lounges, including United Polaris, American Flagship and Delta Sky Club locations, offer shower suites for travelers, according to the companies' websites. 

Programs such as Priority Pass, an independent membership initiative, provide access to lounges with shower facilities at airports around the world.

Access varies by airport and airline — but lounge membership or elite status typically offers the most reliable option. 

Some lounges sell day passes, and several international airports host independent shower or spa facilities that any traveler can pay to use.

Shankman said the process is usually straightforward. After checking into the lounge, travelers go to the shower desk, where staff assign them a room or place them on a waiting list. 

Many lounges now notify passengers through an app or buzzer when a shower suite is ready.

Most facilities provide basic toiletries such as shampoo, soap and towels — and Shankman noted that showers are generally cleaned after each use.

Still, timing matters. 

Any traveler planning to use an airport shower should head straight to the lounge after landing, as wait times can spike when several international flights arrive at once, he said.

Fox News political analyst Lisa Boothe discusses Democrats' outrage over President Donald Trump's ballroom construction during the ongoing shutdown. 

The Trump administration argued in a court filing on Monday that pausing construction on the new White House ballroom would undermine national security, citing a Secret Service declaration warning that halting work would leave the site unable to meet ""safety and security requirements"" needed to protect the president. 

The declaration says the White House's East Wing, demolished in October and now undergoing below-grade work, cannot be left unfinished without compromising essential security measures.

""Accordingly, any pause in construction, even temporarily, would leave the contractor's obligation unfulfilled in this regard and consequently hamper the Secret Service's ability to meet its statutory obligations and protective mission,"" reads the filing in part.

The government's memorandum was in response to a lawsuit filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit that says it advocates for preserving historic sites of national importance and protecting the public's role in that process.

The National Trust lawsuit targets key government officials responsible for overseeing the White House grounds and the agencies managing the construction project, including the National Park Service and the Department of the Interior.

It argues that pausing the Trump administration's ballroom project is essential to prevent irreversible changes while the required oversight and public involvement procedures are carried out.

""Submitting the project to the National Capital Planning Commission for review protects the iconic historic features of the White House campus as it evolves. Inviting comments from the American people signals respect and helps ensure a lasting legacy that befits a government of the people, by the people, for the people,"" said Carol Quillen, the president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

TRUMP UNVEILS VISION FOR EISENHOWER EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING MAKEOVER

The White House announced President Donald Trump's plans in July to move forward with a 90,000-square-foot state ballroom that would cost an estimated $200 million. That figure has now risen to at least $300 million, and while the project is backed by some private donors, Trump has also insisted it will be funded ""100% by me and some friends of mine.""

In its filing, the administration emphasized that key regulatory reviews are forthcoming, saying it plans to submit draft architectural drawings and materials to the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in the coming weeks. 

The government argued the lawsuit is premature because above-grade construction is not scheduled to begin until April 2026.

The National Trust, however, counters that the scale of the project makes early intervention necessary. In its lawsuit, the group argues that the 90,000-square-foot addition would dwarf the Executive Residence and permanently upset the classical balance of the White House's design. 

The complaint also cites an October statement from the Society of Architectural Historians, which warned that the proposed ballroom would represent the most significant exterior change to the building in more than 80 years.

NFL legend Brett Favre lamented in a recent podcast episode the culture of instant satisfaction that has been created in society as a result of the social media age.

Favre and his co-host David Kano talked on ""4th and Favre"" about the lack of loyalty in college sports with the advent of name, image and likeness deals and the transfer portal, coupled with coaches leaving schools without consequences.

Kano compared what he believed was going on in college sports with the state of society.

""I think that's more matter of opinion – what you're exposed to. There's some people who don't watch YouTube. There's some people who don't have TikTok. I am one of those,"" Favre said in response. ""Again, a matter of opinion. But I think, presently, in this world, or this country, it's about how many clicks you can get immediately. Like, what can I do to get the most followers? It's sort of like what we just talked about.

Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt reports live from Brentwood, Calif. on the arrest of Nick Reiner, son of director Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, for their murder on 'America Reports.'

From addiction struggles to violent outbursts, Rob and Michele Reiner's son, Nick, has had his share of battles throughout the years. On Monday, the 32-year-old was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder in the horrific deaths of his parents — who were found dead at their Brentwood, Calif., home on Dec. 14. 

Reiner was initially booked on $4 million bail, but records now show he is being held without bail. On Monday, he was transferred to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. 

Investigators believe Rob and Michele suffered stab wounds, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

""This is not the first time their son has been violent,"" a longtime neighbor told the New York Post. ""I know of another incident a few years back with Nick, but I won't say more than that. I just never thought it would ever get to this point.""

""Rob was always heartbroken that his son couldn't beat his addiction,"" the neighbor continued. ""I know they wanted him to get help, go to rehab, but he wanted to get help while at home — he did not want to get treatment at a facility.""

""And I know they have argued about that for years. Nick has had demons for the longest,"" they added. ""It is such a nightmare. The whole thing is a tragedy.""

Another neighbor told Fox News Digital that Nick had gone to rehab years ago, and she thought he was ""back to normal.""

""Years ago, when he was young, he was on heroin and cocaine, and he went to rehab and did well and was apparently back to normal, but obviously, that wasn't the case,"" Maryanne Lewis, who has lived in the Reiners' neighborhood for over 50 years, said. ""I heard nothing about him recently.""

Nick had been open about his struggles in the past. 

In 2015, Nick and Rob released a semi-autobiographical film titled, ""Being Charlie"" — a movie loosely based on Nick's real-life experience with addiction and recovery.

""It forced me to have to see more clearly and understand more deeply what Nick had gone through, and I think it forced him to see things that I experienced during this process,"" Rob said during a 2016 interview on BUILD, YouTube's live interview series. ""It brought us closer together.""

""The whole process, for me, made me understand him a lot more. And I think it made me a better father. Hopefully, it did. If your kid is going through a rough time, the parent, your main job is to keep your child safe. I felt at a loss.""

Nick gave an interview about ""Being Charlie"" alongside his family at the Toronto Film Festival in 2015, saying his decision to quit heroin was driven by a practical realization.

""I got sick of it. I got sick of doing that,"" he told the Times. ""I come from a nice family. I'm not supposed to be out there on the streets and in homeless shelters doing all these...things.""

During that same interview, Rob spoke candidly about how he handled his son's addiction at the time.

""When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen,"" he said. ""We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.""

""We were so influenced by these people,"" Michele added. ""They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.""

Despite their differences, the film ultimately bonded father and son. 

""To be honest, by the time we got to the point of making the movie, it didn't matter if we actually did,"" Reiner told the Times. ""Because our relationship had gotten so much closer.""

During an appearance on the ""Dopey"" podcast in 2018, Nick opened up about a time when he became violent while using meth in his parents' guest house. 

""I went 10 rounds in my guest house,"" he shared. ""It's not much of a story. I got totally spun out on uppers — I think it was coke and something else — and I was up for days on end. I started punching out some things in my guest house.""

""Everything in the guest house got wrecked,"" said Nick, who admitted there was ""no logic"" behind his outburst. 

According to TMZ, Rob and Nick allegedly got into a ""very loud argument"" while attending Conan O'Brien's Christmas party one night before the murders. 

""Nick was freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous,"" a source told People. 

A representative for O'Brien did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

A source told Page Six that Nick ""really resented his dad"" and ""hated himself for not being as talented, prolific or beloved as his dad or grandad.""

A family spokesperson initially confirmed the deaths to Variety, saying, ""It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.""

Following the initial investigation into the Reiners' homicides, authorities determined Nick was ""responsible for their deaths.""

Nick was located and arrested at approximately 9:15 p.m. Sunday. He was booked on suspicion of murder and is now being held without bail, according to the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

The case will be presented Tuesday to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the LAPD confirmed in a release.

Rob and Michele had three children together: Jake, Nick and Romy.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the Trump administration's maneuvering on Venezuela and Colombia on ‘Special Report.'

After the U.S. seized a tanker carrying Venezuelan crude oil, the shadowy fleet of ""ghost ships"" used to evade sanctions drifted squarely into President Donald Trump's crosshairs.

On Dec. 10, Trump announced the seizure of the ""Skipper,"" a vessel that secretly ferries oil in defiance of sanctions. 

The broader fleet, a clandestine armada of roughly 1,000 tankers, quietly navigates global sea routes to move oil from sanctioned countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.

The so-called ""ghost ships"" sail under foreign flags to obscure their origins, repeatedly change names, shift ownership through shell companies, disable transponders to evade tracking and conduct mid-sea transfers to mask their cargo.

The result is a labyrinthine system of handoffs and disguised voyages.

US–VENEZUELA SHOWDOWN MIGHT JOLT GAS PRICES IN THE LONG TERM

Benjamin Jensen, who heads the Futures Lab at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the challenge extends well beyond Venezuela.

""I do think it's time that the United States and other countries start to address what really is a global problem,"" explained Benjamin Jensen, director of the Futures Lab at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Jensen said the seizure sends a shock not just to Caracas, but to other actors as well. 

""What we don't know is how they're following that up behind the scenes,"" he said, adding that further seizures under Trump are possible.

With Venezuela's economy tethered almost entirely to oil revenue, he noted that even a single interdiction can have an outsized impact. 

""Anything you do that puts pressure on their ability to bypass sanctions and trade in oil is a direct threat to the economy and, by extension, the regime,"" he said. 

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signaled that the seizure of the ""Skipper"" is only the opening salvo in a new effort to cut off the oil revenues that keep Moscow, Tehran and Caracas afloat.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the vessel is ""undergoing a forfeiture process.""

""Right now, the United States currently has a full investigative team on the ground, on the vessel and individuals on board the vessel are being interviewed, and any relevant evidence is being seized,"" Leavitt said, adding that the U.S. will take hold of the oil after the legal process is completed.

The move comes as China continues to be the leading importer of Iranian oil and the second-largest buyer of Russian crude, much of it routed through a growing fleet of nondescript tankers evading U.S. sanctions.

Earlier this year, the 19-year-old crude oil tanker named ""Eventin"" was seized by German authorities after the ship suffered engine failure in the Baltic Sea. The vessel was previously identified as a ship that exports Russian crude oil and other petroleum products.

German authorities discovered that the Panama-flagged vessel, which was previously named Charvi and Storviken, was carrying 99,000 tons, or approximately $45 million worth, of Russian oil.

Former Trump economic advisor Steve Moore breaks down the impact of inflation and residual effects from the Biden administration on the American economy on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

President Donald Trump loves a good foil. For America's sake, he should find his next one in my home state of Illinois. 

Cook County — home of Chicago and most of the state's leftist lunacy — has taken the nation's furthest step toward a so-called universal basic income (UBI). Going forward, many low-income residents will permanently get monthly checks of $500. The goal is to help the poor stay on their feet, but in reality, the poor will stay poor and get more numerous. Not only should the president call out this injustice, but he should contrast it with his recent call to eliminate income taxes altogether. This may be Trump's greatest opportunity for moral and economic leadership yet. 

Make no mistake: A UBI is the left's next national priority. It's the epitome of their now-impenetrable belief that government alone should provide for people's needs. Democrats have laid the groundwork for UBI, as it's called, with refundable child tax credits during the pandemic and pilot programs across the country. The rise of artificial intelligence, with its threat of job losses, gives further momentum to leftists who say that government should give everyone enough money to get by. Even some on the right, like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have jumped aboard the UBI bandwagon.  

COOK COUNTY IN ILLINOIS ESTABLISHES PERMANENT GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM

But UBI, like so much of the welfare state, is a frontal assault on the human soul. It saps people's willingness to develop and apply their inherent talents, making poverty a permanent way of life. While activists and media outlets unfailingly call programs like Cook County's a ""success,"" real-world evidence shows their moral, economic and individual failure.

The recent pilot programs in Democratic cities caused fewer people to work. So did the refundable child tax credit. When the federal government tested an early version of UBI in the 1970s, recipients lost $5 in lifetime earnings for every taxpayer dollar they received. 

Only one word can sum up UBI: evil. It's morally wrong to steal people's drive to make the most of their life. It's inhumane to replace the ladder of opportunity with a cot. At its core, UBI encourages people to tolerate an unhappy existence instead of finding fulfillment through striving, succeeding and contributing to society. 

But as Cook County shows, UBI has political momentum. The best way to beat such a bad idea is with a better idea. A transformative idea that not only highlights the injustice, but shows a real path forward. That's where Trump comes in, especially his idea to eliminate income taxes.

The president made this comment flippantly after a Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2, saying that income taxes won't be needed because of tariff revenue. But the real case for killing income taxes is that, like UBI, they also stifle work and limit its rewards. He could frame ending income taxes as giving every American the ""universal right to earn,"" while directly contrasting it with a universal basic income.  

PROGRESSIVE CITIES GAMBLE WITH UNIVERSAL INCOME WHILE INFLATION THREAT LOOMS

Without income taxes, every American would keep every penny of what they earn, full stop. There's no greater spur to work, to innovate, to start a small business — to do all the things that move individuals and the entire nation forward. The universal right to earn would unleash a new era of growth and wealth creation, benefiting the least fortunate the most. Why? Because it taps into every person's innate desire to strive and rise. Contrast that with a universal income, which traps people in poverty.

Americans aren't used to hearing such bold vision or language from Republicans, but if any politician can make a strong case, it's Donald Trump. In fact, the president could go even further rhetorically, while still staying on firm moral grounds. At its core, taxing labor is a form of slavery, since it takes away the fruits of man's labor. The 13th Amendment banned slavery, but the 16th Amendment reinstated a sliver of it by allowing income taxes. Donald Trump could easily say: For America's 250th birthday, we should end this injustice once and for all and finally realize our national promise. 

I freely acknowledge that eliminating income taxes is a gargantuan political lift. The chances of success are miniscule. But the same was once true of a universal basic income. Now it's a fact of life in Cook County, and it will surely be Democrats' top priority the next time they control the White House and Congress. Someone has to provide an alternative vision — one that actually uplifts the poorest Americans, instead of shackling them in poverty forever. President Trump, the universal right to earn is in your hands.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

One by one, they are singing, the men who used to do dirty deeds for the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. Nobody knows what's going to happen, whether the United States will attack, and whether Maduro will fall. But these Venezuelans sniff change in the air. As more countries exit Venezuela's orbit, more allegations are likely to emerge.

Two of the men are in prison here in the U.S.: Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former spy mastermind, and Cliver Alcala Cordones, a former general, both of whom have written letters to President Donald Trump airing bales of dirty laundry regarding narco-trafficking to the U.S. A third is a top official who has defected and is cooperating with the U.S. government, to whom I spoke a couple of months ago.

Over in Bolivia, where change has already begun, information regarding that government's involvement with narco-terrorism may soon see the light of day as well. The new president, Rodrigo Paz Pereira, elected earlier this year and sworn into office last month, had his predecessor, Luis Arce, arrested on Wednesday. Many members of Arce's government may follow him into the clink, and they may soon start “cooperating” by airing dirty laundry as well.

Arce's Movement for Socialism party is every bit as socialist, as steeped in drug trafficking, and as Cuban-influenced as Chavez's and Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. They fed off each other back in the heyday of Marxism in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Even Spain, currently run by the Left, may soon start producing information. Last week, the Economic and Fiscal Crime Unit searched the offices of an airline run by people with close ties to Venezuela and Cuba, Plus Ultra. The firm is also close to former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, an anti-American socialist who advocates on behalf of Venezuela and China in Madrid.

The Venezuelan regime itself forms the Cartel de los Soles, a narco-trafficking, terrorist group that helped flood our streets with drugs. Maduro and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, in fact, lead it, something we already knew, but which Carbajal confirmed in his letter to Trump.

But the Venezuelan government, using revenues not just from narcotics but also from the world's largest oil reserves, which Venezuela owns, led not just domestic bad actors against the U.S., but the region's communist states. The ideology and deep hatred of the U.S., and the planning on how to operationalize this animus, have come from Havana, but the resources come from Caracas.

Grouped in a regional Marxist bloc called the Foro de Sao Paulo, founded by Cuba's dead dictator Fidel Castro and Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, these Marxist parties swept to power in a second wave — the first was in the early 2000s — four or five years ago in Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Brazil, etc.

Voters in Ibero-America are now bringing this era to a screeching halt, which means that many more narco-terrorist secrets will surely come out. In Chile on Sunday, Jose Antonio Kast romped to victory, defeating the communist candidate Jeannette Jara by 20 points.

Honduras, too, held elections recently, and the candidate supported by the outgoing Marxist President Xiomara Castro, Rixi Moncada, got less than 20% of the vote in elections held Nov. 30. With 99% of the vote counted in that Central American nation, the Trump-backed candidate, Nasry Asfura, has a commanding lead. Castro and her Marxist husband, Manuel Zelaya, will try everything not to hand power to a Trumpian, but they will only be inviting trouble if they do.

All these Marxist presidents who were unable to help their chosen candidates get elected, or may be about to meet the same fate, as Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, is certain to face in elections in May, came to office in our hemisphere under unusual circumstances.

This new pink tidal wave was unleashed by the seismic force of Venezuelan-organized riots in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and other South American countries between 2019 and 2022. Marxist revolutionaries emerged victorious in elections in all the countries following the riots. Most of these new governments then aided Venezuela's narco-terrorist activity.

America, too, was rocked in 2020 by nationwide riots organized by Black Lives Matter, whose leaders were close to Chavez and Maduro. According to the defector who spoke with me, at least one of them received financial assistance from Chavez.

If you pull the information together, a picture emerges of a Cuban-led plan to create disarray inside the U.S., both by flooding U.S. streets with drugs that would undermine the fiber of this country or with street mayhem. Venezuelan gangs and Colombian guerrillas carried out the plan.

Carvajal's letter, which confirms most of this, starts as an act of contrition:

“My name is Hugo Carvajal Barrios. For many years, I was a high-ranking member of the Venezuelan regime. … Today, I sit in an American prison because I voluntarily plead guilty to the crimes charged against me: a narco-terrorism conspiracy. I write to atone by telling the full truth so that the United States can protect itself from the dangers I witnessed for so many years.”

Carvajal clearly does not want to spend the rest of his days in an American prison and is seeking a better deal by revealing what he did. “Today, I see the need to address the American people about the reality of what the Venezuelan regime truly is—and why President Trump's policies are not only correct, but absolutely necessary to the United States' national security,” he wrote.

Carvajal explained that he “personally witnessed how Hugo Chavez's government became a criminal organization that is now run by Maduro, Cabello, and other senior regime officials.” The purpose of this criminal organization, “now known as the Cartel of the Suns, is to weaponize drugs against the United States,” he wrote. “The drugs that reached your cities through new routes were not accidents of corruption nor just the work of independent traffickers; they were deliberate policies coordinated by the Venezuelan regime against the United States.”

This plan, he wrote, “was suggested by the Cuban regime to Chávez in the mid-2000s.” It was “successfully executed with help from FARC, ELN, Cuban operatives, and Hezbollah,” he wrote of the Narco-Marxist guerrilla groups in next-door Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army. The Venezuelan regime, Carvajal wrote, “has provided weapons, passports, and impunity for these terrorist organizations to operate freely from Venezuela against the United States.”

Then Carvajal let dangle that he could furnish more information: “U.S. diplomats and CIA officers were paid to assist Chávez and Maduro in remaining in power. These Americans acted as spies for Cuba and Venezuela, and some remain active to this day.”

The letter by Alcala Cordones, dated Dec. 8 and revealed by Venezuelan investigative journalist Maibort Petit, confirms most of the information contained in Carvajal's own missive.

Alcala Cordones is the highest Venezuelan military leader behind bars in the U.S. He is serving a 21-year sentence after admitting to being a member of the Cartel of the Suns and collaborating with the FARC to smuggle weapons, including grenade launchers, and cocaine into the U.S.

He fingers Maduro as the man in charge of international relations, especially with Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, and Cabello as the leader who maintains armed protection for the smuggling networks, but he says that the Cartel of the Suns is run by Executive Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and her brother, Jorge Rodriguez. The letter details the evolution of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua into a transnational organization with operatives in U.S. streets and the role of Cuban intelligence.

The “current supreme core of Venezuelan power,” Maduro, Cabello and the Rodriguezes, according to the letter, has ties with U.S. congressmen who were left unnamed. It closes with this warning: “The regime run by Maduro and Cabello represents a threat to the national security of the United States.”

Whether this emerging picture provides a casus belli for Washington to act against Maduro by hitting targets inside Venezuela is unclear. The U.S. has been bombing boats coming out of Venezuela that it says are carrying drugs headed for the U.S.

But in a way, nothing here is new. In October 2019, Cabello already put the world on notice that Venezuela's regime would destabilize our hemisphere. “We are headed towards a Bolivarian hurricane,” Cabello warned. “It cannot be stopped by absolutely anyone. What is happening in Peru, what is happening in Chile, what is happening in Argentina, what is happening in Honduras, in Ecuador is just a little breeze. A hurricane is what is to come. It is absolutely impossible that Colombia remains how it is. It is absolutely impossible that Brazil remains how it is. There is no way.”

WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE BROWN SHOOTING

While all the media attention here has been devoted to whether War Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to shoot at one of these boats a second time, the so-called double tap, while some survivors were still swimming in the Caribbean, less attention has been paid to the singing Venezuelans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","House barrels toward Obamacare expiration with bipartisan deal unlikely","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3918906/house-obamacare-subsidies-expiration-no-bipartisan-ground/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

House Democrats and Republicans are hurtling toward the New Year's expiration of Obamacare subsidies but both have decided doing nothing is better than reaching a deal.

The House will vote this week on the GOP legislation, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, which combines elements of other bills that have previously passed. But it is merely intended to display Republican willingness to act and is highly unlikely to become law before subsidies expire on Dec. 31.

The parties have fought over healthcare since Democrats put it front and center during the government shutdown. Neither supports the other's demands, bringing Congress to an impasse.

Democratic leaders have issued a scathing rebuke of the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, calling it “unserious,” which signals they will not encourage their caucus to vote for the bill. Meanwhile, Republican leaders have stated they do not support Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries's (D-NY) three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies, instead arguing that their bill will provide “clear, responsible alternatives” to lower healthcare costs.

Bipartisanship appeared to be on the horizon last week, after centrist Republicans and leadership worked out a deal to amend the legislation and extend the Obamacare subsidies for two years with some reforms. GOP leadership aides told reporters Friday that they expected a vote on an amendment to extend the Obamacare subsidies to come this week.

But that bipartisanship appears to be short-lived as the deal between leaders and GOP members led by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) is allegedly falling apart due to leadership arguing that members would need to find healthcare offsets to pay for the extension, according to multiple reports. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told reporters Monday that a final decision had not yet been made on whether an amendment would be allowed on renewing the subsidies.If leadership and rank-and-file members cannot come to an agreement, the centrist lawmakers will have to find their own way to get a vote to extend the tax credits. To do so, they will have to present a version similar to Fitzpatrick's bill to the House Rules Committee, offering it as an amendment to extend the subsidies by two years.

Given that the Rules Committee is largely a cudgel of leadership and has conservatives such as Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC), it is unlikely their proposal will pass.

This could push lawmakers to a crossroads. Given that 12 Republicans have signed Fitzpatrick's discharge petition, and 11 Republicans have joined the petition led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), there are a few options for the GOP.

One option for Democrats is to band together and join either of the discharge petitions. Doing so would force a vote on a bill to extend the subsidies in some shape or form. Gottheimer's extends the Obamacare subsidies for one year and sets up for a vote on a longer extension or reform process in the second year.

If all Democrats signed one of the petitions, it would be enough to reach the 218-signature threshold. But leaders have dragged their feet on wholeheartedly endorsing either petition, including the one led by their own Democratic caucus member.

Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement Saturday that anything less than a clean three-year extension of the subsidies is a “waste of time.” On Monday, Jeffries said he reviewed the discharge petitions.

“We have a position: a straight three-year extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the minority leader said.

He dodged repeated questions on whether he would explicitly tell his caucus not to sign the discharge petitions.

Rep. Greg Landsman (D-OH) predicted that “anything” that extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies will “ultimately get enough support,” if it's able to make it on the schedule or through the Rules Committee for a vote.

“For me, it is, and has always been, about the 32,000 people in my district that need us to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies,” Landsman told the Washington Examiner. “So I'm supporting any and every attempt to do that, because they come first.”

Another option for centrist Republicans is to join Jeffries's three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies. All Democrats have signed Jeffries's discharge petition, so only four Republicans are needed to reach the 218 threshold.

“We are going to continue to reach our hand out and say, ‘Come join us. Four of you, who seem to now be very concerned about what is happening in their communities as they see their political numbers failing.' …The [American people] deserve so much better than what they are getting from this Republican Party,” House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) said.

However, centrist Republicans, although they favor a smaller extension of the tax credits, are not budging on signing the three-year extension at this time and say it is up to Democratic leadership to make a move.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), who has signed both Fitzpatrick and Gottheimer's petitions, said he is not supportive of a blanket, three-year extension.

“I don't like it,” Bacon said, arguing some of the provisions of the subsidies are “very wasteful.”

“Why should somebody earning $600,000 get these tax credits, and why do we want a third of all the tax credit money, not go to individuals' premiums? That's what's going on right now. … I think Hakeem Jeffries and his team should get on one of the two discharges we have, because we deal with both those issues,” Bacon added.

“So if we're going to do an extension, it's got to be a reform plan.”

Lawler said he thinks Democrats are wavering in their support for the petitions for political reasons.

“We have two discharges that already have more than enough Republican signatures on them, and that's really up to the Democratic leadership, whether or not they truly want an extension or they want the issue,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) told reporters Monday. “Based on many comments they've made, certainly internally, they seem to want the issue, not the actual extension.”

A three-year extension, proposed by Democrats, and a competing Republican proposal failed last week in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said Monday that there is not enough support to have a “straight-up extension” of the tax credits without some significant reforms, essentially putting Capitol Hill at a standstill.

“So how is it an option when it can't get through the Senate?” Lawler asked.

Wednesday's House vote comes as a bipartisan group of senators makes a last-ditch attempt to negotiate a subsidy extension. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bernie Moreno (R-OH), both of whom support a two-year subsidy extension with reforms, organized a Monday evening meeting with a large, ideologically diverse group of senators to discuss what a Senate deal might look like.

HERE'S WHY HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE INCREASINGLY BUCKING LEADERSHIP BY FORCING VOTES ON UNAPPROVED BILLS

Leaving the meeting, senators conceded that reaching a deal before the end of the year would be difficult. Still, they described their conversations as a step in the right direction, following the Senate's failure last week to pass a Democratic-backed extension.

“It seems like the calendar precludes getting something done this week,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the author of a competing GOP bill that lets the subsidies lapse. “But still, a commitment to work together is a lot of progress.”

HEGSETH ‘ESCALATES' FEUD WITH KELLY: It's unclear if the Navy's review of Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) resulted in any recommendation for court martial or administrative discipline for what War Secretary Pete Hegseth deemed “seditious” speech. Hegseth is taking his campaign to punish the retired Navy captain and astronaut to the next level — an ‘official command investigation.'”

While the video message Kelly and five fellow Democrats posted on social media last month reminded U.S. military members of their duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to “refuse illegal orders,” Hegeth and President Donald Trump said because it was not clear what orders they were referencing, the message amounted to a call for troops to on their own volition to disobey any orders they didn't like.

Under Article 94 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, it is also a crime for members of the military to “overthrow lawful authority or hinder military success.” In announcing the Pentagon's general counsel was “escalating the preliminary review,” the department said, “Kelly is currently under investigation for serious allegations of misconduct.”

PENTAGON ESCALATES MARK KELLY ‘MISCONDUCT' REVIEW AS SENATOR'S ATTORNEY THREATENS LEGAL ACTION

KELLY: ‘IT SHOULD SEND A SHIVER DOWN THE SPINE OF EVERY PATRIOTIC AMERICAN': In a response posted on X, Kelly accused Trump and Hegseth of an abuse of power in an attempt to silence their critics that “should send a shiver down the spine of every patriotic American.”

“It wasn't enough for Pete Hegseth to threaten me with a court-martial. Now they are threatening everything I fought and served for across twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy — all because I repeated something every service member is taught,” Kelly said. “The United States has the most professional military in the world – I trust their integrity. What I don't trust is Pete Hegseth, a recklessly unqualified secretary of defense who has already shown he will corrupt any process to make an example out of me.”

“If Trump and Hegseth think this will stop me from doing what I've done every day of my adult life – fighting for this country – then they've got the wrong guy.”

Meanwhile, Kelly says he has yet to receive any official word about any investigation. His only knowledge comes from social media posts and news reports. “They call it a command investigation. I spent 25 years in the United States Navy. I was in many commands. I retired from the Navy, you know, 14 years ago. I'm not in any command now. I don't know what they're talking about,” Kelly said on CNN last night.

THE LAWYERS WEIGH IN: Kelly has retained legal counsel, and his lawyer, Paul Fishman, of Arnold and Porter, fired off a letter to the Navy yesterday before the announcement of the “escalation” was announced.

“To be clear: there is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” Fishman wrote. “If the Executive Branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly's behalf to halt the Administration's unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”

Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are scheduled to provide another briefing for senators today as Democrats and some legal experts are questioning the legality of the strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

“You know, maybe at that point he's [Hegseth] going to come up to me and, you know, say something officially, because I haven't heard anything.”

Last month, a group of former military lawyers, JAGs or Judges Advocates General, wrote an open letter calling the “intentional targeting of anyone – enemy combatants, non-combatants, or civilians – rendered hors de combat (out of the fight),” a potential war crime.

“Since orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,' anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both,” they wrote.

TRUMP: ‘WE'RE CLOSER NOW THAN WE HAVE BEEN EVER': President Donald Trump continued to express optimism that prospects for a peace deal to permanently end the fight in Ukraine are looking up.

“We're trying to get it done. And I think we're closer now,” Trump told reporters at the White House yesterday. “And I think we're closer now than we have been ever.”

But while Russia has yet to soften any of its demands, including that Ukraine give territory that Russia has been unable to take by force, Trump continues to blame both sides for intransigence.

“At this moment, Russia wants to get it ended. The problem is they'll want to get it ended and then all of a sudden they won't, and Ukraine will want to get it ended and all of a sudden they won't. So we have to get them on the same page,” Trump said. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been adamant that Ukraine will not relinquish parts of the eastern Donbas region it currently holds, and that any ceasefire would have to freeze the battleline in its current status.

US CLAIMS 90% OF OBSTACLES TO RUSSIA-UKRAINE AGREEMENT SOLVED IN GERMANY TALKS

U.S. SECURITY GUARANTEES: In return for taking NATO membership off the table, Zelensky is insisting on ironclad, congressionally ratified security guarantees from the United States to ensure Russia doesn't restart the war in the future.

“Before taking any steps on the battlefield, both the military and the civilian population must have a clear understanding of what the security guarantees will be,” Zelensky said yesterday. “We are working on putting all of this on paper right now, and there is progress. The details developed by the military part looks quite solid, even though this is only the first draft.”

Asked about what the U.S. is actually offering in terms of an “Article 5-style” guarantee, Trump said, “In terms of security guarantee, we're working with Europe on it.”

“Europe would be a big part of that. And we're working on the security guarantee so the war doesn't start up again. We don't want to have a war start up again,” Trump said.

Asked if there was a time limit on guarantees, Trump said, “The time limit is whenever we get it done. I mean, we're going to try to get it done. We're making progress. It's more difficult than anybody could have thought.”

GOODBYE CENTCOM AND EUCOM, HELLO AMERICOM AND INTERCOM: The Washington Post is reporting this morning that senior Pentagon leaders are considering a radical reorganization of the U.S. military combatant command structure that would combine the U.S. Northern and Southern Command into the U.S. Americas Command, or AMERICOM. Similarly, the U.S., European, Central, and African commands would be merged into a unified U.S. International Command, or INTERCOM.

The plan, which the Post says will be briefed to War Secretary Pete Hegseth by Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, is said to be “predecisional,” and would reduce the number of combatant commands from 11 to eight.

“If adopted, the plan would usher in some of the most significant changes at the military's highest ranks in decades, in part following through on Hegseth's promise to break the status quo and slash the number of four-star generals in the military,” the report says. “Those familiar with the plan said it aligns with the Trump administration's national security strategy, released this month, which declares that the ‘days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Longest Suicide Note in American History","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/national-security-strategy-democracy/685270/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The Trump administration's new National Security Strategy targets liberal democracy itself.

Last year, a team of American diplomats from the State Department's Global Engagement Center traveled to two dozen countries and signed a series of memoranda. Along with their counterparts in places as varied as Italy, Australia, and Ivory Coast, they agreed to jointly expose malicious and deceptive online campaigns originating in Russia, China, or Iran.

This past September, the Trump administration terminated these agreements. The center's former head, James Rubin, called this decision “a unilateral act of disarmament,” and no wonder: In effect, the United States was declaring that it would no longer oppose Russian influence campaigns, Chinese manipulation of local politics, or Iranian extremist recruitment drives. Nor would the American government use any resources to help anyone else do so either.

The recent publication of the Trump administration's new National Security Strategy showed that this decision was no accident. Unilateral disarmament is now official policy. Because—despite its name—this National Security Strategy is not really a strategy document. It is a suicide note. If the ideas within it are really used to shape policy, then U.S. influence in the world will rapidly disappear, and America's ability to defend itself and its allies will diminish. The consequences will be economic as well as political, and they will be felt by all Americans.

Before explaining, I should acknowledge the curious features of this document, which seems, like the Bible, to have several different authors. Some of them use boastful, aggressive language—America must remain “the world's strongest, richest, most powerful country for decades to come”—and some of them prefer euphemism and allusion. Sometimes these different authors contradict one another, proposing to work with allies on one page and to undermine allies on the next. The views expressed in the document do not represent those of the entire U.S. government, the entire Republican Party, or even the entire Trump administration. The most noteworthy elements seem to come from a particular ideological faction, one that now dominates foreign-policy thinking in this administration and may well dominate others in the future.

The one genuinely new, truly radical element in this faction's thinking is its absolute refusal to acknowledge the existence of enemies or to name any countries that might wish America ill. This is a major departure from the first Trump administration. The 2017 National Security Strategy spoke of creating an alliance against North Korea; noted that Russia is “using subversive measures to weaken the credibility of America's commitment to Europe, undermine transatlantic unity, and weaken European institutions and governments”; and observed that China is “using economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats” to bully others. The 2017 Trump policy team also observed a “geopolitical competition between free and repressive visions of world order.”

The second Trump administration can no longer identify any specific countries that might wish harm to the United States, or any specific actions they might be taking to do harm. A decade's worth of Russian cyberwarfare, political intervention, and information war inside the United States goes unmentioned. Russian acts of sabotage across Europe, Russian support for brutal regimes across the Sahel region of Africa, and, of course, Russia's invasion of Ukraine aren't important either. None of these Russian acts of aggression gets a mention except for the war in Ukraine, which is described solely as a concern for Europeans.

Phillips Payson O'Brien: A wider war has already started in Europe

Even more strangely, China appears not as a geopolitical competitor but largely as a trading rival. It's as if Chinese hacking and cyberwar did not exist, as if China were not seeking to collect data or infiltrate the software that controls U.S. infrastructure. China's propaganda campaigns and business deals in Africa and Latin America, which could squeeze out American rivals, don't seem to matter much either. The new document makes only a vague allusion to a Chinese economic presence in Latin America and to a Chinese threat to Taiwan. When discussing this latter possibility, the authors drop their swaggering language about American power and slip into bureaucratese: “The United States does not support any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.”

Other rivals and other potential sources of conflict get no mention at all. North Korea has disappeared. Iran is described as “greatly weakened.” Islamist terrorism is no longer worth mentioning. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still “thorny,” but thanks to President Donald Trump, “progress toward a more permanent peace has been made.” Hamas will soon fade away. The American troops who are still fighting in Somalia and Syria—and in some cases dying—are ignored, as if they didn't exist at all.

But if America has no rivals and expects no conflicts, then neither the military nor the State Department nor the CIA nor the counterintelligence division of the FBI needs to make any special preparations to defend Americans from them. The document reflects that assumption and instead directs the U.S. national-security apparatus to think about “control over our borders,” “natural disasters,” “unfair trading practices,” “job destruction and deindustrialization,” and other threats to trade. Fentanyl gets a mention. So, rather strangely, do “propaganda, influence operations, and other forms of cultural subversion”—although there is no indication of who might be using propaganda and cultural subversion against us or how it might be countered, especially because the Trump administration has completely dismantled all of the institutions designed to do so.

But what if this document was not written for the people and institutions that think about national security at all? Maybe it was instead written for a highly ideological domestic audience, including the audience in the Oval Office. The authors have included ludicrous but now-familiar language about Trump having ended many wars, a set of claims as absurd and fanciful as his FIFA Peace Prize. The authors also go out of their way to dismiss all past American foreign-policy strategies, presumably including those pursued by the first Trump administration, as if only this administration, under this near-octogenarian president, can see the world clearly.

Finally, although they do not name any states that might threaten America, the authors do focus on one enemy ideology. It is not Chinese communism, Russian autocracy, or Islamic extremism but rather European liberal democracy. This is what this radical faction really fears: people who talk about transparency, accountability, civil rights, and the rule of law. Not coincidentally, these are the same people whom the MAGA ideologues hate and dislike at home, the same people who are fighting to prevent MAGA from redefining the United States as a white ethnostate, who oppose the corruption of America's democratic institutions, and who object when Trump's friends, family, and tech allies redirect U.S. foreign policy to benefit their private interests.

European and American liberal democracy is so dangerous to their project, in fact, that the MAGA ideologues seem to be planning to undermine it. They don't want to meddle in anyone's internal politics anywhere else on the planet: “We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change.” The glaring exception to this rule is in Europe. Here, it is now American policy to “help Europe correct its current trajectory,” language that implies that the U.S. will intervene to do so.

Eliot A. Cohen: Trump's security strategy is incoherent babble

According to reporting by Defense One, an earlier version of the National Security Strategy said that U.S. foreign policy should even seek to support illiberal forces in at least four countries—Hungary, Poland, Italy, and Austria—to persuade them to leave the European Union. For all four, this would be an economic catastrophe; for the rest of the continent, this would be a security catastrophe, because a damaged EU would struggle to counter Russian hybrid warfare and Chinese economic pressure. If the union breaks up, there would also no longer be a European Commission capable of regulating American tech companies, and perhaps that is the point.

At the same time, the document's authors seem to derive their hatred of Europe from a series of false perceptions—or, perhaps, from a form of projection. The authors fear, for example, that “certain NATO members will become majority non-European” very soon. Because they are presumably not talking about non-European Turkey and Canada, the clear implication is that countries such as France and Germany have so much immigration from outside Europe that they will be majority nonwhite. And yet, it is the United States, not Europe, that is far more likely to become “majority minority” in the coming years.

The security strategy also talks, bizarrely, about Europe being on the verge of “civilizational erasure,” which is not language used by many European politicians, even those in far-right parties. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister, has called this sentiment “to the right of the extreme right.” In multiple indices, after all—health, happiness, standard of living—European countries regularly rank higher than the United States. Compared with Americans, Europeans live longer, are less likely to be living on the streets, and are less likely to die in mass shootings.

The only possible conclusion: The authors of this document don't know much about Europe, or don't care to find out. Living in a fantasy world, they are blind to real dangers. They invent fictional threats. Their information comes from conspiracist websites and random accounts on X, and if they use these fictions to run policy, then all kinds of disasters could await us. Will our military really stop working with allies with whom we have cooperated for decades? Will the FBI stop looking for Russian and Chinese spies? Earlier this month, the Justice Department announced that it was taking action against two Russian state-sponsored cybercriminal groups that, among other things, targeted American industrial infrastructure. But if our real enemy is “civilizational erasure” in Europe, then surely we should redirect resources away from this kind of secondary problem and focus them on the threat posed by the British Labour Party or the German Christian Democrats.

One is tempted to laugh at these kinds of ideas, to express incredulity or turn away. But similar conspiracist thinking has already done real damage to real institutions. Elon Musk believed distorted or completely false stories about USAID that he read on his own X platform. As a result, he destroyed the entire organization so rapidly and so thoughtlessly that tens or even hundreds of thousands of people may die as a result. At the State Department, Darren Beattie, the undersecretary for public diplomacy, has repeatedly and falsely stated that the Global Engagement Center was censoring Americans, a fantasy that he encountered on the internet and that he continues to repeat without proof. As a result, he destroyed that organization and ended its international negotiations. He is now conducting an internal departmental witch hunt, trying to find or perhaps invent post hoc evidence for his conspiracist ideas.

Charlie Warzel: Everything is the ‘Twitter Files' now

Some elements of this story are familiar. Americans have overestimated, underestimated, or misunderstood their rivals before. And when they do, they make terrible mistakes. In 2003, many American analysts sincerely thought that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. During the Cold War, many analysts believed that the Soviet Union was stronger and less fragile than it proved to be. But I am not sure whether there has ever been a moment like this one, when the American government's most prominent foreign-policy theorists have transferred their domestic obsessions to the outside world, projecting their own fears onto others. As a result, they are likely to misunderstand who could challenge, threaten, or even damage the United States in the near future. Their fantasy world endangers us all.

Your support goes further this holiday season. When you buy an annual membership or give a one-time contribution, we'll give a membership to someone who can't afford access. It's a simple way for you to support Vox's journalism and share it with someone who needs it

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

The world is on the precipice of a technological revolution. But how much disruption can a society take?

When it comes to artificial intelligence, few fears loom larger than the idea of robots coming to take our jobs. But if you talk to the AI evangelists among us, that could be a good thing.

Not in the Elon Musk robots-will-babysit-your-kids way, but in a way that helps us make better use of our resources and handles our busy-work. If the doom doesn't come to fruition — and that is a big if — we could get the one thing there never seems to be enough of: time.

There's actually a name for this best-case scenario: AI abundance.

Here's how Anton Korinek — an economics professor at the University of Virginia and one of Vox's 2024 Future Perfect 50 — recently explained the idea to the host of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast: “AI abundance essentially carries the notion that we could all be so much more wealthier than we can even imagine today…AI and robots will be able to produce a lot more goods and services than when we have in today's economy, and would make us an order of magnitude wealthier and better off.”

But what would a world without work look like? And what would need to happen for AI to free us from work and provide everyone with a good, universal living standard? We discuss that on the latest episode of Explain It to Me. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Korinek, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

We keep hearing that a change of this scale is unprecedented. Is that true or is it hype?

I think it's the first time of this particular nature, but if you want to go into history and look for any parallels, I think the closest parallel would be the Industrial Revolution. So you would have to go back some 250 years for anything that comes even close to what we are about to experience this time.

What can the Industrial Revolution teach us about this particular moment?

From a big-picture economic perspective, you can say work as we have it today didn't even really exist before the Industrial Revolution. Because before then, the most important factor of production was the land that people worked in order to produce the food that they needed. Then all of the sudden you had these new technologies that didn't rely so much on land as they relied on machines. It started with spinning and weaving in the textile sector, but then soon we had the steam engine and electricity.

The new thing that you needed to produce — in addition to the labor that people had to put in — were machines that you could easily copy and reproduce. That meant that there was nothing holding back production. And that meant that we could suddenly produce a lot more because that bottleneck of land was overcome. In some sense, you can say that's the main reason why today people in advanced economies are something like 20 times richer, on average, than they were before the Industrial Revolution.

What did that mean for workers at the time? I imagine that transition wasn't easy. 

It was actually quite disruptive. If you were an artisan weaver or something like that, if you were a skilled professional doing your trade, then all of a sudden you had these machines coming along that could do what you were doing, but at an order of magnitude cheaper.

So those artisans lost their livelihood essentially overnight, and they were impoverished. But looking at the positive side, their descendants lived in a world where they had cheap textiles and soon all other kinds of cheap industrial goods, and they lived to be much wealthier than their artisan parents or grandparents who lost their job in the first wave of the Industrial Revolution.

This can be hugely disruptive and painful for the individual. But if we have a little bit of social protection, we can mitigate the disruption and we can make sure that in the end everybody actually benefits. Now, if there is a lot of disruption all at once, then it may become a lot harder.

There are people now who lived through another, more recent technology disruption: I'm thinking about the ‘80s and ‘90s with computers.

In some ways, the way that I see the Industrial Revolution is that it first consisted of building machines that could automate a lot of our physical strength. And then since roughly the middle of the 20th century, we created machines that could automate cognitive tasks: computers.

Those first computers could only perform highly routinized things like adding up numbers in a spreadsheet, and that was very useful for businesses. We are seeing that AI can perform more and more of the complex, really thoughtful cognitive tasks. So the big question is where will this stop? And will they leave anything for us?

You talked about land being the bottleneck during the time of the Industrial Revolution. Do we have a bottleneck now? 

I would say the most valuable resource in our economy today is our human capital. It is you and me and everybody [reading] this. Because if we can have more workers, then we can increase the amount that the economy is producing. We may enter a world where they can just press a button and have one more AI worker perform work on their behalf and essentially expand our economic opportunities.

When it comes to the AI revolution, is this something that's going to benefit our grandkids more than us?

I very much hope that we can all benefit. But whether or not that's going to happen is a story that is yet to be written, and it's going to be challenging.

At first, there will be small sectors where people are losing out, and then there's going to be a debate, “Well, why should we help them? We didn't help other workers in previous technological revolutions that much.” Then, eventually, most people will be affected by this. But it's not going to happen overnight. It's going be a somewhat slow process.

We work to get a paycheck. In a future where we don't work anymore, how do we eat? How do we get health insurance? How do we pay for a place to live? 

That's going to be the most important and also the most fundamental challenge to our current system. In some sense, you can say the Industrial Revolution accidentally created a system where our labor became more and more and more valuable because we were so scarce. That has kind of underpinned all this material progress, all this increase in wellbeing that we have seen over the past 250 years.

But once the AI revolution really hits, there is no guarantee that we can earn a decent living based on the value of our labor anymore. I do believe that we are going to need a new system of income distribution at that point. For example, Universal Basic Income, compute allotments: everybody essentially gets a certain amount of computational power allocated that they can then either use or sell off. People are also talking about job guarantees. There's a whole range of options out there from a big picture perspective.

The primary concern has to be that we'll find some solution because if labor does get significantly devalued by this technological change and at the same time we have much more abundance in the economy, it would be such a failure if we don't use that additional abundance to make sure that nobody's left behind.

And it's his own fault.

If you want to understand how the US government works today, you should study President Donald Trump's attempt to pardon a woman named Tina Peters last week.

Peters is a former Colorado election clerk and a die-hard believer in the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. In 2021, Peters committed a series of crimes in an attempt to “prove” election fraud occurred — including, most seriously, allowing a fellow 2020 truther to make copies of the actual hard drives of Mesa County voting machines. A Colorado jury convicted her of seven crimes last year, and a judge sentenced her to nine years in prison.

Last Thursday, Trump intervened on Peters's behalf, declaring he was “granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election.” On its face, this is menacingly authoritarian: the president abusing his powers to protect a woman who literally compromised the integrity of America's vote-counting on his behalf.

Yet, Trump's order is also something else: impotent.

The Constitution explicitly states that the presidential pardon power only applies to crimes committed “against the United States,” meaning federal rather than state crimes. Peters was convicted in a Colorado court under state law, and, thus, cannot be pardoned by the president. The state's governor, attorney general, and secretary of state have all rejected the legality of Trump's order; Peters remains incarcerated.

Trump's actions were reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as a “symbolic” pardon. But that framing gives Trump too much credit. If you read his full post on Truth Social, there's no indication that this is anything but a genuine attempt to do something clearly illegal. He genuinely seems to think that he can pardon her for state crimes, even though he very obviously cannot.

The Peters case represents an especially clear example of what I've come to see as the defining style of the second Trump administration: an incompetent form of authoritarianism that can best be described as “haphazardism.”

Haphazardism is authoritarianism without vision, a governing style defined by a series of individual attacks on democracy without any kind of overarching logic, strategic structure, or clear end state in mind. These attacks can do (and indeed have done) real damage to the American political system, but they are often poorly executed and even self-undermining — preventing Trump from ruling in the truly unconstrained manner he seems to desire.

“Is he succeeding at breaking democracy? Yes,” said Steve Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and author of How Democracies Die. “Is he succeeding at consolidating autocratic power? No.”

Haphazardism, as a concept, helps us understand Trump's dangers to democracy in a more nuanced and precise way. And it can also help us see, after almost a year of Trump's second presidency, where things might stand when he leaves power for good.

Donald Trump, like many of history's villains, has extraordinary political talents. His authoritarian menace stems from these talents being married to a deep, primal lust for power — a desire to wield full authority over others without constraint or restriction. In his first term, these impulses were checked by a coterie of advisers who saw restraining him as part of their job description. This time, there are no guardrails.

Yet, at the same time, Trump is an impulsive man with little understanding of the actual levers of policy and administration. His statements on the topics are marked with intentional lies, to be sure, but also feature seemingly genuine (and profound) misunderstandings about basic issues, such as how trade deficits work. He is also showing signs of age, with fewer public appearances and a noticeably compressed daily schedule. The advisers who step up to shape policy are not always the most competent, and sometimes have agendas of their own that clash with both Trump's public statement and their fellow aides' agendas.

Haphazardism emerges from the interaction of these dynamics.

On the one hand, unbound Trump is pushing the limits of his authority in ways that often directly threaten pillars of the democratic system. Trump has unilaterally asserted extraordinary powers, like the ability to direct revenue and levy tariffs, that are explicitly reserved for Congress. He has attempted to prosecute his political enemies, undermine the fairness of the midterm elections, bully corporations and universities, and hand control over increasingly large swaths of the media to friends.

In many of these areas, he really has been able to change policy in unprecedented ways. The closure of USAID, the unbalanced “deal” with Columbia University, convincing Texas to enact an extreme gerrymander, and pressuring Paramount into selling to a Trump-aligned billionaire family — these are all examples of real victories for Trump's effort to assert more personal control over American governance and society.

On the other hand, this list of authoritarian successes is counterbalanced by meaningful failures. Consider three developments from the past week alone:

These three failures all share something in common: the administration attempting to grab power without a real theory for overcoming the constraints in their way.

They did not understand the historic independence and small-c conservatism of Indiana's Republican Party. They attempted to push through obviously political charges against James, heedless of how a jury might react. They didn't care how illegal Habba's appointment was.

These failures reflect more than mere misjudgments or technical incompetence. Rather, they reveal a White House trying to act on the president's incoherent, often impossible desires. Trump personally wanted Republicans around the country to do extreme gerrymandering. He publicly demanded that the Justice Department prosecute James (and other enemies like James Comey). He wanted Habba installed in a key prosecutorial role.

Trump's desires here do not reflect a coherent view of how to take over the American state. Rather, they reflect particular cases where the president wants maximal power or personal control without any deeper understanding of whether his desires are feasible or strategically wise. Trump's aides and lawyers have little choice but to act on the boss's desires and are often set up to fail.

This is the central way that haphazardism manifests: the sheer inconsistency or short-sightedness of Trump's personal judgment leading to authoritarian setbacks. It's a pattern that has repeated throughout the Trump presidency and produced some of its most notable and enduring failures.

The most important example is the “Liberation Day” tariffs. In that case, Trump's personal obsession led him to assert extraordinary powers — to raise a tax seemingly at will — that would amount to a shocking revision of the constitutional order. On paper, that looks like a win for a president who wants to grab greater and greater personal power over the economy.

But, in the long run, the tariffs have done far more harm to Trump than good. They have been immensely unpopular and done damage to the real economy, both of which have fueled Democratic election gains and made it harder to convince others in society that resistance is futile. Moreover, they seem very likely to be overturned by the Supreme Court, meaning that Trump's temporary gains for executive power will likely prove ephemeral.

Or, consider another example: the attempted takedown of Jimmy Kimmel in September.

In that case, FCC chair Brendan Carr was clearly attempting to act on Trump's broadly stated desire to stop Kimmel. His chosen mechanism for doing that, making mafioso-like threats to network licenses during an appearance on a right-wing podcast, was extremely threatening to democracy. The government was overtly weaponizing its regulatory powers to punish a critic of the president!

But Carr's actions were also self-defeatingly blunt. The obvious threat to free speech created a massive backlash, including a mass citizen-led drive to cancel Disney+ subscriptions. ABC-Disney ultimately had no choice but to reinstate Kimmel, and he remains on the air today. The short-term attempted power grab ended in long-term failure.

Finally, consider a third example: the purging of the civil service.

While the Trump team's actions here have no doubt removed bureaucrats who might oppose his agenda from within, they've also pushed out untold numbers of talented individuals with irreplaceable knowledge of how government actually works. This doesn't only damage the functioning of the US state; it also makes it harder for the Trump administration, specifically, to turn their desires into effective policies.

“A breakdown in state capacity — what the US is capable of doing — is very bad. And paradoxically…that may be the thing that is saving democracy,” says Oren Samet, a political scientist at Stanford University.

Haphazardism is, by its nature, a very confusing style of governance. It is one in which traditional rules of democratic politics, like the rule of law, no longer fully bind the chief executive. Yet, at the same time, that chief executive is not using the powers he is accumulating in any kind of effective or coherent way — leading not only to poor policy but also a failure to systematically prevent meaningful political competition from the opposition.

So, is the United States under Trump's haphazardism a democracy or an authoritarian state?

Harvard's Levitsky is one of the leading voices arguing that America is already living under a form of authoritarianism. Indeed, he published a new piece with frequent coauthors Dan Ziblatt and Lucan Way making this case just last week.

Yet, when I spoke to Levitsky on the phone, he distinguished between an authoritarian government and an authoritarian regime. The former refers to the way in which the people in power are ruling at the present moment; the latter refers to whether they are taking steps to permanently change the political system into something in which they and their allies can hold power indefinitely.

For Levitsky, Trump's “systematic and regular abuse of power” is enough to establish that America currently has an authoritarian government. But, he does not believe that we are living under an authoritarian regime — believing that Trump's authoritarian actions were likely to be “reversed” in the near future. He, thus, characterizes the current American situation as most likely to be a “mild and short-lived burst of authoritarianism” (with the major caveat that even “mild” authoritarianism is still quite dangerous).

Unlike Levitsky, I think that it's still more accurate to call the United States a democracy. I have a hard time describing a country that still has reasonably free and fair elections, in which the incumbent party loses and departs office, as anything but.

But, that's not really a substantive disagreement so much as it is a difference in emphasis. We agree on the basic haphazardist account of the Trump presidency — that it is taking authoritarian actions without effectively changing the operating logic of the system to sustain an unfair lock on political power. Whether you call such a situation “authoritarian” or “democratic” depends on whether you put more weight on current governance or regime fundamentals.

Laura Gamboa, a professor at Notre Dame who studies democratic backsliding in Latin America, says this unclarity is relatively typical of periods of political transformation. When a democracy is under serious attack, she says, there is often “muddiness and contention.” We just might not be able to know what the most precise characterization of the country's politics is for years.

Ultimately, however, these tricky categorization questions are less important than the question of America's political trajectory, which is whether democracy is likely to survive (or rebound from) his second term. And on that score, Trump's haphazardism gives us some reasons for hope.

While 2025 has been an undeniably bad year for American democracy, the haphazardist pattern that has emerged shows that Trump's authoritarian project may be self-limiting.

Amid the fevered climate following Charlie Kirk's shooting, there was a clear and plausible pathway the Trump administration could have taken to create authoritarian change — one that centered on using federal regulatory and prosecutorial powers to repress their enemies. But, in the following months, the administration's haphazardism has made it very difficult for them to go down this road in any kind of straightforward manner. There hasn't been a single-minded focus on repression, and the efforts they have made — like the prosecutions of Comey and James — have run up against major barriers.

This, as both Levitsky and Gamboa pointed out, reflects how hard it is to change a country like the United States. In a country like the United States, with such a long democratic history and established institutions, it takes a lot of planning and ingenuity to overcome the forces standing in their way. Some modern authoritarians, like Hungary's Viktor Orbán, possessed this kind of authoritarian vision and talent from the moment they took office. Trump seemingly didn't.

It's not impossible to overturn a democracy haphazardly. Other successful autocrats, such as Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, built an authoritarian state through a more winding and improvisational pathway than Orbán. But doing it in the United States is an altogether different, and tougher, task.

Again, this does not mean the survival of American democracy is assured. Trump is persistent in pushing democratic limits, and the American presidency is an extraordinarily powerful office.

But, it does mean that the limits of the administration's current strategy are very real — and coming into sharper focus.

Mini gyms and healthier food options aren't going to make airports less miserable.

This month, a video of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. popped up on my feed. Wearing a blue dress shirt and tie, the bronzed, tin-voiced secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services began doing pull-ups. While videos of septuagenarians doing body-weight might be rare if not odd, performing exercises on film has sort of become Kennedy's modus operandi. Watching this man, who was born in 1954, push and pull his body in aggressive ways is supposed to underscore his job as the man in charge of the country's health. If he's healthy, the country must be. But what made this particular video strange was that he was doing these pull-ups at Reagan airport in Washington, DC.

Behind Kennedy is a departures board. Even farther back are restroom and defibrillator signs. His video is papered with the sounds and sights of hapless travelers rolling their carry-ons through the terminal.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

The stunt was part of a press conference in which Kennedy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that they would invest $1 billion in making airports a wellness space. That would include, the administration says, installing gym equipment, more children's play areas, and healthier food options. More broadly, the investment follows proclamations from Duffy that he wants to bring more “civility” to the flying experience, and as a first step in that mission, he encouraged travelers to dress better.

This didn't go over too well, and it's not difficult to understand why: Airports are a bad place and exercises or dressing better will not fix their badness.

Airports are where people want efficiency. The best airports are ones where everything feels less painful — less waiting in lines, less delays, less fluorescent lighting, and everything in between. In fact, people spend money to make the entire process less miserable. They'll shell out money for TSA PreCheck, a feature that shortens the security lines and let you keep shoes on (before TSA got rid of that policy this year). They'll spend money for access to already-crowded lounges, just so they don't have to kill time at the even-more depressing gates.

No one wants to go to the airport and work out. The only time a gym may come handy is in the event of a major delay or if the gym inadvertently becomes a more humane place to wait for your flight than the airport bar (lying down on a yoga mat in peace and quiet might be nice!). Healthier options at a liminal space like an airport are nice in theory, but one of the few joys is that food rules don't apply. You can have alcohol in the morning, eat at a place that advertises itself as an abbreviated version of Chili's, and even test your luck with sushi.

Adding gyms and healthy food to make air travel better isn't directly making air travel better.

But perhaps the outrage is part of the point. Getting upset over a gym you're never going to use, or a bad salad you're never going to eat, or watching an old tan man struggle to do some jungle gym exercises, draws attention away from the things Duffy and his cohort won't fix.

There's still a shortage of FAA flight controllers, which have led to safety concerns and flight delays. In the event of flight delays, Duffy and Trump's administration dissolved a Biden-era initiative for airlines to compensate passengers for lengthy delays. Additionally, airfare is more expensive compared to a year ago and those figures don't include all the upcharges (e.g., sitting toward the front of the main cabin, checked baggage, etc.) that customers choose to make flights more bearable. Said airlines have also made seats smaller and smaller to increase profits.

The awful state of air travel is one of the few things that transcends political partisanship. Go to the airport right now, ask anyone waiting for their flight to board, and they will tell you ways it could improve. Bigger seats, better deals, less delays, more compensation for delays, not being treated like cattle — these are the things people want. Not 15 pull-ups and business casual.

Researchers say some populations are activating “jumping genes” to survive rising temperatures. It's both hopeful and alarming.

This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

Changes in polar bear DNA that could help the animals adapt to warmer climates have been detected by researchers in a study thought to be the first time a statistically significant link has been found between rising temperatures and changing DNA in a wild mammal species.

Climate breakdown is threatening the survival of polar bears. Two-thirds of them are expected to disappear by 2050 as their icy habitat melts and the weather becomes hotter.

Now, scientists at the University of East Anglia have found that some genes related to heat stress, aging, and metabolism are behaving differently in polar bears living in southeast Greenland, suggesting they may be adjusting to warmer conditions.

The researchers analysed blood samples taken from polar bears in two regions of Greenland and compared “jumping genes” — small, mobile pieces of the genome that can influence how other genes work. Scientists looked at the genes in relation to temperatures in the two regions and at the associated changes in gene expression.

“DNA is the instruction book inside every cell, guiding how an organism grows and develops,” said lead researcher Alice Godden. “By comparing these bears' active genes to local climate data, we found that rising temperatures appear to be driving a dramatic increase in the activity of jumping genes within the southeast Greenland bears' DNA.”

As local climates and diets evolve as a result of changes in habitat and prey forced by global heating, the genetics of the bears appear to be adapting, with the group of bears in the warmest part of the country showing more changes than the communities farther north. The authors of the study have said these changes could help us understand how polar bears might survive in a warming world, inform understanding of which populations are most at risk, and guide future conservation efforts.

This is because the findings, published on Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, suggest the genes that are changing play a crucial role in how different polar bear populations are evolving.

“This finding is important because it shows, for the first time, that a unique group of polar bears in the warmest part of Greenland are using ‘jumping genes' to rapidly rewrite their own DNA, which might be a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice,” Godden said.

Temperatures in northeast Greenland are colder and less variable, while in the southeast, there is a much warmer and less icy environment, with steep temperature fluctuations.

DNA sequences in animals change over time, but this process can be accelerated by environmental stress such as a rapidly heating climate.

There were some interesting DNA changes, such as in areas linked to fat processing, that could help polar bears survive when food is scarce. Bears in warmer regions had more rough, plant-based diets compared with the fatty, seal-based diets of northern bears, and the DNA of south-eastern bears seemed to be adapting to this.

Godden said, “We identified several genetic hotspots where these jumping genes were highly active, with some located in the protein-coding regions of the genome, suggesting that the bears are undergoing rapid, fundamental genetic changes as they adapt to their disappearing sea ice habitat.”

The next step will be to look at other polar bear populations, of which there are 20 around the world, to see if similar changes are happening to their DNA.

This research could help protect the bears from extinction. But the scientists said it was crucial to stop temperature rises accelerating by reducing the burning of fossil fuels.

“We cannot be complacent; this offers some hope but does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,” Godden said. “We still need to be doing everything we can to reduce global carbon emissions and slow temperature increases.”

In its push to create an ""AI-first"" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.

The social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.

One of the company's priorities is to ""make AI core to how we work,"" Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention ""Llama"" — alongside products from other firms.

In November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: ""It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.""

The social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.

Among those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees ""work smarter and have more impact,"" Banerjea told employees in the June memo.

Meta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.

After Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for ""concept and production uses"" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.

Gemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to ""unlock AI-driven capabilities"" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.

On the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. ""Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences,"" Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.

To encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported.

Business Insider Edition 

South Sudan has grounded four aircraft linked to United Nations operations, citing security risks and suspected involvement in smuggling, in a move that has raised fresh concerns over aviation safety and relations with international partners.


        South Sudan's government has grounded four aircraft contracted to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), accusing them of operating with undisclosed surveillance equipment and engaging in the smuggling of natural resources, a move that has heightened tensions between Juba and the UN peacekeeping mission.



        The decision was announced after a government investigation into the aircraft's operations, with officials describing the findings as a serious breach of national aviation and security regulations. 
    


        The planes have been barred from further flights pending the outcome of the probe, although other UNMISS air operations continue uninterrupted.
    


        Addressing heads of foreign missions in Juba, Foreign Minister Monday Semaya Kumba said authorities had uncovered evidence that two of the aircraft were fitted with reconnaissance and surveillance systems that had not been declared to the government. 
    


        He said the equipment went beyond what had been approved under existing aviation agreements, raising concerns about sovereignty and national security.
    


        The foreign minister added that two other aircraft are suspected of being used to smuggle sandalwood, a high-value natural resource, between South Sudan and neighbouring Sudan. Kumba said investigators have “preliminary evidence” supporting the claim, though further verification is ongoing.
    


        The aircraft were identified as UNO-570P and UNO-571P for the alleged undisclosed equipment, and UNO-535P and UNO-536P for alleged cross-border smuggling.
    


        South Sudanese officials have stressed that the allegations target the operators of the aircraft rather than UNMISS itself. 
    


        According to the government, the planes are run by private contractors under UN agreements, and the issue revolves around non-disclosure and alleged misuse of aviation assets.



        Authorities said a special investigation committee has submitted its findings to relevant agencies, and appropriate action will follow. Juba reassured international partners that the move does not signal a rejection of peacekeeping operations.
    


        UNMISS, established in 2011 to protect civilians and support peace in the country, said it was unaware of the specific equipment or activities cited by the government. The mission maintains that it operates within its mandate and coordinates with national authorities.
    


        The UN has faced repeated criticism in Africa for inadvertently fueling insecurity. In the DRC and Central African Republic, peacekeepers' failures to prevent violence and misconduct, including sexual abuse, undermined stability. 
    


        In South Sudan, Mali, and the Sahel, operations have sometimes disrupted political dynamics or provoked armed groups. Allegations of trafficking, abuse, and corruption by UN personnel have further eroded public trust, highlighting the challenges of large-scale peacekeeping in fragile states.
    


        The grounding occurs amid ongoing internal security challenges, humanitarian pressures, and strained international relations. 
    


        Analysts say the incident reflects growing scrutiny over foreign aviation operations and the limits of international missions in sovereign states.

President Donald Trump has an ""alcoholic's personality"" and has engaged in legal ""retribution"" against his enemies since his return to office, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in a remarkably candid series of interviews with Vanity Fair published Tuesday.

Wiles said in March that she and Trump had a ""loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.""

Around five months later, she initially denied that Trump was ""on a retribution tour,"" contending that he was motivated by getting ""people that have done bad things"" out of the government.

But she admitted, ""In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time.""

And she said that the administration's attempted prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James — who helmed a business fraud case against Trump and was seen as one of his most reviled political foes — ""might be the one retribution.""

The case against James on mortgage fraud-related charges was dismissed in November, after a judge ruled Trump's pick of prosecutor was invalidly appointed. The Department of Justice has so far failed to convince subsequent grand juries to re-indict her.

Wiles' eyebrow-raising remarks came during 11 interviews with author Chris Whipple, conducted over the course of Trump's first year back in the White House. 

Wiles, who enjoys unparalleled influence and power in Trump's orbit, mostly operates behind the scenes. But in the conversations with Whipple, she offered blunt descriptions, and occasionally criticism, of many of the administration's highest-profile officials.

Those officials include Trump himself. 

Wiles — whose father, former New York Giants kicker Pat Summerall, is described as an alcoholic and an absentee parent — said her difficult upbringing made her ""a little bit of an expert in big personalities.""

Trump does not drink, but he has ""an alcoholic's personality"" in that he ""operates [with] a view that there's nothing he can't do,"" Wiles told Whipple. ""Nothing, zero, nothing."" 

She also spoke about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering behind some of Trump's biggest agenda items, including his global ""reciprocal"" tariff policy.

The early April tariff rollout, which Trump touted as America's ""Liberation Day,"" was the product of what Wiles described as a divided White House that could not agree on the policy's impact.

""So much thinking out loud is what I would call it,"" Wiles said in an interview at the time, recalling that she urged advisers who doubted the tariff plans to get on board, but ""they couldn't get there."" 

Wiles pushed back on Vanity Fair's reporting in an X post later Tuesday morning, calling it ""a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.""

""Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,"" she wrote. 

She added that she has been ""honored"" to work for Trump for nearly a decade, and declared, ""None of this will stop our relentless pursuit of Making America Great Again!""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to CNBC, added that Wiles ""has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history."" 

""President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her,"" Leavitt said.

Whipple also reported Wiles saying that Vice President JD Vance, once a Trump critic who became a leading figure of the MAGA movement, had ""sort of political"" motivations for changing his viewpoint. 

She said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the government-reform  guidebook known as Project 2025, was ""a right-wing absolute zealot.""

Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, ""completely whiffed"" on her early handling of government records related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Wiles said.

Trump said on the 2024 campaign trail that he would support declassifying files from the federal investigations of Epstein, a well-connected money manager who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. But the Trump administration later said it determined that no more disclosures were warranted, sparking outrage from many MAGA supporters.

Bondi, who in February gave binders with old information labeled ""The Epstein Files: Phase 1"" to a group of conservative influencers, failed to appreciate that those people were ""the very targeted group that cared about this,"" Wiles said.

""First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk,"" Wiles said, adding, ""There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk."" 

As for Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief who briefly ran Trump's controversial government-slashing group known as DOGE, Wiles accused him of being ""an avowed ketamine [user]"" and ""an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are.""

She said that she ""was initially aghast"" when DOGE moved to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, which Musk has claimed was rife with fraud.

""I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,"" she said.

""Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,"" Wiles said. ""And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.""

In this article

Kraft Heinz on Tuesday announced that former Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane will lead the company ahead of its planned split next year.

Cahillane will join the Oscar Mayer owner as chief executive on Jan. 1. After Kraft Heinz divides into two publicly traded companies, he will serve as CEO of the business it is temporarily calling Global Taste Elevation, which will include high-growth brands like Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac & Cheese.

""These are phenomenal brands that need to be contemporized, shown a little bit of love and brought back to growth,"" Cahillane said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street,"" comparing the opportunity with Kraft Heinz with the one he tackled at Kellogg.

Cahillane previously led Kellogg through its own breakup in 2023. The company split its sluggish North American cereal business from its high-growth snacking unit, which was then renamed Kellanova. Cahillane stayed on as chief executive of Kellanova until Mars acquired the company for $35.9 billion.

Outgoing Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera was originally tapped to lead the other company known as North American Grocery. However, he will now serve as an advisor through March 6. Abrams-Rivera has been chief executive of the food giant since 2024.

The Kraft Heinz board will initiate a search for a chief executive to lead the portfolio of grocery staples, which includes brands like Oscar Mayer and Kraft Singles.

As part of the transition, John Cahill, who served as CEO of Kraft during its merger with Heinz a decade ago, will succeed Miguel Patricio as chair of the board.

Kraft Heinz is projecting that the separation will happen in the second half of 2026. The company announced the breakup plans in September, following years of sluggish sales despite turnaround efforts. The split reverses much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world.

Kraft Heinz shares rose 1% in morning trading. The stock has fallen about 20% this year.

LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky sees a lot of career advice on the site every day, but he doesn't always agree with every piece that's shared.

One common tip that Roslansky said is ""a little bit outdated"" is that ""you have to have a five-year plan,"" he told content creator Erin McGoff in an interview for her YouTube channel AdviceWithErin. 

In Roslansky's view, having a five-year plan is ""a little bit foolish,"" he said: given how rapidly technology and the workplace are changing, it's not realistic to ""chart out what the next five years of your life are going to look like.""

Instead, Roslansky advised workers to focus on what they want to learn and what experiences they want to have.

""I think that's the right mental model in this environment,"" he said. ""If you focus on those shorter steps, gaining learning, gaining experience, a lot of your career path will open up for you.""

According to Roslansky, having a linear career path isn't realistic anymore. 

Many people think ""you graduate high school and then go to a certain college and then become a consultant and then get an MBA,"" he said – but ""that's not how it happens at all for most people.""

Once you let go of that idea, ""you can take your own career into your own hands,"" he said. ""No one is trying to figure this out for you. You have to take care of it yourself.""

Roslansky also shared his best advice for young people navigating their careers right now.

His first tip is to ""learn the tools"" and experiment with using AI at work, he told McGoff.

""Try and figure out how to create a PowerPoint presentation out of chat,"" he said. ""You know, figure out how this can help you with a better marketing message.""

""Whether or not you like it, whether or not it's a good fit for what you're trying to do, that mental model – like, 'I'm going to use this tool and learn it to help me do something' – I think is the most important thing,"" he continued.

Still, ""it's not just about the tools and technology,"" Roslansky said: skills like empathy, judgment and communication are still ""critical"" in the modern workplace.

""In a world where everyone is kind of, you know, focused more on the technology, if you really work on a lot of those human skills, it can be a great differentiator for you,"" he said.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Investors and economic policymakers alike are counting down to this morning's delayed nonfarm payroll report, due out at 8:30 a.m. ET. The data comes less than a week after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and as the race to lead the central bank takes another turn.

Here's what to know:

Ford's shift away from all-electric vehicles is costing it $19.5 billion in special items, the automaker said yesterday. Shares rose nearly 2% in extended trading.

The charges, most of which Ford expects in the fourth quarter, are related to Ford's new focus on hybrid vehicles and its decision to cancel a generation of all-electric trucks in favor of smaller and more affordable EVs. As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, the move comes as the broader EV industry grapples with a sales slump following the end of federal tax credits for EV buyers in September.

Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC's ""Closing Bell Overtime"" yesterday that the carmaker is ""following customers to where the market is."" For high-end EVs in particular, Farley said that they ""just weren't selling.""

Revenue from the new tariffs imposed by Trump this year has surpassed $200 billion, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said yesterday.

Trump's broad and steep duties have reshaped global trade this year, but their fate hangs in the balance as the Supreme Court weighs their legality. If the court rules against the White House, it could require refunds for companies that have already paid the tariffs.

Despite the milestone, tariff revenue recently pulled back. Collections fell to $30.75 billion in November from above $31 billion in the prior month — the first decline since Trump announced his sweeping new tariffs in April.

Consumers are still feeling doom and gloom about the economy. But as CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Melissa Repko report, that isn't stopping them from spending.

Even as a key consumer sentiment gauge sits near record lows, data shows that the highest number of Americans shopped in the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday in at least nine years. Retailers ranging from Costco to Best Buy have also said they've had positive starts to the all-important holiday shopping period.

There are still signs that the economic outlook is weighing on consumption habits. Namely, strength in value-oriented retailers like Walmart and T.J. Maxx signal shoppers' increased attention to prices.

A decade ago, robotaxis were still being written off as the work of science fiction. Today, these driverless cars have become commonplace across America, from the Las Vegas Strip to school drop-off lines in Phoenix.

Alphabet-owned Waymo – the industry leader – is now operating, testing or planning to launch service in 26 markets around the world. Meanwhile, Amazon-owned Zoox and Tesla launched the first iterations of their services this year. Tesla shares surged to a new 2025 high yesterday after CEO Elon Musk confirmed that driverless robotaxi tests were happening in Austin.

There are still obstacles on the road to becoming more mainstream, whether it's complaints around noise and congestion, consumer concerns about safety or higher prices than traditional rideshare platforms.

Baron Capital founder Ron Baron joined CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" yesterday to discuss his firm's new exchange-traded funds and SpaceX investment.

Databricks is raising $4 billion in a funding round that would value the data analytics software company at $134 billion, the company announced Tuesday.

The valuation is a 34% jump from the funding round announced in August, which valued the company at $100 billion. At the time, Databricks became one of a handful of private companies to surpass a $100 billion valuation, after SpaceX, ByteDance and OpenAI.

Databricks said it plans to use the capital to support customer app building as artificial intelligence accelerates development. 

Tune in at 4:15 p.m. ET as Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joins CNBC TV to discuss the latest funding round and valuation. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream.

The company said it topped a $4.8 billion revenue run-rate during the third quarter and is growing 55% year-over-year. That figure is also up from the $4 billion revenue run-rate announced earlier this year.

Databricks is among a growing list of companies that have opted to stay private for longer as private markets offer more funding opportunities.

Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company and JPMorgan Asset Management led the round, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz.

Databricks was founded in 2013 in San Francisco and ranked third on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.

Kevin Hassett has reclaimed the lead in prediction markets betting on who President Donald Trump will nominate as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, after briefly losing ground to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

On Kalshi, traders on Tuesday assigned Hassett a roughly 53% chance of securing the nomination, up from about 39% earlier in the day following reports of internal pushback from figures close to Trump. Warsh's implied probability fell to about 33% from 46% earlier Tuesday.

The shift seemingly occurred after Hassett showed support for central bank independence on CNBC and said forging consensus is an important part of the job.

""The Federal Reserve's independence is really, really important, and the voices of the other people at the [Federal Open Market Committee], they're important, too,"" he said. ""So the way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data.""

Hassett's odds took a dip earlier after fresh pushback from high-level figures with direct access to the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Those advisers have raised concerns that Hassett, currently director of the National Economic Council, is seen as too close to Trump. 

Warsh, a former Fed governor who served from 2006 to 2011, has long been viewed as a credible pick for Republicans. Hassett has been a fixture of Trump's economic team across both terms, a proximity that some advisers now fear could undermine the Fed's institutional standing.

The race for Fed chief opened up after Trump injected new ambiguity into the race late last week. After previously telling reporters he already knew whom he would choose as Fed chair, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that Warsh had risen to the top tier of contenders.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, one of the finalists for the Federal Reserve chair job, showed support Tuesday for central bank independence.

With President Donald Trump apparently in the final days of picking a successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, Hassett declined in a CNBC interview to directly address his own candidacy but said forging consensus is an important part of the job.

""The Federal Reserve's independence is really, really important, and the voices of the other people at the [Federal Open Market Committee], they're important, too,"" he said. ""So the way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data.""

Prior to last week, Hassett had been considered the leading contender for the job to take over for Powell, who is nearing the end of his second term as head of the central bank. However, Trump said last week that former Governor Kevin Warsh has come to the front of the pack as well, following an interview between the two last Wednesday.

There has been some pushback against Hassett in recent days. Sources told CNBC that the president's advisors worry that Hassett will be perceived as too close to Trump and will do his bidding rather than seek to set interest rates in line with the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.

However, Hassett said his relationship with Trump shouldn't be held against him.

""The idea that someone isn't qualified for the job because they are a close friend who's worked well with the president is something that I think the President rejects,"" he said.

Though he appointed Powell, Trump has been a constant critic of the Fed chief. 

Trump has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts, unsatisfied even as the FOMC has approved three consecutive cuts since September totaling three quarters of a percentage point. Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee who came on board in September, has voted against each of those reductions in favor of half-point cuts.

Hassett stressed the need for consensus building at the Fed. Trump has advocated that the Fed should consult the president when making rate decisions.

""The way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data,"" he said. ""When you get things wrong, you explain why and fix it. So that's the way it moves forward. But the President is a seasoned observer of the economy, and if he has a good point, then I'm sure others will recognize it as such.""

Hassett and Warsh were part of five finalists for the job. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the process, said Tuesday morning on Fox Business that the decision likely will come in early January.

A shortage of memory chips fueled by artificial intelligence players is likely to cause a price rise in smartphones in 2026 and a drop in shipments, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Tuesday.

Smartphone shipments could fall 2.1% in 2026, according to Counterpoint, versus a previous outlook of flat-to-positive growth.

Shipments do not equate to sales but are a measure of demand as they track the number of devices being sent to sales channels like stores. 

Meanwhile, the average selling price of smartphones could jump 6.9% year-on-year in 2026, Counterpoint said, in comparison to a previous forecast of a 3.6% rise.

This is being driven by specific chip shortages and bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain, which are pushing up component prices.

The continued build-out of data centres globally has hiked demand for systems developed by Nvidia, which in turn uses components designed by SK Hynix and Samsung — the two biggest suppliers of so-called memory chips. 

However, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, is also critical for smartphones. DRAM prices have surged this year as demand outstrips supply. 

For low-end smartphones priced below $200, the bill of materials cost has increased 20% to 30% since the beginning of the year, Counterpoint said. The bill of materials is the cost of producing a single smartphone. 

The mid and high-end smartphone segment has seen material costs rise 10% to 15%. 

""Memory prices could rise another 40% through Q2 2026, resulting in BoM costs increasing anywhere between 8% and over 15% above current elevated levels,"" Counterpoint said. 

The rising price of components could be passed on to consumers and that will in turn, drive the rise in the average selling price.

""Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters,"" MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint, said in the note. ""But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins.""

Hwang said this will ""play out especially"" with Chinese smartphone makers who are in the mid-to-lower end of the market. 

Counterpoint said some companies may downgrade components like camera modules, displays and even audio, as well as reusing old components. Smartphone players are likely to try to incentivize consumers to buy their higher-priced devices too.

The U.S. has halted a technology trade deal with the U.K., after officials in Washington became frustrated with the pace of progress, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

Announced in September during President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., the ""technology prosperity deal"" is a sweeping agreement aimed at encouraging collaboration between the countries on tech like artificial intelligence, nuclear fusion, and quantum computing.

At the time, Trump said that the deal would ""ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side."" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the agreement was a ""generational step change in our relationship with the U.S.""  that would deliver ""growth, security and opportunity up and down the country.""

Talks were suspended by the U.S. last week, the FT reported, quoting unnamed British officials.

When asked to comment on the report, a U.K. government spokesperson told CNBC: ""Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the Tech Prosperity Deal delivers opportunity for hardworking people in both countries.""

The agreement would establish AI-enabled research programs in areas including the development of models and datasets in mutual priorities such as AI for biotechnology, precision medicine for cancer and rare and chronic diseases, and fusion energy, the two countries said in September.

It came as the U.K. signed deals totalling £31 billion ($41 billion) with U.S. tech firms like Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, and CoreWeave to build out the country's AI infrastructure. The U.S. is the U.K.'s largest trading partner.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has been approached for comment.

U.S. stocks of late have been shaky as investors turn away from artificial intelligence shares, especially those related to AI infrastructure, such as Oracle, Broadcom and CoreWeave. 

The worry is that those companies are running into high levels of debt to finance their multibillion-dollar deals.

Oracle, for instance, said Wednesday it would need to raise capital expenditure by an additional $15 billion for its current fiscal year and increase its lease commitments for data centers. The company is turning to debt to finance all that.

The stock lost 2.7% on Monday, while shares of CoreWeave, its fellow player in the AI data center trade dropped around 8%. Broadcom also retreated over concerns over margin compression, sliding about 5.6%.

That said, major indexes were not too adversely affected as investors continued rotating into sectors such as consumer discretionary and industrials. The S&P 500 slipped 0.16%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked down just 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite, comprising more tech firms, fell 0.59%.

The broader market performance suggests that the fears are mostly contained within the AI infrastructure space. 

""It definitely requires the ROI [return on investment] to be there to keep funding this AI investment,"" Matt Witheiler, head of late-stage growth at Wellington Management, told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" on Monday. ""From what we've seen so far that ROI is there.""

Witheiler said the bullish side of the story is that, ""every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute I can make more revenue.""

The ready availability of clients, according to that argument, means those companies that provide the compute — Oracle and CoreWeave — just need to make sure their finances are in order.

India's exports of goods grew in November. Shipment increased 19% year on year to $38.13 billion. New Delhi's exports to the U.S. returned to growth in November, rising 22.6% from a year earlier to $6.98 billion, despite tariffs on Indian imports remaining stiff.

High cost of goods is causing consumers to spend less for the holidays, CNBC survey finds

Inflation looks to be sapping some of Americans' holiday cheer as they head out to buy gifts this Christmas season, according to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey.

The survey found the high cost of goods has emerged as a major factor affecting how much shoppers spend and where they spend, suggesting inflation of the past several years and the rise in prices of imported goods due to tariffs is being felt at the checkout counter.

China on Tuesday announced lower duties on pork imports and pig by-products from the European Union as it concluded a year-long anti-dumping investigation into European pork imports. 

The new tariff rates — ranging from 4.9% to 19.8% on dozens of European pork exporters — will start taking effect on Wednesday and last five years, according to the Chinese commerce ministry. 

Earlier in September, China had imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 62.4% in the form of cash deposits on pork imports from the EU. 

The trade tensions had flared after Brussels slapped tariffs of up to 45% in October last year on electric vehicles imported from China, drawing Beijing to denounce it as protectionist. 

China launched the anti-dumping probe in June last year as part of a countermeasure to the EU's punitive measures against its EV sector. 

The EU is the world's largest pork exporter, selling around 13% of its annual production overseas, with China being the single largest buyer, according to estimates by S&P Global. 

European leaders have called out Beijing's growing trade imbalance with major trading partners, including the EU, as tariff tensions with Washington propelled Chinese exporters to redirect shipments to non-U.S. markets. 

China's trade surplus reached a record of more than $1 trillion for the year as of November. 

Beijing's curbs on rare earth exports had also threatened a shortage of the critical minerals at several European manufacturers that sought to diversify supply chains from China. The agreement that China struck with the U.S. in late October has allayed some concerns, as Beijing reportedly has started granting licenses for such exports. 

The EU and China have also clashed over the export of semiconductors after the Netherlands took control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned firm based in the country. Last week, Beijing called on the Dutch government to send a delegation to China for further negotiations.

Bitcoin is headed for the fourth annual decline in its history, and the first one that didn't coincide with a major scandal or industry meltdown. 

The latest leg down came Monday, with a sharp selloff that sent the original cryptocurrency falling as much as 5.2%. Bitcoin is now about 7% lower for the year. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) acquired another 54 bitcoin during Monday's sharp selloff, bringing its total stack to 5,098 coins worth just less than $450 million based on BTC's current price of $87,600.



That places the company, co-founded by Eric Trump, who serves as its chief strategy officer, in the top 20 of publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firms, according to bitcointreasuries.net. The Nasdaq listed firm said its accumulated holdings were acquired through a combination of self mining and targeted purchases, including bitcoin held in custody or pledged under a miner purchase agreement with Bitmain.The company also highlighted a 96.5% bitcoin yield since its Nasdaq debut, alongside 533 satoshis per share as of Dec. 14. Bitcoin yield tracks the percentage change in satoshis per share over time. While satoshis per share measures the amount of bitcoin attributable to each outstanding share.Despite bitcoin's gains on Tuesday, ABTC is down another 2.7% Tuesday, continuing to reel after an unexpected stock lock-up expiration two weeks ago. Shares are down nearly 60% since.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitmine Chair Tom Lee says “the best days for crypto are ahead” as the firm tops up its treasury with another $300 million worth of Ethereum.

The fresh haul brings the crypto treasury firm's total holdings of the second-biggest token to $12 billion.

Lee said “positive developments in digital assets” such as favourable regulations, new US crypto laws and Wall Street's adoption of crypto will fuel the sector's growth.

“These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate Ethereum towards our ‘alchemy of 5%' target,” he said.

Backed by marquee investors including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, Bitmine currently owns more than 3.2% of Ethereum's supply.

The haul follows a $435 million purchase earlier in December. Lee cited Fusaka, a major upgrade to the Ethereum network that boosted scalability and usability rolled out on December 3, as another key reason for buying.

To be sure, Bitmine's stock price is down about 30% from its highs this month and trading at $31 per share. It is not the only digital asset treasury to be down. DAT pioneer Strategy is down some 63% since July.

Ethereum is trading at just above $2,900 at time of reporting, down some 40% from its all-time high set in August, against the backdrop of a $1.4 trillion crypto market drawdown.

Meanwhile, some whales are offloading. The Lookonchain wallet tracking account has flagged over $100 million in selling this week.

Bitmine's announcement comes the same day JP Morgan's asset management division debuted its first-ever tokenised money market fund built on Ethereum.

The $4.6 trillion bank's My OnChain Net Yield Fund — MONY — invests in US Treasury securities and allows qualified investors to hold the token on the Ethereum blockchain to earn yield.

MONY “offers daily dividend reinvestment and investors will be able to subscribe and redeem using cash or stablecoins,” the firm said.

George Gatch, chief executive of JP Morgan Asset Management, said that “by harnessing technology alongside our deep expertise in active management, we're able to provide clients with advanced, innovative, and cost-effective capabilities that help them achieve their investment goals.”

Market watchers took notice.

“JP Morgan launches its first tokenised money market fund,” Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute said on X.

“And seeding it with $100 million. Using Ethereum blockchain. See where this is all heading yet?

Ark Invest purchased  550,404 shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies across its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF exchange-traded funds, according to daily trade disclosures.

The buying followed an 11.2% decline in Bitmine shares on Monday, which closed at $30.95, valuing Ark's purchase at roughly $17 million.

At the stock's $30.95 closing price, the purchase would have cost approximately $17 million.

Bitmine, associated with Fundstrat co-founder Lee, has positioned itself as an Ethereum-focused treasury company and has been aggressively accumulating ether on a near-weekly basis.

Ark also increased exposure to other crypto-related firms, purchasing 64,946 shares of Coinbase, 143,579 shares of Circle Internet Group, and 122,360 shares of Bullish. All three stocks posted losses during the session.

Despite expanding exposure to Ethereum-linked strategies, Wood said that Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency in her view.

Asked to rank Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana during a recent podcast appearance, Wood said Bitcoin is typically “the first one to get sold and drag the others down” during periods of market stress.

She added, however, that she believes markets may be approaching a bottom, as adverse developments have largely been absorbed.

Cathie Wood breaks down her top 3 crypto assets:

– Bitcoin as the global monetary system and entry point for institutions– Ethereum as the institutional infrastructure layer– Solana as the consumer-focused chain pic.twitter.com/bHqgPfSQkp 

— Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 14, 2025 



Wood described Bitcoin as “a very big idea,” calling it a global monetary system, a technology, and a new asset class.

She said it is “leading the charge into a completely new asset class” and remains the primary entry point for institutional investors.

Ethereum, she said, is increasingly becoming the platform institutions are choosing as they build on its layer-one blockchain and expand activity through layer-two networks.

Wood characterized Ethereum as more of an institutional play, while describing Solana as more consumer-focused.

Wood also recently reiterated Ark Invest's long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, saying recent adjustments to the firm's valuation model have not altered its top-end price target of $1.5 million.

Speaking during an Ark webinar  in November, Wood said parts of the model were updated to reflect the rapid growth of stablecoins, which she said are increasingly serving as an “insurance policy” in emerging markets.

In this recent webinar, I discuss why the liquidity squeeze that has hit #AI  and #crypto  will reverse in the next few weeks, something the markets seemed to buy, and why AI is not in a bubble. The 123% increase noted below was in Palantir's US commercial business last qtr.

Watch… https://t.co/GdBZtEQcxM 

— Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) November 26, 2025 



Ark analyst David Puell noted that Bitcoin's share of transaction volume in developing regions remains below that of stablecoins, accounting for roughly 20% compared with between 40% and 50% for stablecoins, citing Chainalysis data.

As a result, Ark reduced its assumptions for Bitcoin's adoption as a safe-haven asset in those markets.

Despite these changes, Wood said Ark's long-term conviction remains intact.

“Our bull price … really hasn't changed,” she said.

Ethereum's near-term price action remains weak despite signs of rebuilding institutional interest, according to CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri.

At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading  at around $2,920, down nearly 7% over the past seven days.

Tahiri said Ethereum's recent rebound likely marked the completion of a fourth wave within a broader corrective structure, suggesting the asset could now be entering a fifth and final downward wave.

“If so, the main target for the bottom is at $2,065,” Tahiri said, citing a 1.61 external Fibonacci retracement level as key support, after which a significant bounce could follow.

He added that while improving long-term sentiment and prominent bullish positions are constructive, they do not invalidate Ethereum's current downtrend.

“This disconnect explains why Ethereum's price is falling despite the release of positive headlines,” Tahiri said.

Tahiri added that downside risk remains elevated until Ethereum reclaims key resistance levels and confirms a trend reversal.

Oops, something went wrong

 Key Takeaways

Coinbase has expanded its “perpetual-style” futures offering.

Eleven altcoins have joined the roster alongside Bitcoin and Ether.

Unlike traditional perps, perpetual-style futures comply with U.S. derivatives regulations.

Following the launch of its flagship BTC and ETH products earlier this year, Coinbase has expanded its derivatives offering with perpetual-style futures tied to a slate of major altcoins. 

While offshore and decentralized exchanges have long dominated the global perp market, Coinbase's move highlights the steady normalization of regulated crypto derivatives in the U.S. market—albeit in a distinctly American wrapper.

Coinbase initially listed “perpetual-style” futures for Bitcoin and Ether in July, marking the launch of a new asset class for the U.S.-regulated market.

The contracts are designed to replicate perpetual exposure without being legally classified as swaps. They are technically still futures with expiries, but because they automatically roll over at maturity, from the perspective of traders, they behave the same as true perps.

On Thursday, Dec. 15, Coinbase introduced eleven new altcoins to its perpetual-style derivatives offering:

Avalanche (AVAX)

Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

Cardano (ADA)

Chainlink (LINK)

Dogecoin (DOGE)

Hedera (HBAR)

Litecoin (LTC)

Polkadot (DOT)

Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Sui (SUI)

Stellar (XLM)

The selection leans toward large-cap, liquid tokens with long trading histories. Legacy networks, such as Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Stellar, sit alongside newer layer-one and infrastructure plays, including Avalanche, Sui, and Chainlink. 

Memecoins also feature, with both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu included in the list, their persistent liquidity and retail demand.

Unlike traditional perps offered by decentralized or offshore exchanges, Coinbase's perpetual-style futures comply with U.S. derivatives regulations, making them suitable for American retail and institutional traders.

Perp-style futures are listed on Coinbase Derivatives rather than the company's spot exchange. Traders must access them via the firm's registered FCM (Futures Commission Merchants) partners, which include ABN Amro, Architect, and Clear Street.

The cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp and broad-based correction on Monday, December 15, extending into Tuesday, as Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below the crucial $86,000 support level, dragging the global altcoin market down significantly. This latest price action marks a continuation of the bearish streak following BTC's recent rejection from the $94,000 interim highs.

The sell-off is not attributable to a single factor but rather a confluence of macro and internal crypto market pressures. The primary driver of the sudden drop was a cascade of long liquidations in the derivatives market. After moving sideways near the $89,000–$90,000 range, Bitcoin broke key technical support, triggering automatic forced closures of highly leveraged long positions. This created a vicious cycle, as the selling pressure from the liquidations amplified the price decline, pulling BTC down to briefly bottom near $86,000. Data suggests a clear liquidity imbalance where, while retail and mid-sized wallets were active in buying the dip, absorbing nearly half a billion dollars in demand, this was decisively overshadowed by an estimated $2.78 billion in selling from large holders, or “whales.” This distribution from large players is the core mechanical reason for the sustained downward pressure. Furthermore, the crypto market is reflecting a wider “risk-off” shift across global financial markets. Uncertainty surrounding the US Federal Reserve's future Chair, rising US fiscal stress, and the recent delay of US crypto market structure legislation to 2026 have all contributed to caution among institutional investors, prompting them to reduce exposure to volatile assets. Finally, as Bitcoin dominance stabilizes, the correlation between BTC and altcoins remains high during market downturns. With Bitcoin falling, major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Binance Coin (BNB) experienced even steeper percentage declines, with many falling over 9% in 24 hours. The weakness in altcoins reinforces the overall negative market sentiment.

The market sentiment, as reflected by various indices, remains in the “fear” zone, though not yet at “extreme fear,” suggesting some traders anticipate a short-term reversal. Analysts are now eyeing the next major psychological and technical support zone between $82,000 and $84,000. Defending this range is crucial to prevent a slide back to mid-cycle lows. Relief rallies in altcoins are expected to be tactical and short-lived until the selling pressure from larger Bitcoin holders eases and broader macro signals stabilize. Investors are advised to avoid excessive leverage and maintain a defensive posture.

Key takeaways:

Leverage surged in the crypto market, with $527 million in liquidations in 24 hours, signaling growing caution among traders.

Tighter liquidity and increasing AI debt risks push traders to exit riskier assets, contributing to a market correction.

The cryptocurrency market saw a correction on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) retesting the $85,000 level and Ether (ETH) dropping to $2,900. Traders became more risk-averse after a survey showed worsening economic conditions in the United States and changes in investor expectations regarding the proposed options for the next US Federal Reserve chair. 

The resilience of the US five-year Treasury after hitting a low of 98.64 on Wednesday points to a more defensive shift in positioning as liquidity conditions tightened across global markets. That caution comes amid mounting fiscal pressures after a recent tax and spending package extended credits and raised the US debt ceiling by $5 trillion. Also, the Federal Reserve said it will begin purchasing about $40 billion per month in short-dated Treasury bills as part of a technical reserve-management operation aimed at maintaining ample liquidity, a move policymakers have stressed is not a return to broad quantitative easing or a shift in the Fed's monetary policy stance.

The consumer sector remains a concern, as a CNBC survey revealed that 41% of Americans plan to spend less during the holidays this year, up from 35% in 2024. Additionally, 61% of respondents cited affordability problems due to stagnant wages amid rising prices. US October retail sales data will be released on Tuesday, along with November nonfarm payrolls figures. 

Excessive leverage in the cryptocurrency market continues to be a major issue, with futures open interest standing at $135 billion. Over $527 million worth of bullish leveraged positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours, causing traders to worry about further downside. Weakness in the artificial intelligence sector has also driven traders to increase cash positions, exiting riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies.

Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates reportedly said that tech firms' heavy reliance on debt markets to fund AI investments has reached a dangerous phase, according to Reuters. “Going forward, there is a reasonable probability that we will soon find ourselves in a bubble,"" Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen wrote in a note. 

Demand for leverage on short (sellers) positions surged on Bybit, pushing the annualized funding rate below zero. This unusual situation, where longs (buyers) are paid to keep their leveraged positions open, rarely lasts as arbitrage opportunities emerge. Still, since the Oct. 10 crash, liquidity has become much tighter, with some market makers likely facing sizable losses.

Part of Monday's decline in the US stock market can be attributed to a decrease in Kevin Hassett's odds of replacing Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair. CNBC reported that President Donald Trump's inner circle pushed for someone perceived as more independent. Trump said on Friday that Kevin Warsh would also be a great fit, which eased concerns about the fragility of the US dollar. 

The US Dollar Index (DXY) found support at the 98 level after four consecutive weeks of decline. This stability suggests higher confidence in the US government's ability to avoid a recession, which is somewhat supportive for the stock market but less so for cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin and Ether are generally seen as part of an independent financial system, so the relative strength of the US dollar reduces the demand for alternative hedges. The excessive leverage in the cryptocurrency market, combined with broader macroeconomic uncertainty, is likely to continue weighing on prices.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) has completed the world's first on-chain disbursement of universal basic income (UBI) using a digitally native sovereign bond, USDM1, via the Stellar blockchain.

Developed in partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) and infrastructure provider Crossmint, the multimillion-dollar initiative is part of RMI's national UBI program, known locally as ENRA, the Marshalls Islands' Finance Ministry confirmed. The program replaces quarterly physical cash deliveries with direct digital transfers to eligible citizens, many of whom live across widely dispersed islands.

USDM1 is a U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bond fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The bond is distributed through the Stellar Disbursement Platform into a custom-built digital wallet app called Lomalo. Developed by Crossmint, Lomalo allows recipients to receive funds instantly via Crossmint wallets on the Stellar network.

In an exclusive statement to CoinDesk, a Finance Ministry spokesperson said, “USDM1 is issued under New York law using a time-tested Brady-bond structure that has underpinned sovereign finance for decades. Its foundation is not regulatory discretion or policy preference, but settled law.”

“U.S. Treasury collateral is held by an independent trustee, outside the control of any government or private issuer, and redemption rights are fixed, unconditional, and legally enforceable,” the spokesperson added.

SDF CEO Denelle Dixon said the program exemplifies “what adoption looks like for blockchain technology,” enabling everyday financial access where it was previously lacking.

The government emphasized that USDM1 does not compromise the country's monetary or technological sovereignty. “ENRA is a fiscal distribution program, not a currency initiative,” the spokesperson said. “Every unit is issued one-to-one against short-dated U.S. Treasuries held in trust, fully backed and legally segregated at all times.”

The rollout, years in the making, was shaped by the Marshall Islands' geography and infrastructure constraints. “Distance, dispersion, and limited physical infrastructure shape the realities of daily life,” the spokesperson said. “This was purpose built for the Marshall Islands.”

A white paper released alongside the initiative outlines the broader policy and financial framework for USDM1.

India PR Distribution



New Delhi [India], December 16: This initiative empowers key stakeholders such as drivers, NBFCs, OEMs, Policy makers and recyclers, fueling EV adoption and financial inclusion in India.



Zenfinity Energy, a deep-tech battery company incubated at IIT Madras, and Chargeup, India's EV Tech platform for last mile drivers, today announced the launch of India's first blockchain-based Battery Passport, starting with a 3,000-battery pilot (15 MWh) to be deployed across major Indian cities in the next 6 months. Built on India's emerging ""Battery Aadhaar"" framework, this passport captures both static and high-resolution dynamic data across the full battery lifecycle--marking a pioneering step toward India's transition to Digital Battery Passports (DBPs) aligned with global standards.



India's Growing Battery Dependence Requires Smarter Lifecycle Data

India is projected to import more than 25 GWh of lithium-ion cells and batteries in FY25-26, equivalent to nearly 156,000 tonnes of cells. With rapid electrification of commercial fleets, the nation must ensure these assets stay productive for as long as possible. To finance this scale of batteries--whether new, in-field, or in resale markets--stakeholders need accurate State of Health (SoH) and remaining useful life (RUL) data. These metrics can only be generated through continuous capture of in-field dynamic data reflecting cyclic ageing, calendar ageing, thermal stress, operational behavior, and telemetry patterns.



A Technological Breakthrough for India's Battery Ecosystem

Zenfinity's Battery Passport is engineered to combine:

* Manufacturing metadata (supply chain, batch characteristics, QC parameters)

* Real-time field telemetry (temperature, current, voltage, C-rates, GPS)

* Physics-informed SoH/RUL algorithms

* Lifecycle events (service history, repairs, swaps, firmware updates)

* End-of-life insights for recycling, material recovery, and circularity

All of this is anchored on a permissioned blockchain ledger, ensuring tamper-proof, immutable, and selectively shareable battery records. Importantly, the architecture ensures complex analytics from Zenfinity's SoH engine do not burden the blockchain ledger, maintaining scalability and performance.

This system supports compliance with India's Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR 2022) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandates, while creating the data backbone for a transparent, circular battery economy.

Until now, most battery passport initiatives--domestically and globally--focused primarily on static data, material provenance, and supply-chain compliance. By integrating dynamic operational and ageing data, Zenfinity and Chargeup are bringing the next generation of lifecycle intelligence to India's EV ecosystem.

3,000-Battery Pilot: Linking Battery Health, Driver Behavior & Financing

Over the next six months, Zenfinity and Chargeup will onboard 3,000 drivers and 3,000 blockchain-enabled L3 batteries to the program. OEMs, NBFCs, recyclers, and policymakers will gain access to live dashboards and operational telemetry streams.

This pilot integrates:

* Zenfinity's Battery Passport, SoH/RUL engine, and analytics stack

* Chargeup's Driver Karma Score, underwriting models, and risk mitigation engine

Each battery receives a unique digital identity capturing its entire operational history, degradation trends, and remaining life. The Driver Karma Score layers on driver behavior, battery usage discipline, and payment reliability, creating a unified risk signature for each asset.

With all lifecycles, behavioral, and financial data in one place, NBFCs gain the ability to lower credit risk, reward responsible drivers, reduce non-performing assets (NPAs), and increase recycling value--while drivers and fleet operators enjoy more uptime and fairer loan terms.

Dr. Kriti Yadav, CEO, Zenfinity Energy, said:

""We're creating guard rails for bankable batteries. Weak batteries are an ongoing challenge in India's scaling EV ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain to create an open yet secure battery record, we aim to boost confidence in EV batteries and make it easier for fleet operators and drivers to obtain financing. A verifiable battery passport can assure all stakeholders of a battery's performance and remaining life, ultimately accelerate EV adoption and set new industry benchmarks.""

Mr. Satish Mittal, Co-founder, Chargeup, added:

""Integrating Zenfinity's battery passport with our platform is a game-changer for last-mile drivers and the EV financing ecosystem. Through our Driver Karma Score and real-time battery data, responsible drivers will be rewarded with better loan terms and more uptime. Financiers and recyclers, in turn, get unparalleled visibility into asset health. Together, we're creating a framework where trust replaces uncertainty--benefiting drivers, NBFCs, and the entire value chain with a goal to financial Inclusion and acceleration of EV adoption in India""

Crypto pundit Chain Cartel has raised several key points following SWIFT's latest comment on its move to adopt blockchain technology. The pundit claimed that Ripple's XRPL network best suits what SWIFT is trying to achieve and suggested that the two firms collaborate. 

In an X post, Chain Cartel stated that SWIFT admitted they are building Ripple's XRPL network, but did not explicitly say so in their announcement. The pundit was referring to an X post from SWIFT highlighting their earlier announcement to add a blockchain-based ledger to their infrastructure.

The pundit explained that SWIFT's language in the X post suggests that they want to build something like Ripple's XRPL. He declared that it is not Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any generic blockchain experiment but precisely what Ripple has been building for a decade. Chain Cartel noted that Ripple's model has always been a neutral settlement layer, real-time atomic finality, shared ledger visibility for institutions, interoperability with legacy rails, and liquidity-first design. 

Chain Cartel then alluded to SWIFT's statement about its plans to build a blockchain-based ledger to be included in its payment infrastructure and provide a single source of truth, enabling instant, 24/7 cross-border payments. He declared that this is Ripple's blueprints with the XRPL, as the crypto firm uses the network for its payment services. 

In line with this, the pundit remarked that SWIFT doesn't replace rails, but instead coordinates them, and that Ripple doesn't replace banks, but instead connects them. He added that SWIFT is acknowledging that the future payment stack requires a ledger layer, not just messaging, and that the only model already battle-tested at scale is Ripple's XRPL.

However, it is worth mentioning that SWIFT doesn't plan to integrate Ripple's Ledger. Instead, it is building this blockchain-based ledger in partnership with Consensys and Chainlink. As such, although SWIFT may plan to build a network similar to Ripple's XRPL, it intends to do so without assistance from the crypto firm. 

Ripple is looking to expand its payment service, as it recently announced plans to begin testing its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum layer-2 networks Base, Ink, Optimism, and Unichain. The move comes just days after the OCC granted Ripple a conditional approval to become a bank, which is also a major boost for the firm's payment service. 

Ripple plans to expand its RLUSD stablecoin beyond the Ethereum and XRPL networks to these layer-2 networks through its partnership with Wormhole. The firm noted that the future of crypto is multichain, which is why it is adopting this strategy. This move gives Ripple's clients greater options when using the RLUSD stablecoin, and it could also attract new users to the stablecoin, which is currently one of the fastest-growing stablecoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Whale.io launches $WHALE NFT collection on Solana","https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2025/12/16/116789-whaleio-launches-whale-nft-collection-on-solana","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:00:45 GMT","

Whale.io has launched its $WHALE NFT collection on the Solana blockchain, advancing the rollout of its native token ahead of the platform's Token Generation Event (TGE).

The $WHALE NFTs are issued as fully tradable digital cards that introduce a new utility layer to the Whale ecosystem. Each card contains a fixed amount of $WHALE tokens locked on-chain and backed on a 1:1 basis, allowing holders to redeem the NFTs at any time for the underlying tokens. Minting is now live exclusively on mintwhale.io, with secondary trading available on marketplaces including Magic Eden.

According to Whale.io, the new structure positions $WHALE as a hybrid asset, combining the collectible nature of NFTs with the intrinsic value of a native token. While functioning like standard NFTs that can be transferred or sold freely, the cards also provide instant, on-chain verification of their locked token value. Holders can unlock and return the $WHALE tokens to the Whale.io platform whenever needed.

By allowing tokens to be converted into tradable NFTs, the system supports liquidity and sustained community engagement. The cards also lower the barrier to entry for new users, who can access the Whale ecosystem directly through secondary markets without participating in traditional play-to-earn mechanics.

In addition, the NFTs offer a seamless way for existing players to top up their $WHALE balances. Users with low token holdings can purchase cards on secondary marketplaces and redeem them instantly for playable tokens, enabling continued access to games, battle passes, and rewards.

Whale.io emphasized that all $WHALE NFTs remain transparently backed by real tokens at all times, ensuring that value is anchored and fully verifiable on-chain.

Upcoming features include a Staking mechanism (locking liquid $WHALE into cards) and a dedicated Token Swapping interface for one-click redemption. Whale.io has also reaffirmed its commitment to regular market buybacks followed by permanent token burns to support long-term token health.

Community members are invited to follow @Whalegames_en on X for real-time mint updates, secondary market insights, and announcements on future roadmap milestones.","{'href': 'https://www.yogonet.com', 'title': 'Yogonet'}","cryptocurrency"

 By NFTPlazas

Luna Classic (LUNC) and Terra Coin (LUNA) is back in focus as traders brace for the sentencing of Terra founder Do Kwon. The token has traded with heightened volatility, and the latest rebound reflects renewed speculation around one of the most closely watched legal cases in the crypto industry.

Traders increased their positions as speculation returned to the Terra ecosystem. Market data from several exchanges shows higher spot volume, especially from retail-focused platforms in Asia.

The token rose even as most large-cap assets traded sideways. Analysts say the move reflects a typical pattern around major legal events. Short-term traders often attempt to capture volatility when new information is expected.

Despite the rise, liquidity remains weak compared to earlier cycles. Order books show thin depth on both sides, which makes LUNC sensitive to sudden swings. Several analysts warned that a single large order can shift price quickly during these conditions.

Sentiment has also improved online. Social trackers recorded a clear jump in Terra-related mentions. Most conversations focused on the court decision and its possible impact on the long-dormant ecosystem. However, researchers note that the increase came mostly from short-term traders rather than long-standing community members.

The sentencing is shaping up to be one of the most important moments since Terra collapsed in 2022. Regulators have spent years reviewing the fallout from UST's implosion and the losses that followed. Do Kwon now faces allegations involving market manipulation along with multiple violations of financial laws.

Legal experts say the sentencing could influence how courts handle future crypto cases. Regulators worldwide have increased their scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins and high-risk token models. Terra's collapse remains one of the largest failures in the sector, and the outcome of this case may shape future enforcement priorities.

Some investors believe a clear ruling could help close a long chapter of uncertainty. Others fear the opposite. A harsh decision may trigger renewed pressure on assets tied to the Terra ecosystem. Market analysts stress that sentiment will likely move quickly once the verdict is released.

Legal Timeline Overview

The legal timeline has stretched longer than many expected. Each new development has triggered waves of speculation around LUNC. The coming decision is viewed as the final major milestone for this case.

LUNC's latest jump mirrors a pattern the market has seen many times before. The token often reacts to headlines tied to Terra or Do Kwon. Analysts warn that these moves rarely reflect real progress on the network.

The project still lacks a clear roadmap. Developer work is scattered across small teams. Supply remains a major problem despite repeated burn efforts. Liquidity is thin on most exchanges, and institutional interest is almost nonexistent.

Short-term traders may find openings in LUNC's sharp intraday moves, but long-term holders still face a difficult outlook. Analysts note that most of LUNC's activity is driven by sentiment rather than real adoption. Even so, the latest jump shows Terra still holds cultural weight in the market. The community remains vocal, and the token can attract sudden bursts of volume during otherwise quiet sessions. This pattern helps explain why LUNC can rally quickly even when its fundamentals do not show major improvement.

LUNC's current rebound is tied largely to speculation around Do Kwon's upcoming sentencing. Traders expect volatility and are positioning ahead of the court decision. The move has lifted prices in the short term, but the rally is fragile and rests on shifting expectations. Once the ruling is issued, market direction may change fast, and both upside and downside swings remain possible. The next phase will depend less on hype and more on how traders react to the legal outcome.

On 14 October 2025, the Information Commissioner's Office (the ICO) hosted its annual Data Protection Practitioners Conference, with a number of Burges Salmon's lawyers in attendance. 

There was an interesting session delivered on lessons learned from cyber-attacks. The slides from the session are available online here. In this session, the ICO talked about 5 actionable insights coming out of the range of cyber attacks that they have been involved with. 

In the table below, we set out the 5 actionable insights and the comments from the ICO on these. We have also added comments on how these apply to pension schemes trustees. 

The ICO's five actionable insights

No.

Action 

ICO comments

Our comments for trustees

1

Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

MFA mitigates common attack methods such as phishing and password spraying. 

Article 25 – Data Protection by design and by default.

ICO guidance states it should be implemented wherever it is possible to do so. 

 

MFA is a security process that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before gaining access to an account, system or application. 

MFA is an easy win for all schemes. MFA can help trustees maintain the security of the mass amounts of sensitive personal and financial data they manage in a cheap and easy way. 

As well as using this for trustee email accounts, schemes can use MFA where scheme administration platforms or trustee portals are accessed remotely as it helps protect against unauthorised access. 

Vulnerability scanning

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

 

 

 

Trustees should ask questions to determine whether their administrators are carrying out vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. 

While the ICO does not mandate penetration testing be carried out, organisations must identify risks and ensure appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to mitigate against them. As penetration testing is invasive and costly, schemes will need to consider whether this is proportionate for them to carry out themselves. 

We would, however, expect scheme administrators to be conducting regular penetration testing given the volume of scheme data that they process.

Patch management

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

Continuous monitoring and timely remediation of vulnerabilities. 

Critical or high-risk vulnerabilities (based on CVSS score) should be prioritised. 

How is patching approached by your organisation?

Trustees should ask questions to determine whether their administrators have a clear patching policy and that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. 

If professional trustees hold large amounts of personal scheme data, it may be prudent to introduce patch management.

Monitoring and alerting

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

Controls in place to detect unusual or suspicious activity. 

This will likely vary significantly based on the size of the organisation and the data being processed. 

If resourcing is an issue, focus on critical assets. 

Trustees should liaise with their scheme administrators to ensure they have appropriate monitoring in place and that alerts are reviewed and acted upon promptly. 

The importance of this takeaway was highlighted during the Capita breach in 2023 as despite a high security alert being raised within 10 minutes of the breach, Capita failed to effectively respond for 58 hours which allowed the attacker to exploit their system. 

It may be appropriate for professional trustees to establish their own internal monitoring and alerting processes.

Know what you have, know what it holds 

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

The systematic process of identifying, tracking and managing an organisation's assets. 

The ICO have an expectation an Information Asset Register will be in place. 

Consider obligations under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK GDPR. 

As data controllers, trustees should engage in data and asset mapping so that they know what data they are responsible for and where it is. The ICO refers to this as an Information Asset Register. 

Once a scheme has processes in place to map their data and assets, they can understand their cyber footprint. This means understanding who their suppliers are, who their suppliers' sub-processors are and what the flow of data and assets actually looks like for their scheme in practice. 

Once this is understood, trustees can make a risk-based decision regarding the extent to which they would like to review their suppliers (both from a processes and a contractual perspective), which is expected by the Pensions Regulator and the ICO. 

Key takeaways for trustees

The 5 actionable insights from cyber attacks that the ICO has dealt with are an interesting lessons learned piece that trustees should be aware of. From a pensions perspective, the key actions and takeaways are: 

Multi-Factor Authentication: Trustees without MFA should implement it as a priority, both for email use and portal use (where relevant).

Data and Asset Mapping: Schemes should have an up to date data and asset map to understand their cyber footprint. Trustees can then make informed, risk-based decisions on the extent to which they would like to review their suppliers (both from a processes and a contractual perspective). 

Understanding third party processes: Linked to reviewing their suppliers, trustees should be asking questions of their third party suppliers, including their scheme administrators. Based on the ICO's actionable insights, some of the questions to ask include:

whether they carry out vulnerability scanning and/or penetration testing and how frequently; 

whether they have a clear patching policy and that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly; and 

whether they have appropriate monitoring in place and that alerts are reviewed and acted upon promptly. 

How can we help?

We would be very happy to help pension scheme trustees with the key takeaways set out above and with building their scheme's cyber security resilience. Details of our experience in advising pension schemes in relation to cyber security can be found on our dedicated webpage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","HumaTek announces HumaCoin ICO launch, advancing blockchain transparency in humanitarian aid","https://ambcrypto.com/humatek-announces-humacoin-ico-launch-advancing-blockchain-transparency-in-humanitarian-aid/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:06:24 GMT","

For years, questions around where humanitarian aid money actually ends up have followed the sector. Large donation flows often move through layers of organisations, partners, and local operators, making it difficult for donors to see how funds are used once they leave their accounts. That lack of visibility has become a growing point of concern as global aid demands continue to rise.

As a result, HumaTek has announced the launch of the HumaCoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO), the company's latest blockchain initiative, as a possible response to this issue. The token is designed to support on-chain tracking of humanitarian funds by using a multi-chain setup across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon zkEVMe transactions, making them more transparent and traceable. 

Industry estimates suggest as much as 40% of humanitarian funding is lost to fraud, waste, or administrative overhead, contributing to an annual global aid shortfall of roughly $320 billion. While these challenges are not new, they have become harder to ignore as digital finance tools change how money moves across borders in other sectors. The contrast has sharpened questions around why aid funding remains difficult to track at scale.

One reason blockchain keeps coming up in these conversations is its ability to follow money as it moves. In humanitarian settings, funds often cross borders quickly and pass through several hands before reaching the ground, which makes oversight difficult. Putting transactions on a shared ledger is meant to reduce that opacity and make it easier to see how funds are allocated at each step.

As a result, HumaTek's HumaCoin offers that visibility to humanitarian funding, using on-chain records to support transparency without changing how aid organisations themselves operate.

HumaCoin operates on a multi-chain framework across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon zkEVM, networks HumaTek says were chosen to support faster settlement and lower transaction costs. These considerations are particularly relevant in humanitarian contexts, where funding often needs to move across borders without delays or excessive fees.

“Our blockchain-based ecosystem will cut out intermediaries to reduce aid delivery costs, providing faster, more efficient, and more secure aid,” said Tommy LaRocca, CEO of HumaTek. “The public ledger allows donors and organisations to track the flow of funds, ensuring aid reaches recipients and reducing fraud.” The multi-chain framework sits at the centre of how HumaCoin is intended to operate as the platform moves into its public token sale.

HumaTek has minted a total of 2 billion HumaCoins, of which 300 million are available for public purchase during the Initial Coin Offering at $0.04 per token. The ICO can be accessed through three major platforms: ICOHotList.com, ICODrops.com, icoannouncement.com, and humatek.io, the company's own pre-launch website. 

The company has also set aside 400 million coins for HumaClub, its public benefit corporation. These tokens are intended to support global aid initiatives over a 40-year period, allowing for sustained, measurable impact rather than one-off contributions.

HumaTek has already begun putting HumaCoin to practical use through its HumaAID Food Box Program in Tampa, Florida. In partnership with Station House BBQ, the initiative has provided over 1,000 hot meals, all recorded on-chain to track exactly how donations are used.

The pilot program also demonstrates how the different parts of the HumaTek ecosystem come together. HumaCoin acts as the transaction layer, HumaDash provides real-time visibility into fund flows, HumaAID coordinates meal distribution as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and HumaClub supports ongoing community engagement.

Furthermore, the company is working with six major local Tampa Bay charities focusing on issues such as human trafficking awareness, health, poverty relief, and support for wounded veterans, while also sponsoring the Philanthropists of the Year Awards, reinforcing its engagement with the local nonprofit community.

Many refugees, displaced people, and underserved communities struggle to access traditional banking services, making it difficult to receive aid quickly or securely. Crypto wallets negate these barriers, offering a portable, permissionless way for people to receive funds directly, without relying on local banks or extensive documentation.

“Crypto wallets can help financially excluded populations, including refugees and the unbanked,” Tommy LaRocca added. “Accepting crypto donations also allows nonprofits to engage new, tech-forward donors.”

By reducing the need for physical cash and central intermediaries, HumaCoin provides an additional layer of safety and traceability for both donors and beneficiaries. The system allows organisations to reach populations that might otherwise struggle to access assistance, while also opening the door to donors interested in blockchain-enabled giving.

HumaTek is a humanitarian technology company based in Tampa, Florida, focused on improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability in global aid. Its platform combines HumaCoin, HumaDash, HumaAID, and HumaClub to provide traceable, real-time support and long-term engagement.

Founded by veterans of finance and technology, HumaTek works with more than 50 NGOs to reduce fraud, cut costs, and restore donor confidence. By integrating blockchain, AI, and cloud-based SaaS tools, the company aims to make aid more measurable and effective.

As humanitarian aid faces growing demands and persistent challenges, tools that increase transparency and accountability are becoming essential. HumaTek's HumaCoin ICO and its early pilot programs show how blockchain and digital finance can be applied in practical ways, providing both donors and organisations with clearer insight into how funds are used.

While the platform is still expanding, these initial efforts illustrate a greater change in the space, particularly how technology is strengthening humanitarian aid rather than trying to replace it. For HumaTek, the focus remains on measurable impact, long-term engagement, and building systems that help aid in reaching those who need it most.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","South Africa finds no ‘strong immediate need' for a retail CBDC","https://coingeek.com/south-africa-finds-no-strong-immediate-need-for-a-retail-cbdc/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 06:03:37 GMT","

South Africa will not pursue a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), with the country's central bank concluding that there's no “strong immediate need for such an instrument.”

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) recently published a position paper outlining its policy view on a retail digital rand, based on findings from years of research, experimentation, and stakeholder engagement. The paper, supported by a 57-page background note, concludes that the country does not need a CBDC and advocates for it to focus on existing digital payment initiatives.

The top bank says it has the technical capability to develop a retail digital rand that aligns with its policy and regulatory objectives. However, South Africa has made significant strides in digital payments, which SARB believes are better suited to advance financial inclusion.

These efforts include the Payment Ecosystem Modernisation Programme, which aims to overhaul the payment infrastructure and build a secure, faster, and more inclusive system.

“…while the SARB does not currently advocate for the implementation of a retail CBDC, it will continue to monitor developments and will remain prepared to act should the need arise,” SARB states.

In the future, the top bank will explore how a retail digital currency would safeguard access to central bank money and complement existing digital payment solutions, SARB says.

South Africa's outlook mirrors Kenya's; the East African nation's central bank dismissed the need for a retail CBDC over two years ago, saying it was not “a compelling priority in the short to medium term.” Kenya's financial inclusion stands at 85%, with mobile payment services like M-Pesa now used almost universally.

The two are the outliers as other African countries advance their retail CBDC efforts. Ghana has been targeting a 2025 launch of the eCedi, with a banking official recently revealing that the central bank was now ready to launch the digital currency. Nigeria launched its eNaira four years ago, and Uganda recently launched a pilot for its digital shilling.

Like many Western economies, South Africa is shifting attention to a wholesale CBDC.

“This strategic shift reflects the growing global momentum around wholesale applications and their potential to enhance financial market innovation, cross-border payment efficiency and systemic resilience,” the SARB says.










This pivot will allow the bank to leverage the foundational work it has already undertaken, especially its research into DLT architecture. It will also enable the bank to stay current with the latest developments in CBDC programmability, interoperability, and settlement efficiency, the SARB added.

Beyond CBDCs, the top bank's position paper dismissed the use of digital assets and stablecoins in payments. Despite the efforts of companies like Centbee, which offer easy onboarding and thousands of partner merchants, South Africans still consider digital assets as investments.

Largest bank's embrace of China's CIPS causes a stir

While the SARB pivots away from a CBDC, local banks are exploring cheaper and faster cross-border payment systems. The country's largest lender is leading the charge, but its integration of China's yuan-based settlement infrastructure has raised eyebrows.

Standard Bank (NASDAQ: SBGOF) announced earlier this year that it would tap into China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), enabling South Africans to make direct payments to China in yuan. Previously, these payments were routed via correspondent banks and settled in U.S. dollars and euros.

Standard Bank's chief financial officer, Arno Daehnke, has dismissed the concerns, saying the integration was in response to customer demand for faster payments to China.

“We wouldn't be weighed by geopolitics for signing up to CIPS. We have important clients in China, and we bring important clients to other markets across Europe and the Middle East,” he told an investor conference this week.

South Africa is a founding member of BRICS, a bloc that has been alleged to be orchestrating a global de-dollarization campaign. These ties have drawn the ire of the Trump administration, which pledged to slap 100% tariffs on any country that sidelines the greenback.

A year ago, South Africa publicly distanced itself from any de-dollarization campaigns, denying any plans for a BRICS currency.

Discussion about the digital euro has been constantly growing since it was first announced back in 2021, with conflicting narratives and even conspiracies about the currency cropping up online as the months go by. 

The European Central Bank (ECB) describes it as an ""answer in a world of change"", with features such as enhanced privacy, universal acceptance and free basic use, while certain consumers claim it's a tool for the EU to control people's money.

A petition, which has gathered more than 388,000 signatures, was published online in November, calling on MEPs and national governments to reject the digital euro.

But how true are the claims that the digital euro will block citizens from effectively controlling their own money? Euronews' fact-checking team, The Cube, took a look at the evidence.

Last week, the ECB announced plans to ""prepare for a possible rollout of the digital euro by 2029"". 

Initial trials of the digital currency could begin as early as mid-2027 — but only if MEPs approve the necessary regulation in 2026.

The digital euro would be a new form of central bank money — in other words, real money issued by the European Central Bank, but in digital form. 

As things stand, the only way for the public to hold central bank money is in cash. The digital euro would make it possible to hold this same sovereign money in a digital wallet, accessible, for example, via a smartphone.

In practical terms, payments could be made in shops using a phone, much like with a bank card today. However, paying with a digital card and paying with a digital euro are not the same.

Card payments, whether physical or digital, are processed through private banks or payment service providers. The digital euro, by contrast, would be issued directly by the ECB — like banknotes — without intermediaries.

This payment method will be complementary to cash and is not intended to replace it, serving as an additional choice for consumers and businesses.

The project, presented by ECB President Christine Lagarde, is receiving growing political backing. 

At a eurozone summit in October, European leaders called for faster progress to strengthen Europe's monetary sovereignty, economic security and competitiveness in the payments sector.

However, concerns remain over the protection of users' data, particularly when looking through the lens of China, which has been testing its digital yuan on a large scale since 2020. 

In 2024, Chinese authorities continued rolling out the state-issued digital yuan, using it as a tool to monitor and restrict financial activity linked to illegal sectors such as gambling, with transactions subject to oversight through a centrally controlled digital payment system.

The ECB, for its part, says it's committed to striking a balance between traceability and privacy. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also expected to provide safeguards for users of the digital euro, so it's not right to say that the currency will lead to the EU having total control over consumers' wallets.

Belgian economist Bruno Colmant, who has previously warned about the potential risks of control associated with the digital euro, also raised concerns about hacking. 

He told The Cube that ""the entry point for the digital euro is a commercial bank — those dealing with individuals, businesses and public authorities"". This means that ""even without their knowledge, these banks could be used to trace digital euro transactions,"" he added.

That said, he stressed the need for a nuanced debate on the issue. 

The maximum amount an individual would be allowed to hold in digital euros with the ECB is commonly said to be around €3,000. The cap would apply only to digital euro balances and has not yet been finalised in legislation, and it doesn't limit a person's overall assets or bank account holdings. Even so, Colmant said that the risk of some control ""is not zero"".

""There is potentially a loss of privacy protection, because this digital euro could be traced, and it would be possible to know exactly what it is being used for,"" he said.

It should also be noted that no precise legal framework for the digital euro has yet been adopted. MEPs are expected to adopt the relevant regulation by 2026, a prerequisite before any implementation of the project can take place.

Some bankers have voiced concerns and scepticism about the creation of the digital euro. 

The chief executive of the French bank Crédit Mutuel, Daniel Baal, wrote on LinkedIn that the digital euro ""does not meet any clear need for citizens"" and offers ""no substantial advantage over existing payment methods"".

Michael Anseeuw, the chief executive of BNP Paribas Fortis Belgium, told Belgian news outlet L'Echo that the ECB's digital currency project was a ""false good idea"", describing it as ""superfluous"", while pointing to the development of new European payment alternatives such as Wero.

Nevertheless, the ECB says one of the objectives of this complementary currency is to ""reduce dependence on non-European providers"".

The US giants Visa and Mastercard account for around 70% of the card payment market in Europe. Colmant pointed out that Europe's commercial banks ""use Visa and Mastercard, even though the licence is American"".

Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for the Economy and Productivity, has stressed the importance of ensuring Europe's strategic autonomy and avoiding reliance on foreign payment systems, particularly as online commerce continues to grow.

HKEX plans to adopt digital currencies and tokenisation in the next decade, which analysts say are in demand for round-the-clock trading

With Nasdaq seeking US regulatory approval to extend its trading hours to 23 hours, some industry players believe local bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will need to consider a similar move for certain products to enhance its competitiveness.

HKEX chief executive Bonnie Chan Yiting did not mention trading hours in her blog on Monday, but she did say the bourse operator would expand into digital currencies and tokenisation over the next decade, which analysts pointed out were the types of products in demand for round-the-clock trading.

“Trading securities 23 hours a day may not be suitable at the current stage in Hong Kong,” said Robert Lee Wai-wang, lawmaker and chairman of Hong Kong-based Grand Finance Group. “However, HKEX's futures trading should actively explore extending trading hours as many futures markets are already trading 24 hours a day.”

The issue came under the spotlight after Nasdaq, home to tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to extend trading to 23 hours per day, five days a week, up from 16 hours a day now, according to its filing.

“Nasdaq submits its proposal to extend its trading hours to compete for order flow from these investors, as well as to position itself favourably in the future to participate in markets that trade digital assets,” the filing said.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

Visa Inc. announced early Tuesday it is supporting stablecoins as a settlement option for issuer and acquirer banks in the United States, a major move in payment card finance and one observers see as an inevitable next step for the industry, though one that could come with complications.



The use of stablecoins will make settlement “potentially faster, more convenient, and cheaper,” notes Eric Grover, principal at the payments advisory Intrepid Ventures. Now, he adds, “here we have the biggest [payments] network in the world putting its imprimatur on stablecoin settlement. That's a certification, an endorsement, if you will.”
The potential downside, though, could lie in how well the broader merchant, acquirer, and banking world understands stablecoins and how fast they will adopt them. “Outside the crypto world, I wonder what's the scenario where the issuer and the acquirer would prefer to use stablecoins,” Grover says. “That's the question right now.”




For its settlement venture, Visa is relying on USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Group Inc. Cross River Bank and Lead Bank are two initial participating institutions, and have already begun settling with Visa on the Solana blockchain, according to Visa. More banks will be added throughout the year, the network says.



Banks may see further advantages from the pilot. “Today's money movement is fragmented across fiat rails and blockchains. Moving stablecoins requires an intermediary, costly transfers, and disparate ledgers. This process can be improved upon—and that was our goal at Cross River,” notes a spokesperson for the bank.



Stablecoins retain a value pegged to a national fiat currency, often the U.S. dollar. The advantages these coins bring include speed and availability, with settlement transactions flowing seven days a week. The latest venture entails a “bridging,” Visa says, of two systems that have until recently operated in separate worlds, conventional payment networks and blockchain technology.



Visa and its rival, Mastercard, have for years launched pilots of various kinds for cryptocurrency, both in the U.S. and abroad. But the simplicity, speed, and very stability of blockchain-generated coins tied to the value of a national currency appeals to network operators, banks, and, ultimately, merchants, observers say. Now, Visa's latest move means blockchain finance has moved from the margins to the center of payments, according to some observers. “It's in the mainstream,” Grover notes.



Visa has been active in digital currency ventures and pilots for years. Indeed, it recently announced its stablecoin settlement volume has surpassed $3.5 billion in annualized volume, having settled its first stablecoin transaction in 2023.



Now, observers say, this latest venture, coupled with supportive federal legislation passed by Congress last summer, could move more banks to get involved in crypto settlement. “Big, conservative banks won't be early settlement banks, but all of them have their toes in the water,” says Grover. “Stablecoins are fit for purpose. Now the question is, can they get traction in the U.S.?”

But the simplicity, speed, and very stability of blockchain-generated coins tied to the value of a national currency appeals to network operators, banks, and, ultimately, merchants, observers say. Now, Visa's latest move means blockchain finance has moved from the margins to the center of payments, according to some observers. “It's in the mainstream,” Grover notes.



Visa has been active in digital currency ventures and pilots for years. Indeed, it recently announced its stablecoin settlement volume has surpassed $3.5 billion in annualized volume, having settled its first stablecoin transaction in 2023.



Now, observers say, this latest venture, coupled with supportive federal legislation passed by Congress last summer, could move more banks to get involved in crypto settlement. “Big, conservative banks won't be early settlement banks, but all of them have their toes in the water,” says Grover. “Stablecoins are fit for purpose. Now the question is, can they get traction in the U.S.?”
					
									

Banks may see further advantages from the pilot. “Today's money movement is fragmented across fiat rails and blockchains. Moving stablecoins requires an intermediary, costly transfers, and disparate ledgers. This process can be improved upon—and that was our goal at Cross River,” notes a spokesperson for the bank.



Stablecoins retain a value pegged to a national fiat currency, often the U.S. dollar. The advantages these coins bring include speed and availability, with settlement transactions flowing seven days a week.

  NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec.  16, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SRx Health Solutions, Inc. (
  
   NYSE American: SRXH
  
  ) (the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
  

    EMJ Crypto Technologies (“EMJX”)
   

  , a digital-asset treasury platform designed as a treasury operating system, applying quantitative models, artificial intelligence, and systematic risk controls to multi-asset digital treasury management. Upon completion of the transaction, Eric M. Jackson, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of EMJX, is expected to serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the combined company.
 



   A Gen2 Approach to Digital Asset Treasuries:
  

  EMJX is designed as a
  
   next-generation (“Gen2”) digital-asset treasury platform
  
  , differentiated from earlier “Gen1” treasury models that primarily hold a single digital asset on a passive basis. EMJX's Gen2 approach is structured as a platform that governs how capital is allocated, hedged, and reinvested across market cycles, rather than functioning as a passive balance sheet tracking asset values. Gen1 treasury approaches largely rely on price appreciation of a single asset and typically lack systematic risk management, which can expose shareholders to significant drawdowns and dilution during adverse market conditions.
 



   By contrast, EMJX is structured to support:
  



  The Company believes this Gen2 framework reflects the continued maturation of digital-asset treasuries toward more disciplined, institutional-grade capital management models.
 


  Eric M. Jackson, Founder and CEO of EMJX, said, “Every major technology category goes through generational transitions. In digital assets, we believe the next phase is defined by disciplined risk management and multi-asset flexibility rather than single-asset exposure alone. Many digital-asset treasuries today function more like passive markers in the market — they rise and fall with price movements. EMJX is designed to operate more like a vessel with navigation systems, applying quantitative models and AI-enabled risk controls to help manage volatility across market cycles. Our objective is to reinvest capital back into the treasury over time rather than rely on dilution, and to build a transparent, institutional-grade platform with a long-term orientation. Platforms aren't valued on what they hold – they're valued on what they enable.”
 



   Capital Discipline and Treasury Compounding:
  

  As a treasury operating system, EMJX is designed to manage risk and capital allocation at the system level rather than through asset-by-asset trading. The platform applies quantitative risk-management tools, including hedging strategies, with the objective of mitigating drawdowns during periods of market stress.
 


  When these risk-management activities generate excess capital, the Company intends to allocate that capital back into its digital-asset treasury rather than relying on equity issuance, subject to market conditions, governance oversight, and regulatory considerations. The Company believes this approach may allow the treasury to compound over time while reducing the need for shareholder dilution that has historically accompanied single-asset, unhedged treasury models.
 



   Founder Track Record and Market Insight:
  

  EMJX was founded by Eric M. Jackson, Ph.D., a long-time technology investor and market analyst known for identifying inflection points in misunderstood public companies before they became widely recognized.
 


  Over the past several years, Dr. Jackson publicly identified and analyzed a number of non-consensus opportunities that later experienced significant market re-ratings, including Carvana, Opendoor, Better Home & Finance, and Nextdoor. His work around Opendoor helped catalyze a large, engaged retail investor community commonly referred to as the “OPEN Army,” which emphasized long-term conviction, transparency, and platform-level analysis over short-term trading.
 


  That same analytical framework underpins the Rising Dynasty philosophy — a research-driven approach focused on power-law outcomes, structural change, and disciplined risk awareness. EMJX applies these principles to the digital-asset treasury space through quantitative systems rather than discretionary positioning.
 


  Dr. Jackson is a frequent commentator on technology and market structure and has appeared on major financial media outlets including CNBC, Bloomberg, and Fox Business.
 



   Platform Development:
  

  EMJX's digital-asset treasury operating system is powered by its proprietary Quantitative AI and Machine Learning (QAM) Engine, which has been developed and refined since 2021. The QAM Engine is designed to analyze market conditions and inform portfolio-level risk-management decisions across multiple digital assets, subject to governance and oversight.
 


  The Company emphasizes that the platform's objective is risk-aware treasury management, not short-term speculation.
 



   Strategic Rationale:
  

  The transaction is intended to position the combined company at the intersection of:
 


  The Company believes digital-asset treasuries are entering a new phase, where survivability through volatility, disciplined capital allocation, and long-term compounding — rather than simple asset exposure — become the defining competitive advantages. The Company believes the long-term value of EMJX will be driven not by the digital assets held at any point in time, but by the risk-management, capital-routing, and compounding capabilities the platform enables over full market cycles.

 Most likely, you are managing crypto in 2025 with at least two wallets, as many people do. Crypto wallet usage has grown to almost $14 billion in 2024, with the number of user wallet downloads reaching levels last seen during the 2021 peak. In other words, there are more users, meaning more wallets are floating around, each of which may be used for a specific task or set of functions.

You may need one wallet for regular trading, another for long-term storage, and a hardware wallet for your highest-value assets. The question is not whether you will use multiple wallets to manage your crypto, but rather how to make them work well together without creating a mess.

It is not necessary to have more wallets simply because everyone else does. It's essential because each wallet does something better than the other. You may use a mobile wallet for small, quick purchases on your phone, such as coffee or NFTs. On the other hand, a hardware wallet keeps your larger investments safe because it is offline, making it unreachable to hackers. Lastly, the exchange wallet lets you trade and exchange your cryptocurrency without having to transfer funds back and forth between exchanges. AI-driven tools can now help you manage and optimise your wallets more effectively. For example, AI apps can automatically categorise your wallet activity, making it easier to track expenses, investments, and trading patterns.

Security plays a major role in all of this. If you were to lose access to one wallet, the loss would be limited to the amount in that wallet. Therefore, if you had your crypto spread across multiple wallets, you wouldn't lose it all at once. The idea of spreading your assets across various locations is why you wouldn't carry all your money in cash. In 2025, more than $2.17 billion was reported in crypto thefts, with most cases caused by unauthorised access to a user's wallet.

Further, different blockchains require different wallets, too. For example, your Ethereum wallet won't help you much on Solana or Bitcoin. While some wallets now support multiple chains, specialised wallets often give you better features and lower fees for specific networks. When choosing the best crypto wallet for everyday needs, consider which chains you'll use most often and whether you need cross-chain functionality built in. Some of the currently most popular hardware wallets are Ledger and Trezor, while among hot wallets, the trends tend to favour Best Wallet and Exodus. 

Start with a clear plan before you create multiple different wallets and forget which one holds what. Write down what you need each wallet to do. One for everyday spending, one for DeFi activities, one for cold storage. Keep it simple at first. When you set up each wallet, save your recovery phrases separately and securely. Don't store them all in the same place or on the same device. A physical notebook in a safe beats a screenshot folder on your phone any day because it's hackproof.

The majority of DeFi and NFT platforms allow users to connect multiple digital wallets to a single user account. There will most likely be a “Connect Wallet” option on the site. When you click it, you'll select your wallet from the options provided, then confirm the connection in your mobile/wallet application. You are always shown exactly which permissions you are granting for each connection request. Be sure to read them carefully. Some applications only need your digital wallet address and your current token balance, while others may require the ability to spend your tokens. If a wallet is requesting more permissions than necessary, it is considered a red flag and warrants further research of that wallet.

Most platforms also allow users to switch between connected wallets. The majority of platforms display a wallet icon or your digital wallet address in the upper-right corner of the screen. Clicking either the icon or the address will prompt you to view all your connected wallets and select the one you want to use. This allows you to keep multiple wallets active for different functions without having to log in and out of the platform.

Portfolio-tracking apps pull data from multiple wallets and display everything in one place. You connect your wallet addresses (read-only, not full access) and the app shows your total holdings, transaction history, and current values. CoinTracking, Delta, and similar apps save you from checking five different wallets every time you want to see your portfolio.

On top of that, cross-chain bridges let you move assets between different blockchains without going through an exchange. This helps when you need to consolidate funds or use a token on a different network. Bridge usage has grown significantly, with platforms like OKX Wallet reporting a 57% increase in cross-chain feature usage between mid-2024 and mid-2025. Just remember that ignoring transaction fees when you move funds between wallets can shock you. Network fees change based on congestion, so check current gas prices before you transfer anything.

Credit card giant Visa (V) is launching USDC settlement in the United States, letting issuer and acquirer partners settle obligations to the card network in Circle's dollar-pegged stablecoin.

The move marks the U.S. phase of a stablecoin settlement program that has reached a $3.5 billion annualized run rate as of Nov. 30, according to a Visa press release on Tuesday.. 

The new option is meant to give banks and fintechs near-instant funds movement, seven-day-a-week settlement and more predictable liquidity around weekends and holidays, while keeping the consumer card experience unchanged.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like fiat currencies or gold. They underpin much of the crypto economy, serving as payment rails and a tool for moving money across borders. Tether's USDT is the largest stablecon, followed by Circle's USDC.

Initial participants include Cross River Bank and Lead Bank, which are settling with Visa in USDC over the Solana blockchain. 

“Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because our banking partners are not only asking for it – they're preparing to use it,” said Rubail Birwadker, Visa's global head of growth products and strategic partnerships, in the release.

The company said it expects to extend access to more U.S. partners through 2026 and is encouraging interested clients to work through their account teams as availability expands. 

The network is also deepening its ties with Circle by serving as a lead design partner for Circle's Arc blockchain and plans to support Arc for USDC settlement, including operating a validator node once the chain goes live.

Visa first experimented with USDC settlement in 2021 and became one of the first major payment networks to settle transactions in a stablecoin in 2023. Since then, it has added support for more blockchains and stablecoins in its pilot program to give partners flexibility in how they settle VisaNet obligations. 

The new U.S. rollout is aimed at financial institutions, fintechs and treasury teams looking to modernize settlement flows, tighten liquidity management and build programmable money-movement products that bridge legacy banking systems with blockchain-based infrastructure.

The U.S. labor market appears to have continued to soften in recent months as the government caught up to reports that had been delayed due to the shutdown in D.C.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 64,000 in November, according to a Tuesday morning report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist estimates had been for jobs growth of 50,000.

The November unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6%, versus expectations of 4.4% and 4.4% in September.

For October, the economy saw jobs decline by 105,000 versus 119,000 added in September. The negative October print, however, was surely influenced by the government shutdown.

Taken together, the reports paint at least a modestly weaker picture of the employment situation than had been expected.

The price of bitcoin BTC$85,944.78 gave back some of its small overnight gains in the minutes following the report, dipping to $87,000. U.S. stock index futures swung from small gains to small losses and the 10-year Treasury yield was steady at 4.17%.

Ahead of the data, markets were pricing in a 75% probability that the Federal Reserve would hold rates steady at its January meeting. Those odds remained the same shortly following the release.

Cryptocurrencies stabilized after Monday's sharp selloff, with bitcoin BTC$85,944.78 bouncing above $87,000 in the early U.S. session on Tuesday.

The largest crypto climbed about 3% from overnight lows, while ether ETH$2,921.02 was underperforming, ahead just 1.4%. Altcoin majors including BNB BNB$867.23, XRP$1.8818, SUI$1.4998 showed relative strength, gaining 3% to 6% overnight.

Crypto-related equities also rebounded after Monday's panicky action. Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) and brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) were 3%-4% higher, while Circle (CRCL), issuer of the $78 billion USDC stablecoin, jumped 9%.

In a rare occurrence, crypto is outperforming U.S. equities, which are modestly lower across the board on Tuesday, the S&P 500 down 0.5% and Nasdaq off 0.3%.

In the news were delayed U.S. employment reports, with November data showing a troubling jump in the unemployment rate to a four-year high of 4.6%. For the moment, the weakness isn't flowing though to trader expectations for a January Fed rate cut, which remain muted at just a 24% chance.

Tuesday's early action could offer some hope that bitcoin's slide from last week's high above $94,000 has been arrested in the short-term, but at least one analyst sees BTC making new lows soon.

Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at broker XS.com, said that BTC's bounce from the November low of $80,000 to early December was a ""corrective high,"" with the next leg down likely making a fresh low below $80,000.

In a Tuesday market note, he described the current environment as ""fragile,"" with derivatives markets underscoring the caution. Then past two days saw $750 million in long liquidations, including $250 million tied to bitcoin futures, he noted.

""Traders are either stepping aside ahead of the data or being forced out, reinforcing downside momentum,"" Hasn said. ""Without a positive macro catalyst to reset sentiment, bitcoin remains exposed to a deeper flush, with sub-80,000 levels increasingly part of the near-term conversation rather than a tail risk.""



""The market now faces a short-term battle between the delay in monetary easing and the long-term attractiveness of BTC as a store of value,"" said David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21shares. ""Immediate selling pressure may emerge as traders re-evaluate the risk landscape, forcing BTC to defend key support zones,"" he continued. ""Yet, the underlying economic tension reinforces the bullish argument for smart money accumulation: where the Fed struggles to tame inflation without crashing the economy, bitcoin's finite supply becomes an essential asset.""

Heart and Kidney Diseases and Type 2 Diabetes May Be One Ailment

These three disorders could really be “CKM syndrome,” which can be treated with drugs like Ozempic

By Jyoti Madhusoodanan edited by Josh Fischman

Amy Bies was recovering in the hospital from injuries inflicted during a car accident in May 2007 when routine laboratory tests showed that her blood glucose and cholesterol were both dangerously high. Doctors ultimately sent her home with prescriptions for two standard drugs, metformin for what turned out to be type 2 diabetes and a statin to control her cholesterol levels and the heart disease risk they posed.

The combo, however, didn't prevent a heart attack in 2013. And by 2019 she was on 12 different prescriptions to manage her continued high cholesterol and her diabetes and to reduce her heart risk. The resulting cocktail left her feeling so terrible that she considered going on medical leave from work. “I couldn't even get through my day. I was so nauseated,” she said. “I would come out to my car in my lunch hour and pray that I could just not do this anymore.”

Medical researchers now think Bies's conditions were not unfortunate co-occurrences. Rather they stem from the same biological mechanisms. The medical problem frequently begins in fat cells and ends in a dangerous cycle that damages seemingly unrelated organs and body systems: the heart and blood vessels, the kidneys, and insulin regulation and the pancreas. Harm to one organ creates ailments that assault the other two, prompting further illnesses that circle back to damage the original body part.

Diseases of these three organs and systems are “tremendously interrelated,” says Chiadi Ndumele, a preventive cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University. The ties are so strong that in 2023 the American Heart Association grouped the conditions under one name: cardio-kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM), with “metabolic syndrome” referring to diabetes and obesity.

The good news, says Ndumele, who led the heart association group that developed the CKM framework, is that CKM can be treated with new drugs. The wildly popular GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro, target common pathology underlying CKM. “The thing that has really moved the needle the most has been the advances in treatment,” says Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern University. Although most of these drugs come only in injectable forms that can cost several hundred dollars a week, pill versions of some medications are up for approval, and people on Medicare could pay just $50 a month for them under a new White House pricing proposal. The appearance of these drugs on the scene is fortunate because researchers estimate that 90 percent of Americans have at least one risk factor for the syndrome.

More than a century before Bies entered the hospital, doctors had noticed that many of the conditions CKM syndrome comprises often occur together. They referred to the ensemble by terms such as “syndrome X.” People with diabetes, for instance, are two to four times more likely to develop heart disease than those without diabetes. Heart disease causes 40 to 50 percent of all deaths in people with advanced chronic kidney disease. And diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for developing kidney conditions.

At present, around 59 million adults worldwide have diabetes, about 64 million are diagnosed with heart failure, and approximately 700 million live with chronic kidney disease.

The first inkling of a connection among these disparate conditions came as far back as 1923, when several lines of research started to spot links among high blood sugar, high blood pressure and high levels of uric acid—a sign of kidney disease and gout.

Then, several decades ago, researchers identified the first step in these tangled disease pathways: dysfunction in fat cells. Until the 1940s, scientists thought fat cells were simply a stash for excess energy. The 1994 discovery of leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, showed researchers a profound way that fat could communicate with and affect different body parts.

Since then, researchers have learned that certain kinds of fat cells release a medley of inflammatory and oxidative compounds that can damage the heart, kidneys, muscles, and other organs. The inflammation they cause impairs cells' ability to respond to the pancreatic hormone insulin, which helps cells absorb sugars to fuel their activities. In addition to depriving cells of their primary energy source, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in the blood—the telltale symptom of diabetes—further harming blood vessels and the organs they support. The compounds also reduce the ability of kidneys to filter toxins from the blood.

Insulin resistance and persistently high levels of glucose trigger a further cascade of events. Too much glucose harms mitochondria—tiny energy producers within cells—and nudges them to make unstable molecules known as reactive oxygen species that disrupt the functions of different enzymes and proteins. This process wrecks kidney and heart tissue, causing the heart to enlarge and blood vessels to become stiffer, impeding circulation and setting the stage for clots. Diabetes reduces levels of stem cells that help to fix this damage. High glucose levels also prod the kidneys to release more of the hormone renin, which sets off a hormonal cascade critical to controlling blood pressure and maintaining healthy electrolyte levels.

At the same time, cells that are resistant to insulin shift to digesting stored fats. This metabolic move releases other chemicals that cause lipid molecules such as cholesterol to clog blood vessels. The constriction leads to spikes in blood pressure and heightens a diabetic person's risk of heart disease.

The circular connections wind even tighter. Just as diabetes can lead to heart and kidney conditions, illnesses of those organs can increase a person's risk of developing diabetes. Disruption of the kidneys' renin-angiotensin system—named for the hormones involved, which regulate blood pressure—also interferes with insulin signaling. Adrenomedullin, a hormone that increases during obesity, can also block insulin signaling in the cells that line blood vessels and the heart in humans and mice. Early signs of heart disease such as constricted blood vessels can exhaust kidney cells, which rely on a strong circulatory system to filter waste effectively.

The year before Bies's car accident, when she was in her early 30s, her primary care doctor diagnosed her with prediabetes—part of metabolic syndrome—and recommended changes such as a healthier diet and more exercise. But at the time, the physician didn't mention that this illness also increased her risk of heart disease.

Not seeing these connections creates dangers for patients like Bies. “What we've done to date is really look individually across one or two organs to see abnormalities,” says nephrologist Nisha Bansal of the University of Washington. And those narrow views have led doctors to treat the different elements of CKM as separate, isolated problems.

For instance, doctors have often used clinical algorithms to figure out a patient's risk of heart failure. But in a 2022 study, Bansal and her colleagues found that one common version of this tool does not work as well in people with kidney disease. As a result, those who had kidney disease—who are twice as likely to develop heart disease as are people with healthy kidneys—were less likely to be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner than those without kidney ailments.

In another study, researchers found that among people with type 2 diabetes—one in three of whom are likely to develop chronic kidney disease—fewer than one quarter were receiving the kidney disease screening recommended by the American Diabetes Association and KDIGO, a nonprofit group that provides guidelines for global improvements in kidney health.

At present, around 59 million adults worldwide have diabetes, about 64 million are diagnosed with heart failure, and approximately 700 million live with chronic kidney disease. Collectively, these illnesses are the leading cause of death in dozens of countries; the evidence for CKM indicates that the several epidemics may in fact be one.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

One of the first pushes for treating these diseases together came in the late 2000s. That's when Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen was scouring a database from a pharmaceutical company that listed its drug tests, in search of clinical trials of a diabetes drug named rosiglitazone. Across 42 trials, Nissen found, the data revealed a clear increase in heart attacks with the use of the drug. If the drug reduced diabetes, accompanying heart trouble should have gone down, not up, he thought.

A Senate investigation followed this vein of evidence and led to a 2007 advisory panel convened by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The discussions brought about a transformational change in how diabetes drugs were approved: It was no longer enough to simply show an improvement in blood glucose. Pharmaceutical companies would also need to demonstrate that the drugs were not linked to increased chances of developing heart health issues. Clinical trials to test the drugs would need to include people at high risk of heart or blood vessel diseases, including older adults.

Nissen recalls immense opposition to the idea and concern that the bar had been set too high. Those fears were not unfounded—many large pharmaceutical companies “abandoned the search for diabetes drugs” because the trials would take longer to complete and cost more, according to endocrinologist Daniel Drucker of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. “The pharma industry was 100 percent worried about this,” Drucker says.

Drucker, who at the time was studying a promising new group of drugs for diabetes, was concerned about the extra time and expense, too. But in preliminary experiments, the scrutiny for additional conditions began to pay off. In 2008, at about the same time the fda updated its guidance on diabetes drugs, Drucker and other researchers discovered that the new molecules they were investigating seemed to protect mice and rats from heart disease.

“There's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to all of this.” —Nisha Bansal, nephrologist

The new drugs mimicked a small protein named GLP-1, which normally regulates blood sugar and digestion. Small studies suggested it had wider benefits and might protect heart function in people who were hospitalized after a heart attack and angioplasty. At the time, these GLP-1 mimics were being used only as diabetes treatments. But studies in animals suggested they could do more, and subsequent trials in people showed the drugs also protected heart and kidney function. “We might not have discovered these actions of GLP-1 for some time if we hadn't been directed by the fda to really study this,” Drucker says. “In hindsight, it worked out very well.”

The regulations ended up leading to very successful multifaceted drugs. In 2013, the year that Bies had her heart attack, the fda approved the first of a group of medications that act to block a receptor known as SGLT2 in the kidneys. These so-called SGLT2 inhibitors are “almost a wonder drug,” says nephrologist Dominic Raj of George Washington University.

In a series of stunning, large trials, researchers established that these drugs lowered blood glucose, delayed the worsening of kidney disease, and were strongly correlated with reduced risk of several cardiac conditions. These studies also confirmed that cardiac, kidney and metabolic diseases are “more closely linked than we anticipated,” Bansal says. “The SGLT2 trials were really a landmark in this.”

GLP-1-mimicking drugs such as Wegovy have been similar changemakers. A clinical trial of GLP-1 medications was stopped early because the benefits were so overwhelming that it was unethical to continue giving a placebo to patients in a comparison group. In 2024 researchers compared one drug with a placebo in more than 3,500 participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. But instead of looking only at diabetes improvement, they examined kidney and heart conditions as well. The scientists found an 18 to 20 percent lower risk of death in those treated with the GLP-1 drug.

Although the GLP-1 medicines do have side effects (nausea and vomiting are some), within a few short years clinicians found that they had therapies that were designed to protect one organ but also treated others. “Now we have excellent evidence to say that not only will you have better control of your diabetes, and not only will these medicines help you lose weight, but they will prevent or attenuate the risk of developing serious heart disease and serious kidney disease,” Drucker says.

Bies's physician prescribed her the GLP-1 receptor agonist drug Ozempic in 2024. Two months after she began the treatment, her blood glucose levels dipped below the diabetic range. Her heart is healthier, too. Doctors are “very happy with where my numbers are,” she says. And with fewer drugs in her system, Bies feels much better overall.

Not everyone is convinced that the CKM syndrome framework is necessary. Nissen, for one, says it is “a rebranding of a very old concept.” The symptoms and health risks linked to CKM overlap significantly with those of metabolic syndrome, an older term used to describe a similar constellation of health risks, he says.

Ndumele, however, disagrees with that characterization. “Although they are clearly related, CKM syndrome and metabolic syndrome have some very important differences,” he says. For one, the CKM framework encompasses more disease states. And clinicians can use the concept to identify different stages of risk: very early warning signs followed by clinical conditions—including but not limited to metabolic syndrome—and ultimately late stages of CKM, which include full-blown heart and kidney disease. “This is meant to better support prevention across the life course,” Ndumele says. Ongoing studies are testing new ways to identify those at risk of CKM early on and help with preventive care.

Patients such as Bies agree that combining care for the diseases that make up CKM could save lives. For decades she and countless other patients have struggled to manage different aspects of their health. Bies remembers that although all her doctors were affiliated with the same hospital, they didn't communicate with one another or see others' notes about her prescriptions.

A few years ago Bies joined an American Heart Association advisory committee on CKM to inform clinicians and advocate for others who deal with this complex illness, in hopes that speaking up about her own traumatic journey might help others so that “somebody else won't have to wait 10 to 12 years to advocate for themselves,” she says.

At the University of Washington, Bansal and her colleagues are testing an integrated care model in which patients meet with multiple specialists at the same time to chart out their care. It is, she says, a work in progress. “How do we actually improve the rates of screening and disease recognition and get more people who are eligible on therapies to treat CKM disease?” Bansal says. “Although there have been a lot of exciting advances, we're only at the beginning. Integrating care is always a challenge.”

Such integrations are critical to help with early diagnosis—a crucial step in squelching the rise of CKM around the world, according to Ndumele. In the future, even more specialties may need to coordinate. New research already hints at the involvement of other organs and organ systems. Cardiologist Faiez Zannad of the University of Lorraine in France suspects that as researchers glean a clearer picture, CKM syndrome will further expand to include liver disease. Zannad is investigating liver damage in heart patients because it is another common fallout of the same disease mechanisms.

Researchers and patients caution, however, that the move to group different diseases into CKM should not hinder efforts to understand each condition. Each person's course of disease—their initial diagnosis, the complications they are at greatest risk of developing and how best to treat them—can vary. “It's a very broad syndrome, and there will be nuances in terms of understanding subgroups, what the mechanisms are, and how we diagnose and treat patients,” Bansal says. “There's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to all of this.”

Rising Temperatures Could Trigger a Reptile Sexpocalypse

The sex of many turtles, crocodilians, and other reptiles is determined by the temperature at which their eggs incubate. Global warming could doom them

By Elizabeth Preston edited by Kate Wong

The tuatara, a reptile found only on small islands in New Zealand, is facing a dangerous combination of habitat restriction and skewed sex ratio.

Under no light but the stars, a green sea turtle hauls herself out of the surf and onto the familiar sand of Alagadi Beach on the northern coast of Cyprus. She doesn't notice any predators as she makes her way up the beach; tonight will be the night.

When the turtle reaches a satisfactory spot, she nestles into the warm sand and begins excavating a deep pit. Nothing can distract her; she's gone into a kind of trance. She pushes out 100 wet, leathery eggs into the pit. The turtle won't move until she has completed her task, even if humans creep close to measure her shell and tuck a temperature logger in among her eggs. She finishes laying in about 20 minutes, but her work isn't done. Still focused, she spends another few hours laboriously scooping the sand over her eggs. Then she turns around and crawls back into the ocean.

In about two months her babies will emerge from that sand and make a mad dash to the water. They'll have to fend for themselves—their mother is done caring for them. She'll never know the curious fate that befalls her offspring: nearly all of the hatchlings will be female.

Many reptiles differ from typical vertebrates in that their sex is not determined by their genes. They lack sex chromosomes such as the X and Y inside human cells. Instead the temperature of their nest pushes them toward becoming male or female.

For green sea turtles, if the temperature is about 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) during a critical mid-incubation window, the babies will hatch as a half-and-half mix of females and males. But the hotter the nest, the more they will skew female. In the dark sand of Alagadi Beach, the eggs incubate at a toasty 33 or 34 degrees C, resulting in broods that are overwhelmingly female.

The reptiles that have temperature-dependent sex determination—most turtles, as well as all crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators and their kin), some lizards, and a unique creature from New Zealand called the tuatara—belong to lineages that have survived Earth's climatic ups and downs for millions or even hundreds of millions of years. Yet the present day brings a confluence of problems they haven't ever encountered in their long history, including anthropogenic habitat loss and a planetary thermostat gone haywire.

How in the world reptile biology came to rely on temperature to decide the sex of babies is largely a mystery.

Global warming will affect various kinds of reptiles in different ways. Whereas hotter temperatures turn developing turtles female, they have the opposite effect on crocodilians, producing more male hatchlings. Scientists have predicted nearly single-sex generations of alligators by the year 2100.

If rising temperatures mean entire generations of sexually reproducing reptiles will be dramatically skewed male or female, it's not hard to see how they could doom species: mating opportunities will decline; populations might become inbred. Surviving members of a species that's already dwindling from other pressures might not be able to find a partner with whom to make babies. Some species seem to be adapting to the shifting conditions by altering their nesting behaviors. But as climate change accelerates, their continued survival may depend on whether they can keep up.

Temperature-based sex determination is an admittedly strange phenomenon—one that scientists have struggled to explain. Consider the American alligator. Around the summer solstice the alligator mother shoves vegetation from her wetland habitat into a pile to create a nest. She then deposits her eggs in this “glorified compost heap,” as Benjamin Parrott, an ecologist at the University of Georgia, calls it. The eggs are warmed by the slowly decomposing pile. If they incubate at a little below 32 degrees C, they'll hatch as an even mix of males and females. If they incubate above this so-called pivotal temperature, more hatchlings will be male, although if the temperature gets hot enough, the ratio will skew back toward females. “A couple of degrees Celsius makes all the difference,” Parrott says.

How in the world reptile biology came to rely on temperature to decide the sex of babies is largely a mystery. Some of Parrott's research suggests that this type of system can evolve in a species if one sex survives better at warmer temperatures. Sex determination based on temperature has evolved in some fishes, too.

It makes sense for parents to use information about their environment to give their kids an edge. But unlike, for example, the Atlantic silverside—a fish with temperature-based sex determination whose offspring grow up within a year—reptiles such as alligators and turtles mature very slowly. American alligators in South Carolina, for instance, won't start laying eggs until they are 16 years old. Sea turtles might take as long as 40 years to mature. Why should one warm summer dictate the fate of your offspring when they'll need to survive another 16 summers or more before they reproduce? “It's hard to wrap your head around,” says Rachel Bowden, an ecological physiologist at Illinois State University who studies freshwater turtles.

Nor do researchers understand why incubating eggs at their pivotal temperature produces a mix of males and females, because all the eggs have experienced the same conditions. Bowden is investigating the hormones and other molecules that might turn differences of a few degrees into ovaries or testes.

Further complicating the research is the fact that even experts can't always tell whether a baby gator or turtle is a girl or boy. “There's no easy way to sex them,” Parrott says. An alligator's external genitalia won't start to look distinctive for about six months. In the laboratory, scientists have euthanized hatchlings and examined them internally to learn that certain steady incubation temperatures produce certain ratios of males to females. But they usually have to estimate the sex ratios of hatchlings that emerge from nests in the wild under naturally fluctuating temperatures.

Sex determination is even more complex in lizards. Among the several thousand lizard species on Earth, some have temperature-dependent sex determination, whereas others rely on genes. But even in species with sex chromosomes, temperature can influence whether offspring develop into males or females. In the snow skink, a little copper-colored lizard that lives in Tasmania and bears live young, populations that dwell at high altitude have genetically determined sex, whereas low-altitude populations depend on temperature. In the central bearded dragon, native to Australia, warm temperatures can turn chromosomally male lizards into females.

Against this backdrop of unknowns, researchers are racing to learn just how flexible reptiles can be in their nesting habits. During their many millions of years on Earth, reptiles have survived dramatic climate shifts, living through ice ages and intense heat. Alligators and their relatives, for example, managed at least in part by migrating to more favorable climes: The fossil record shows that they moved toward the equator when it was cooler and toward the poles when things heated up. At one point, crocodilians lived in Alaska. But in our human-dominated world, Parrot says, migration might not be a feasible solution. “I don't think people in D.C. are going to tolerate gators in the Potomac,” he says.

In theory, today's reptiles might be able to keep their eggs cool and their sex ratios steady by nesting earlier in the year or in shadier places or by digging deeper in the ground. But that would depend on the animals perceiving the temperature shift—and having the capacity to do things differently.

During the summer nesting season, Sophie Davey becomes nocturnal. She leads the sea turtle monitoring project for the Society for the Protection of Turtles. Nearly every night of the week, she goes to Alagadi Beach at about 7:30 in the evening. Every 10 minutes a team member will walk up and down this beach to check for laying turtles. Both loggerheads and green sea turtles nest here, and this past summer “they've been coming thick and fast,” Davey says, especially the greens.

To avoid disturbing the nesting mothers, the team members do as much as they can in the dark. They use a red light if they need it for something like entering data in a form. Otherwise they have learned to rely on their other senses.

The scent of freshly dug sand is often their first clue that a green sea turtle has arrived. “As soon as that wind hits you and you smell earth, it's like, okay, there's a turtle on the beach somewhere,” Davey says. In contrast, loggerheads, with algae and barnacles clinging to their shells, have a seaweedy smell.

Sounds offer more hints to what's happening in the dark. Fat plops of sand hitting the beach mean a turtle is using her big front flippers to carve out a depression for her body, whereas more delicate scoops indicate she's using her flexible back flippers to dig the egg chamber.

During the turtles' nesting rituals, the team members gather data. They measure the animals, give them identification tags and microchips, and take tissue samples that let them study genetics as well as where the turtles have been living and what they eat at sea. Afterward the workers cage the nest to keep predators away.

As part of its mission, the project is helping to answer questions about how turtles might adapt as the world gets hotter. Since the 1990s green sea turtles have been laying their first nests at Alagadi Beach almost one day earlier each year. Marine conservation biologist Annette Broderick of the University of Exeter in England, who is one of the scientific advisers of the turtle-monitoring project in Cyprus, says the older and more experienced females, who lay multiple clutches in a nesting season, are driving the trend. Nests that are laid earlier stay cooler throughout their incubation. Loggerheads exhibit a similar trend, with experienced loggerhead moms arriving about half a day earlier each year.

In other words, the sea turtles seem to be adjusting their habits in response to warming. “But that can happen only to a point,” Broderick says. The seagrass that the turtles eat, hundreds of kilometers away, may not be available early enough in the year for them to fill up on before heading to the nesting beach.

The nesting beaches themselves may pose their own constraints. Even though the mothers who nest at Alagadi Beach are arriving earlier and earlier, their offspring continue to be almost all females. With its dark, hot sand (and, Davey points out, a constant influx of potentially heat-retaining plastic trash), Alagadi Beach just might not be able to maintain temperatures cool enough to produce males no matter how early the mothers arrive to lay their eggs. Elsewhere on Cyprus there are cleaner beaches with deep, white sand, where a few more males might hatch. Still, all the island's beaches skew highly female.

In any case, a 50–50 ratio of females to males in a brood isn't necessarily the goal. Sea turtles seem to naturally have female-biased nests, Broderick says. Things may balance out because a female will lay eggs only every two to four years, whereas a male can mate every year. In the near term, then, temperatures that produce extra females could actually help sea turtle populations grow.

“Undoubtedly, there will be some positive effects,” Broderick says. “But there will also be some negatives.” Besides producing more female turtles, warm temperatures tend to make reptiles grow faster—so those females might be ready to reproduce sooner. But hot enough nesting temperatures, in addition to leaving those females with almost no potential mates, could make entire clutches fail to hatch.

Ocean-dwelling turtles aren't the only ones changing their habits as the climate warms. Freshwater turtle mothers seem to be adapting their behavior, too. Populations of several different North American turtles have shifted their nesting earlier in recent decades. Slider turtles in Illinois nest more than three weeks earlier in the spring than they did in the 1990s.

In one study, Jeanine Refsnider, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Toledo, brought wild painted turtles from New Mexico, Illinois, Nebraska, Iowa and Washington State to research ponds in Iowa. All of the turtles were pregnant females. They could have sought the ideal nesting conditions for their home climates: females from hot New Mexico choosing shade, those from chilly Washington looking for relatively warm spots, and so on. Yet in Iowa everyone acted the same. The mothers chose similarly shady conditions to build their nests, and their offspring hatched with essentially the same sex ratios.

“They do seem to adjust their nesting behavior quite quickly in response to the current conditions they find themselves in,” Refsnider says. She notes, however, that “if they don't have the habitat availability to express that kind of innate flexibility, then they're in trouble.” In other words, it's not enough for turtle moms to be perceptive and flexible; they also need better options for nesting.

Refsnider is now studying the nesting habits of endangered spotted turtles, which live in swamps and nest in damp, mossy mounds or rotten logs. If researchers can understand turtles' preferences about nesting conditions, then humans can try to manage habitats to help the turtles: adding shade cover, for instance, or hauling in rotting logs so the turtles can maintain a healthy sex ratio as the climate warms. “I don't think it's hopeless,” Refsnider says of the fate of turtle populations on a warming planet. “But it is concerning.”

The situation is more acute for species that are also facing pressure on other fronts. The tuatara is a charismatic medium-size reptile with a Muppet-like face and a row of spines running down its back. It looks a lot like its closest living relatives, the lizards. But it's actually the lone survivor of a separate order of vertebrates that split off from the lizards around 250 million years ago, before mammals had evolved from our reptilian ancestors, the therapsids.

Lately its survival hasn't been easy. Predators introduced by waves of human settlers have eliminated tuatara in much of their original habitat, which once spanned all of mainland New Zealand. Today they live only on about 32 small islands, and climate change is threatening those scattered survivors. Tuatara share the sex-determination pattern of the crocodilians in that warmer temperatures create males, although unlike in crocodilians, no one has found an incubation temperature warm enough to shift the sex ratio of the developing tuatara young back toward female. Predicting how climate change will affect adult tuatara sex ratios is difficult because the reptiles mature so slowly, explains Alison Cree, an emeritus professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand, who has studied the biology and ecology of tuatara. Their eggs may stay in the ground for a year or longer. The adults don't reproduce until age 13 or so.

But because the remaining tuatara populations all live on islands, it's clear that their options for shifting their habitat or habits are limited. On a tiny, treeless bit of land called North Brother Island, the population is becoming increasingly male. Researchers warn that the combination of habitat restriction and skewed sex ratio is setting up the North Brother Island tuatara for a downward spiral known as an extinction vortex that will be very difficult, if not impossible, to escape.

It doesn't help that tuatara tend to return to the same nesting sites they've used before—that behavior is ingrained. But they may be more flexible when it comes to timing. A study at another site, on Stephens Island, found that tuatara nested earlier in years with warmer springs. That shift could help keep their eggs cooler, as it does for turtles. The authors of that study predicted that at least in the medium term, the reptiles could keep their female-to-male ratios steady.

If tuatara sex ratios reach a crisis, Cree suspects it will be a symptom of a larger emergency that's already underway. Once temperatures have climbed high enough to turn most tuatara male, the creatures will also be facing drought, flooding, and a rising sea eating away at their islands.

In that case, we will be losing far more than a charismatic species. Tuatara play significant roles in their ecosystems, Cree explains. If they went extinct, their unique quarter-billion-year-old lineage would disappear, too. “From a perspective of studying reptile evolution, that's a huge loss,” she says. Tuatara are also culturally significant to the Maori, the Indigenous people of New Zealand. Commonly featured in Maori stories, tuatara may signify knowledge or warn of a coming calamity.

Still, next spring the tuatara will do what they always do. The pregnant females will gather in open, sunny areas. Each expectant mother in the shared rookery will use her strong limbs and claws to dig a burrow for her eggs, working across several nights. She'll lay a small clutch, only about 10 eggs. She'll cover her burrow with dirt and vegetation until it's undetectable. For another two weeks or so, the tuatara mother will stay and guard her nest. Then she'll walk away, having done everything she can.

Mysterious Bright Flashes in the Night Sky Baffle Astronomers

Celestial transients shine furiously and briefly. Astronomers are just beginning to understand them

By Ann Finkbeiner edited by Clara Moskowitz

Olena Shmahalo

Long, long ago a cloud of stars circled a galaxy-size black hole, safely at a distance. Then about 200 million years ago one member of the cloud bumped another, a sun-size star, and sent it toward the black hole. The black hole was a million times more massive than the sun-size star, and its gravitational pull proportionately stronger, so the star was drawn closer and closer—until it got too close. Some of the star's gas was pulled into an orbiting stream around the black hole that widened into a flat pancake called an accretion disk. The rest of the star came apart in a sudden and great flash of light.

On September 19, 2019, just before noon, the flash reached the 1.2-meter mirror of the Zwicky Transient Facility in southern California. Astronomers named the flash AT2019qiz and noted that they hadn't seen it three days before. On September 25, 2019, the 10-meter Keck I telescope in Hawaii identified AT2019qiz as a so-called tidal disruption event—a flare-up that occurs when a black hole's gravitational tides rip a small object apart. The star the size of the sun exploded with 10 billion times the sun's luminosity.

But AT2019qiz wasn't finished yet. An entirely unrelated star, maybe from the same cloud, was on an orbit that intersected AT2019qiz's newly created disk. Each time this other star splashed into the disk, it flashed, though less brilliantly than the original, pulled-apart star. In December 2023 the brightness of AT2019qiz (now the name of the disrupted star, the accretion disk and the flaring star that ran into them) peaked, dimmed down and then shot up again—a pattern that repeated nine times. Each flash marked a pass of the interloper through the disk, which occurred every 48 hours. Between 2019 and 2024, astronomers observed AT2019qiz with telescopes on the ground and in space, at wavelengths from x-ray through ultraviolet, optical and infrared. The multitelescope, multiwavelength data together confirmed that AT2019qiz was first a tidal disruption event and then a “quasi-periodic eruption.” Both are examples of phenomena astronomers call transients. Both involved unspeakable violence on unearthly scales. Neither could have been identified 20 years ago.

Transients, which are astronomical objects that appear suddenly from nowhere and usually disappear soon after, contradict the standard truth that the universe changes predictably and slowly over billions of years. They include what the typically staid National Academy of Sciences called “the most catastrophic events in spacetime.” They are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days—which is a combination of size and speed that seems impossible. If we didn't observe them, says astronomer Vikram Ravi of the California Institute of Technology, “you'd never know that physics allows these things to exist.”

But physics says everything not forbidden will, sooner or later and with some probability, happen. And astronomers, noticing these improbable things and knowing that nothing is one of a kind, began to find many more, all at the far reaches of physics. Between 1976 and 2012, the number of transients listed on the International Astronomical Union's official Transient Name Server was around five each year. Between around 2013 to 2015, that number jumped to about 100. Since 2019, scientists have seen roughly 20,000 a year. At press time, the total was 175,953 transients. Chart this rise, and it looks like a long tail with an elephant attached.

The growth has been the result of a large number of astronomical surveys, most still ongoing, “vacuuming the whole sky,” says experimental physicist Christopher Stubbs of Harvard University. For instance, the Zwicky Transit Facility, which started the jump in detections in 2019, scans the entire northern sky every two nights and compares each evening's images with the ones taken two nights before. And the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which came online in 2025, will soon survey the entire southern sky every three nights, identifying changes within 60 seconds of their detection to create near-real-time movies of the sky and finding 10 million changes every day. The elephant will go seriously nonlinear.

With such a large amount of data, astronomers can begin to study credible demographics: that is, they can move from just finding these wild, unlikely creatures to figuring out what they are. Because things that happen once and disappear are hard to study, the transients' identities—the physics that drives them, the processes that produce them—are still speculative. Most of their names are just adjectives, and “when the transient's name is a description,” says astrophysicist Raffaella Margutti of the University of California, Berkeley, “that tells you we know nothing intrinsic about them.” That's about to change.

Scientists sort transients into two main groups: events involving the deaths of stars and events around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The first known transients fell into the former category: they were supernovae, or massive stars that blow up. Before the 1600s, astronomers confidently knew of five of them; now they count tens of thousands. Supernovae fit into two general categories. One kind is the dead core of a star pulling gas from a nearby star, piling up mass until nuclear fusion restarts and goes critical and the whole thing pops off like a 20-billion-billion-billion-megaton thermonuclear bomb, which it is. It explodes in a day, stays bright for days to weeks, and fades out over months.

The other type of supernova is called a core collapse: A star burns through enough of its fuel and is massive enough that the outward push of its radiation loses to the inward pull of its gravity. Its core collapses in on itself so thoroughly that its electrons meld with the nuclei of its atoms until the star is made mostly of neutrons—a neutron star—and it shrinks in the space of one second from a radius of about 6,000 kilometers to about 10 kilometers. The collapse causes a shock wave that breaks out of the star's remaining atmosphere with a flash called a shock breakout, and minutes later the star is as bright as 10 billion suns. It fades out over months; the remnant is called a neutron star.

Beyond these two main categories, though, are many variants—the Transient Name Server identifies 31 types so far. One new kind, called a gap transient, is dimmer and probably less massive than other supernovae, and nobody knows why it explodes. Another is a superluminous supernova, twice as luminous as a core collapse supernova; it has the light of 20 billion suns, and nobody knows why it's so bright. Supernovae are by far the most numerous of the stellar-death transients, but, as astronomer James E. Gunn of Princeton University points out, stars have “a vast number of interesting ways to die.”

In 1967, for instance, the U.S. Vela satellites detected surprising flashes of extremely energetic gamma rays that could have been (but weren't) illegal nuclear tests in Earth's atmosphere; the National Enquirer thought similar flashes seen later might be a space war between alien civilizations. Eventually astronomers pooled data from the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to identify the flashes, which were the first known gamma-ray bursts—a class of transients now understood to be “the brightest of the brightest,” says astrophysicist Peter Jonker of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who observes space in high-energy wavelengths. Their light rises in seconds to the brightness of a trillion suns, and they last for seconds to hours. The fastest ones might be massive stars going supernova, collapsing so thoroughly that they don't stop at neutron stars and instead condense into star-size black holes that aim high-intensity jets of plasma at Earth.

Gamma-ray bursts may or may not be related to other high-energy stellar deaths called fast x-ray transients. Discovered in 2008, they number only around 70, although this tally will soon change. China's Einstein Probe, an x-ray satellite telescope that began collecting data in mid-2025, should find 50 to 100 fast x-ray bursts a year. “The next few years could be dramatic,” says astronomer Mansi Kasliwal of Caltech. Meanwhile, because fast x-ray transients are still rare, no one is ready to say what they are—maybe massive stars exploding, maybe neutron stars colliding before disappearing into black holes.

Another dramatic rarity is called a fast optical blue transient, or FBOT—“fast” because although it explodes at the same outrageous brightness as a superluminous supernova, its light rises and falls not in months but in days. The first FBOT, found in 2018, is officially named AT2018cow and is called Cow for short. Since then, scientists have seen 12 more Cow-like FBOTs. Astronomers know they're not supernovae—“the energy source of the normal supernovae doesn't work” for Cows, Margutti says—but aren't sure what they are. Maybe they flash when a nearby star's mass piles up onto a neutron star or a modest-size black hole, or maybe they represent shock breakouts from a star that puffed up in its later years. “Whatever they are,” says astronomer Anna Y. Q. Ho of Cornell University, who helped to find the original Cow, “they're interesting.”

In 2007 radio astronomer Duncan Lorimer and astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin, who are colleagues at West Virginia University and married, were looking in the archives of a radio telescope survey at a small galaxy 200,000 light-years away. They were interested in pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars that release jets of radio light from their magnetic poles. These lighthouselike jets sweep the sky so that whatever is in their path is exposed to a metronomically regular radio pulse every few seconds to milliseconds.

In the course of their search, Lorimer and McLaughlin found a radio spike that lasted a few milliseconds, but it didn't pulse and was so bright it saturated the telescope's instrument. Lorimer calculated its distance as seven billion light-years away. “Oh,” he thought, “it's really far.” Anything that distant and still that bright had to be sending out a billion times more energy than nearby pulsars.

This odd find is now called the Lorimer Burst. Surveys have since identified several thousand of these so-called fast radio bursts scattered throughout other galaxies, emitting in one millisecond the radio energy sent out by the sun in 100 years. “These things are weird,” Lorimer says.

Some of these possible stellar death transients could be related to a deeply strange object called a magnetar. Magnetars existed only in theory until they were observed in 1998. Their weirdness quotient is high even among transients. A magnetar is a neutron star that “rotates ridiculously fast,” making a full turn in milliseconds, says Daniel Kasen of the University of California, Berkeley, “but with a ridiculously high magnetic field.” The strength of the sun's magnetic field is somewhere around 10 gauss; a magnetar's is 1014 gauss or higher. That field is “so high it's unstable,” Ravi says. “It chaotically reconfigures itself.”

Transients are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days.

The object's magnetic field lines twist and snap and reconnect, and in the process they send out flares. The combination of absurdly strong magnetic fields and absurdly fast rotation leads to lots of explosive physics, Kasen says. In 2004 a flare from one magnetar halfway across the Milky Way ionized the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere. Astronomers know of around 30 of them in our galaxy so far.

“Magnetars are invoked to explain a lot of things we don't understand,” says Brian Metzger of Columbia University, a theoretical astrophysicist who specializes in stellar-death transients. For instance, different transients might be different phases of a magnetar's life. Magnetars might be born in the core collapse of the same massive stars as superluminous supernovae. A supernova might then condense into a pulsar and send out jets that are seen as gamma-ray bursts. Later, when the magnetar's spin period has slowed from milliseconds to seconds, its flares may be seen as a fast radio burst. Magnetars might even explain FBOTs, Ho says, but so far FBOTS are too distant for scientists to be sure.

The stellar-death transients are dying in ways intrinsic to stars. But stars can also die because they're just in the cosmically wrong place, in the nuclei of galaxies with supermassive black holes. These “nuclear transients,” the second overall category of transients, have turned up only in the past decade. They're rare and barely understood.

One reason for that is that nuclear transients “are a minefield of contamination,” says Suvi Gezari of the University of Maryland, College Park. Astronomers must distinguish the flashes of nuclear transients from supermassive black holes whose behavior varies. One percent of supermassive black holes, the quasars, are furiously, actively accreting gas and shine so brightly they can be seen near the beginning of the universe. Most of the rest are inactive and just flickering; they have gravitationally cleared out much of the space around them, and their brightness varies by just 10 to 45 percent. And another, unknown fraction are not accreting at all; they're completely black and invisible.

Nuclear transients are not active quasars, and they don't flicker—they're cosmic flash-bangs. One kind is a tidal disruption event such as AT2019qiz, a star trapped in a supermassive black hole's gravitational field and torn to smithereens. Astronomers have found around 100 tidal disruption events, each visible for a few months in the x-ray, optical and ultraviolet ranges, each with its own small accretion disk that lasts for a few tens of years. Maybe one in 10 tidal disruption events do what AT2019qiz did and become the site of another kind of nuclear transient, the quasi-periodic eruption. In these cases, an errant star passes through the tidally disrupted star's accretion disk and flares up in x-rays to the brightness of a billion suns. Such flares last minutes and repeat in hours to weeks.

Other nuclear transients may not involve stars at all and may reflect odd behavior of the black holes. One kind of transient discovered in the past decade is called a changing-look quasar (CLQ). It has the brightness of a normal quasar but rapidly changes its appearance in unexplainable ways. It should take thousands of years for a quasar to switch off and go from brilliantly active to quietly inactive. Yet astronomers have found dozens to hundreds of CLQs that change their looks by 200 percent in months—they change so much and so quickly that “they're not theoretically explainable,” says astrophysicist Paul Green of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Maybe they're the aftermath of a long-gone tidal disruption event, or maybe, he says, “we haven't watched long enough to see a change of state that's lasting.”

As if CLQs weren't improbable enough, astronomers also find ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), whose problem is in their name: “They're ambiguous,” says astrophysicist Philip Wiseman, who studies nuclear transients at the University of Southampton in England. They are a diagnosis of exclusion, a flash that isn't any other transient. ANTs are brighter than all transients except gamma-ray bursts. Their light rises slowly over months and lasts for two or more years. They've been found in data archives in numbers from a few to hundreds, depending on who's defining them. “We can find them, but we don't know what they are,” says astronomer Matthew Graham of Caltech, another nuclear-transients specialist.

These events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy.

One ANT discovered in 2020 became famous: At first astronomers thought it was an actively feeding supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy, but they couldn't find the galaxy. The lonely supermassive black hole, like a kind of negative island, is somewhere between 10 and 1,000 times the size of the one in the Milky Way. One of its names is ZTF20abrbeie; astronomers call it Scary Barbie.

ANTs could be outsize tidal disruption events—that is, instead of sun-size stars being torn apart by black holes with the mass of a million suns, they might be 10-solar-mass stars torn apart by black holes with the mass of a billion suns. Or they could be supermassive black holes moving from inactive flickering to active fiery accretion—black holes “turning on,” Graham says. Researchers are still looking for Scary Barbie's galaxy. “We're guessing at half this stuff,” Graham adds.

The obvious question is, Are some of these transients somehow aspects of the same thing? For stellar-death transients, the answer is not exactly no. Several of them may be related to one another or to magnetars; in general, they're a menu of the variables that determine how stars end their lives. For nuclear transients, the answer is unsatisfying: either a captured star or a black hole's accretion disk is brightening. For a better answer, astronomers need to collect many more nuclear transients.

Nor can stellar and nuclear transients be put together into a single grand unified theory. Such a picture should be based on their physics—specifically, the source of energy for their outbursts. “The holy grail is understanding what produced the transient,” says Eliot Quataert of Princeton, a theoretical astrophysicist studying nuclear transients. Theorists want to be able to slot energy sources into a few categories, such as radioactive decay, shocks and gravity, although some transients don't seem to fit into any of these boxes.

To figure out the energy sources and maybe unify transients, astronomers need to compare what they see in different wavelengths, which each reflect different physical processes. In supernovae, for instance, ultraviolet light comes from shock breakouts, and x-rays and radio waves come from collisions between matter ejected in the explosion and the surrounding gas. Collecting every possible photon from every physical process allows astronomers to assemble a complete picture of the event.

Accordingly, telescopes now operating in optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray and radio-wave bands are about to be joined by a series of new telescopes in space. Among them are NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will launch by mid-2027 and observe in the infrared; the Einstein Probe in x-ray; and NASA's Ultraviolet Explorer, which will launch in 2030.

You might wonder whether this is a lot of telescopes and effort just to learn about 100,000 one-offs in a universe full of 10,000 billion billion stars in 100 billion galaxies. Understanding transients is important partly for answering other astronomical questions. Supernovae are used as distance markers to enable calculations of the universe's acceleration. Both tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions hold evidence about supermassive black holes that are quiescent and therefore invisible, as well as about the all but theoretical class of black holes whose masses are between those of stellar black holes and supermassive ones. And fast radio bursts, because they are visible in the distant universe, can be used as searchlights to map the distribution of regular matter, of which only 10 percent is known.

But transients are also interesting for their own odd selves, for their ability to teach us what physics doesn't forbid. Kasen says they are “laboratories for fundamental physics and extreme conditions”; they are “physics at the extreme,” Margutti says, “and I can't probe that on Earth.” Transients show “the range of phenomena possible in the universe,” Ravi says.

These events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy released in the time it takes to buy groceries, drink a glass of water or snap your fingers. A supernova shock breakout travels the distance from Baltimore to Western Australia in half an eyeblink. A magnetar passing 160,000 kilometers away could demagnetize every credit card on Earth. A neutron star compresses a massive star to the length of a leisurely two-hour walk. The study of transients is certifiable science, but if it weren't, it would still be reason for near-holy astonishment.

Meet Your Future Robot Servants, Caregivers and Explorers

Robots are poised to play a much bigger role in daily life at home, at work and in the world

By Ben Guarino edited by Clara Moskowitz

Bed making is one household task that could eventually be outsourced to robots such as TidyBot, a project led by Stanford University computer scientist Jeannette Bohg.

Christie Hemm Klok

In the future, a caregiving machine might gently lift an elderly person out of bed in the morning and help them get dressed. A cleaning bot could trundle through a child's room, picking up scattered objects, depositing toys on shelves and tucking away dirty laundry. And in a factory, mechanical hands may assemble a next-generation smartphone from its first fragile component to the finishing touch.

These are glimpses of a possible time when humans and robots will live and work side by side. Some of these machines already exist as prototypes, and some are still theoretical. In situations where people experience friction, inconvenience or wasted effort, engineers see opportunity—for robots to perform chores, do tasks we are unable to do or go places where we cannot.

Realizing such a future poses immense difficulties, however, not the least of which is us. Human beings are wild and unpredictable. Robots, beholden as they are to the rules of their programming, do not handle chaos well. Any robot collaborating or even coexisting with humans must be flexible. It must navigate messes and handle sudden changes in the environment. It must operate safely around excitable small children or delicate older people. Its limbs or manipulators must be sturdy, dexterous and attached to a stable body chassis that provides a source of power. And to truly become a part of our daily lives, these mechanical helpers will need to be affordable. All told, it's a steep challenge.

But not necessarily an insurmountable one. To see how close we're getting to this vision, I visit the Stanford Robotics Center, which has 3,000 square feet for experiments and opened in November 2024 at Stanford University. There I am greeted by Steve Cousins, the center's executive director and founder of the company now known as Relay Robotics, which supplies delivery robots to hospitals and hotels. He believes robots will become indispensable to modern life—especially in areas such as caregiving, which will need more workers as the world's population ages. “Robotics is about helping people,” he says.

In some roles, robots' abilities can surpass those of the flesh and blood. Yet it's also true that there are certain jobs only humans ever could or should do. The Stanford Robotics Center is one attempt to probe that boundary and find out just how many tasks of daily life—at home, at work, in medicine and even underwater—are best offloaded to metal and plastic assistants.

One skill in particular is a significant stumbling block for robots. “The biggest challenge in robotics is contact,” says Oussama Khatib, director of the center. Lots of robots have humanlike hands—but hands are more complex than they seem. Our articulated fingers belong to an appendage built of 27 bones and more than 30 muscles that work in concert. Our sense of touch is actually a synthesis of many senses, relying on cellular receptors that detect pressure and temperature and on proprioception, or our knowledge of our body's location and motion. Touch and dexterity enable humans to outperform current robots at many tasks: although children often master tying their shoes between the ages of five and seven years, for instance, only machines designed specifically to tie shoelaces can do so at all. Many robots rely not on hands but on “jaw grippers” that bring two opposing fingers toward each other to hold an object in place.

Impressive demonstrations of robotic hands, such as when Tesla's humanoid Optimus robot was recorded snatching a tennis ball out of the air in 2024, often rely on teleoperation, or remote control. Without a technician guiding Optimus off-screen, playing catch would be out of the question for the robot.

In the early 1960s the first industrial robot arm—a bulky, 3,000-pound machine—was installed in a General Motors plant in Trenton, N.J. Named Unimate, it was designed for “programmed article transfer,” as its patent describes. In practice, this meant the robot used its gripper to grab and lift hot metal casts from an assembly line. Unimate's proprioception was crude. A handler had to physically move the arm to put it through any desired motion. It could carry out basic tasks, including hitting a golf ball and pouring a beverage from an open can—which a Unimate robot demonstrated for Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show in 1963.

Yet Carson gave the machine's business end a wide berth. Maintaining a respectful distance from robot arms is, after all, a long-standing norm, part of the structured environments that have helped manufacturing robots succeed for the past 60 years. Moving them out of such orderly domains, as the roboticists at Stanford are trying to do, is hard. Khatib says he and his colleagues are “taking robots to a world that is uncertain—where you don't know where you're going exactly and where, when you touch things, you [might] break them.” He seeks inspiration from what he calls human “compliance,” or the way we adapt to our environment by touch and feel. Guided by these principles, he developed a pair of cooperative robot arms equipped with grippers, named Romeo and Juliet.

I spy Romeo in Khatib's lab, powered down and alone; Juliet has recently been shipped back from a museum in Munich and is still boxed up. Khatib recalls becoming nervous when a wealthy computing pioneer visited the university in the 1990s and approached the arms because he “wanted to dance” with the robots. The visitor wasn't hurt, luckily, but that wasn't a guaranteed outcome. “This is our work: trying to discover human strategies,” he says, and then applying them to robots that must operate in a world that includes variables such as spontaneous dancers.

To help robots better feel their way through the world, Monroe Kennedy III, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford, is developing a sensor called DenseTact. The device improves standard grippers by equipping them with a translucent silicone gel tip. When the tip presses against something, the object leaves an imprint in the gel. A camera in the sensor then detects light, produced by an LED embedded in the sensor, reflecting off the interior surface of the silicone. The robot uses the changing light intensity to make a mathematical representation of the surface of the object. In other words, DenseTact enables a robot to “see” what it's touching. One of Kennedy's robots can rub a sheet between two fingers and tell whether the fabric contains one, two or three layers of silk with greater than 98 percent accuracy.

Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a similar system named GelSight. Sandra Liu, as a doctoral student in mechanical engineering there, has shown that GelSight can identify by touch the tiny letters spelling out LEGO on the stud of a toy brick. In a departure from other designs for robot hands, which tend to emphasize fingers, Liu inserted a GelSight sensor into a rubber palm. Palms are underappreciated in robotics, Liu says. “When I grab something large, for example, I'm actually grasping more with my palm than I am with my fingers,” she explains. Liu and her thesis adviser tested robots with various finger-and-palm configurations by having them grasp plastic Fisher-Price toys slathered in paint. A robotic palm that was bendable and covered in compliant gel afforded the best grip on the toys, they found.

Although palms seem promising, Liu acknowledges that the optimal robotic hand might not need to mimic our own anatomy at all. “There's a lot of philosophical debate about whether we're so hung up on the idea of making humanlike robotic hands that we've lost sight of what's actually important,” she says, “which is just a robotic hand that can do a bunch of different tasks.”

To descend into the Stanford Robotics Center is to enter what must be among the nicest basements of any university engineering schools. Bright artificial light beams from fake skylights in its white ceiling, which ripples as if to suggest waves. The rooms, partitioned by glass walls, are themed around domestic, recreational and workplace environments. There's a kitchen where a robot has stir-fried shrimp and put away dishes. In a medical suite, a see-through replica head is threaded with tubes filled with red liquid à la human veins. The idea, Cousins says, is that tiny robots could be guided by magnets through the vasculature to, for instance, remove a blood clot. Outside in the hallway, a quadruped robot rests like a sleeping dog at the end of a sofa. “I think they're teaching it to jump on the couch,” Cousins says.

There is also a dance studio, complete with a wood floor and large mirrors. Here scientists record the movements of human dancers to train virtual robots. “Robots move in the world,” Cousins says. “Who understands how to move in the world more innately than dancers and choreographers?”

Next door, in a bedroom styled with IKEA furniture, two roboticists are testing TidyBot. The one-armed machine uses a parallel jaw gripper to clean up the space. Cameras that ring the ceiling help it determine which object among those scattered around is nearest. Using its onboard camera, TidyBot categorizes each item as, say, a toy, a piece of clothing or a hat. Then it decides where that thing belongs; roboticists determined that TidyBot can put an object in its proper place about 85 percent of the time (better than my human children).

As I watch, the robot deposits a shirt in a laundry basket. Then it finds a hat, grabs it, wheels across the room to a bureau, places the hat on the ground, opens a drawer by gripping its handle, picks up the hat, sets it inside and closes the drawer. Next it turns around, spies a plastic banana, picks it up and sets it on a shelf. In other tests, TidyBot has, with varying levels of success, wiped down a countertop, loaded a dishwasher, closed a refrigerator and watered a plant.

If robots are to truly partner with humans, they will need to master skills that are more ambitious than tending to ficuses. I follow the Stanford Robotics Center's ceiling ripples down a passage that leads to a large pool, still under construction, that will host the merperson-shaped robot OceanOne.

The 500-pound underwater machine has two arms and an anthropomorphic face, which Khatib says is designed to appear reassuring to human divers in murky water, and it tapers into a fishlike rear that sprouts omnidirectional thrusters. Its hands have rubbery fingers that give slightly when squeezed. It's designed to venture deeper into the ocean than scuba divers typically dare. “It is the only [robot] in the world capable of reaching the seabed” and sensing it with haptic feedback, Khatib says.

OceanOne has already navigated the world's deepest swimming pool, in Dubai, where Khatib used it to play chess against a diver. Near the coast of Corsica it explored a sunken Roman ship dating to the second century C.E. There Khatib, onboard a research ship at the surface, remotely piloted the robot's soft fingers to pluck a delicate oil lamp from the ancient wreck. He and his colleagues are working on an upgraded version named OceanOneK, which will be able to dive to a depth of 1,000 meters (almost 3,300 feet).

When OceanOne is diving, its hands are controlled via a tether that links it to a control system and a pilot who wears 3D glasses to see the robot's view. Outside his office, Khatib leads me to a set of similar controls. The apparatus is akin to a pair of parallel video-game joysticks but sleeker and with more degrees of freedom. I grab one in each hand. A scene appears on a computer screen in front of me, showing a ball atop a slab of what looks like gelatin. Khatib asks me to roll the ball across the gel. I move the controller forward, and the ball responds. What feels smooth and instantaneous to me requires hefty computing power. “This is really difficult because we are simulating in real time the deformable membrane, but at the same time you are touching it and feeling it physically,” he says. “Go to the middle and push hard—hard!” I follow his instructions, and the simulated membrane breaks as I drive the ball downward. The response through the haptic feedback is uncanny: it's exactly how I imagine it would feel to press a billiard ball into a tray of Jell-O.

The OceanOne robot's anthropomorphic face is designed to reassure human divers underwater.

Khatib's dream is to put more controllers like this one, attached to more robots like OceanOne, in the hands of many other scientists. He would submerge those robots at various points on the ocean floor to create a submarine fleet scattered around the world. The program would operate similarly to space observatories, where experts from many institutions can visit to take measurements with specialized sensors and return home with their data. “Imagine what you can do,” he says, “for the coral reefs, for plastic, for the environment, for the sea.”

Charmed though I am by such visions, I have an admission: I have a hard time picturing myself using robots in daily life (as much as I'd love a cheerfully beeping R2-D2-style helper). Perhaps it's because my only relationship with a household robot, an automated dinner-plate-size vacuum, ended in disaster. A well-meaning houseguest turned on the robot before she left, unaware of the prep required to robot-proof the apartment. The bot ran over my cat's food bowl and partially ingested some salmon pâté; by the time I arrived at home it had smeared the rest in a brown slug trail across my rug and floors. I was already unsure whether the device was saving me any cleaning time, and after the cat food fiasco, I retired the robot to a closet and never turned it on again.

And there are still issues to work out in the machines at Stanford, as impressive as they are. In one test I observed, TidyBot was supposed to put away a yellow LEGO brick but failed to find it when it was obscured behind a bed. During another demonstration in the center's kitchen, the dishwashing robot, which had previously been working normally, glitched. The reason, after some investigation, was that it got confused by the unusually large number of people watching it that day—its surroundings were so crowded that the machine could no longer detect where to place dishes. The robot is trained through machine learning, so Cousins says one solution might be to train it more frequently to perform with an audience.

Near the end of my tour, a few doors down from the kitchen, in the Field Robotics Bay, a staff roboticist launches a small, cylindrical drone named the Firefly. It lifts off vertically with a sound like a hair dryer set to max. Unusually for a drone, it has only one spinning blade and relies on self-stabilizing systems to remain oriented upright. Cousins pokes the monocopter in the side, and the flying robot wavers and automatically rights itself. His next nudge, though, is a touch too hard. The drone tilts sideways, then shoots off and crunches into a wall.

Cousins pauses. “It should probably turn itself off if it goes horizontal,” he says. The staff roboticist who's been operating the drone appears unfazed as he picks up the scattered pieces of plastic; such are the benefits of housing an experimental robot in a replaceable 3D-printed shell. The crash, though minor, is a reminder of two central truths: robotics is complicated, and, to robots, people are complications. We'll have to wait to see whether humans are a problem that can ever be solved.

These Orcas Are on the Brink—And So Is the Science That Could Save Them

Inside the desperate rush to save the southern resident killer whales

By Kelso Harper edited by Seth Fletcher

Eclipse (J41) is one of 74 orcas remaining in the southern resident population.

Jeffery DelViscio

Like many people who visit San Juan Island, I came here for the orcas. This little patch of forest and farmland off the coast of Washington State is one of the best places in the world to encounter them. But you can't schedule an orca sighting, so on a sunny July day I was killing time, wandering a lush meadow, when a bolt of adrenaline struck: I had missed three calls from Deborah Giles, a researcher at the SeaDoc Society, a marine science nonprofit. The southern residents had been spotted nearby for the first time in months. I had 40 minutes to meet her on the far side of the island.

The southern resident orcas have lived off the coast of the Pacific Northwest for thousands of years. They don't associate with any of the estimated 50,000 other orcas living around the world, even those who share the same home waters. They have their own language, customs and culture, and they are the most studied population of orcas on Earth. But because of human encroachment on the shores and waters of their territory, they are in dire trouble.

I arrived at Giles's mooring just moments before she did. She lives on whale time, meaning she will drop anything to get on the water with southern residents, the focus of her research. She told me she hasn't taken a vacation away from San Juan Island in years—it's just not relaxing. What if the southern residents appear while she's gone?

“Come on, pup, let's go!” Giles called, urging a little brown-and-white dog down the metal dock. The pup, named Eba, appeared immune to being rushed and trotted behind at the farthest extent of her leash, tongue lolling, black eyes squinting in the afternoon sun. As Giles climbed into a small motorboat and took her place behind the wheel, her husband and research partner, Jim Rappold, lifted Eba onto the bow, placing her on a carpeted platform that he built specially for her. Giles's research assistant Aisha Rashid handed everyone life vests and strapped a peach one around Eba. I hunkered down in the back near the boat's onboard wet lab—a large metal box that holds a centrifuge, various vials, and other research equipment.

We sped off through Haro Strait on the western side of the island. The southern residents used to spend so much time swimming up and down this channel that the locals took to calling the routine the “west side shuffle.” The whales would use the strait's steep underwater canyon to corner their preferred cuisine: big, fatty Chinook salmon. But as Chinook populations have declined, so have southern resident sightings near the island.

Over the past century the world around these whales has changed dramatically. Metropolitan centers bloomed on their coastlines, and their core habitat transformed into a bustling waterway. The Salish Sea grew toxic from pollutants, and the fish the orcas evolved to hunt with deadly precision became scarce. In a single whale's lifetime, humans have put the southern residents on a path toward extinction.

Deborah Giles has cataloged the southern resident killer whales that inhabit the waters around the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest for more than two decades. She is an orca researcher at the SeaDoc Society.

Giles and other scientists have devoted their careers to understanding and reversing the decline of this ancient population. By building out a picture of the whales' health, habits and diet, researchers are deciphering the many ways humans impact their lives and guiding conservation actions that may mean life or death for the orcas. But the research itself is now at risk, too. Actions by the Trump administration threaten to stall, diminish or stop a swath of conservation studies at a crucial juncture for southern residents—and for other populations that hang by a human-made thread. “The science is endangered now,” Giles said, “just like the whales.”

Orcas, like humans, are cosmopolitan animals. We live on every continent; orcas live in every ocean. Much like us, the whales have adapted to environments from the icy Antarctic to the balmy Gulf of California by being smart, social creatures. They pass down knowledge about where to forage and how to hunt. They share food and collectively care for their young. They even have their own cultural trends. In the 1980s, as human teens donned parachute pants and leg warmers, southern resident adolescents took to wearing dead salmon “hats” on their heads.

With big, wrinkly brains and high levels of intelligence, orcas seem likely to have complex internal lives. “They're clearly very smart animals; they're just different from us,” says Amy Van Cise, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who studies orcas and other cetaceans. “Killer whales don't write books, but killer whales can echolocate. Can you echolocate?” In 2018 a southern resident whale named Tahlequah made headlines for carrying her deceased newborn for 17 days in what became known as a “tour of grief.” The mother traveled nearly 1,000 miles with her baby draped over her forehead or held gingerly in her mouth; in January 2025, when another calf died, Tahlequah repeated the ritual.

Also like us, orcas are deeply familial creatures. Resident killer whale offspring stay with their mothers for their entire lives, forming a nearly inseparable family group called a matriline. A handful of matrilines together form a pod; pods are led by older females, who can live for a century, more than twice as long as most males.

The southern residents comprise three pods: J, K and L. Historically the pods spent much of April through October in the Puget Sound and near the San Juan Islands, often gathering as a “superpod.” In colder months the pods tend to split up and spend more time on the outer coasts of Washington State, Oregon and even California. No matter how far apart, though, the pods are tied together by their shared language, diet, habits and behaviors—a culture distinct from that of any other population.

Humans and killer whales share a long, complicated history. Indigenous communities of the Pacific Northwest lived peacefully alongside orcas for thousands of years. Each tribe has its own relationship with the animals, whom they generally view as sacred—often as guardians of the sea or as family members under the waves. But settlers who arrived in the 1800s took a different view: orcas became feared and reviled as a source of competition for fishers, a vermin species to be avoided or, better yet, exterminated.

Then, in 1965, the world's first captive performing orca, Namu, opened hearts—and wallets—at the Seattle Marine Aquarium. The whale's surprisingly gentle nature (he even let his captor, Ted Griffin, ride on his back) shocked and enraptured onlookers. Soon aquariums around the globe began putting in orders for their very own killer whale, and over the next decade more than 50 orcas were captured from the Salish Sea or killed in the process. Most of these whales were southern residents. By the time the practice ended in the mid-1970s, the population had shrunk to just 71 whales.

Scientists initially had hope that the southern residents would recover. Their numbers rebounded to 98 whales by the mid-1990s. “Then, all of a sudden, we started to see this decline,” says Kim Parsons, a supervisory research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

At the time, Parsons was studying the southern residents as an undergraduate and could recognize every individual. Over the course of six years a fifth of southern residents died, including Parsons's favorite whale, J3. “He had this really cool dorsal fin,” Parsons says. “It almost looked like it was on backward.” The precipitous decline couldn't be explained by the generational losses of the captive era alone. What was going on with the southern residents?

After millennia of relative quiet, the Salish Sea is now one of the busiest waterways in North America. Around nine million people live in the surrounding drainage basin, meaning ample urban, industrial and agricultural runoff has made its way into the water. When researchers began digging into the southern residents' decline, they found an alphabet soup of toxic chemicals in the whales' blubber: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Pollutants accumulate in the flesh of animals at every level of the food chain, but they get concentrated at higher levels, and orcas sit at the very top.

But this couldn't have been the full story, because neighboring orcas that share much of the same habitat didn't experience the same decline. These other whales, known as transients—also called “Bigg's” killer whales after pioneering orca researcher Michael Bigg—eat mammals, which are a level higher on the food chain than the fish eaten by residents, so they tend to accumulate even more pollutants. The key difference: Transient orcas had plenty to eat. Southern residents did not.

Transients' favored prey—such as seals, sea lions and porpoises—have proliferated since the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 made hunting them illegal. But a combination of river damming, habitat destruction, overfishing and pollution has caused numbers of the southern residents' preferred prey, Chinook salmon, to plummet since the 1980s. Eight populations of Chinook made their way onto the endangered and threatened species lists before the southern residents joined them in 2005.

“Killer whales don't write books, but killer whales can echolocate. Can you echolocate?” —Amy Van Cise, University of Washington

In her early research, Giles found that the southern residents' lack of prey is compounded by the nearly constant disturbance the orcas experience from boats in and near the Salish Sea. The jetlike sounds of container ship engines can reverberate for miles, and many boat engines emit noise in the same frequency range that the whales use to communicate. In 2008 Giles helped to develop an acoustic device that she attached to the backs of orcas with suction cups, allowing her to eavesdrop on the whales as they hunted. She found that in noisy waters, “females will just say, ‘Screw it. I'm not even going to try to forage,'” she says. “Males will try but miss because if vessel noise is too loud, it masks the whales' ability to echolocate and find food.” The northern resident killer whales provide another comparison: they spend more time in quieter, less polluted waters off the coast of British Columbia, and their numbers have doubled since the capture era.

Today 74 southern residents remain. Decades of research have identified these three factors—pollution, vessel disturbance and lack of food—as central to the decline of the southern residents. But each of these evolving threats is a universe unto itself, with countless variables and unknowns.

The boat motor roared, and a whitewater mist prickled my skin as we neared the northern edge of Haro Strait. The sea was smooth, protected on all sides by forested islands. A towering container ship heaved across our path, and its exhaust joined a yellow-green haze that hung low across the otherwise cloudless sky. Then, just after we cleared the ship's roller-coaster wake: “Whale!” Rappold shouted.

I whipped around just in time to glimpse a giant black-and-white body crashing back into the sea. Giles smiled—we had found the southern residents.

Like corn kernels in slowly heating oil, the orca sightings began sparse and unpredictable. But at some imperceptible moment, things shifted; suddenly black fins, white tails and entire submarinelike bodies were popping out of the water just a few hundred feet away.

Research biologist Kim Parsons first studied the southern resident orcas in the early 1990s, just before the population experienced a steep decline. Parsons works at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

Jeffery DelViscio

Giles called out behaviors for Rashid to document. “Spyhop!” she yelled when a whale periscoped its enormous head out of the water and sank back down. “Tail slap!” Giles shouted as an orca's fluke rose up and smacked the water's surface.

As the boat neared the whales, Giles pulled out three laminated sheets from behind the steering wheel. They bore photographs of a few dozen gently rounded dorsal fins—snapshots of each of the southern residents. Giles examined the fins and saddle patches (a swirly white marking behind the dorsal fin) to identify these whales as part of J-pod. But we'd found only a handful of the 27 pod members, which was unusual. Giles told me that the pods had been splitting up more in recent years, perhaps as a “divide and conquer” strategy to make the most of scarce food.

“Baby breach!” Giles called as a small body (by orca standards) shot out of the water, arced in the air and smacked back down with a belly-flop splash. A second, roughly one-ton baby followed suit. In a stroke of luck, we'd found the two southern resident calves who had survived this year. Two others hadn't made it.

At the bow of the boat, Rappold watched Eba closely. The dog's demeanor was shifting. Her body became stiff, alert, and her ever-wagging tail dropped low. She stretched over the bow, leaning her snout as close to the glassy surface as she could manage. An orca leapt out of the water in the distance, but no one looked up. All eyes were on Eba now—she had caught the scent of killer whale poop.

“Let's find it!” Rappold said, egging Eba on.

It is hard to collect whale poop. First, of course, you have to find the whales. Then one has to poop, and you need to find that poop before it sinks, gets dive-bombed by seagulls or breaks up in rough water. That's where Eba comes in: her powerful nose helps Giles home in on scat while she follows the whales at a distance.

As a scent-detection dog, Eba helps Giles home in on floating killer whale poop for collection and analysis. The researchers can measure a given orca's levels of hormones and toxic chemicals, among other factors.

Jeffery DelViscio

But orca poop is worth the effort because it is a data treasure trove. With just a pea-size glob of scat, biologists can genetically decode which individual whale produced the sample. They can measure that whale's levels of toxic chemicals and catalog the bacteria and parasites in its microbiome. Hormone analysis reveals whether the whale was pregnant, and successful pregnancies are a key marker of population health. As they accumulate data over years, researchers are fleshing out a picture of southern resident health to clarify exactly how pollution, vessel disturbance and lack of prey cumulatively impact the orcas' bodies. This work may also reveal new threats—a new contaminant or bad bacteria, perhaps—and identify struggling whales early on.

Scientists also use scat samples to get a detailed look at what these orcas eat. Until the early 2000s, researchers could study orca diets only by cutting open the stomachs of recently deceased animals or happening on them mid-hunt. Scat samples are easier to come by (relatively speaking) and provide more detailed information.

By checking fragments of DNA in a sample against a library of fish genomes, Parsons and Van Cise can identify the exact species a whale ate over a roughly 24-hour period and in what relative amounts—for instance, 60 percent Chinook salmon, 30 percent chum salmon, 10 percent halibut. Their research has shown that although the southern residents eat mainly Chinook, they also rely on a mix of other species that fluctuates throughout the year. Chum and coho salmon in particular appear to be more important than previously thought in the late summer and early fall. But the researchers still need more samples, especially between October and April, to get a full picture of the southern resident diet. Giles says it's important to know all of what the whales eat—and where and when—to ensure that they have what they need year-round. If, for example, fishery managers knew the southern residents typically eat a lot of chum in the Puget Sound in November, they could theoretically adjust the harvest of that stock to account for the whales' needs.

“The science is endangered now, just like the whales.” —Deborah Giles, The Seadoc Society

Whining softly, Eba began crab-shuffling over to the right side of the bow. Giles turned the boat to follow her path. When Eba shuffled back to the left, Giles swerved again. They followed this zigzag pattern to stay in the “scent cone” of the feces, homing in closer with each pass.

Eba became even more restless. She propped her front paws on the bow and yelped like a capuchin. (I silently wondered whether that's how she got her nickname, “Fluffy Monkey.”) We had to be getting close. Giles slowed the boat, and Rappold searched the water intently.

“Hit, hit, hit!” Rappold yelled. He tossed a handful of cereal puffs in the water to mark what he saw. Giles cranked the boat back around, leaned out from behind the steering wheel and squinted past a bright glare on the water. A trail of bubbles floated in a choppy slick, iridescent in the slanting sunlight.

“Well, what do you think?” Rappold asked Eba softly. He turned back to Giles.

“It's very weird,” Giles said. They scanned the dark surface for any signs of scat. The boat bobbed idly, water lapping against it. The outboard engine hummed. Eba barked. The hopeful, frenetic energy from moments before began to fade with the slick. Giles decided there was nothing for us to collect; we should move on.

With just a small amount of scat, scientists such as Amy Van Cise can examine the state of an orca's health and analyze its diet in great detail. Van Cise teaches at the University of Washington.

Jeffery DelViscio

Giles turned the boat around and pointed us back toward the orcas. Eba grew frenzied as we pulled away, yelping and barking, stomping around the bow and looking up expectantly at Rappold. She had sniffed admirably, but Eba doesn't get her reward—playtime with a rope toy—until Giles successfully collects a scat sample.

Giles tried to console Eba. “Good job, let's find the next one!” Eba barked at her twice. “Phew, she's mad,” Giles murmured, steering us toward the dorsal fins on the horizon.

As important as other species might be in the southern residents' diets throughout the year—and as eager as Giles and her collaborators are to know about them—Chinook still make up the bulk of the orcas' diets. But Chinook conservation is enormously complex. There are dozens of Chinook populations across hundreds of rivers from California to Alaska, each facing unique challenges, such as impassable dams, overfishing and urban development. And at each stream and tributary, it takes a lot of research, time and effort to demonstrate that Chinook conservation is a worthwhile priority for the species itself and for the whales.

To this end, Parsons and Van Cise are working to tease even more detail from the genetic mayhem of whale poop and identify which salmon runs the southern residents rely on most. “If we can target our management to specific rivers,” Van Cise says, “that might make it easier to conserve the right populations.” With proper funding, she says, they could probably tackle this genomic conundrum in the next few years. But with the way science funding plummeted in 2025, it might not happen at all.

Days after Donald Trump took office in 2025, his second administration began hollowing out federal science agencies, and it aims to shrink them further in 2026. Already the administration has canceled thousands of research grants totaling billions of dollars. “I've watched funding source after funding source just shutter its doors,” says Van Cise, who relies almost entirely on funding from NOAA, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Naval Research. She says she's lucky that she hasn't lost any current grants, but she also hasn't received any new grants—and her funding is starting to run out. This is a crucial time for her; as an early-career research professor, she is just now establishing herself in the field. “If research funding continues the way that it is,” Van Cise says, “I could watch my career die before it really even gets off the ground.”

In March 2025 Giles applied with partners at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance for an NSF grant to fund three years of an ongoing research project. Together, the researchers use drones to fly through an orca's blow and collect samples of its breath, which adds a new dimension for studying the animal's health and microbiome. They are also beginning to use infrared cameras to see whether the whales are suffering from illness or injury (hot spots can signal inflammation). But less than a month after the group submitted its application, the NSF returned it—unopened. Giles was told that was the fate of more than half of NSF applications at the time.

NOAA is central to the conservation of all endangered marine species. Staff scientists conduct research, and managers craft recovery plans, designate critical habitat, and work with states, tribes, and other nations to preserve vulnerable species. In 2025 the Trump administration thinned the agency by more than 2,000 employees through layoffs, early retirements and a deferred-resignation program. One such employee was Lynne Barre, the southern residents' recovery coordinator for two decades. Barre hadn't been planning to retire at 55 years old, but with the mass firings of probationary employees, the frozen budgets, “the uncertainty and the chaos,” she felt it was her best option. Barre says a colleague likened the situation to being on a pirate ship that someone lights on fire: “Then your choice is to walk the plank and either jump off yourself or be stabbed in the back [until you] jump off.” The Northwest Fisheries Science Center and the West Coast Regional Office—where the majority of 's southern resident work takes place—lost almost 30 percent of their staff in 2025, including many researchers with decades of expertise. “That's a huge hit to our workforce,” Barre says.

So where does that leave the southern residents? All the scientists I spoke to agree: the southern residents don't have time to spare. “It's a critical time,” Parsons says. “The population has been at this fairly low-level status for a long time, and that's not a great sign.” In 2025 Washington State enacted a new regulation requiring boats to stay at least 1,000 yards away from the southern residents; at that distance a whale tail looks smaller than a sesame seed. (Research vessels like Giles's can travel within 50 yards of the whales.) The goal is to allow the whales to hunt more easily, without a cacophony of boat motors muddying their echolocation. Van Cise says it took years of research to support this intervention, and it will take years—and more research—to see what impact it has. Barre says the same will be true for any actions related to the whales' health or diet. “If we don't have that strong foundation of science, we're not going to make very good decisions,” she says, and with such a small group of whales, there is a thin margin between recovery and the “vortex of extinction”—the point of no return.

Toward the end of our encounter with the southern residents, a mother and baby beelined toward our boat. Their slick black bodies surged rhythmically out of the water every 10 yards or so. Giles turned off the motor, and we all fell silent—except Eba, who yelped and whined. The whales emerged with heavy sighs just a few yards away. The baby tumbled around at the surface, flipping her white belly to the sky and rubbing up against her mother's back. She rolled onto her side and flapped one little pectoral fin out of the water. When her mother ducked back down and began to swim away from us, she followed.

Giles didn't collect any scat samples that day. As the whales headed south at sunset, we peeled off toward San Juan Island. There were no southern resident sightings for the rest of the week.

On my last night with Giles, we visited the place where locals used to see orcas almost every day of the summer: Lime Kiln Point State Park. It sits on the western side of the island and is home to a stately white lighthouse, a food truck (The Blowhole: Snacks with a Porpoise) and the spot we were headed to—Orca Whale Watching Point. It's where Giles saw orcas for the first time, in 1987.

Giles led us to a craggy mound of rock at the edge of the water. The last ripe orange rays of sun snuck under her hat and tangled with the wind in her hair. She sat quietly, gazing just offshore at tasseled heads of bull kelp bobbing in the surf.

“I remember looking out to the ocean, and all of the southern residents were right there,” Giles recalled, “foraging just right here, right off the kelp bed.” Below the dark, jagged water in front of us, the seafloor plummeted to nearly 1,000 feet—the deepest channel in the San Juan Islands. It was a rare place where both humans and orcas gather, just a few yards apart.

“Four decades of time that I've known about these whales, and I have just watched them fail to recover,” Giles said, looking down at a photo of her 18-year-old self kneeling on the same rocks, an orca frozen mid-breach behind her. “I'll just keep trying to figure out how to help them so we can see breaching whales right off Lime Kiln again, every day.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Were Excavating an Ancient Site—And Discovered a Cube-Shaped Skull","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69679560/cube-skull/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Humans have been modifying their skull shapes since prehistory, but the discovery of a cube-shaped skull has researchers scratching their (round-shaped) heads.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nearly every corner of the world contains archaeological evidence of the ancient practice of artificial cranial deformation. The Huns of Central Asia are a well-known example, but so are the Hirota people of ancient Japan, the Maya of Central America, and even members of the peasant class in Toulouse, France, around the end of the 19th century. Today, some cultures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Vanuatu in the South Pacific still practice the tradition. 

Most of these examples—both historical and contemporary—form pointed skulls by binding an infant's head while the skull bones fuse (typically up until the age of two). It's not incredibly common to see a cube-shaped skull, but the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) recently reported one such discovery in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas near the Balcón de Montezuma—an archaeological site occupied by various ethnic groups between 650 B.C.E and 1200 C.E.

One of these communities, around the year 400 C.E., contained roughly 90 houses and a variety of artifacts. As the archaeologists sifted through these finds, they discovered what appeared to be a parallelepiped, or cube-shaped, skull. Artificial skull deformation was a common practice among the Maya, but hasn't been documented in this particular site. 

“Not only was intentional cranial deformation identified for the first time for this type of site, but also a variant with respect to the models recognized in Mesoamerica, not reported, until now, in the area,” biological anthropologist Jesús Ernesto Velasco González said in a translated press statement. Velasco González noted that similar deformations occurred at the El Zapotal archaeological site in Veracruz, located further south along the Gulf of Mexico, so scientists tried to piece together potential migration leaks. However, those didn't quite pan out. 

“Stable oxygen isotope studies in collagen and bioapatite samples from bone and teeth, a technique used to infer the geographic origin of the second individual's skeletal remains, indicate that he was born, lived, and died in this part of the mountains,” Velasco González said in a press statement. “Therefore, the results rule out a direct mobility relationship with the groups of El Zapotal or those further south.”

The reasons why the people of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica—or any people, for that matter—practiced skull formation are almost as varied as the people groups themselves. Sometimes it was a marker of social hierarchy, sometimes it was a religious rite, and sometimes it was just for aesthetics. Although the health effects are debated, it's largely believed that this practice doesn't decrease the size of the skull, and as such, health impacts are mostly negligible (though some research has asserted that the practice could impact cognitive or memory function).

Vessels brimming with coins suggest a convenient method of hiding savings underground.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There was (obviously) no such thing as online banking 1,700 years ago. While the ancient Romans did adopt early banking systems from ancient Greece, the most convenient way to put aside cash that would have simply been transfered into a savings account over a thousand years later was remained stashing it in a vessel that was later buried.

Wherever the Roman Empire spread, its customs came with it. The empire and all its wealth extended through France, and archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) have now unearthed three clay amphorae overflowing with coins. Found at a site in Senon, northeastern France, makeshift piggy banks were buried in a pit beneath the lime concrete floor of what was likely someone's living room. The research team found more than 40,000 coins, weighing about 183 pounds in total. Some had been deposited in the necks of the jugs even after the containers were buried.

“Contrary to what one might think at first glance, it is not certain that these are ‘treasures' that were hidden during a period of insecurity,” numismatist Vincent Geneviève, who studies ancient currency, said in a statement from INRAP. “Many other explanations are possible, and these deposits should be seen instead as a snapshot of complex monetary management, planned over the medium to long term, within a household or administration, capable of making deposits and withdrawals at various intervals.”

At the time, Senon was populated by the Mediomatrici tribe, whose name translates to “middle mother,” and is probably a reference to the middle goddess of the three mothers worshipped in northwest Europe during the Roman era. These Celtic people, or Gauls, lived in the region during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar's forces conquered parts of Belgium, France, and Switzerland between 57 and 50 B.C.E. Caesar fought the Gauls when a subgroup known as the Helveti (from what is now Switzerland) began to migrate and clash with Roman allies. According to Caesar's own account of the Gallic Wars, Celts near the Rhine (probably including the Mediomatrici) clashed with German tribes. 

The vessels and coin hoards found by the reasearcher date from much later, around the late 3rd to early 4th century C.E. Geneviève found some 23,000 to 24,000 coins in the first amphora (weighing a total of 83 pounds), and 18,000 to 19,000 in the second amphora (weighing a total of 110 pounds). Only three coins remained in the third vessel.

Researchers who found coins stuck to the outer face of one vessel realized that they had been added to the hoard before the pit was filled with sediment. The Mediomatrici settlement in which the vessels were found had been burned to the ground in the 4th century and rebuilt, only to be reduced to ashes again, and these artifacts were there before the fires. That can only mean that they had been there before the Romans conquered.

Because the reserves of coins were buried between 280 and 310 C.E., it is thought that they may be associated with the Roman military occupation at Senon—whether they belonged to Roman warriors or Mediomatrici, however, is unclear. The artifacts were buried at a time when urban growth began to trigger a shift in building practices and materials, and the living space, as a result, was made of limestone bricks (limestone was a plentiful resource in this part of France at the time). Rooms are separated by brick walls, with multiple pits that may have been latrines or spaces for storage. What they were actually used for will be determined by lab analysis.

It seems that Senon was heavily influenced by its Roman conquerors. Impressions on the coins appear stylistically Roman, and the ruins at the site reflect an affluent city with a public square, courtyards, temples, baths, and even a theater. Its inhabitants may have been artists or merchants. INRAP officials, therefore, do not think that there was a rush to bury these coins because of impending disaster. The fact that the tops of the amphorae were almost at ground level indicates that they were supposed to be easily accessible for deposits or withdrawals.

“Their exceptional nature lies less in the discovery of a large quantity of coins (some thirty coin hoards are known in the Meuse department alone) than in the possibility of documenting their depositional context so precisely,” Geneviève said, “which is rare.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find the missing links between genes and disease","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251215084201.htm","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:30:39 GMT","

Biomedical scientists are racing to identify the genes that contribute to illness, hoping that these discoveries will lead to treatments that target the right genes and help bring the body back to health.

When one faulty gene is responsible, the path to understanding the problem can be fairly direct. Many conditions, however, are far more complicated. In these cases, multiple genes, sometimes even thousands, play a role, and it becomes much harder to sort out how they connect to the disease.

A new genomic mapping approach could make that challenge easier to tackle. In a Nature study, researchers at Gladstone Institutes and Stanford University used a broad strategy that tests the impact of every gene in a cell, linking diseases and other traits to the underlying genetic systems that shape them. The resulting maps could cut through confusing biology and spotlight the genes most likely to be useful targets for new therapies.

""We can now look across every gene in the genome and get a sense of how each one affects a particular cell type,"" says Gladstone Senior Investigator Alex Marson, MD, PhD, the Connie and Bob Lurie Director of the Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, who co-led the study. ""Our goal is to use this information as a map to gain new insights into how certain genes influence specific traits.""

Finding the 'Why' Behind Genetic Risk

For years, scientists have relied heavily on ""genome-wide association studies,"" which scan the DNA of thousands of people to find statistical links between genetic differences and traits, including disease risk. These efforts have generated enormous datasets, but turning those signals into clear biological explanations can be difficult, especially for traits influenced by many genes.

""Even with these studies, there remains a huge gap in understanding disease biology on a genetic level,"" says first author Mineto Ota, MD, PhD. Ota is a postdoctoral scholar in Marson's Gladstone lab, as well as in the lab of Stanford scientist Jonathan Pritchard, PhD. ""We understand that many variants are associated with disease; we just don't understand why.""

Mineto compares it to having a map with a clear starting point and endpoint, but no routes connecting the two.

""To understand complex traits, we really need to focus on the network,"" says Pritchard, a professor of Biology and Genetics at Stanford, who co-led the study with Marson. ""How do we think about biology when thousands and thousands of genes, with many different functions, are all affecting a trait?""

Combining Cell Experiments With Big Population Data

To dig into that network problem, the researchers pulled information from two databases.

One dataset came from a human leukemia cell line that is commonly used to study red blood cell traits. In earlier work, an MIT researcher who was not involved in this study had switched off each gene in that cell line, one at a time, and tracked how losing that gene changed genetic activity.

Marson's team then paired those results with UK Biobank data, which includes genomic sequences from more than 500,000 people. Ota searched for individuals with genetic mutations that lowered gene function in ways that changed their red blood cells.

Putting the two sources together allowed the researchers to build a detailed map of the gene networks that influence red blood cell traits. The picture that emerged showed a remarkably complex genetic landscape. With this approach, they could see the starting point, the destination, and the intricate set of connections in between.

They also discovered that some genes affect several biological processes at the same time, weakening certain activities while increasing others. One example is SUPT5H, a gene associated with beta thalassemia, a blood disorder that disrupts hemoglobin production and can lead to moderate to severe anemia. The researchers connected SUPT5H to three key blood cell programs: hemoglobin production, cell cycle, and autophagy. They also showed how the gene influences each program, either increasing or reducing gene activity.

""SUPT5H regulates all three main pathways that affect hemoglobin,"" Pritchard says. ""It activates hemoglobin synthesis, slows down the cell cycle, and slows down autophagy, which together have a synergistic effect.""

Why This Mapping Method Could Matter for Immunology

Being able to reveal the detailed genetic pathways that control how cells function could reshape both basic biology and drug development.

Although the team identified multiple ways gene networks shape blood cell behavior, the bigger story is the tool itself. The research group, and potentially many other scientists, can now apply the same strategy to other human cell types to uncover the molecular patterns that drive disease.

For the Marson lab, which focuses on T cells and other parts of the immune system, the method could open the door to many more discoveries.

""The genetic burden associated with many autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and allergies are overwhelmingly linked to T cells,"" Marson says. ""We look forward to developing additional detailed maps that will help us really understand the genetic architecture behind these immune-mediated diseases.""

The study, ""Causal modeling of gene effects from regulators to programs to traits,"" appears in the December 10, 2025 issue of Nature.

Mosasaurs were enormous marine reptiles that lived more than 66 million years ago, but new evidence shows they did not spend all their time in the ocean. Researchers analyzing a mosasaur tooth discovered in North Dakota have found strong signs that some of these animals lived in rivers. The tooth likely came from an individual that grew up to 11 meters long. Led by scientists at Uppsala University, the international research team concluded that mosasaurs adapted to freshwater river systems during the final million years before their extinction.

The tooth was uncovered in 2022 from a river deposit in North Dakota. It was found alongside a tooth from a Tyrannosaurus rex and a jawbone from a crocodylian, in a region already known for fossils of the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus. The unusual mix of land dinosaurs, river-dwelling crocodiles, and a giant marine reptile immediately stood out. If mosasaurs were ocean animals, how did one of their teeth end up preserved in a river?

Isotopes Provide the Answer

To solve this puzzle, researchers from the United States, Sweden, and the Netherlands examined the chemical makeup of the mosasaur tooth enamel using isotope analysis.

Because the mosasaur tooth, the T. rex tooth, and the crocodylian jawbone all date to roughly the same time, about 66 million years ago, the scientists could directly compare their chemistry. The work was carried out at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) in Amsterdam and focused on isotopes of oxygen, strontium, and carbon. The mosasaur tooth contained unusually high levels of the lighter oxygen isotope (16O), which is typical of freshwater environments rather than marine ones. Strontium isotope ratios also pointed to a freshwater habitat.

""Carbon isotopes in teeth generally reflect what the animal ate. Many mosasaurs have low 13C values because they dive deep. The mosasaur tooth found with the T. rex tooth, on the other hand, has a higher 13C value than all known mosasaurs, dinosaurs and crocodiles, suggesting that it did not dive deep and may sometimes have fed on drowned dinosaurs,"" says Melanie During, one of the study's corresponding authors.

""The isotope signatures indicated that this mosasaur had inhabited this freshwater riverine environment. When we looked at two additional mosasaur teeth found at nearby, slightly older, sites in North Dakota, we saw similar freshwater signatures. These analyses shows that mosasaurs lived in riverine environments in the final million years before going extinct,"" says During.

When Seas Slowly Turned Into Rivers

The findings also help explain how this lifestyle shift became possible. Over time, increasing amounts of freshwater flowed into the Western Interior Seaway, a vast inland sea that once ran north to south across what is now central North America and split the continent in two. As freshwater input grew, the seaway gradually changed from salty to brackish and eventually to mostly freshwater, similar to conditions seen today in the Gulf of Bothnia. The researchers suggest this process created a 'halocline', with lighter freshwater forming a surface layer above denser saltwater. Isotope data supports this idea.

""For comparison with the mosasaur teeth, we also measured fossils from other marine animals and found a clear difference. All gill-breathing animals had isotope signatures linking them to brackish or salty water, while all lung-breathing animals lacked such signatures. This shows that mosasaurs, which needed to come to the surface to breathe, inhabited the upper freshwater layer and not the lower layer where the water was more saline,"" says Per Ahlberg, coauthor of the study and promotor of Dr. During.

Adapting to a Changing World

The researchers argue that the teeth studied clearly belonged to mosasaurs that had adjusted to these new conditions. Large predators shifting between habitats is not unheard of in evolutionary history.

""Unlike the complex adaptation required to move from freshwater to marine habitats, the reverse adaptation is generally simpler,"" says During.

Modern animals show similar flexibility. River dolphins live entirely in freshwater even though their ancestors were marine. The estuarine crocodile, known in Australia as the saltwater crocodile, regularly moves between rivers and the open ocean, hunting wherever prey is available.

A Bus-Sized Predator in Unexpected Places

Mosasaur fossils are common in marine deposits across North America, Europe, and Africa dating from 98-66 million years ago. In contrast, they are rarely found in North Dakota, making this discovery especially striking. The size of the tooth suggests an animal up to 11 meters long, roughly the length of a bus. Earlier discoveries of mosasaur bones at a nearby site support this estimate. The tooth likely belonged to a prognathodontine mosasaur, although its exact genus cannot be identified. Close relatives in the genus Prognathodon had massive heads, powerful jaws, and robust teeth, and are thought to have been opportunistic predators capable of attacking large prey.

""The size means that the animal would rival the largest killer whales, making it an extraordinary predator to encounter in riverine environments not previously associated with such giant marine reptiles,"" says Ahlberg.

The research was carried out by scientists from Uppsala University in collaboration with Eastern West Virginia Community and Technical College, Moorefield, West Virginia, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and the North Dakota Geological Survey. The article draws on a chapter from Melanie During's doctoral thesis, which she defended at Uppsala University in November 2024.

All living organisms adapt in order to survive, and bacteria are no exception. Over many decades, some bacteria have gradually become resistant to widely used antibiotics and disinfectants, creating serious challenges for medicine and public health. At the same time, countless bacterial species play a helpful and often critical role in keeping the human body healthy. This raises an important question. Instead of trying to eliminate bacteria, could scientists find ways to influence how they behave to reduce disease and improve health?

Bacteria are far from silent. Inside the human mouth, roughly 700 different bacterial species constantly exchange information through a process called quorum sensing. This chemical communication allows bacteria to coordinate their actions as a group. Many oral bacteria rely on signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to send and receive these messages.

Investigating Bacterial Communication in Dental Plaque

Researchers at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences and the School of Dentistry set out to explore how bacteria in the mouth communicate and whether that communication could be deliberately disrupted. Their goal was to determine if interfering with these signals could help prevent plaque buildup and support a healthier oral microbiome. The findings, published in the journal npj Biofilms and Microbiomes, suggest this approach could reshape how doctors think about treating bacterial diseases.

Key Findings From the Study

The researchers discovered several important patterns in how oral bacteria communicate and organize themselves:

Dental Plaque as a Living Ecosystem

""Dental plaque develops in a sequence, much like a forest ecosystem,"" said Mikael Elias, associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences and senior author of the study. ""Pioneer species like Streptococcus and Actinomyces are the initial settlers in simple communities -- they're generally harmless and associated with good oral health. Increasingly diverse late colonizers include the 'red complex' bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are strongly linked to periodontal disease. By disrupting the chemical signals bacteria use to communicate, one could manipulate the plaque community to remain or return to its health-associated stage.""

""What's particularly striking is how oxygen availability changes everything,"" said lead author Rakesh Sikdar. ""When we blocked AHL signaling in aerobic conditions, we saw more health-associated bacteria. But when we added AHLs under anaerobic conditions, we promoted the growth of disease-associated late colonizers. Quorum sensing may play very different roles above and below the gumline, which has major implications for how we approach treatment of periodontal diseases.""

Toward New Microbiome-Based Treatments

The researchers plan to next examine how bacterial signaling differs across various regions of the mouth and among patients at different stages of periodontal disease. ""Understanding how bacterial communities communicate and organize themselves may ultimately give us new tools to prevent periodontal disease -- not by waging war on all oral bacteria, but by strategically maintaining a healthy microbial balance,"" said Elias. The team believes this strategy could eventually lead to therapies for other parts of the body, where imbalances in the microbiome are linked to illness and certain forms of cancer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Living cells may generate electricity from motion","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251216081930.htm","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:26:10 GMT","

Scientists have developed a new theoretical explanation for how living cells might generate electricity on their own. At the center of the idea is the cell membrane, the thin, flexible layer that surrounds every living cell and controls what enters and leaves it. Rather than being a static barrier, this membrane is constantly moving and reshaping itself at very small scales. The new framework shows that these tiny motions can give rise to real electrical effects.

The research was led by Pradeep Sharma and his colleagues, who built a mathematical model to explore how physical forces inside cells interact with biological activity. Their work focuses on how motion at the molecular level can translate into electrical signals across the membrane.

Molecular Activity That Makes Membranes Move

Inside every cell, proteins are constantly changing shape, interacting with other molecules, and carrying out chemical reactions. One important process is ATP hydrolysis, which is how cells break down adenosine triphosphate to release energy. These active biological processes do not happen quietly. They push and pull on the cell membrane, causing it to bend, ripple, and fluctuate.

The model shows that these ongoing membrane movements can trigger a phenomenon known as flexoelectricity. Flexoelectricity occurs when bending or deformation in a material produces an electrical response. In this case, the bending of the cell membrane can create an electrical difference between the inside and outside of the cell.

Voltage Levels Comparable to Nerve Signals

According to the framework, the electrical voltages created across the membrane can be surprisingly strong. In some cases, they can reach up to 90 millivolts. That level is notable because it is similar to the voltage changes seen in neurons when they fire electrical signals.

The timing also matches what happens in the nervous system. The voltage shifts can occur within milliseconds, which aligns closely with the shape and speed of typical action potential curves for neurons. This suggests that the same physical principles could play a role in how nerve cells communicate.

Driving Ion Movement Against Natural Gradients

The theory goes further by predicting that these membrane driven voltages could actively move ions. Ions are electrically charged atoms that cells use to send signals and maintain balance. Normally, ions flow along electrochemical gradients, meaning they move from areas of high concentration to low concentration.

The new model suggests that active membrane fluctuations could push ions in the opposite direction, working against those gradients. The researchers connect this behavior to specific properties of the membrane, including how stretchy it is and how it responds to electric fields. These properties help determine which direction ions move and what type of charge they carry.

From Single Cells to Tissues and New Materials

Looking ahead, the authors suggest that this framework could be expanded beyond individual cells. By applying the same principles to groups of cells, scientists could explore how coordinated membrane activity leads to larger scale electrical patterns across tissues.

The researchers argue that this mechanism offers a physical foundation for understanding sensory perception, neuronal firing, and even how living cells might harvest energy internally. It may also help bridge neuroscience with the development of bio inspired and physically intelligent materials, offering new ways to design systems that mimic the electrical behavior of living tissue.

The powerful earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28, 2025, has given researchers an uncommon chance to observe how some of the planet's most dangerous fault systems behave, including faults similar to California's San Andreas. Earthquakes are usually chaotic and difficult to study, but this one occurred along an unusually straight and geologically ""mature"" fault, creating nearly ideal conditions to examine how energy is released during a major continental rupture.

Scientists have long struggled to observe earthquakes that behave in such a clean and predictable way. The Myanmar event stood out because its fault geometry removed many of the complications that typically obscure how seismic energy moves through the Earth.

Investigating the Longstanding Shallow Slip Deficit Mystery

An international research team led by The University of New Mexico focused on understanding how mature faults behave during large earthquakes, with special attention on a debated phenomenon called the ""shallow slip deficit."" In many earthquakes, surface movement is far smaller than the motion that occurs deep underground. This gap has raised questions about whether some of the energy is absorbed by surrounding rock or simply goes undetected.

By closely analyzing the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, the researchers aimed to determine how energy moves along an ancient, relatively simple fault system and whether deep motion is fully transferred to the surface.

The study, titled ""Mature fault mechanics revealed by the highly efficient 2025 Mandalay earthquake,"" was published in Nature Communications. It was led by UNM Assistant Professor Eric Lindsey, working alongside collaborators from Taiwan and Myanmar.

Studying a Major Earthquake From Space

Because Myanmar is currently affected by armed conflict and the earthquake caused further damage to infrastructure, researchers were unable to quickly conduct on-the-ground investigations. Instead, they turned to satellite-based observations to collect the data needed for their analysis.

""We used two primary satellite technologies: Optical Image Correlation (using Sentinel-2 satellites) to track how pixels in satellite photos moved between two images collected before and after the quake, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) using Sentinel-1 satellites, which measures the change in distance to the ground from the satellite between two consecutive passes. These tools allowed us to measure ground shifts with incredible precision without setting foot in the danger zone,"" explained Lindsey.

How InSAR Reveals Ground Movement in Extreme Detail

InSAR functions like a sophisticated version of ""spot the difference,"" using radar signals to detect extremely small changes in the Earth's surface from orbit. As a satellite circles the planet, it sends radar waves toward the ground and records the returning signals.

""By comparing the time it takes for the signal to bounce back to the satellite from each point on the ground, we can detect changes in the ground's elevation or position down to a fraction of an inch. It allows us to map exactly how the Earth warped over an area hundreds of miles wide, day or night, and through clouds,"" Lindsey said.

This approach allowed the team to reconstruct the earthquake's impact across an enormous region with remarkable accuracy.

A 500-Kilometer Rupture Unlike Most Earthquakes

The rupture caused by the Myanmar earthquake extended for nearly 500 kilometers. To visualize that scale, it is similar to a crack stretching from Albuquerque to Denver, with the ground on either side suddenly sliding past each other by 10 to 15 feet.

""Most earthquakes we study break much shorter fault segments -- perhaps 30 to 60 miles long. It is incredibly rare and scientifically significant to see a rupture that is this long, continuous, and straight,"" Lindsey said.

Such a long, uninterrupted rupture provided scientists with an exceptional natural experiment.

A Fault System Comparable to California's San Andreas

The earthquake occurred along the Sagaing Fault, which is a strike-slip fault. In this type of fault, the two sides move horizontally past one another, similar to cars scraping by each other on a highway.

""This is just like the San Andreas fault in California,"" Lindsey said. ""We also describe the Sagaing fault as 'mature,' which means it has been slipping in the same way for millions of years. Over that vast time, the rough edges and bends in the fault have been ground down. Because it is so smooth and straight, the earthquake rupture could travel very efficiently across a huge distance.""

This long history of motion has shaped the fault into a structure that allows seismic energy to move with little resistance.

No Missing Energy at the Surface

For decades, researchers have observed that many earthquakes show far less movement at the surface than deep underground, a phenomenon known as the ""Shallow Slip Deficit.""

""We found that in the 2025 Mandalay earthquake, this deficit was non-existent. The massive amount of slip that happened miles underground was transferred 100% to the surface,"" Lindsey explained.

This result contrasts sharply with many recent earthquakes where surface motion was reduced because energy was spread across networks of small fractures rather than concentrated on a single fault.

""This shows that on mature, smooth faults, the energy is highly focused and comes right to the surface,"" Lindsey said. ""This is significant because it means the ground shaking near the fault line might be more intense than our current hazard models predict for these types of faults.""

How One Earthquake Linked Multiple Fault Segments

The research also revealed that the rupture was able to connect several fault sections into one continuous 500-km event, passing through boundaries that scientists previously believed might halt an earthquake.

""We found that the fault followed a historical pattern: it slipped less in areas that had experienced earthquakes in the 20th century and slipped the most in areas that hadn't broken since the 1800s,"" Lindsey said. This behavior is known as ""slip predictability"" and suggests scientists may be able to estimate how much movement could occur on fault segments that have not yet ruptured.

Such insights could improve long-term earthquake forecasting and preparedness efforts.

Why Satellite Science Matters for Global Safety

The study demonstrates the growing power of satellite-based observation. Even in a conflict zone where traditional fieldwork was not possible, researchers were able to produce one of the most detailed analyses of earthquake mechanics to date.

""It's a testament to how global scientific collaboration and open data access (like the Copernicus Sentinel missions) can help us understand natural hazards that affect millions of people,"" Lindsey said. ""The significance lies in safety. This earthquake showed us that mature faults can be much more efficient at transmitting energy to the surface than younger ones, which has direct implications for how we build infrastructure to withstand the 'Big One' in the United States.""

Applying These Methods Closer to Home

Lindsey noted that New Mexico sits on a very different fault system known as the Rio Grande Rift, which is pulling apart inside of sliding sideways.

""The remote sensing techniques we refined in this paper are the exact same methods we can use to monitor safety issues close to home,"" he explained.

By using InSAR to track land subsidence caused by aquifer depletion in New Mexico, as well as slow ground movement related to the rift and deep magma body inflation beneath Socorro, researchers can help state officials better plan for future risks.

""Understanding the physics of 'mature' faults helps us understand the general mechanics of the earth's crust, which improves earthquake hazard models globally,"" Lindsey concluded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Physicists found a way to see heat in empty space","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251215084213.htm","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:42:45 GMT","

Scientists at Stockholm University and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali have outlined a realistic strategy to observe one of the most unusual ideas in modern physics: the Unruh effect. This effect predicts that an object that is speeding up (accelerating) would experience empty space as slightly warm. In practice, however, producing enough acceleration to directly heat something is far beyond what laboratory experiments can achieve. The researchers instead describe how this extremely weak effect could be transformed into a distinct, precisely timed burst of light.

The basic setup is easier to picture than the underlying physics. Consider a collection of atoms placed between two parallel mirrors. These mirrors can influence how quickly the atoms release light. Under the right conditions, the atoms stop acting independently and instead emit light together, like a choir singing in unison -- much louder than solo singers. This phenomenon is known as superradiance.

According to the new work, if the atoms experience the subtle warmth associated with the Unruh effect, that influence gently shifts their behavior. The result is that the collective flash of light occurs slightly earlier than it would if the atoms were not accelerating. This advance in timing becomes a clear and measurable sign of the Unruh effect.

Turning a Whisper Into a Clear Signal

""We've found a way to turn the Unruh effect's whisper into a shout,"" said Akhil Deswal, a PhD student at IISER Mohali. ""By using carefully spaced high-quality mirrors, we make ordinary background signals quieter while the acceleration-seeded burst comes out early and clean.""

An important advantage of this approach is that it dramatically reduces how much acceleration is needed. Without high-quality mirrors, the required acceleration would be far greater and well beyond practical limits.

Why Timing Makes the Difference

""Timing is the key,"" added Navdeep Arya, a postdoctoral researcher at Stockholm University. ""The choir of atoms is not only louder but also shouts earlier if they feel the faint Unruh effect-related warmth of empty space. That simple clock-like marker can make it easier to separate the Unruh signal from everyday noise.""

By focusing on when the light appears rather than how intense it is, the method offers a new way to isolate the desired signal from background effects that normally overwhelm it.

Connecting Laboratory Experiments to Extreme Physics

By tackling a detection problem that has challenged physicists for decades, the proposal helps narrow the gap between standard laboratory equipment and phenomena usually associated with extreme environments. Since acceleration and gravity are closely linked, similar timing-based methods could eventually allow scientists to study delicate quantum effects driven by gravity -- right on the lab bench.

The research, co-authored with Kinjalk Lochan and Sandeep K. Goyal of IISER Mohali, has been published in Physical Review Letters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Colon cancer is surging in younger adults and doctors are alarmed","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251215084232.htm","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:34:43 GMT","

Colorectal cancer has long been viewed as a condition that primarily affects older adults. That assumption is changing as more cases are now being diagnosed in younger people, a shift that is raising concern among health experts around the world. Public awareness increased sharply after the death of actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 at age 43, which highlighted the growing number of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases occurring in people under 50 and challenged long-standing ideas about who is most at risk.

As Colon Cancer Awareness Month draws attention to this trend, researchers are examining the forces behind the rise in early-onset CRC. At the same time, advances in genetic testing are opening new possibilities for prevention and earlier detection.

Rising Rates of Colorectal Cancer in Younger Adults

A large international study published in The Lancet Oncology found a clear increase in CRC diagnoses among younger adults. From 2013 to 2017, incidence rates rose in 27 of the 50 countries included in the analysis for people under the age of 50. Although the highest numbers continue to appear in North America and Europe, notable increases were also reported across Eastern Europe, South-Central and Southeastern Asia, and South America.

Researchers believe this global pattern reflects broad changes in daily life, including shifts in diet, reduced physical activity, urban living, and environmental exposures. Specialists emphasize that earlier screening, healthier eating habits, and stronger public education are essential to slow this trend. Without effective intervention, experts warn that early-onset CRC cases are likely to continue rising over the coming decades.

Lifestyle and Diet Linked to Increased Risk

Research increasingly points to diet as a major contributor to colorectal cancer risk. High intake of ultra-processed foods, red and processed meats, and sugary drinks has been associated with inflammation and a greater susceptibility to cancer.

One example comes from Kazakhstan, where a population study found that average meat consumption was almost double the World Cancer Research Fund's recommended limit of 500 grams per week. The same study showed that only 8.6% of participants consumed fish at recommended levels, a pattern that may contribute to nutritional imbalances linked to higher cancer risk.

Obesity is another important factor tied to CRC. Excess body fat can drive chronic inflammation and interfere with normal metabolic processes. However, researchers note that obesity's role may be more complex than it appears. An analysis of 18 studies revealed that many CRC patients experience unintended weight loss before diagnosis, suggesting that standard measures used to assess obesity-related risk may not fully capture its impact.

Genetic Factors and Inherited Cancer Syndromes

Genetics also plays a significant role in early-onset colorectal cancer. According to Dr. Alexei Tsukanov, head of the Laboratory of Genetics at the National Medical Research Center for Radiology, many younger CRC cases are linked to inherited cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. These disorders are caused by mutations in tumor-suppressor genes, which sharply increase the likelihood of developing CRC at a younger age.

Despite the importance of early diagnosis, warning signs are often overlooked. Symptoms can include lasting changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, unexplained weight loss, and ongoing abdominal discomfort.

Dr. Tsukanov emphasizes the value of genetic testing for individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer. ""Identifying a hereditary mutation allows us to implement lifelong clinical monitoring and early intervention, significantly improving survival rates,"" he explains.

New screening technologies are also expanding detection options. Tools such as BGI Genomics' COLOTECT® Stool DNA Methylation Test identifies CRC-related genetic markers (SDC2, ADHFE1, and PPP2R5C) through stool DNA analysis, providing a non-invasive approach to identifying cancer-related changes at an earlier stage.

Screening Gaps and the Need for Public Awareness

Access to colorectal cancer screening varies widely across regions. In parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, screening programs remain uneven. Countries including Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Latvia, and Georgia have established national screening efforts, while others depend on opportunistic testing. This inconsistency leaves many cases undetected until later stages.

Education is seen as a critical step toward improving outcomes. ""To improve early detection, we must educate both healthcare providers and the public about the importance of screening,"" says Jemma Arakelyan, an advisor at the Immune Oncology Research Institute and CEO of The Institute of Cancer and Crisis in Armenia.

Colorectal cancer is no longer confined to older populations. Younger adults are increasingly affected, with unhealthy lifestyle patterns playing a major role. Addressing this growing challenge will require coordinated action from governments, healthcare systems, and individuals to raise awareness, support healthier choices, and expand access to early screening. The urgency of the situation continues to grow.

Despite the curative potential of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, many patients remain unresponsive to existing treatments. Glyco-immune checkpoints, which involve interactions of cell-surface glycans with lectin, or glycan-binding, immunoreceptors, have emerged as prominent mechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance in cancer. Here, we describe antibody-lectin chimeras (AbLecs), a modular system for glyco-immune checkpoint blockade. AbLecs are bispecific antibody-like molecules comprising a cell-targeting antibody domain and a lectin ‘decoy receptor' domain that directly binds glycans and blocks their ability to engage inhibitory lectin receptors. AbLecs potentiate cancer cell destruction by primary human immune cells in vitro and reduce tumour burden in a humanized, immunocompetent mouse model, outperforming most existing therapies and combinations tested. By targeting a distinct axis of immunological regulation, AbLecs synergize with blockade of established immune checkpoints. AbLecs can be readily designed to target numerous tumours and immune cell subsets as well as glyco-immune checkpoints, thus representing a potential modality for cancer immunotherapy.

Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies (for example, PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 antagonist antibodies) are now used to treat nearly half of all cancer patients in the United States1. However, these therapies are effective in only a small fraction (<20%) of treated patients1 and, of those who respond, at least 25% will develop resistance2. As a result, there is an urgent need for therapies targeting additional immune checkpoints that drive cancer progression.

Altered cell surface glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer that is associated with poor disease prognosis3,4,5. These altered glycan structures modulate immune cell function through interactions with lectin (glycan-binding) immunoreceptors, including sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs)6, selectins7 and galectins8,9. In particular, multiple recent studies indicate that upregulation of cell surface sialoglycans allows tumours to engage inhibitory Siglec receptors on immune cells and evade immune surveillance10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Taken together, glyco-immune checkpoints are emerging as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy.

However, multiple challenges have prevented therapeutic targeting of glyco-immune checkpoints in cancer (Fig. 1a). The weak immunogenicity of mammalian glycan structures can undermine the development of specific and high-affinity anti-glycan antibodies. To put this in perspective, a recent report catalogued 417 commercially available antibodies targeting glycans35. The same study noted that a single supplier offers 287 different antibodies to tubulin and 269 different antibodies to CD4, meaning that there are more antibodies to these two proteins available from a single supplier than all of the commercially available anti-glycan antibodies combined. Further complicating monoclonal antibody development is the fact that many lectin receptors have multiple ligands that are expressed in the context of cancer10,15,17,23,36, and the precise identities of their ligands are often unknown. ‘Decoy receptor' molecules, comprising a lectin glycan-binding domain fused to an antibody Fc domain, address this complexity by retaining native glycan-binding specificities; however, their low binding affinities (typically with dissociation constants in the μM to mM range37) preclude their use as therapeutics.

We recently developed enzyme conjugates for targeted degradation of glycans12,16 or glycoproteins38 as an alternative approach to potentiate antitumor immunity; however, these molecules require substantial engineering of enzyme kinetics to target new types of glycans. In addition, such approaches are currently restricted to degradation of broad classes of glycans (for example, sialoglycans12,16) or glycoproteins (for example, mucins38) rather than the specific molecules involved in immune regulation. Finally, although lectin-targeted antagonist antibodies, such as those directed against galectin-9 (ref. 39) and Siglec-15 (ref. 40) as well as a sialidase-Fc fusion for sialoglycan degradation41, are being tested in the clinic, these untargeted checkpoint inhibitors could elicit immune-related adverse events, which are observed in at least 50% of patients treated with existing checkpoint blockade immunotherapies42. Indeed, ~42% of patients with cancer who were treated with a Siglec-15 blocking antibody experienced treatment-related adverse events in a recent clinical trial43, despite the more restricted expression profile of this receptor on immune cell subsets compared to other members of the Siglec family6. By contrast, targeted immunotherapies (for example, monoclonal antibodies targeting tumour-associated antigens) generally offer more favourable safety profiles44. Overall, our inability to specifically and directly block immunomodulatory glycans, even after the development of multiple therapeutic modalities, highlights the significance of this technological gap.

Here, we describe antibody-lectin chimeras (AbLecs) as a modular system to target glycans for cancer immunotherapy. AbLecs couple glycan-binding domains from lectin receptors to antibodies directed against an antigen on the target cell surface (Fig. 1a). This approach enables blockade of immunomodulatory glycans at nanomolar concentrations agnostic of their specific identities. We demonstrate proof-of-concept for the AbLec platform through the development and characterization of AbLecs combining tumour-targeting antibodies with decoy receptor domains from Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, which have been shown to mediate immune suppression in multiple cancers11,12,13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,28,29,30,33. We show that tumour-targeting AbLecs enhance antibody-dependent phagocytosis and cytotoxicity of cancer cells in vitro and reduce tumour burden in vivo compared to the parent monoclonal antibody. Notably, we found that the chimeric AbLec architecture results in a gain-of-function arising from their ability to block Siglec engagement at the immunological synapse. As a result, AbLecs amplify inflammatory signalling, outperforming most existing therapies and combinations we tested in functional assays. We demonstrate that the AbLec platform can be applied to target several tumour-associated antigens, including HER2, CD20 and EGFR, and cancer cells with varying levels of antigen expression. Furthermore, we designed and validated dual blockade AbLecs that simultaneously block protein-based immune checkpoints (for example, PD-1/PD-L1, CD47/SIRPα) as well as glyco-immune checkpoints that restrain productive anticancer immune responses (for example, Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 (refs. 11,12,13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,28,29,30,33), galectin-9 (refs. 45,46)). We found that glyco-immune checkpoint blockade was synergistic with blockade of these established immune checkpoints. These results indicate that AbLecs target a non-redundant axis of immune suppression in cancer and could expand the subset of patients who respond to immunotherapy. In sum, AbLecs represent a generalizable approach for glyco-immune checkpoint blockade and an alternative modality for cancer immunotherapy.

We reasoned that high-affinity binding of an antibody Fab domain to cancer antigens would cause AbLecs to accumulate at a high local concentration on the cell surface. This high local concentration of the AbLec would then permit binding of a relatively low-affinity lectin domain to inhibitory glycans on the same cell. As proof-of-concept, we created AbLecs that combine the Fab domain from trastuzumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that binds the tumour-associated antigen HER2, with the extracellular domains of Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 fused to an Fc domain. Trastuzumab is used to treat HER2+ malignancies of diverse tissue origins, including breast, gastric and colon cancers. Trastuzumab exhibits a dual mechanism of action involving inhibition of oncogenic HER2 signalling as well as activation of innate and adaptive immune responses47. A select subset of patients treated with trastuzumab experience durable disease remission, indicating its potential to elicit lasting immunity to cancer48,49. However, acquired resistance to trastuzumab limits therapeutic efficacy in most patients50,51. Recent approval of margetuximab, a glycoengineered trastuzumab with improved ability to recruit and activate natural killer (NK) cells, shows that an enhanced immune response has the potential to overcome resistance to HER2-targeted therapies52. We suspected that trastuzumab-hybrid AbLecs could further amplify immune responses to HER2+ cancers through Siglec blockade12,16,22.

We used a modified knobs-into-holes Fc engineering approach53 to facilitate self-assembly of heterotrimeric AbLecs in a single expression culture (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Indeed, coexpression of trastuzumab heavy and light chains with Siglec-7-Fc or Siglec-9-Fc in Expi293 cells resulted in expression of predominant protein species with molecular weights consistent with heterotrimeric AbLecs (Fig. 1c). Reducing SDS–PAGE analysis of purified proteins showed that trastuzumab × Siglec-7 (T7) and trastuzumab × Siglec-9 (T9) AbLecs were composed of three disulfide bonded protein chains consistent with the molecular weights of the Siglec-Fc and the trastuzumab heavy and light chains (Fig. 1c). Western blotting against HA and 6×His tags on the Siglec-Fc and antibody heavy chains, respectively, demonstrated that full-length AbLecs are composed of both antibody and decoy receptor arms (Fig. 1d), which was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) (Supplementary Table 2). Thermal shift assays determined that T7 and T9 AbLec melting temperatures are between 55 °C and 60 °C, indicating stability at physiological temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

We next characterized binding of T7 and T9 AbLecs to SK-BR-3 cells compared to trastuzumab and Siglec decoy receptor controls. SK-BR-3 cells express the HER2 antigen bound by trastuzumab as well as ligands for Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 (Sig7L/Sig9L) (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). As expected, the decoy receptor controls (Siglec-7/9-Fc) bind only at low levels to SK-BR-3 cells, even at the highest concentrations tested (200 nM), despite the fact that SK-BR-3 cells express Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 ligands (Fig. 1f). However, by combining the Siglec decoy receptor arm with the high-affinity trastuzumab antibody arm, AbLecs bind to SK-BR-3 cells with apparent dissociation constant (KD) values in the low nM range, similar to the parent bivalent antibody trastuzumab (Fig. 1f,g). Thus, AbLecs enable recruitment of otherwise low-affinity lectin binding domains to cell surfaces at nanomolar concentrations.

Despite the low affinity of the Siglec domain in comparison to the antibody arm, we wondered whether AbLec binding to cell surfaces was partially glycan-dependent. By mutating a conserved arginine residue in the Siglec-Fc binding site to an alanine, we created T7A and T9A AbLec mutants that are reported to exhibit significantly reduced affinities for Siglec ligands54. Arginine mutant AbLecs exhibited reduced binding to SK-BR-3 cells, measured by an approximately twofold to threefold increase in apparent KD values compared to wild-type AbLecs (Extended Data Fig. 1e–h). These results indicate that Siglec–sialoglycan interactions contribute to AbLec binding, supporting the idea that AbLecs could occupy Siglec receptor binding sites on target cells.

We next asked whether AbLecs could successfully block engagement of their targeted lectin receptors. To this end, we tested the ability of T7 and T9 AbLecs to compete with fluorescently labelled Siglec decoy receptors for binding to K562-HER2 cells (Fig. 1h). This cell line expresses a higher ratio of Sig7L and Sig9L to the targeted antigen HER2, offering a more challenging target for glycan blockade (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). Notably, although K562-HER2 cells express the Fc gamma receptor FcγRIIa (Extended Data Fig. 1k), we conclude from comparison of Siglec-7/9-Fc and isotype control staining by flow cytometry that decoy receptor binding to the cell surface is primarily glycan-dependent (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1j). Treatment of cells with T7 or T9 AbLec significantly reduced binding of fluorescently labelled Siglec-7-Fc or Siglec-9-Fc, respectively (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 1l–n). AbLecs further selectively block binding of the targeted lectin receptor. Treatment with the T7 AbLec blocked binding of the cognate Siglec-7 decoy receptor to a greater extent than trastuzumab or the non-cognate T9 AbLec at all concentrations tested (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 1o). Moreover, both T7 and T9 AbLecs reduced binding of their cognate Siglec decoy receptors almost to the level of a sialidase-treated control, in which target cells were pre-treated with a sialidase enzyme to degrade Siglec ligands before staining with fluorescently labelled Siglec-7/9-Fc (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 1n). In sum, we find that AbLecs can block most of the glycan-dependent binding of their cognate Siglec decoy receptor to target cells.

We wanted to test whether AbLecs block the same epitopes bound by their cognate lectin receptors. We recently reported that the predominant ligand for Siglec-7 expressed on K562 cells is the sialomucin CD43 (ref. 17). Furthermore, we found that the commercially available MEM-59 antibody binds to the same sialylated epitope on CD43 that is bound by Siglec-7 (ref. 17). We tested the ability of AbLecs to compete with the MEM-59 antibody for binding to K562-HER2 cells. We observed that the T7 AbLec blocked binding of MEM-59 to a greater extent than trastuzumab or the non-cognate T9 AbLec, suggesting that the T7 AbLec binds and blocks the same CD43 glycoform bound by the endogenous Siglec-7 immunoreceptor (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 1p). This evidence supports our hypothesis that AbLecs selectively block engagement of the targeted lectin receptors by competing for the same binding epitopes.

We further interrogated the mechanism of AbLec binding and Siglec receptor blockade by developing a structure-guided computational model of Siglec-7-Fc, trastuzumab and T7 AbLec binding trained using our experimental data (Supplementary Fig. 1a)55,56. This model allowed us to better understand the cooperative, bivalent binding of each reagent to multiple HER2 antigens and/or Siglec-7 ligands on K562-HER2 cells. Cooperativity in these bivalent interactions can be quantified by their avidities (KD,eff) and the effective concentration of the second arm relative to its target after binding of the first arm ([Ceff]; Supplementary Fig. 1b). A higher [Ceff] indicates a higher probability that an antibody or AbLec can engage in a cooperative, bivalent interaction at the cell surface. Our computational model estimated that the T7 AbLec [Ceff] was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig. 1b; [Ceff, tras] = 0.12 μM; [Ceff, T7] = 25 μM), suggesting that cooperative binding of T7 AbLec to one HER2 and one Sig7L is much more likely than cooperative binding of trastuzumab to two HER2 antigens. The strong cooperativity of the trastuzumab and Siglec-7 decoy receptor arms helps explain why the apparent AbLec KDs are of the same order of magnitude as the apparent trastuzumab KD, despite having only one high-affinity antibody arm.

We next used the model-derived [Ceff] values to compare the ability of T7 AbLec and Siglec-7-Fc to deliver Siglec-7 binding domains to the cell surface as a measure of their potency as Siglec-7 blockade reagents. By combining trastuzumab and Siglec-7 decoy receptor arms, the T7 AbLec is nearly 400 times more effective at delivering Siglec-7 binding domains than Siglec-7-Fc (Supplementary Fig. 1c), enabling the use of a decoy receptor approach for Siglec receptor blockade.

Finally, we used the modelled binding parameters to simulate the competitive binding experiments with T7 AbLec and Siglec-7-Fc (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e). Without any additional parameter fitting, our model closely approximates the experimentally determined inhibition curve (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 1f), building confidence in its description of T7 AbLec and Siglec-7-Fc binding. The model also provides deeper insights into why AbLecs are so effective in outcompeting Siglec decoy receptors for binding to K562-HER2 cells. T7 AbLec treatment shifts the Siglec-7-Fc binding mode from mostly bivalent to mostly monovalent (Supplementary Fig. 1g), the latter being a very weak interaction that readily dissociates. This finding is physiologically relevant, as clustering of Siglec receptors is thought to be required for effective inhibitory signalling54,57,58. Taken together, AbLecs decrease Siglec receptor binding by reducing their binding valency, and thus have the potential to disrupt inhibitory Siglec signalling.

Having demonstrated that AbLecs block the binding of Siglec receptors to target cells, we investigated whether AbLec treatment could elicit immune responses against cancer cells. Therapeutic tumour-targeting antibodies create immune synapses between antigens on the cancer cell surface and Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) on immune cells. Engagement of FcγRs activates the immune cell to perform antibody effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which result in the destruction of the targeted cancer cell. However, interactions between Siglec receptors on immune cells and Siglec ligands on the cancer cell surface negatively regulate antibody effector functions12,16,59. By contrast, we reasoned that AbLecs would block Siglec engagement at the immune synapse and enhance antibody effector functions (Fig. 2a).

a, Siglec engagement at immune synapses restrains anticancer immune responses. We reasoned that AbLecs would recruit FcγR+ immune cells to cancer cells and simultaneously block Siglec engagement, relieving inhibitory signalling and potentiating cancer cell killing. b, Phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy images of primary human macrophage/SK-BR-3 cell co-cultures treated with Siglec-7-Fc, trastuzumab or T7 AbLec at t = 5 h.

We first tested our hypothesis using in vitro phagocytosis assays with primary human macrophages. At the time of use in our assays, macrophages expressed FcγRI and FcγRIIa, as well as Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 (Extended Data Fig. 2a–e). Notably, AbLecs alone are not cytotoxic: we did not observe any defects in SK-BR-3 or K562-HER2 cell growth over 72 h following AbLec treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2f–i). We co-cultured these macrophages with SK-BR-3 cells labelled with a pH-sensitive dye that fluoresces red in acidic phagosomes (Extended Data Fig. 2j), enabling quantification of phagocytosis using fluorescence. After 5 h of co-culture, fluorescence microscopy images show that SK-BR-3 cells in co-cultures treated with the T7 or T9 AbLec are more readily phagocytosed by macrophages than those treated with trastuzumab or Siglec-7/9-Fc decoy receptor (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Videos 1–3). We observed the same enhancement of phagocytosis using macrophages from three donors and in assays with the HCC-1854 and K562-HER2 cell lines, which express varying levels of HER2 and/or Sig7L/Sig9L compared to SK-BR-3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 3).

We next asked whether AbLecs could potentiate cancer cell killing by additional subsets of immune cells. We co-cultured primary human NK cells expressing FcγRIII and Siglec-7 with SK-BR-3 tumour cells and analysed cytotoxicity by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 4a–h). Across three donors, the T7 AbLec significantly enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity compared to trastuzumab or Siglec-7-Fc decoy receptor (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4i,j). We observed the same effect in assays with the K562-HER2 cell line (Extended Data Fig. 4k,l). We performed similar assays with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which express FcγRIIa and FcγRIII29 as well as Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). We found that T7 and T9 AbLecs elicited increased cancer cell killing by PMNs compared to trastuzumab and AbLec isotype controls (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5e–i).

It was important to demonstrate that AbLec activity is at least partially antibody-dependent; that is, mediated by antigen binding and FcγR engagement. To test FcγR dependence, we incubated macrophages with FcγR blocking or isotype control antibodies before co-culture with SK-BR-3 cells. We observed lower levels of SK-BR-3 phagocytosis for both trastuzumab and T7 AbLec when macrophages were pre-treated with FcγR blocking antibodies, indicating that both antibody and AbLec activities are FcγR-dependent (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). We further found that an antibody blocking FcγRIII/CD16 significantly reduced AbLec-mediated ADCC by NK cells, confirming that AbLec activity is FcγR-dependent (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Notably, FcγR blockade appeared to reduce trastuzumab-mediated phagocytosis to a greater extent than the T7 AbLec. Indeed, when we quantified the reduction in phagocytosis observed upon FcγR blockade across three donors, we found that trastuzumab exhibited a greater dependence on FcγRs than the T7 AbLec (Fig. 2g). These data support our hypothesis that the AbLec mechanism of action is bifunctional, with contributions from activation of antibody effector functions and glyco-immune checkpoint blockade. We further observed that T7/9 AbLec-mediated phagocytosis of target cells was dependent on expression of the HER2 antigen in phagocytosis assays with wild-type (HER2−) K562 and K562-HER2 cells (Fig. 2h). Overall, these results show that T7 and T9 AbLecs elicit enhanced antibody effector functions, including ADCP and ADCC, compared to the parent monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab.

We tested whether the AbLec-mediated enhancement of anticancer immune responses was a result of blockade of Siglec–sialoglycan interactions. In one approach, we pre-incubated macrophages or NK cells with Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 blocking antibodies before co-culture with SK-BR-3 or K562-HER2 cells (Fig. 2i). When the targeted Siglec receptor was blocked, AbLecs and trastuzumab elicited similar levels of ADCP (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e) and ADCC (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g), suggesting that AbLec-mediated enhancement of antibody effector functions is Siglec-dependent. Similarly, pretreatment of target cells with sialidase to degrade Siglec ligands also abolished AbLec-mediated enhancement of PMN ADCC over trastuzumab (Fig. 2k,l and Extended Data Fig. 5f,h,i), further supporting the idea that AbLec activity is Siglec-dependent. These results help to rule out any contribution of knobs-in-hole Fc engineering to enhancement of ADCP and ADCC, consistent with previous studies showing that these mutations preserve the native structure and effector functions of wild-type hIgG1 Fc53,60,61. Taken together, these results suggest that the increased levels of ADCP and ADCC observed with AbLec treatment are a direct result of glycan blockade.

We next set out to investigate whether AbLecs could improve immune control of cancer in vivo. However, we faced the challenge that Siglec biology is not conserved from mice to humans. Human Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 share a common murine ortholog, Siglec-E, but neither expression patterns on immune cells nor binding preferences of Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 completely match those of Siglec-E62. To address this gap, we leveraged recently developed humanized mice in which the Siglece gene is inactivated and SIGLEC7 and SIGLEC9 transgenes are stably expressed under the control of their endogenous promoters20. As a result, the expression patterns of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 on leucocytes in these mice closely mirror those on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)20. We crossed these mice with established humanized FcγR mice63 to yield animals that recapitulate both human Siglec-7/9 and FcγR biology that together mediate the dual mechanism of action of T7/9 AbLecs, providing the ideal genetic background for evaluation of in vivo efficacy. We established a lung colonization model by intravenous inoculation of syngeneic B16D5-HER2 cancer cells, which express the HER2 antigen, high levels of Sig9L and intermediate levels of Sig7L (Fig. 2m,n), and found that this model exhibited Siglec-dependent progression (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). We therefore set out to evaluate the effect of T7 and T9 AbLec in this model, using a dosing strategy informed by their half-lives in circulation in our humanized Siglec-7/9 hFcγR mice (Fig. 2o and Extended Data Fig. 6j,k). We found significantly reduced metastatic burden in the lungs of mice treated with T9 AbLec compared to those treated with the parent antibody, trastuzumab (Fig. 2p and Extended Data Fig. 6l,m). Metastatic burden was overall lower in T7 AbLec-treated mice than in trastuzumab-treated mice, but this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 2p and Extended Data Fig. 6l,m). We speculate that Siglec-9 may be the dominant glyco-immune checkpoint in our lung colonization model, owing to the relatively low level of Sig7L compared to Sig9L expression on the B16D5-HER2 cell line and the fact that neutrophils, which express higher levels of Siglec-9 than Siglec-7, are the dominant Siglec-expressing immune cell population in the lung20. Overall, AbLec treatment reduced tumour burden in a translationally relevant animal model.

We were curious to know whether the chimeric AbLec architecture was required to potentiate killing of cancer cells. To determine whether this was the case, we compared ADCP of K562-HER2 cells treated with T7 AbLec or the combination of trastuzumab and the Siglec-7-Fc decoy receptor (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). We found that the combination of trastuzumab and Siglec-7-Fc did not enhance killing of K562-HER2 cells compared to trastuzumab alone, as expected given the low binding affinity of the decoy receptor (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7b). However, as before, treatment with T7 AbLec elicited enhanced cancer cell phagocytosis (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7b). From these results, we conclude that the chimeric AbLec architecture is required to recruit lectin decoy receptor domains to cancer cell surfaces at therapeutically relevant concentrations and potentiate their destruction.

Combinations of monospecific therapies can result in enhanced therapeutic efficacy and combinatorial treatment strategies are now thought to be required for durable responses in most patients with cancer64. We hoped that the bispecific AbLec architecture would elicit tumour-targeted antibody effector functions and glyco-immune checkpoint blockade at least as effectively as combination therapy. Therefore, we sought to benchmark the efficacy of AbLecs compared to combinations of trastuzumab with existing Siglec blockade approaches. First, we compared AbLec efficacy to a combination of trastuzumab with sialidase as a model of enzymatic sialoside degradation, an approach to target the Siglec–sialoglycan axis that is currently being investigated in clinical trials41 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). There was no significant difference in ADCP elicited by T7 AbLec treatment compared to the combination of trastuzumab with sialidase (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 7b). The combination of T7 and T9 AbLecs also did not further enhance ADCP compared to T7 or T9 treatment alone (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). These data indicate that AbLec-mediated Siglec blockade is as effective as sialic acid degradation in its ability to potentiate antibody effector functions.

In addition, we compared AbLec treatment to combinations of trastuzumab with Siglec-blocking antibodies20 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Notably, AbLecs elicited enhanced ADCP (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 7f) and ADCC (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 7g) of SK-BR-3 cells compared to the combination of trastuzumab with Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antagonist antibodies20. We observed the same trends in ADCP and ADCC assays with K562-HER2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). These data suggest that blockade of Siglec engagement locally, at the immune synapse, could be more effective than systemic Siglec antagonism.

Overall, our findings support the paradigm that the chimeric AbLec architecture results in a gain-of-function: the ability to block inhibitory signalling through glyco-immune checkpoints. AbLecs are more effective glyco-immune checkpoint antagonists than Siglec-blocking antibodies, and as effective as enzymatic sialoglycan degradation, both of which are therapeutic strategies under investigation in clinical trials40,41.

Our surprising finding that AbLecs were more effective Siglec antagonists than Siglec-blocking antibodies suggested that the proximity of the tumour-targeting and Siglec blockade elements may be important. Therefore, we sought to better understand how Siglec–sialoglycan interactions at the immune synapses formed by AbLec opsonization impact macrophage activation. We overexpressed a Siglec-7–mGFP fusion protein in RAW264.7 macrophages, which allowed us to visualize Siglec localization on the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 8a). We incubated these macrophages with silica beads coated in a supported lipid bilayer that mimiced the surface of a cancer cell and could be functionalized with defined molecular signals (Extended Data Fig. 8a). To activate engulfment, we introduced an anti-biotin antibody, which forms immune complexes with biotinylated lipids in the supported lipid bilayer. We could further functionalize the bilayer with the GD2 glycolipid, a high-affinity ligand for the Siglec-7 receptor23 (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Addition of GD2 suppressed bead engulfment, consistent with the results of our ADCP experiments with human primary macrophages and cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 8c).

With this system in hand, we investigated how Siglec localization was influenced by the presence of its ligand, GD2. We observed significant enrichment of Siglec-7 at immune synapses formed between macrophages and bound beads bearing GD2 (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). By contrast, there was no enrichment of Siglec-7 at the phagocytic cups of macrophages that had initiated bead engulfment in both the presence and absence of GD2 (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g). Taken together, our results show that ligands like GD2 position Siglecs at the immunological synapse, where they act to inhibit phagocytosis at the earliest stages of target cell encounter.

With these insights into how Siglecs exert their inhibitory functions at the immunological synapse, we next investigated the effect of AbLec treatment on Siglec localization. We suspected that the AbLec decoy receptor arm could block Siglec recruitment to synapses formed by the trastuzumab antibody arm by occupying Siglec ligands in close physical proximity (Fig. 3e). To test this hypothesis, we created target cell mimics by functionalizing silica beads with the HER2 antigen and GD2 as a ligand for Siglec-7, opsonized with trastuzumab or T7 AbLec, and incubated with RAW264.7-Siglec-7–mGFP macrophages (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 8h). As expected, Siglec-7 was recruited to synapses formed between macrophages and trastuzumab-treated beads bearing the Siglec-7 ligand GD2 (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8i). By contrast, AbLec treatment completely prevented Siglec-7 accumulation at these synapses; we observed no significant difference in Siglec recruitment to AbLec-treated beads bearing GD2 compared to trastuzumab-treated beads that lacked Sig7L (Fig. 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8i). This evidence supports our hypothesis that the ability of tumour-targeted AbLecs to enhance immune cell activation is mediated through exclusion of inhibitory Siglec receptors from the immunological synapse.

Recruitment of SIRPα to phagocytic synapses upon binding to its ligand, the ‘don't eat me' signal CD47, similarly suppresses phagocytosis65,66. As a result, we wondered whether Siglec–sialoglycan and CD47–SIRPα immune checkpoints are redundant or distinct axes of inhibition in macrophages. We tested this hypothesis by investigating whether trastuzumab-hybrid AbLecs synergize with blockade of CD47, in light of recent results showing that CD47 blockade synergizes with trastuzumab67,68. If Siglec–sialoglycan checkpoints are a distinct axis of immune suppression, we would expect the combination of trastuzumab-hybrid AbLecs with CD47 blockade to further enhance ADCP of HER2+ cancer cells (Fig. 3i). Indeed, the combination of a CD47 antagonist antibody and T7 AbLec increased phagocytosis of cancer cells compared to T7 AbLec treatment alone in two of three donors tested (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 8j–l). Across all three donors, the combination of αCD47 and T7 AbLec outperformed the combination of αCD47 and trastuzumab (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 8j–l). The combination of αCD47 with T7 or T9 AbLec also enhanced PMN cytotoxicity over αCD47 and trastuzumab (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Our findings are especially encouraging in light of recent clinical results in gastric cancer showing that CD47 blockade significantly increased response rates when added to the standard of care treatment regimen, which includes trastuzumab68. Furthermore, we observed synergy of T7 AbLec and CD47 blockade using a concentration of αCD47 that was ineffective as a monotherapy (Fig. 3j, Extended Data Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 8j–l). This is important because the high dose of the αCD47 antibody magrolimab required for single-agent efficacy is thought to be the major driver of its on-target, off-tumour toxicity, which ultimately resulted in the termination of multiple clinical programmes (for example, NCT05079230 (ref. 69), NCT06046482). Our data suggests that combinations of AbLecs with low-dose CD47 blockade could reduce off-tumour toxicity while preserving on-tumour efficacy. In sum, these results indicate that Siglec-7 is a distinct axis of inhibition in macrophages and that AbLecs have the potential to synergize with cancer immunotherapies in clinical development, extending their therapeutic benefits to more patients.

Our discovery that AbLecs exclude Siglecs from the immunological synapse spurred us to investigate how AbLec treatment impacts immune cell signalling. To this end, we performed global phosphoproteomic analysis of primary human macrophages following co-culture with K562-HER2 cells and treatment with Siglec-7 blocking antibody (αSig7), trastuzumab, T7 AbLec or vehicle (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We initially compared phosphopeptide abundances in T7 AbLec-treated and trastuzumab-treated macrophages and found that AbLec treatment decreased phosphorylation of two proteins associated with the Rab11a complex that mediates endosomal recycling (Extended Data Fig. 9b). The Rab11 GTPase family governs a decision point at which endosomes can either mature to ultimately become lysosomes or recycle to the plasma membrane70. This is relevant because effective phagocytosis requires that phagosome maturation proceeds through successive fusion with early and late endosomes as well as lysosomes71. Our data suggest that AbLec treatment downregulates the activation of proteins involved in endosomal recycling, allowing more endosomes to mature and facilitating the increased phagocytosis that we observe in our ADCP assays. Indeed, previous work has shown that downregulation of Rab11a increases macrophage phagocytosis72. Gene Ontology term analysis provided further support for the idea that T7 AbLec treatment amplifies phagocytic signalling compared to trastuzumab. In AbLec-treated compared to trastuzumab-treated macrophages, we observed changes in the abundances of phosphopeptides involved in multiple cellular structures and processes related to phagocytosis, including cell–cell adhesion by cadherins and focal adhesions, the podosome, the phagocytic cup and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These results provide insights into the cellular signalling underlying the ability of T7 AbLec to elicit enhanced ADCP compared to trastuzumab in our functional assays (for example, Fig. 2c).

For a more global understanding of the signalling pathways influenced by AbLec treatment, we leveraged post-translational modification signature enrichment analysis (PTM-SEA)73. PTM-SEA allowed us to identify kinase activities, signalling pathways and perturbations (for example, drug treatments) that match the dynamics of fold changes between treatment conditions for all identified phosphopeptides in our datasets (Extended Data Fig. 9d–g). We prioritized signatures that were consistently upregulated or downregulated for each comparison in assays with macrophages from three donors, to increase the likelihood that they represent the effects of treatment with αSig7, trastuzumab or T7 AbLec. For many of these signatures, we found evidence in the literature of their pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages, which helped us better understand the overall impact of each treatment on macrophage phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 9d–g). We found the greatest number of pro-inflammatory signatures upregulated in T7 AbLec-treated macrophages compared to vehicle-treated controls (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f) and enrichment of multiple pro-inflammatory signatures in the T7 AbLec condition compared to trastuzumab (Extended Data Fig. 9g). Of particular interest was cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity, which was upregulated in comparisons of T7 AbLec to vehicle and to trastuzumab (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). CDK2 signalling supports macrophage activation74,75,76, and there is evidence that its kinase activity is negatively regulated by Siglec-E in murine immune cells77. CDK2 signalling was upregulated in comparisons of αSig7 to vehicle but not trastuzumab to vehicle, consistent with the idea that upregulation of CDK2 activity is a result of Siglec-7 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). These data are consistent with our findings that T7 AbLec amplifies pro-inflammatory signalling by blocking Siglec-7 engagement.

Finally, we focused on signatures that were modulated in T7 AbLec-treated macrophages compared to trastuzumab-treated or αSig7-treated macrophages to understand signalling that contributes to the enhanced function of the AbLec over these controls observed in our ADCP assays. However, when we compared these signatures to those that were also present in our analyses of trastuzumab or αSig7-treated macrophages, we found some similarities but also differences (Extended Data Fig. 9h–k). Therefore, the signalling pathways activated by AbLec treatment may not be fully explained by the trastuzumab or Siglec blockade components alone and instead point to synergistic effects of their combination. Collectively, our phosphoproteomic analysis provides additional evidence that AbLec treatment enhances macrophage activation by amplifying pro-inflammatory signalling through a dual Siglec-dependent and FcγR-dependent mechanism of action.

As a feature of their modular chimeric architecture, AbLecs can be readily developed to target diverse cancers and glyco-immune checkpoints. To demonstrate this modularity, we constructed tumour-targeting AbLecs with components derived from rituximab × Siglec-7 (R7) and cetuximab × Siglec-7 (C7), designed to block Sig7L on CD20+ and EGFR+ cancer cells, respectively (Fig. 4a,b). In addition, we generated a trastuzumab × Siglec-10 AbLec intended to block engagement of the Siglec-10 receptor on HER2+ tumour cells, as Siglec-10 was recently shown to mediate immune evasion in breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers15,34 (Fig. 4c).

Functional characterization of R7 and C7 AbLecs demonstrated the utility of the AbLec platform for combination tumour-targeting and glyco-immune checkpoint blockade in diverse tumour types. Across n = 3 donors, R7 C7 AbLec treatment significantly enhanced phagocytosis of CD20+ Ramos cells or K562-EGFR cells, respectively, compared to the parent antibody or Siglec-7-Fc alone (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Notably, and consistent with our findings with T7/9 AbLecs, R7 and C7 AbLecs selectively target antigen-expressing cells and spare antigen-negative cells (Fig. 4f–k). As a result of their antigen-dependent activity, which we observed in the context of three tumour-associated antigens, we expect AbLecs to exhibit safety profiles driven by the expression patterns of the targeted antigen, which are typically more favourable than those of systemic immune checkpoint blockade42,44. These data further show that AbLecs can be readily redesigned to target a variety of cancer antigens.

Low or heterogeneous expression of tumour-associated antigens on cancer cell surfaces has been associated with resistance to immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies78,79, immune checkpoint blockade80 and CAR-T cells81,82. We reasoned that the enhanced effector functions elicited by AbLecs might be able to overcome weak FcγR signalling potentiated by cancer cells with low antigen density. We created K562 lines expressing high and low levels of the CD20 antigen, while the expression of Sig7L was constant (Fig. 4f–h). In assays with primary human macrophages, we found that R7 AbLec treatment enhanced ADCP of tumour cells expressing very low levels of the targeted CD20 antigen compared to the parent monoclonal antibody, rituximab (Fig. 4f–h,j). Our results show that the improved efficacy of AbLecs compared to the parent monoclonal antibody is maintained in cancers with low antigen expression, a current area of unmet medical need.

Numerous inhibitory receptors on immune cells regulate their activation. Often, multiple immune checkpoints are misregulated in tumours, contributing to disease progression and resistance to existing immunotherapies64. To address this challenge, we developed dual checkpoint blockade AbLecs designed to block engagement of both protein-based and glycan-based immune checkpoints (Fig. 5a–d). As a first example, we designed an AbLec for dual blockade of CD47 and Siglec-7 ligands on cancer cells by combining the αCD47 antibody magrolimab69 with a Siglec-7 decoy receptor domain (Fig. 5a). This molecule offers an alternative strategy for dual targeting of CD47 and Sig7L that could be combined with FDA-approved tumour-targeting antibodies. For example, addition of CD47 blockade to either trastuzumab or rituximab therapy improved efficacy in mouse and human cancers67,68,83,84. Our results and others' have shown that a combination of CD47 and Siglec-7 blockade has the potential to even further amplify anticancer immune responses23,25 (Fig. 3i,j).

Cytotoxic T cells are among the most important effectors of antitumor immunity, as evidenced by the clinical success of checkpoint inhibitors (for example, PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists85) and T cell therapies (for example, TIL86 and CAR-T cell therapies87). However, inefficient CD8+ T cell priming, which requires CD4+ T cells88,89, and/or exhaustion have been implicated as key mechanisms of resistance90,91, necessitating new approaches to maintain T cell fitness. Glyco-immune checkpoints are known to restrain both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function19,21,46,92,93,94,95,96, but it has been challenging to date to target their glycan ligands directly. As a proof-of-concept, we generated nivolumab × galectin-9 and pembrolizumab × galectin-9 AbLecs (NG9 and PG9 AbLecs, respectively) designed to simultaneously block the PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3/galectin-9 T cell checkpoints46,92,95 (Fig. 5a,b,e and Extended Data Fig. 10c). Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD-1 antagonist antibodies approved to treat diverse cancers85,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104. The galectin-9 lectin is a ligand for the TIM-3 checkpoint receptor, and binding of galectin-9 to TIM-3 contributes to CD8+ T cell exhaustion and apoptosis46,92,95. Moreover, the PD-1 and TIM-3 T cell checkpoints synergize to suppress type 1 immune responses46,92,95, which generate TH1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations that are critical for productive anticancer immunity. Both galectin-9 and TIM-3 antagonist antibodies are cancer immunotherapy approaches being investigated in clinical trials39,105,106,107, but these monospecific therapies cannot ensure effective blockade of both PD-1 and TIM-3 engagement on the same T cell. By contrast, both NG9 and PG9 AbLecs bound to activated human T cells at nanomolar concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 10d–h). Furthermore, NG9 and PG9 AbLecs exhibited distinct binding profiles compared to parent monoclonal antibody and galectin-9-Fc controls (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g), indicating contributions from both αPD-1 and galectin-9 domains to overall AbLec binding. NG9 and PG9 AbLecs blocked binding of fluorescently labelled galectin-9-Fc and their parent nivolumab and pembrolizumab antibodies, respectively, indicating that they occupy the same binding sites on activated human T cells (Fig. 5f–i). Therefore, NG9 and PG9 AbLecs can simultaneously block the PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3/galectin-9 immune checkpoints that restrain T cell activation.

Siglecs and sialoglycans are upregulated in patients who do not respond to PD-1 blockade30, indicating that this axis is a mechanism of resistance to drugs currently used to treat nearly half of all cancer patients1. To address this mechanism of resistance, we used the binding domain from the FDA-approved αPD-L1 antibody avelumab108,109,110 to engineer an avelumab × Siglec-7 AbLec for dual blockade of PD-L1 and Sig7L expressed on cancer or antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 5d). The A7 AbLec enhanced phagocytosis of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing PD-L1 and Sig7L compared to the avelumab antibody alone (Fig. 5j,k and Extended Data Fig. 10i–k). Taken together, dual blockade AbLecs target orthogonal immunosuppressive pathways in cancer20,23,25,45 and can be used alone or in combination with existing clinical-stage immunotherapies to amplify antitumor immune responses.

In this work, we establish AbLecs as a class of antibody chimeras targeting glyco-immune checkpoints for cancer immunotherapy. AbLecs combine antibodies against antigens of interest (for example, tumour-associated antigens, immune checkpoint receptors or ligands) with glycan-binding domains from immunomodulatory lectin receptors. We show that AbLecs bind to cell surfaces at therapeutically relevant concentrations and selectively block binding of the targeted lectin receptor. AbLecs enhanced antibody-mediated phagocytosis and cytotoxicity of cancer cells, including those with low expression of the targeted antigen, and reduced tumour burden in a humanized animal model. Synergy with blockade of established checkpoints demonstrated the potential for AbLecs to expand the subset of patients that benefit from cancer immunotherapy. Overall, AbLecs offer a modular molecular architecture for glycan blockade as an immunotherapeutic mechanism of action.

Importantly, this study could not fully explore the therapeutic possibilities enabled by the AbLec platform. There are many human cancers whose progression is influenced by Siglecs or galectins and that have targetable surface antigens for which additional AbLecs could be developed (for example, colorectal28,34,96, prostate33,111,112 and pancreatic18,113 cancers, glioblastoma25,30, melanoma19,39). Furthermore, it will be important to test AbLec efficacy in additional animal models of cancer and assess their in vivo synergy with approved immunotherapies (for example, PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors). Collectively, these future studies promise to identify the full spectrum of cancers that could benefit from AbLec treatment.

We found that T7 and T9 AbLecs were more effective Siglec antagonists than Siglec-blocking antibodies and as effective as sialoside degradation. Further investigation revealed that their potent antagonist activity is mediated by the exclusion of Siglec receptors from the immunological synapse. We suspect that this is a result of the chimeric AbLec architecture, which allows the Siglec decoy receptor arm to occupy Siglec ligands in close physical proximity to synapses formed by the trastuzumab antibody arm. Our data suggest that targeted lectin blockade mediated by AbLecs is at least as effective as systemic glyco-immune checkpoint blockade with the potential for reduced toxicity.

Notably, opportunities to influence organization of the immunological synapse for immunotherapy are not restricted to Siglecs or other glyco-immune checkpoints. Our work adds to a growing body of evidence that the recruitment of checkpoint receptors and/or tyrosine phosphatases to synapses restrains inflammatory signalling and immune cell activation59,65,66,114. By contrast, therapies such as AbLecs that mediate their exclusion reverse these effects115. These insights promise to inform the design of next-generation immune checkpoint inhibitors with improved efficacy.

Tumours substantially remodel their cell surface glycosylation. It is now clear that a key role for these remodelled glycans is to facilitate immune evasion and tumour progression by engaging multiple broad classes of lectin receptors10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,28,29,30,33,45,46,96,113,116,117,118,119,120,121,122. Our chimeric AbLec molecules result in a gain-of-function: potent blockade of glyco-immune checkpoints that represent important mechanisms of immune suppression and therapeutic resistance in cancer. The AbLec approach is extensible to multiple cancers and mechanisms of action, with the potential to expand the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

The stable K562-HER2 line was generated as previously described123, and HER2 expression was verified by flow cytometry. RAW264.7-Siglec-7–mGFP cells were established by transducing RAW264.7 cells (ATCC) with lentiviral particles encoding Siglec-7–mGFP. Lentivirus encoding Siglec-7–mGFP was produced in HEK293T cells transfected with pMD2.G (a gift from D. Trono; Addgene, 12259), pCMV-dR8.2 (Addgene, 8455) and a Siglec-7–mGFP fusion construct (Origene, RC206995L2) cloned into a lentiviral vector derived from pHRSIN-CSGW (Addgene, 113014) using lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, 15338–100). Media containing lentivirus was collected 72 h post transfection, filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and concentrated using LentiX (Takara Biosciences). After addition of the concentrated virus, cells were centrifuged at 2,000g for 45 min at 37 °C.

All antibody and AbLec plasmids were generated by Twist Bioscience and inserted into the pTwist CMV BetaGlobin vector using the XhoI and NheI cut sites, unless otherwise specified below. DNA and amino acid sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Trastuzumab was expressed from a pCDNA3.1 vector described in our previous work16.

Antibodies were purified by manual gravity column (Bio-Rad) using protein A agarose (Fisher Scientific). In brief, the clarified supernatant was passed over the column twice; bound protein was treated with sialidase on the resin with 0.25–0.5 column volumes of 100 nM Vibrio cholerae sialidase in PBS for 0.5–2 h at room temperature (21 °C), washed with 20 column volumes of PBS and eluted twice with 5 ml 100 mM glycine buffer pH 2.8 into tubes pre-equilibrated with 150 μl of 1 M Tris pH 8. AbLecs were purified by manual gravity column using nickel-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen). In brief, AbLec supernatant was incubated with PBS-equilibrated resin for ~1 h at 4 °C. Resin and supernatant were then loaded onto a chromatography column, and bound protein was treated with sialidase on the resin with 0.25–0.5 column volumes of 100 nM V. cholerae sialidase in PBS for 0.5–2 h at room temperature, then washed with 20 column volumes of PBS + 20 mM imidazole and eluted twice with five column volumes of PBS + 250 mM imidazole. Antibodies and AbLecs were buffer-exchanged into PBS using PD-10 desalting columns (GE). Purified avelumab monoclonal antibody was purchased from Selleck Chemicals, and purified anti-GD2, nivolumab and pembrolizumab antibodies were purchased from BioXCell.

For SDS–PAGE gels, 1 μg of protein with SDS loading dye (non-reducing conditions), or SDS dye + 1 M β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 95 °C for 5 min (reducing conditions), was loaded onto a Criterion XT 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel, 18-well (Bio-Rad) and run with XT-MES buffer at 180 V for 40–60 min. Total protein content was visualized using Aquastain (Bulldog Bio) with staining for 10 min followed by a 10 min destain in water. For western blots, 0.2 μg of protein was loaded onto an SDS–PAGE gel and run as described above and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Midi Nitrocellulose Transfer Kit (Bio-Rad) at 25 V for 14 min. The membrane was blocked in FACS buffer for 0.5–1 h at room temperature, then stained with anti-HA Tag Polyclonal Antibody (clone SG77, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:500–1:5,000) and anti-6×His antibody (clone J099B12, BioLegend; 1:2,000–1:5,000) for 1 h in FACS buffer with shaking at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween), followed by staining with secondary antibodies IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Mouse or Goat anti-Rabbit and IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Rabbit or Goat anti-Mouse (all secondaries; LI-COR; 1:15,000) in PBST for 0.5–1 h with shaking at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBST and one wash with PBS before imaging. All gels and blots were imaged on an Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR), and images were analysed using Image Studio Lite (v.5.2.5).

A total of 5 μg of each AbLec was digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin for proteomic analysis. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 55 °C with 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)fosfine (TCEP), followed by a 30 min incubation at room temperature in the dark with 20 mM 2-chloroacetamide, and then quenched for 15 min at room temperature using an additional 2.5 mM TCEP. A final concentration of 1% sodium deoxycholate was added, followed by trypsin or chymotrypsin (Promega) at a 1:20 w/w ratio, and digestions proceeded at 37 °C overnight. The following morning, a 2% formic acid v/v was added twice to precipitate the SDC and quench the digestion. Samples were desalted over a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (Strata-X) cartridge (Phenomenex), following the vendor-supplied protocol. Samples were dried using vacuum centrifugation and then resuspended in 0.1% formic acid in water at a concentration of 0.5 µg µl−1 for MS analysis.

Approximately 1 µg of peptide was injected per analysis, wherein peptides were separated over a 25 cm Aurora Series Gen2 reverse-phase liquid chromatography column (75 μm inner diameter packed with 1.7 μm FSC C18 particles; Ion Opticks). The mobile phases (A, water with 0.1% formic acid; B, acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) were driven and controlled by a Vanquish Neo UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gradient elution was performed at 300 nl min−1. Mobile phase B was held at 0% and set to 2.2% at 0.1 min, followed by an increase to 25% at 85 min, a ramp to 99% B at 85 min and washed using consecutive iterations of 99% to 2% B for 5 min, for a total analysis time of 90 min. Flow was then ramped back to 0% B to re-equilibrate the column at 0% B. Eluted peptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid MS system124 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Precursors were ionized using a Nanospray Flex ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) held at +2.0 kV compared to ground. The inlet capillary temperature was held at 275 °C. Survey scans of peptide precursors were collected in the Orbitrap from 375–1600 m/z with an MS1 AGC target of 10% (400,000 charges), a maximum injection time of 251 ms and a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled for peptide isotopic distributions, precursors of z = 2–6 were selected for data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scans for 3 s of cycle time and dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s with a ±10 ppm window set around the precursor monoisotope. An isolation window of 0.7 m/z was used to select precursor ions with the quadrupole. MS/MS scans were collected using higher-energy collisional dissociation at 30 normalized collision energy with an AGC target of 200% (100,000 charges) and a maximum injection time of 59 ms. Mass analysis was performed in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000 at 200 m/z and scan range set to auto calculation.

Raw data were processed using Byonic (v.5.5.2). Oxidation of methionine (+15.994915) was set as a common125 variable modification, protein amino-terminal acetylation (+42.010565) and asparagine deamination (+0.984016) were specified as rare variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021464) was set as a fixed modification. Up to three common and two rare modifications were permitted. A precursor ion search tolerance of 10 ppm and a product ion mass tolerance of 20 ppm were used for searches, and three missed cleavages were allowed for full trypsin specificity (carboxy-terminal of RK) and chymotrypsin (C-terminal of FLWY). Peptide spectral matches were made against custom FASTA sequence files that contained appropriate combinations of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 holes, and antibody knobs and light chains. Peptides were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate, and a 1% protein false discovery rate was applied according to the target-decoy method. All peptide identifications were manually inspected, and sequences coverages were calculated only from validated peptide identifications. Sequence coverage percentages are derived from the proportion of amino acids explained by peptide identifications relative to the total number of amino acids.

T7/9 AbLecs, trastuzumab and Siglec-7/9-Fcs were normalized to equal concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mg ml−1 in PBS.

For SYPRO Orange assays, 20 µl of protein was mixed with SYPRO Orange Dye at a final dye concentration of 5× (diluted from 5,000× stock) in a PCR plate and sealed with an optically clear adhesive cover. Reactions were run and imaged using a CFX384 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Following an initial 2 min incubation at 25 °C, the temperature was increased in 0.5 °C increments to 95 °C. Fluorescence was imaged following a 1 min incubation–equilibration period at each temperature. Melting curves were plotted as the first derivative of SYPRO Orange fluorescence with respect to temperature, and melting temperatures were determined as the lowest temperature at which a local maximum in this derivative occurred.

Nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) assays were performed using a Prometheus Panta instrument (NanoTemper Technologies). Protein samples were loaded into Prometheus Standard Capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies), and a nanoDSF thermal gradient was run from 25 °C to 95 °C with a step size of 0.5 °C min−1. Melting curves were plotted as the first derivative of the ratio of fluorescence emission at 350 nm/330 nm with respect to temperature. Melting temperatures were determined as the lowest temperature at which a local minimum or maximum in this derivative occurred.

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA). Siglec-Fc or human IgG1 isotype Fc (R&D Systems) precomplexes with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647)-labelled donkey anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were prepared at equimolar concentrations (7.5 nM) in FACS buffer. Biotin-labelled MALII lectin (Vector Labs, 10 μg ml−1) was precomplexed with AF647-Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1 μg ml−1) in FACS buffer. Staining was performed for 30 min on ice at 1 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were subsequently washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer, resuspended in FACS buffer containing 100 nM SytoxGreen or 1 μM SytoxBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed by flow cytometry (BD LSR II or BD Symphony).

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer, as above. To quantify HER2, GD2, CD20 or EGFR expression, cells were stained with 7.5 nM antibody (trastuzumab, anti-GD2, rituximab or cetuximab, respectively) or a human IgG1 isotype control in FACS buffer for 30 min on ice at 1 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were subsequently washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer, resuspended in FACS buffer with 7.5 nM AF647-labelled donkey anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and stained for 30 min on ice. Following incubation with the secondary antibody, cells were washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer, resuspended in FACS buffer containing 100 nM SytoxGreen or 1 μM SytoxBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed by flow cytometry (BD LSR II or BD Symphony). For all other flow experiments, cells were stained with 10 μg ml−1 dye-labelled antibodies or the appropriate isotype controls in FACS buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. All antibody clones used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer, resuspended in FACS buffer containing 100 nM SytoxGreen or 1 μM SytoxBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed by flow cytometry (BD LSR II or BD Symphony).

K562-HER2, SK-BR-3 or activated primary human CD3+ T cells were isolated from the cell culture supernatant or by dissociation with TrypLE (Gibco), respectively, washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer. A total of 60,000 cells were then distributed into wells of a 96-well V-bottom plate (Corning). Various concentrations of trastuzumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, Siglec-Fcs (R&D Systems), Galectin-9-Fc (Sino Biological) or AbLecs were added to the cells in equal volumes and incubated with cells for 1 h at 4 °C with periodic pipet mixing. Cells were washed three times in FACS buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA), pelleting by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C between washes. Cells were resuspended in 4 μg ml−1 AF647-labelled donkey anti-human secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in FACS buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were further washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer, and fluorescence was analysed by flow cytometry (BD LSR II or BD Symphony). Gating was performed using FlowJo (v.10.0) software (Tree Star) to eliminate debris and isolate single cells. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the cell populations was normalized to the MFI of cells stained with 50 nM trastuzumab from each experimental replicate. MFI values were fit to a one-site total binding curve using GraphPad Prism (v.10.4), which calculated the apparent KD values as the antibody concentration needed to achieve a half-maximum binding.

MVsim55, a multivalent binding simulation application (v.1.1 with MATLAB 2021a), was used to model the binding of trastuzumab, T7 AbLec, T7A mutant AbLec and Siglec-7-Fc to K562-HER2 cells. MVsim models the effects of molecular valency, topology, affinity and kinetics on the binding dynamics of multivalent and multispecific macromolecular receptor–ligand systems. Here, MVsim was used to create a modelling routine that simulated, through the microstate binding model55, the interaction of antibodies and antibody-like chimeras to surfaces populated with specific targeted ligands/antigens. The designed sequences and structures of the biomolecules were used to parameterize the model with the binding valencies. Here, the trastuzumab, T7A AbLec and Siglec-7-Fc reference biomolecules, as well as the T7 AbLec, were modelled as topologically related, Fc domain-driven, immunoglobulin dimers, each with a valency of two. The model was further parameterized with monovalent binding affinities that were experimentally estimated here (as described in the previous section, ‘AbLec and antibody binding isotherms') or informed by the supporting literature. Affinities were parameterized as follows: trastuzumab monovalent KD = 11.2 nM and Siglec-7-Fc monovalent KD = 200 µM126,127.

The parameterized model was then used to fit the flow cytometry-based experimental binding data for the avidities (KD,eff) and effective concentration ([Ceff]) parameters that derive from the spatial, nearest-neighbour proximity of pairs of targeted cell surface ligands or antigens. This was done by using a 2:3 HER2:Siglec-7 ratio and fitting for a global maximum MFI across all binding curves to constrain experimental binding curves that did not reach saturation (for example, Siglec-7-Fc). All simulations also included a 270 s dissociation step after equilibrium to mimic the delays arising from sample preparation and data collection by flow cytometry. The parameterized model was then further used to simulate competition experiments between Siglec-7-Fc and T7 AbLec on K562-HER2 cells. The setup of the competitive binding model is described in Supplementary Fig. 1d,e, and the ligand concentrations (0–100 nM AbLec and 200 nM Siglec-7-Fc) mirrored the experimental conditions to which the model was compared.

Siglec-Fc decoy receptors were expressed in Expi293F cells that stably express the human formylglycine-generating enzyme for aldehyde tagging. Siglec-Fc constructs were expressed according to the Expi293F manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified by manual gravity column (Bio-Rad) using protein A agarose (Fisher Scientific) as described for antibodies above, with the modification that transfected cells, supernatant and purified Siglec-Fcs were stored in the dark. Siglecs were then buffer-exchanged into acidic buffer, concentrated and conjugated with HIPS-azide as we previously described16. Siglec-Fc-azide was then buffer-exchanged into PBS. Then, 100× molar equivalents of DBCO-AF647 (Click Chemistry Tools, 1302-1) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were added, and the reaction was mixed at 500 rpm in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. Siglecs were buffer-exchanged into PBS by 6× centrifugation on Amicon columns (30 kDa MWCO), and AF647 addition was confirmed by using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer at 650 nm for the AF647 dye (extinction coefficient, 239,000) and at 280 nm for the protein (using extinction coefficients calculated for each protein by ExPASy)128.

Dye-labelled galectin-9-Fc (Sino Biological), nivolumab (BioXCell) and pembrolizumab (BioXCell) were generated by site-specific conjugation. In brief, oYo-Link Azide reagent (Alpha Thera) was mixed with 1.5 molar equivalents of DBCO-Alexa Fluor 647 (Vector Laboratories) and incubated in the dark at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The next day, 100 μg galectin-9-Fc or antibody was added to clear PCR tubes (<150 μl total reaction volume) or 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (150 μl to 1 ml total reaction volume). Reaction tubes were incubated on their sides on ice 1–4 inches (~2.5–10 cm) below a 365–385 nM UV lamp for 2 h. AF647-labelled protein was purified from free dye/oYo-Link using 40 kDa molecular weight cutoff Zeba spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff Amicon columns (Sigma-Aldrich). AF647 addition was confirmed by using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer at 650 nm for the AF647 dye (extinction coefficient 239,000) and at 280 nm for the protein (using extinction coefficients calculated for each protein by ExPASy)128.

K562-HER2 or activated primary human T cells were isolated from the cell culture supernatant, washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer. Cells were aliquoted for sialidase treatment with 100 nM V. cholerae sialidase at 37 °C for 30 min in FACS buffer. The V. cholerae sialidase cleaves all linkages (α2,3; α2,6; and α2,8) of terminal sialic acid, and thus can effectively degrade Siglec ligands12,16. Expression and purification of V. cholerae sialidase was performed as previously reported12. A total of 60,000 untreated or sialidase-treated cells were then distributed into wells of a 96-well V-bottom plate (Corning). Various concentrations of antibodies or AbLecs were combined with 200 nM Siglec-7/9-Fc-AF647, 0.3 μg ml−1 MEM-59-AF647, 25 nM Galectin-9-Fc-AF647, 0.1 nM nivolumab-AF647 or 0.1 nM pembrolizumab-AF647, added to the cells in equal volumes and incubated with cells for 2–3 h at 4 °C with periodic pipet mixing. Cells were washed three times and resuspended in FACS buffer, pelleting by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C between washes, and fluorescence was analysed by flow cytometry (BD LSR II or BD Symphony). Gating was performed using FlowJo (v.10.0) software (Tree Star) to eliminate debris and isolate single cells. The MFI of the cell populations was background-subtracted and normalized to the MFI of cells stained with 200 nM Siglec-7/9-Fc-AF647, 0.3 μg ml−1 MEM-59-AF647, 25 nM Galectin-9-Fc-AF647, 0.1 nM nivolumab-AF647 or 0.1 nM pembrolizumab-AF647 without antibody or AbLecs from each experimental replicate.

SK-BR-3 and K562-HER2 cells were isolated from the cell culture supernatant or lifted with trypsin (Gibco), washed with 8 ml culture media, pelleted by centrifugation at 300g and resuspended in phenol-red-free culture medium containing 50 nM Sytox green cell dead stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for K562-HER2 cells or 5 nM Sytox red dead cell stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for SK-BR-3 cells to measure cytotoxicity. Cells were plated onto a flat-bottomed 96-well plate (10,000 cells per well, 95 μl); then, 5 μl of AbLec, Siglec or antibody in PBS was added and mixed, followed by centrifugation at 30g for 1 min. Images were acquired using an IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System (Sartorius) every 2 h for 3 days. SK-BR-3 cells were analysed by phase with segmentation adjustment = 1 and a minimum area of 200 μm2; cell death was quantified by red fluorescence using a threshold of 0.3 red calibrated unit (RCU), with an edge sensitivity of −50 and areas between 50 and 1,000 μm. K562-HER2 phase segmentation adjustment was 0.2, with no hole-fill and a minimum area of 60 μm. Cell death was quantified by green fluorescence using a threshold of 2 RCU, with an edge sensitivity of −45 and areas between 50 and 800 μm with eccentricity and integrated intensities less than 0.95 and 40,000, respectively.

LRS chambers were obtained from anonymous healthy donors through the Stanford Blood Center. PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs were extracted from the PBS/Ficoll interface, washed once with PBS and resuspended in serum-free RPMI. Monocytes were isolated by plating ~1 × 108 PBMCs in a T75 flask containing serum-free RPMI for 1–2 h, followed by three washes with PBS +Ca +Mg to remove non-adherent cells. The media was then replaced with IMDM with 10% Human AB Serum (Gemini) and incubated for 7–9 days to induce macrophage differentiation before use in phagocytosis or flow cytometry experiments.

Macrophages were washed with PBS and lifted by 30 min incubation at 37 °C with 10 ml TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Macrophages were pelleted by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min and resuspended in IncuCyte medium (phenol-red-free RPMI + 10% HI FBS). Macrophages (10,000 cells in 100 μl) were added to a 96-well flat-bottom plate (Corning) and incubated in a humidified incubator for 1 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Meanwhile, target cells were washed once with PBS, then treated with 1:80,000 diluted pHrodo red succinimidyl ester dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min, washed once with PBS and resuspended in IncuCyte medium. Finally, 10 μl of 20× antibody or AbLec stocks in PBS were added to the macrophages, followed by the addition of pHrodo red-stained target cells (20,000 cells in 90 μl). Antibodies, Siglec-Fcs and AbLecs were added at 25 nM, Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 blocking antibodies (1E8 and mAbA clones, respectively20; Creative Biolabs) were used at 12.5–25 μg ml−1, V. cholerae sialidase was used at 100 nM and human IgG1 isotype antibody (BioXCell), rat IgG2a isotype antibody (BioXCell) and CD47 blocking antibody (clone B6H12, BioXCell)23 were added at 10 μg ml−1 unless otherwise noted. For FcγR blocking experiments, macrophages were pre-treated during the 1 h incubation in the 96-well assay plate with human IgG1 isotype antibody (BioXCell), which binds and occupies human FcγRs, or rat IgG2a isotype antibody (BioXCell) as a control with minimal binding to human FcγRs129. For Siglec-7/9 blocking experiments, macrophages were pre-treated during the 1 h incubation in the 96-well assay plate with Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 blocking antibodies (1E8 and mAbA clones, respectively20; Creative Biolabs). Cells were plated by gentle centrifugation (50g, 2 min). Two images per well were acquired using an IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System (Sartorius) at 1 h intervals until the maximum signal was reached. The quantification of pHrodo red fluorescence was empirically optimized for phagocytosis of each cell line based on their background fluorescence and size. K562 and MDA-MB-231 cells were analysed with a threshold of 0.8, an edge sensitivity of −70 and the area was gated between 100 and 2,000 μm2 with integrated intensities between 300 and 2,000 RCU × μm2 per image. HCC-1954 were analysed with a threshold of 1.5, an edge sensitivity of −45 and an area between 30 and 2,000 μm2. SK-BR-3 analysis had a threshold of 1, an edge sensitivity of −55, a minimum integrated intensity of 60 and a maximum area and eccentricity of 3,000 and 0.96, respectively. Ramos and Raji analysis used a threshold of 1.5, an edge sensitivity of −45 and areas between 100 and 2,000 μm2. The total red object integrated intensity (RCU × µm2 per image) was quantified for each image, and the maximum total red object integrated intensity value is reported for each treatment condition.

For phagocytosis and cell growth assays, images were obtained over time using an Incucyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System (Essen BioScience) within a Thermo Fisher Scientific tissue culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Data were acquired from a ×10 objective lens in phase contrast, a green fluorescence channel (excitation, 460 ± 20; emission, 524 ± 20; acquisition time, 300 ms) and from a red fluorescence channel (excitation, 585 ± 20; emission, 665 ± 40; acquisition time, 400 ms). Two images per well were acquired at intervals.

PBMCs were isolated from LRS chambers as described above, and cryostocks were prepared at 2–4 × 107 cells in 90% heat-inactivated FBS + 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen vapour until use. The day before use, stocks were thawed and NK cells were isolated using an EasySep NK isolation kit (StemCell Technologies). Isolated NK cells were cultured with 0.5 µg ml−1 recombinant IL-2 (BioLegend) in RPMI + 10% heat-inactivated FBS for 24 h before use in NK cell cytotoxicity or flow cytometry experiments.

Target cells were lifted with TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stained with CellTracker Deep Red dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NK cells and target cells were mixed at an effector to target ratio of 4:1 (SK-BR-3 cells) or 2:1 (K562 cells), and Sytox Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added at 100 nM. Antibodies, Siglec decoy receptors and AbLecs were added at 25 nM, Siglec-7 blocking antibody (clone 1E8, Creative BioLabs)20 was used at 12.5–25 μg ml−1, CD16-blocking antibody (clone 3G8, BioLegend) was added at 10 μg ml−1 and V. cholerae sialidase was used at 100 nM unless otherwise noted. For FcγR and Siglec-7 blocking experiments, NK cells were pre-treated with CD16-blocking antibody (clone 3G8, BioLegend) or Siglec-7 blocking antibody (clone 1E8, Creative BioLabs)20, respectively, before the addition of target cells and other treatments. After a 5–6 h incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, cell death was analysed by flow cytometry by selecting the CellTracker Deep Red+ cells and quantifying the per cent dead as Sytox Green ± total CellTracker Deep Red+ cells. NK cytotoxicity index was then calculated as the ratio of dead to alive cells in the assay: % dead / (100 − % dead).

PMNs were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation using Polymorphprep (Progen), as previously described130. Isolated PMNs were >82% pure by flow cytometry.

PMN-mediated cytotoxicity was analysed in chromium-51 [51Cr] release assays as previously described131. AbLecs and antibodies were added at varying concentrations. The CD47 blocking antibody hu5F9-IgG2σ was added at 20 µg ml−1. Effector cells and 51Cr-labelled target cells were added at a ratio of 40:1. After 3 h incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, 51Cr release was measured in counts per minute (cpm) in a MikroBetaTrilux 1450 liquid scintillation and luminescence counter (PerkinElmer). Maximal 51Cr release was achieved by the addition of 2% v/v Triton-X 100 solution, while basal 51Cr release was measured in the absence of antibodies. Specific tumour cell lysis in % was calculated as follows:

Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories and housed at the Comparative Bioscience Center at The Rockefeller University or in Stanford University vivaria. SigE−/− mice were developed previously20. SigE−/− Sig7/9 hFcγR mice were generated by crossing previously developed SigE−/− Sig7/920 and hFcγR63 mouse lines. SigE−/− and SigE−/− Sig7/9 hFcγR mice were bred and maintained at the Comparative Bioscience Center at The Rockefeller University or in Stanford University vivaria. Genotypes were confirmed using PCR in-house, as previously described20,63, or with validated qPCR probes (Transnetyx). The effects of these genetic modifications on Siglec-E/7/9 and human and mouse Fc gamma receptors have been extensively characterized20,63. All experiments carried out at The Rockefeller University were performed in compliance with federal laws and institutional guidelines and have been approved by The Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments involving animals carried out at Stanford University were similarly performed in compliance with federal laws as well as institutional guidelines and were approved by the Administrative Panel on Lab Animal Care (APLAC) under protocol number 31511. Husbandry was performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were housed under the following conditions: 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle; ambient temperature of 20–22 °C; and relative humidity of between 30 and 70%. All studies were performed on age-matched and sex-matched female and male mice.

Groups of two 8–12-month-old SigE−/− Sig7/9 hFcγR mice were dosed with 1.5 nmol (~ 10 mg kg−1) trastuzumab or T7/9 AbLec intraperitoneally at t = 0. Blood samples were collected at t = 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h following injection. Serum was isolated by centrifugation at 4,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and antibody or AbLec concentration in serum was assessed with western blot. For western blots, 0.5 μl of each serum sample was mixed with non-reducing SDS loading dye (non-reducing conditions), loaded onto a Criterion XT 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel, 18-well (Bio-Rad) and run with XT-MES buffer at 180 V for 40–60 min. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Midi Nitrocellulose Transfer Kit (Bio-Rad) at 25 V for 14 min. The membrane was blocked in FACS buffer for 0.5–1 h at room temperature, stained with IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Human antibody (LI-COR; 1:10,000) in PBST for 0.5–1 h with shaking at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBST and one wash with PBS before imaging on an Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR). Antibody and AbLec concentrations in serum were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the average densitometry at t = 6 h. All serum samples from an individual mouse were analysed on the same blot to ensure accurate quantification.

B16D5-HER2 lung colonization models were established by intravenously inoculating each mouse in the lateral tail vein with 0.3 or 0.5 × 106 cells suspended in 200 μl PBS. For survival studies, groups of four or five 8–12-week-old wild-type and SigE−/− mice were monitored for 30 days. For therapeutic efficacy studies, treatment groups of seven or eight 8–12-month-old SigE−/− Sig7/9 hFcγR mice were randomized and received intraperitoneal injections of 2.25 nmol (~ 15 mg kg−1) of trastuzumab or T7/9 AbLecs every other day after tumour inoculation, and animal weights were measured every 3–4 days. On day 14, lungs were dissected, fixed with Fekete's buffer (70% ethanol, 4% glacial acetic acid, 1.2% formalin in MilliQ water), and surface metastatic foci were quantified using a dissecting microscope.

Macrophage–cancer cell co-cultures in RPMI + 10% heat-inactivated FBS were prepared by adding 4 × 107 K562-HER2 cells directly to a T75 flask containing macrophages on day 7–9 of differentiation from monocytes for a final effector to target cell ratio of ~2:1. Co-cultures were treated with PBS or equimolar (25 nM) quantities of Siglec-7 blocking antibody (1E8 clone20; Creative Biolabs), trastuzumab or T7 AbLec and incubated in a humidified incubator for 6 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Following incubation, T75 flasks were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove non-adherent K562-HER2 cells, and the remaining macrophages were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (1 ml per T75 flask) (Thermo Fisher, 89900) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, 5870S) and HALT protease inhibitor (1:100; Thermo Fisher, 78429), per the manufacturer's protocol. Macrophage lysates were sonicated for 30 s at 50% pulse to improve lysis efficiency before clarification by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000g. Protein concentration was quantified by BCA (Thermo Fisher, 23227).

Digestion was performed on 100 µg protein using a mini S-trap protocol provided by the manufacturer (Protifi)132. Here, proteins were adjusted to 5% SDS and reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min at 95 °C. Cysteines were alkylated using 30 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min each at room temperature in the dark. The lysate was then acidified with phosphoric acid, adjusted to approximately 80–90% methanol with 100 mM TEAB in 90% methanol and loaded onto the S-trap column. Following washing with 100 mM TEAB in 90% methanol, trypsin (Promega) was added to the S-trap at a 20:1 protein to protease ratio for 90 min at 47 °C. Peptides from each lysate were labelled with 10-plex TMT (Tandem Mass Tags, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at room temperature using recently published protocols133,134. Samples from each donor were kept in separate TMT experiments so that each donor used eight channels of a single 10-plex kit. The labelling scheme was the same for each donor: PBS vehicle replicates in channels 126 C and 127 C; αSig7 replicates in 127 N and 128 N (donor 2); empty channels for 128 C and 129 N; trastuzumab replicates in 129 C and 130 C; and T7 AbLec replicates in 130 N and 131 N. A test mix was run for each combined TMT experiment (that is, one per donor) to confirm >99% labelling efficiency and even distribution of signal across all channels before quenching of the TMT labelling reaction (0.5 µl 50% hydroxylamine reacted for 15 min). Peptides from each channel were then combined before phosphopeptide enrichment, which was performed as previously described135. In brief, 100 µl magnetic titanium(IV) immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (Ti(IV)-IMAC, ReSyn Biosciences) beads were washed three times with 1 ml 80% acetonitrile/6% TFA (all washes were 1 ml)136. Peptides were dissolved in 1 ml 80% acetonitrile/6% TFA and gently vortexed with the TI(IV)-IMAC beads for 45 min. Beads were then washed with three 80% acetonitrile/6% TFA, one 80% acetonitrile, one 0.5 M glycolic acid/80% acetonitrile and two 80% acetonitrile washes. Peptides were eluted with 500 µl 50% acetonitrile, 1% ammonium hydroxide. Eluates were dried down in a speed vac and further cleaned up on Strata-X SPE cartridges (Phenomenex) by conditioning the cartridge with 1 ml ACN followed by 1 ml 0.2% formic acid in water. Peptides were resuspended in 0.2% formic acid in water and then loaded onto the cartridge, followed by a 1 ml wash with 0.2% formic acid in water. Peptides were eluted with 400 µl of 0.2% formic acid in 80% ACN and dried via lyophilization.

All samples were resuspended in 0.2% formic acid in water before liquid chromatography–MS/MS analysis. Enriched phosphopeptides were resuspended in 15 µl total with 4 µl injected per analysis. Triplicate injections were collected for all samples. All phosphopeptide mixtures were separated over a 25 cm EASY-Spray reversed-phase liquid chromatography column (75 µm inner diameter packed with 2 μm, 100 Å, PepMap C18 particles; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phases (A, water with 0.2% formic acid; B, acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid) were driven and controlled by a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RPLC nano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An integrated loading pump was used to load peptides onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 5 µm particles, 20 mm length; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 8 µl min−1, which was put in line with the analytical column 4 min into the gradient for the total protein samples. The gradient increased from 0% to 5% B over the first 4 min of the analysis, followed by an increase from 5% to 25% B from 4 to 158 min, an increase from 25% to 90% B from 158 to 162 min, isocratic flow at 90% B from 162 to 168 min and a re-equilibration at 0% for 12 min for a total analysis time of 180 min. Eluted phosphopeptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Precursors were ionized using an EASY-Spray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) held at +2.2 kV compared to ground, and the column was held at 40 °C. The inlet capillary temperature was held at 275 °C. Survey scans of peptide precursors were collected in the Orbitrap from 350–1,350 Th with an AGC target of 1,000,000, a maximum injection time of 50 ms and a resolution of 60,000 at 200 m/z. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled for peptide isotopic distributions, precursors of z = 2–5 were selected for data-dependent MS/MS scans for 2 s of cycle time, and dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s with a ±10 ppm window set around the precursor monoisotope. An isolation window of 1 Th was used to select precursor ions with the quadrupole. MS/MS scans were collected using higher-energy collisional dissociation at 30 normalized collision energy with an AGC target of 100,000 and a maximum injection time of 118 ms. Mass analysis was performed in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 with a first mass set at 100 Th.

All data were searched with the Andromeda search engine137 in MaxQuant138 (v.2.4.2), using the entire human proteome downloaded from Uniprot139 (reviewed, 20,428 entries). All raw files were searched together, and technical injections per donor-specific TMT experiment were labelled as fractions. Cleavage specificity was set to Trypsin/P with three missed cleavages allowed and variable modifications of phosphorylation on serine/threonine/tyrosine, oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the protein N-terminus with four maximum modifications per peptide. The experiment type was set to Reporter ion MS2, and only the TMT channels used (as described above) were selected to be included. The reporter ion mass tolerance was set to 0.3 Da, and the minimum reporter PIF score was set to 0.75. Defaults were used for the remaining settings, including peptide spectral match and protein false discovery rate thresholds of 0.01 and 20 ppm, 4.5 ppm and 20 ppm for first search MS1 tolerance, main search MS1 tolerance and MS2 product ion tolerance, respectively. Match between runs was not enabled.

Quantified phosphosites were then processed in Perseus140. Contaminants and reverse hits were removed, and results were filtered for phosphosites that had localization probabilities of >0.75; signal in all relevant TMT channels was required. Significance testing was performed using a two-tailed paired-sample t-test for pairwise comparisons with appropriate multiple comparisons correction. Gene Ontology term enrichment was performed using g:Profiler141. After processing in Perseus, data from pairwise comparisons of treatment conditions were exported as text files for interrogation using PTM-SEA73. For each phosphopeptide, a protein-phosphosite identifier was created by concatenating the UniProt ID, amino acid and phosphorylation position in the format {UniProt-ID}-{Amino Acid}{Position}. This identifier, along with enrichment data, was then reformatted into GCT (v.1.3) files using Morpheus142, following the specifications outlined at CLUE (https://clue.io/connectopedia/gct_format). GCT files were uploaded to the PTM-SEA module on GenePattern, alongside a UniProt-centric pathway database downloaded from the PTM-SEA GitHub repository. PTM-SEA results were retrieved from the web server and compiled by donor, treatment, pathway ID and enrichment score. Subsequently, the compiled PTM-SEA results were analysed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Data were visualized using seaborn's clustermap function (metric = ‘cityblock', method = ‘average'), based on pathway fold-enrichment across donors and conditions.

Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared to functionalize silica beads for immune synapse imaging assays. For IgG functionalized silica beads, the following chloroform-suspended lipids were mixed and desiccated overnight to remove chloroform: 98.8% POPC (Avanti, 850457), 1% biotinyl cap PE (Avanti, 870273), 0.1% PEG5000-PE (Avanti, 880230) and 0.1% atto647-DOPE (ATTO-TEC, AD 647–161).

For beads conjugated with recombinant HER2, the following chloroform-suspended lipids were mixed and desiccated overnight to remove chloroform: 97.8% POPC (Avanti, 850457), 2% DGS-NTA (Avanti, 790404), 0.1% PEG5000-PE (Avanti, 880230) and 0.1% atto390-DOPE (ATTO-TEC, AD 390–161).

In both cases, the lipid sheets were resuspended in PBS and stored under inert gas. The lipids were then broken into SUVs by several rounds of freeze–thaws. The lipids were then stored at −80 °C under inert gas. To remove aggregated lipids, the solution was diluted to 2 mM and filtered through a 0.22 μM filter (Millipore, SLLG013SL) immediately before use.

Silica beads with a 5.01 μm diameter (10% solids; Bangs Labs, SS05003, lot 16595) were washed several times with PBS, mixed with 1 mM SUVs in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with end-over-end mixing to allow for bilayer formation. Beads were then washed with PBS to remove excess SUVs and incubated in 0.2% casein (Sigma-Aldrich, C5890) in PBS for 15 min before protein coupling.

For IgG conjugated beads, anti-biotin Alexa Fluor 647-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories 200-602-211, lot 156182) was added at 500 μM to a 10× dilution of beads (1% solids), unless otherwise indicated and incubated for 30 min with end-over-end mixing. When indicated, 10 μM ganglioside GD2 (Cayman Chemical, 25487) was added to beads for 30 min and incubated with end-over-end mixing.

For HER2 conjugated beads, recombinant human HER2 (Sino Biological, 10004-H08H4) was added at 1000 nM. Proteins were coupled to the bilayer for 30 min at room temperature with end-over-end mixing. When indicated, 10 μM ganglioside GD2 (Cayman Chemical, 25487) was added to beads for 30 min and incubated with end-over-end mixing. Trastuzumab or T7 AbLec was then added to beads at 500 μM for 30 min and incubated with end-over-end mixing.

Approximately 50,000 RAW264.7-Siglec-7–mGFP macrophages were plated in one well of a 96-well glass-bottom MatriPlate (Brooks, MGB096-1-2-LG-L) between 12 and 24 h before the experiment.

For phagocytosis assays, ~8 × 105 beads were added to wells and engulfment was allowed to proceed for 30 min. The cells were imaged using spinning disc microscopy (×40/0.95 NA Plan Apo air). Internalized particles were identified by their fluorescent supported lipid bilayer, and counted in ImageJ by a blinded analyst using the Blind-Analysis-Tools-1.0 ImageJ plug-in.

For immune synapse imaging assays, ~8 × 105 beads were added to wells, and individual bead contacts were imaged through multiple z planes at various stages of phagocytosis using spinning disk confocal microscopy (×100/1.49 NA oil immersion objective). Siglec-7–mGFP enrichment at bead contacts compared to the cell cortex was determined using the line analyser tool in ImageJ and was normalized to a membrane-bound control protein (CAAX–mCherry).

PBMCs were isolated from LRS chambers, cryostocks were prepared at 2–4 × 107 cells in 90% heat-inactivated FBS + 10% DMSO and stocks were stored in liquid nitrogen vapour until use, as described above. Human T cells were isolated from thawed cryostocks using an EasySep CD3+ T cell isolation kit (StemCell Technologies). T cells were cultured at a 1:2 cell to bead ratio with cultured αCD3/αCD28 activator beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 50 ng ml−1 recombinant IL-2 (BioLegend) in RPMI + 10% heat-inactivated FBS for 3 days before use.

Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism (v.10.4) and using Hierarch143 (v.1.1.6). Unless otherwise noted, the following statistical tests were used for data analysis. In binding assays, NK cell cytotoxicity experiments, phagocytosis experiments and Siglec expression analyses, ordinary one-way ANOVAs were performed with Tukey's multiple comparisons test to compare treatment groups. Unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were performed to determine statistical significance when comparing two treatment conditions. Hierarch's many-sample, multiple hypothesis test with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple comparisons correction was used to determine statistical significance from biological replicates collected across multiple donors. All results were confirmed with multiple biological replicates as indicated in the figure legends. All data were tested for outliers using GraphPad Outlier Calculator (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/Grubbs1.cfm), and significant outliers (P < 0.05) were removed.

(a, b) Thermal stability of Siglec-7/9-Fc, trastuzumab, and T7/9 AbLecs was measured via the first derivative of SYPRO Orange fluorescence (a) or intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (b) with respect to temperature. Both assays indicate melting temperatures for T7 and T9 AbLecs between 55–60 °C, similar to their corresponding Siglec-7/9-Fc arms and well above physiological temperature (37 °C). Traces represent averages of n = 3 biological replicates. (c) HER2 expression on SK-BR-3 cells measured via trastuzumab staining compared to hIgG1 isotype antibody by flow cytometry. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (d) Sig7L and Sig9L expression measured via Siglec-7/9-Fc staining of SK-BR-3 cells compared to hIgG1 isotype control. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (e) Crystal structure of Siglec-7 bound to the sialic acid mimetic, oxamido-Neu5Ac (PDB Code: 2G5R). The arginine at position 124 (R124), which mediates receptor binding to sialic acid-containing ligands, is highlighted on the protein backbone in green. (f) Binding of T7 AbLec or R124A AbLec mutant with reduced sialic acid binding (T7A AbLec) to SK-BR-3 cells was quantified via flow cytometry (n = 3, binding normalized to 50 nM trastuzumab for each experimental replicate). Apparent dissociation constants (KD) ± 95% confidence intervals for bivalent T7 and T7A AbLec binding to SK-BR-3 cells were determined by fitting experimental data to one-site total binding curves. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (g) Structure of Siglec-9 predicted using AlphaFold 3. The arginine at position 120 (R120), which mediates receptor binding to sialic acid-containing ligands, is highlighted on the protein backbone in green. (h) Binding of T9 AbLec or R120A AbLec mutant with reduced sialic acid binding (T9A AbLec) to SK-BR-3 cells was quantified via flow cytometry (n = 3, binding normalized to 50 nM trastuzumab for each experimental replicate). Apparent dissociation constants (KD) ± 95% confidence intervals for bivalent T9 and T9A AbLec binding to SK-BR-3 cells were determined by fitting experimental data to one-site total binding curves. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (i) HER2 expression on K562-HER2 cells measured via trastuzumab staining compared to hIgG1 isotype antibody by flow cytometry. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (j) Sig7L and Sig9L expression measured via Siglec-7/9-Fc staining of K562-HER2 cells compared to hIgG1 isotype control. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (k) Expression of human Fc gamma receptors FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIII on K562-HER2 cells measured by flow cytometry. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 4 biological replicates. (l) Binding of trastuzumab and T7/9 AbLecs to K562-HER2 cells was quantified via flow cytometry. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. Experimental data were fit using one-site total binding curves. (m) Apparent dissociation constants (KD) ± 95% confidence intervals for bivalent trastuzumab and T7/9 AbLecs were determined by fitting experimental data from (l) to one-site total binding curves. (n) T9 AbLec (25 nM), blocks Siglec-9 receptor binding in competitive binding assays with dye labeled Siglec-9-Fc. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 (sialidase) or n = 4 (PBS, T9 AbLec) biological replicates, normalized to Siglec-9-Fc staining without AbLec. Sialidase-treated cells stained with Siglec-9-Fc are shown as a negative control. (o) T7 AbLec, but not trastuzumab or T9 AbLec, blocks Siglec-7 receptor binding in competitive binding assays with dye labeled Siglec-7-Fc. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates, normalized to Siglec-7-Fc staining without AbLec or antibody. (p) Detection of αCD43 antibody (MEM-59) binding in competitive binding assays with increasing concentrations of T7 AbLec, T9 AbLec, or trastuzumab. The MEM-59 antibody binds to the same epitope on CD43 recognized by the Siglec-7 receptor. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates, normalized to αCD43 staining without AbLec or antibody. P-values were determined by two-tailed unpaired t test (c, i) or Tukey-corrected one-way ANOVA (d, j, k, n, o, p); ns p>0.05, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, and ****p<0.0001.

Source data

(a) Macrophages were defined as CD11b+ by flow cytometry. (b) Macrophages were profiled for expression of human Fc gamma receptors FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIII by flow cytometry. Histograms are representative of macrophages from n = 3 human donors (quantified in c). (c) Expression of FcγRI and FcγRIIa on macrophages measured via flow cytometry was significant compared to staining with an isotype antibody. Data are mean ± s.d. from n = 3 human donors. (d) Macrophages expressed Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 receptors. Histograms are representative of macrophages from n = 3 human donors (quantified in e). (e) Expression of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 receptors on macrophages measured via flow cytometry was significant compared to staining with an isotype antibody. Data are mean ± s.d. from n = 3 human donors. (f-i) No statistically significant difference in cell growth (f, g) or cell death (h, i) was observed in SK-BR-3 or K562-HER2 cultures treated with T7 or T9 AbLecs compared to vehicle, trastuzumab, or Siglec-7/9-Fc controls. Data are mean ± s.d. of n = 3 biological replicates. (j) Macrophages were co-cultured with human cancer cell lines labeled with the pH-sensitive pHrodo red dye that fluoresces red in acidic phagosomes. This enabled quantification of phagocytosis via fluorescence microscopy. (k) Quantification of macrophage phagocytosis of K562-HER2 cells.

Human stem cell-based embryo models provide experimentally amenable in vitro systems for developmental research. A key feature of embryo models is their multi-lineage differentiation, which allows for the study of tissue co-development. Here we develop human trunk-like structures that have morphologically organized somites and a neural tube that form through self-organized, endogenous signalling. Transcriptomic comparison with human embryo datasets suggests that human trunk-like structure cells approximate Carnegie stage 13–14 (28–35 days after fertilization). The absence of a notochord leads to a dorsal identity, but exogenous Sonic Hedgehog signalling activation ventralizes both the somites and the neural tube in a dose-dependent manner. We further identify reciprocal signalling: neural tube-derived cues induce medial ALDH1A2 in somites, which in turn generate retinoic acid signals that drive spontaneous neural-tube patterning. Together, our data highlight the value of modularity in embryo models, which we leverage to explore human trunk co-development.

In the embryo, tissues and organs mature alongside neighbouring tissues, using local interactions that are important for correct development and downstream function. For example, neighbouring tissues may provide positional information through spatially localized cues or provide signalling feedback that balances the proportions of cell fates. Inter-tissue interactions are also important for ensuring synchronized developmental timing, so that the embryo keeps a consistent pace. We refer to this inter-dependency between tissues as ‘co-development'.

There is therefore a need to investigate organogenesis at the multi-tissue level. This has been challenging using embryos because signalling pathway convergence and overlapping communication across many tissues can make it difficult to identify reciprocal interactions between any two tissues of interest. Classical experimental embryology provides a route to explore tissue interactions through manipulations including explants, transplants and excisions (see, for instance, refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8). However, these approaches are not feasible in humans owing to ethical and technical constraints, including limited long-term human embryo culture9.

Stem cell-based embryo models offer a practical alternative10. Their multi-lineage potential enables exploration of inter-tissue interactions, while bottom-up generation of specific tissues in the presence or absence of others can determine the necessity and sufficiency of these interactions11. Importantly, human pluripotent stem (PS) cell-derived models provide scalability, experimental flexibility and species-specific relevance that cannot be achieved with embryos alone.

Several models of early embryogenesis have now been developed. Human gastruloids are self-organized aggregates of PS cells that spontaneously break symmetry, differentiate to all three germ layers and undergo axial elongation and spatiotemporal gene expression along an anteroposterior (AP) axis12. However, they lack morphological complexity, including somitic epithelialization. Mouse gastruloids can form axially organized morphological somites through embedding in an extracellular matrix gel13 and even form integrated somite- and neural tube-containing structures called trunk-like structures (TLSs)14. Likewise, three-dimensional (3D) human models of somitogenesis15,16,17, the caudal neural tube18,19, structures that contain both neural and somitic mesoderm20,21,22, neuromuscular junctions23,24 and notochord progenitors25 have been described. These models showcase the remarkable modularity of embryo models to include or exclude particular tissues, in a building block-like manner. We reasoned that this could be harnessed to explore co-development, focusing particularly on the tissue interactions during axial extension.

Somitic and neural tube development needs to be coordinated to form functional organ systems, for instance, the innervation of muscles to form circuits. There is evidence of co-development between these tissues, such that signals from the neural tube promote myogenesis3,5,6,7,26 and prevent medial Sim1 expression in the somites2, while somitic signals to the neural tube promote neurogenesis8,27. However, the exploration of these interactions in humans has been hampered by a lack of appropriate experimental systems. Here, we modify a somite-only axioloid protocol to develop robust and reproducible human TLSs (hTLSs) that allow us to explore trunk development in the presence or absence of the neural tube.

We find that, owing to the absence of a notochord, the hTLS exhibits dorsal bias, but exogenous activation of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling induces ventralization in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, even without a localized SHH source, we observed neural tube patterning orthogonal to the anterior–posterior (AP) axis, mediated by somite-derived retinoic acid (RA) signalling, which we validate through an RA responsive element (RARE) reporter system. This RA signalling is required for localized PAX6 expression in the neural tube and for neurogenesis. Moreover, the neural tube was able to induce ALDH1A2 expression specifically in medial somites, a finding that we validated in mouse embryos. Our findings highlight the potential of stem cell-based embryo models to uncover the regulatory logic of co-development and show that the modular nature of embryo models can offer insights into the coordination of tissue interactions during early human organogenesis.

While mouse gastruloids embedded in low percentage Matrigel can develop organized epithelial somite structures13,14, human gastruloids had to be exposed to the Nodal signalling inhibitor SB431542 (hereafter, SB43) during pre-treatment12, to generate segments when embedded in 20% Matrigel (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These segments formed sequentially from the posterior, but they did not form rounded, epithelial structures characteristic of somitic morphology in the embryo. Instead, a protocol combining the Wnt–β-catenin activator CHIR99021 (hereafter, Chi) and SB43 at aggregation with embedding in 10% Matrigel enabled morphologically organized somitic tissue formation as axioloids15 (similar to in refs. 16,17). We adapted this protocol from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to human embryonic stem (ES) cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b) by adjusting the Chi concentration according to cell line requirements (Methods). In doing so, we noticed that higher concentrations of Chi biased the cultures towards the mesodermal fate, as expected28, while lower concentrations enabled the coformation of a morphologically organized neural tube alongside the somites (Fig. 1a). These structures increased in somite number, were elongated and displayed an organized somitic and neural tube morphology in 79% of aggregates (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c–g). Marker gene expression confirmed the presence of somitic (MEOX1+) and neural (SOX2+) identities with a pool of progenitors (SOX2+ and TBXT+) at the posterior and a presomitic mesoderm (PSM) domain (TBX6+ and MESP2+) in the tailbud region (Fig. 1c,d). Somites expressed TBX18 anteriorly, particularly in the first one to two newly formed somites, and UNCX4.1 posteriorly (Fig. 1d). As such, the structures were similar to recently described hTLSs20,21,22, with the important distinction that the protocol could be ‘fine-tuned' by adjusting the level of Chi to give somite-only or combined somite- and neural tube-containing structures, thereby allowing direct comparison between structures with the presence or absence of the neural tube.

Source data

Similar to in other in vitro models of somitogenesis15,21, we noted that the morphological organization of the hTLS was critically dependent on embedding in Matrigel and exposure to retinal, as time-matched structures without these had some degree of gene expression organization along an AP axis but no or little morphological organization of somites or the neural tube (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). We were also able to adapt the protocol to a total of ten cell lines (from five parental backgrounds), including both human ES and iPS cells, which showcases the versatility of the protocol beyond intrinsic line-to-line variability (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 2). Detailed step-by-step instructions for forming hTLSs are available at https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.e6nvw4d59lmk/v1 (ref. 29).

To better understand the morphological organization of hTLSs, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize the surface morphology. This showed cell compaction differences, with loosely arranged cells in the posterior tailbud, medium compaction in the PSM and tightly compacted epithelialization in both the neural tube and somite domains (Fig. 1e), in keeping with descriptions in vertebrate embryos30,31. Likewise, the hTLS generated with a ZO-1::mEGFP line showed that both the somites and neural tube had internal ZO-1- and actin-rich lumina, with cells organized as epithelia (Fig. 1f). We therefore wanted to better understand how these epithelial tissues formed in the hTLS.

This question is particularly interesting for the neural tube because it is known to form through two modes of morphogenesis in mammals: primary and secondary. Primary neurulation involves the folding of the neural ectoderm32 and has been extensively studied because malformations are the leading cause of neural tube defects (NTDs) in humans33. By contrast, secondary neurulation—when neural cells condense to form rods that later epithelialize to form a contiguous tube—is much less understood because it accounts for only the caudal-most portion of the axis34. Exactly how secondary neurulation occurs in humans, how the two modes are coordinated and whether the human embryonic neural tube is branched at early stages or contiguous35 are still open questions in the field. Using the ZO-1::mEGFP cell line, we sometimes saw multiple or branched neural tubes, particularly at the posterior pole (Extended Data Fig. 1j). With live imaging, we observed epithelial cysts that progressively merged to generate a contiguous tract (Extended Data Fig. 1k and Supplementary Video 1). Therefore, it seems that the mode of neural tube formation in hTLS structures is similar to secondary neurulation and may prove useful in establishing the cell biological mechanisms of such phenomena in vitro.

To further characterize hTLSs over time, we collected samples at 72 h, 96 h and 120 h and performed 10× single-cell RNA sequencing. We detected populations including a neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) cell state (expressing SOX2 and TBXT), PSM (TBX6, HES7 and DLL1), determination front (RIPPLY1/2 and MESP1/2), somitic (MEOX1 and TCF15) and neural (SOX2 and PAX6) clusters (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3a–e). Cells from early timepoints mostly populated the progenitor populations, while those from later timepoints populated more mature states (Fig. 1h). In addition, we detected sub-clusters including endothelial cells (KDR+ and ETV2+; Extended Data Fig. 3f) that match previous reports of a somite-derived endothelial population in mouse TLSs14, human axioloids15 and embryos36,37. In addition, we observed a small population of mature neural cells (ONECUT2 and ELAVL3; Extended Data Fig. 3g), indicating that neurogenesis starts at 120 h in the hTLS. By contrast, we saw no evidence of notochord, non-neural ectoderm, neural crest, endoderm or lateral plate mesoderm fates, corroborating the observation that the hTLSs contain only neural tube and somitic progenitors (Fig. 1i). Bioinformatic projection onto an existing axioloid dataset15 confirmed that the hTLSs contain neural cell types not present in the somite-only version and also showed some differences in terms of gene expression in the two overlapping somitic clusters, indicating that, while comparable, hTLSs are indeed distinct entities from axioloids (Extended Data Fig. 4a–g). The hTLSs also showed similarities with other somite- and neural tube-containing models21,22 but with some notable differences, such as the absence of a notochord or endoderm (Extended Data Fig. 4h–m).

To further examine whether our annotated clusters had equivalents to the corresponding in vivo states, we projected our dataset onto a human embryonic atlas ranging from Carnegie stage (CS) 12 to CS16 (ref. 38). Our data clearly mapped to the somitic and neural progenitor populations, highlighting that the in vitro populations observed in the hTLS match the expected cell types in the human embryo (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Interestingly, when we performed label transfer for our dataset, the vast majority of cells were called as CS13–14 equivalent (day 28–35 of human development; Extended Data Fig. 5c–g), which is notably later than that predicted for human gastruloids (approximately CS8–9; day 17–21 of human development)12, indicating the substantial step forwards achieved by the hTLS protocol.

We also integrated the hTLS dataset with other in vitro protocols15,21,22 alongside the embryonic CS12–16 dataset38 for systematic comparison. We observed clear separation between in vitro and in vivo data in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) state space, particularly at early stages (Extended Data Fig. 5h), but overall unity of neural and somitic cell types across samples (Extended Data Fig. 5i), suggesting that, in general, these cell states approximated the embryonic identities of somitic and neural populations.

We next examined the spatial and temporal regulation of Hox gene expression, as these genes are known to be critical in the regulation of axial identity along the AP axis of vertebrate embryos39. We observed expression of HOXC6/8 along the full AP axis of the hTLS, while HOXC10 was only present in the posterior portion (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Temporally, there was progressive expression of HOX gene paralogues across the timepoints sampled (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Together with the lack of expression of HOX11–13, this suggests that the hTLS model approximates the thoracic and lumbar regions of the AP axis but not the sacral or caudal-most regions40. Given that termination of axial elongation is thought to be triggered by the expression of HOX13 in embryos41,42, we wondered what was mediating the extension and then termination of axial elongation in our hTLS model.

In the embryo, axis extension is supported by a population of NMPs: bipotential progenitors that give rise to both the neural and somitic cell fates43,44,45 (Fig. 2a). One basic characterization of NMPs is the co-expression of TBXT and SOX246 that is thought to underlie their bipotency, and we observed cells co-expressing these markers in the posterior of the hTLS (Fig. 2b,c). Using the RUES2-GLR cell line47, which contains TBXT-mCerulean and SOX2-mCitrine fluorescent reporters, we live-imaged the hTLS under conditions that promoted co-development of the neural tube and somites (hTLS) or conditions that biased towards somite-only (high pre-treatment Chi conditions; for example, 3 μM Chi before treatment and 1 μM Chi at aggregation) or neural tube-only fates (low pre-treatment Chi conditions; for example, 2 μM Chi before treatment and 3 μM Chi at aggregation; Fig. 2d). We observed an early bias (between 78 and 90 h) towards SOX2-only or TBXT-only expression in neural tube-only and somite-only structures, respectively, with co-developing structures maintaining a TBXT and SOX2 co-expressing domain for the longest duration, consistent with the role of NMPs in contributing to both fates.

However, the NMP domain showed a clear decrease in volume over the hTLS time course, as was confirmed by staining at the messenger RNA and protein level (Fig. 2e,f) and by our single-cell RNA sequencing data (Fig. 2g–i). Indeed, RNA velocity analysis showed evidence of bi-directional fates predicted from this population (Fig. 2j), and trajectory analysis rooted in the NMP cluster predicted endpoints in both somites and neural tube populations (Supplementary Fig. 1). Together, these data suggest that hTLSs contain an NMP population capable of bipotential cell fate differentiation, and its gradual depletion may be responsible for the resultant maximum axial length and number of somites observed in hTLSs.

In vertebrate embryos, the sequential addition of somites from the posterior unsegmented region is determined by a combination of local intrinsic oscillations of gene expression and a global signalling landscape48. Using a HES7::Achilles iPS cell line49, we observed oscillatory expression in the PSM of hTLSs, which moved posterior to anterior and stopped at the site of emergent somite formation (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Video 2), as has been described in embryos50,51. The time period of these oscillations comprised an average of 298 min (±17.2 s.d.; 4.96 h; Fig. 3c) which is consistent with in vitro measurements performed in alternative human systems (~5 h in somitoids16 and axioloids15 and 4.6 h in segmentoids17). However, an increased period of oscillations was observed for subsequent peaks, indicating that the clock is slowing down over time. This could be due to the exhaustion of the tailbud domain at these timepoints, similar to that seen in embryos at late somitogenesis52,53. Further research would be necessary to investigate the mechanism of this slowing.

We then turned our attention to the signalling landscape of the hTLS along the AP axis. In the embryo, the signalling gradients primarily responsible for the wavefront are thought to be fiboblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signalling in the posterior region and RA at the level of the somites (Fig. 3d). We observed FGF8 and FGF4 in the posterior region54,55; FGF18 expression in the first three to five newly formed somites, the determination front and the anterior PSM56; and FGFR1 in the neural tube and the determination front54,57 (Fig. 3e). We also saw posterior expression of WNT3A and AXIN2 in the tailbud (Fig. 3f), consistent with a posteriorly localized Wnt signalling gradient58,59,60,61.

Likewise, we observed strong expression of Notch signalling ligands DLL3 and DLL1 in the anterior PSM and determination front and in a salt-and-pepper organization in the neural tube (Fig. 3g–i), matching descriptions in the embryo, where a Notch-dependent mutual inhibition mechanism leads to neural differentiation62,63,64. In addition, expression of LFNG and NOTCH1 in the anterior PSM and newly formed somite is consistent with the role of Notch signalling in mediating the dynamic control of somitogenesis65 (Fig. 3g).

The crucial anterior signalling gradient that opposes the Wnt and FGF gradients is RA, which inhibits posterior FGF signalling and fine-tunes the progenitor-to-differentiated neuron gradient along the neural tube8,66. Typically, ALDH1A2 (an alcohol dehydrogenase involved in the synthesis of RA) and CYP26A1 (which degrades RA) have been used as a proxy for RA signalling status in chick67 and mouse embryos68. In the hTLS, CYP26A1 is strongly expressed in the most posterior tip of the tailbud, with ALDH1A2 expressed in the somites (Fig. 3i,j), which is indicative of a ‘source and sink' pattern creating an AP gradient of RA signalling. As such, it is likely that self-organized signalling along the AP axis provides endogenous signals that establish the clock-and-wavefront mechanism of somitogenesis in hTLSs.

In the embryo, signals from the surrounding tissues, including the notochord, lateral plate mesoderm and surface ectoderm, are all integrated to provide positional information to cells within the neural tube and somites69. In embryo models, the presence or absence of such tissues can allow us to investigate the extent of positional information in a simplified system. For instance, SHH signals from the notochord play a key role in setting up the dorsoventral (DV) axis in both the neural tube and somites (see ref. 70 for review). We therefore wondered what DV identity our hTLS structures assumed in the absence of these tissues.

On the basis of transcriptomic data analysis, we found that the hTLS neural tube has a dorsal identity (PAX6, OLIG3 and IRX3), with no detectable ventral (OLIG2 and NKX2-2/8), floor plate (FOXA2 and SHH) or roof plate markers (Fig. 4a,b). Indeed, comparison of the hTLS neural clusters with human embryonic spinal cord data71 showed that they aligned the most strongly to progenitor dorsal cell identities, excluding the roof plate (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

Source data

Likewise, the somitic identity (Extended Data Fig. 7b) of hTLS show expression of pan-somite markers (TCF15, MEOX1 and FOXC2), dorsal markers of dermomyotome (PAX3, PAX7, SIX1, SIX4 and EYA1) and syndetome (SCX; Extended Data Fig. 3c,h), with very few or no late dermatome or myotome markers (MYF5; Extended Data Fig. 7c; MYOD and MYOG not expressed). We observed few cells expressing markers of ventral somitic identity, the sclerotome, with only a handful expressing detectable PAX1 or PAX9 (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Together, this suggests that the lack of notochord leads to an overall dorsalization of both the somites and the neural tube in hTLSs.

To test whether hTLSs do still have the capacity to ventralize, we exposed the structures to varying concentrations of Smoothened agonist (SAG), which promotes SHH signalling, as well as to the small molecule cyclopamine that inhibits SHH signalling72 as a control (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Upon SAG addition, we observed increasing ventralization of hTLS structures in a dose-dependent manner, with increased expression of ventral neural tube (OLIG2 and FOXA2; Fig. 4c) and ventral somite (PAX1 and TWIST1) markers (Extended Data Fig. 7e). In addition, the morphology of hTLSs appeared to be altered under increasing SAG exposure with less compacted anterior somites (Extended Data Fig. 7f), suggesting that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition associated with ventral (sclerotome) fates could be occurring, while cyclopamine had no observable effect on hTLSs (Extended Data Fig. 7g). However, the dose-dependent ventralization of hTLSs exposed to SHH signalling was not simply all-or-nothing. Surprisingly, we observed that at high concentrations of SAG exposure, not only did proportions of OLIG2+ cells increase in the neural tube (Fig. 4d), but these were organized across an axis orthogonal to the AP axis (Fig. 4e). In the embryo, it is known that negative feedback between transcription factors acts to establish discrete domains of neural progenitor identity along the continuous SHH gradient73, and the same is probably happening in the hTLS model. However, because the hTLSs are exposed to a single, exogenous concentration of SAG throughout (rather than a localized source), the appearance of a consistent axis was surprising. In this case, we reasoned that the juxtaposition of the somites next to the neural tube may establish some aspects of an axis because the OLIG2+ domain was localized adjacent to the somites (Fig. 4c–e). We therefore set out to investigate the nature of this communication between the somites and the neural tube.

One of the primary benefits of a co-developing system such as the hTLS is the ability to use it to probe the interactions between tissues, which would otherwise present challenges in an embryonic context. Beyond the difficulties of accessing human embryonic material at these stages of development, the complexity of the signalling landscape—with signals emanating from diverse tissues and organs, across multiple spatial axes and dynamically changing over time—makes it complicated to unravel the contribution of a single tissue. In this case, we were interested in the signalling interactions between the neural tube and somites, in the absence of all other tissues (Fig. 5a).

We turned first to unbiased, computational approaches to interrogate the putative signalling ligand–receptor interactions predicted between the two tissues. Building on the expression profile of ligands and receptors of known pathways, we used CellChat74 to identify statistically significant, unidirectional interactions specifically from the somitic to the neural tissues (combining neural progenitor populations 1–3 and neuronal clusters) or the inverse interaction. This identified several putative signalling interactions, including RA, Notch, IGF, fibronectin and EphA signalling from somites to neural tissue and cholesterol, GDF, non-canonical Wnt, SEMA6 and SLITRK pathway signalling from neural to somitic tissues (Extended Data Fig. 8).

We validated the expression signatures of somite-derived RA and neural tube-derived non-canonical Wnt signalling by examining the localization of the gene corresponding to an RA-binding protein, CRABP2 (alongside ALDH1A2 and CYP26A1), which was expressed in the neural tube, as predicted, and by expression of ligands WNT5A and WNT5B in the neural tube and receptor FZD7 in the somites (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We therefore hypothesized that signalling between the two tissues in the hTLS is responsible for setting positional identity.

An additional surprise came on closer examination of the somites, where we noticed that ALDH1A2 was not uniformly localized across the somite but instead was most strongly expressed adjacent to the neural tube (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). This is in direct contrast with somite-only axioloid structures, where ALDH1A2 was shown to instead have an AP polarity15, consistent with our own experiments in axioloids (Extended Data Fig. 9). This hinted that the presence of the neural tube may bias the localization of ALDH1A2 expression to the neural tube-adjacent side, with important implications for the mechanism of mediolateral polarization in somites. Although this phenomenon does seem to be apparent from closer inspection of existing data75, we examined the same gene expression in E9.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 5c), where we likewise observed a clear medial bias of ALDH1A2 expression in the somites (Supplementary Video 3).

To verify that endogenous RA signalling was indeed occurring in hTLSs, we engineered a RARE/DR5–eGFP reporter line (where DR5 is direct-repeat-5) that contains five RARE/DR5 responsive element repeats that promote eGFP expression as a result of RA binding (FCI-GM25256-RARE), or control reporters without the RARE binding sequence (FCI-GM25256-Ctrl; Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9f). Although spontaneous reporter silencing led to a salt-and-pepper pattern of fluorescence, clear signal could be seen in both the neural tube and somites, indicating that active RA signalling is indeed occurring in the system (Fig. 5e). We also made use of an ALDH1A2 antibody to confirm protein-level expression of the enzyme in the somites of hTLS structures, although the medial bias was less clear at the protein level (Fig. 5e).

Together, these data suggest that the neural tube biases the localization of ALDH1A2 to the medial somite domain in both embryos and models, which leads to active RA signalling exposure within both the somites and the neural tube.

It remained unclear how the medially localized ALDH1A2 expression was established in somites. We reasoned that it was probably due to signalling from the neural tube, given the localization adjacent to the tube, and so turned to the other significantly enriched pathway proposed via CellChat analysis (Extended Data Fig. 8), the non-canonical Wnt (ncWnt) signalling pathway through WNT5A and WNT5B. To investigate whether ncWnt might act upstream of ALDH1A2 localization, we inhibited signalling using either IWP2 (a porcupine inhibitor targeting both canonical and ncWnt) or XAV939 (a tankyrase inhibitor targeting only canonical Wnt signalling) or activated it with recombinant WNT5A or WNT5B. While XAV393 had a mild effect on hTLS structure at 120 h (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c), this had fully resolved by 144 h, which was equivalent to the control structures (Fig. 5f,g). However, IWP2 had a sustained impact on both ALDH1A2 expression and hTLS morphology, with a lack of somitic epithelialization that mirrored the effect of the lack of retinal (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1i). WNT5A and WNT5B had little discernible effect on either the morphology or patterning of hTLS structures (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). While we cannot rule out that the lack of epithelialization could be a cause rather than a consequence of the lack of ALDH1A2 expression, it is possible that ncWnt is the signal originating in the neural tube that leads to localized ALDH1A2, which in turn drives endogenous RA signalling and subsequent epithelialization.

We next turned our attention to the downstream role of localized ALDH1A2. In the embryo, RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube is thought to have three main functions: (1) AP axis organization and morphogenesis of the neural tube, (2) promoting cellular neurogenesis and (3) mediating the DV patterning of neural tube populations (see ref. 76 for review). In addition, in the absence of RA signalling, there is an expanded domain of ventral gene expression in the neural tube77, suggesting that it has a dorsalizing influence on the neural tube.

To test whether similar effects were also occurring in hTLS structures, we prevented RA signalling either by removal of the exogenous retinal or by exposure to the pan-RA receptor (RAR) inhibitor, BMS49378. Following early (72–120 h) exposure to BMS493, hTLS structures were morphologically impaired, with a smaller overall area, and were composed of fewer organized somites, a smaller neural tube and an increased tailbud size (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). This is consistent with the role of RA signalling in axial organization and morphology, as Raldh2−/− mouse embryos die mid-gestation with aberrant morphology that includes a truncated posterior axis, small somites and an irregularly folded neural tube79. However, when hTLSs were exposed to BMS493 at later timepoints (96–120 h), there was a significant reduction in area but overall morphology was comparable to controls (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). This suggests that at this point, morphology had already been established and blocking the RA signalling might specifically affect the ongoing interactions between somites and the neural tube. Indeed, hTLS structures exposed to BMS493 at either timepoint showed much lower or no CYP26A1 in the neural tube, in contrast to control structures (Extended Data Fig. 10c) consistent with published data from chick embryos77. We therefore further investigated the proposed role of somite-derived RA signalling on the neural tube by focussing on the latter timepoint.

To investigate the role of somite-derived RA on early neurogenesis, we examined marker expression in hTLS structures, including DLL1 and NGN1 (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 10d–f). Upon RA signalling inhibition, we observed significantly fewer DLL1+ cells in the neural tube (Fig. 5f). In vitamin A deficient (VAD) quails that lack the precursor to RA, retinal, Delta-1 expression is depleted from the caudal neural tube in 9–19 somite-stage embryos8, but in the Raldh2−/− mouse model, Delta-1 expression is comparable to wild type (WT) at the 14–15 somite stage80. As such, the observation that hTLSs show RA-dependent neurogenesis hints that there may be additional species-specific differences in how RA signalling affects the neurogenesis cascade.

We next examined the role of somite-derived RA signalling on patterning in the neural tube. It is known that Raldh2−/− mice and VAD quails have depleted expression of Pax6 in the neural tube compared with WT embryos75,77. We therefore examined the expression of PAX6 in the hTLS with late RA signalling inhibition and observed a substantial depletion of this neural marker from the neural tube (Fig. 6a). Conversely, the addition of all-trans RA (ATRA) onto hTLS structures increased the expression of CYP26A1 in the neural tube, with no obvious difference in DLL1 expression and with broad expression of PAX6 across the neural tube (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Taken together, this suggests that somite-derived RA signalling is required for PAX6 expression in hTLS and, given the spontaneous neural tube patterning observed (Fig. 4), makes it likely that RA signalling is responsible for establishing this patterning. Similar SHH-independent RA signalling effects on neural progenitor identity have been shown in chick embryos81 but not in a human system.

Non-canonical Wnt signalling from the neural tube probably biases ALDH1A2 expression in the somites towards the neural tube (far left), followed by subsequent RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube (middle left). This leads to PAX6 expression being biased towards the somitic side (middle), or in the context of SAG exposure, increased OLIG2 expression adjacent to the somites (middle right). This patterning is dependent on endogenous RA signalling because inhibition leads to FOXA2 expression in the absence of other mediolateral patterning (far right). Asterisks indicate somites; dashed lines outline the hTLS. Scale bars, 100 μm. RA, retinoic acid; IM, intermediate mesoderm; LPM, lateral plate mesoderm.

Source data

To test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment in which we varied the concentration of SAG exposure in the presence of BMS493 to inhibit RA signalling. The logic was that if endogenous RA signalling from somites was responsible for the localized induction of OLIG2 with dose-dependent exposure to SAG, these expression patterns should be abrogated when an RA signalling inhibitor was added. Indeed, we observed decreased PAX6 expression and a marked increase in FOXA2 expression under BMS493 treatment (compare Figs. 4d and 6b) across all SAG exposures, while OLIG2 was no longer dose-responsive to SAG (Fig. 6b–d). As transcription factor networks composed of negative feedback motifs have been well described in the patterning of the neural tube82,83, it is likely that the concomitant increase in FOXA2 and decrease in PAX6 is the direct result of feedback mechanisms due to the lack of RA-responsive gene expression. The lack of dose-responsiveness to SAG also indicates that RA is necessary for fine-tuning the neural identities, while the consistent presence of PAX6+ and OLIG2+ cells always at the anterior part of the neural tube (Fig. 6d) indicates that timing of exposure to, or inhibition of, RA/SHH signalling likewise plays a role in patterning. This result showcases the flexibility of using an in vitro model to explore the interplay between endogenous signalling, intrinsic regulatory networks and exposure to external signalling factors, to better understand patterning dynamics, especially in a human context.

Taken together, these data suggest that initial ncWnt signalling from the neural tube to the somites results in the medial somitic localization of ALDH1A2 adjacent to the neural tube, which, in turn, leads to RA signalling from somites to the neural tube that promotes PAX6/OLIG2 expression specifically at the side adjacent to the somites (Fig. 6e). Integration with the SHH pathway leads to progressive ventralization while maintaining the self-organized patterning in the neural tube established by localized signalling from the somites, due at least in part to endogenous RA signalling. This reciprocal signalling between the somites and the neural tube may therefore play an important role in ensuring that correct axial patterning is coordinated between tissues and suggests that elements of a mediolateral or DV axis can be established, even in the absence of signalling centres such as the notochord or lateral plate mesoderm.

Our system has revealed several features associated with the development of the paraxial mesoderm and neural tube. Interestingly, although hTLSs represent the thoracic and lumbar region, the neural tube structures develop through a process similar to secondary neurulation, which is characteristic of the tail region32. This suggests that, in the embryo, the mode of neurulation is dependent on the early morphology at gastrulation, and because the hTLS model bypasses these morphological stages, they utilize secondary neurulation mechanisms instead. This may also explain why different species evolutionarily rely on primary and secondary neurulation to different extents84, as a function of their early morphological constraints. It would be interesting to explore in subsequent research whether this substitution in the mode of neurulation plays a role on the cell biology or fate decisions in the neural tube.

The most noteworthy findings from this work concerns signalling interactions between the paraxial mesoderm and the neural tube. For instance, the hTLS model revealed medially localized ALDH1A2 in the early somites of both hTLS and E9.5 mouse embryos. It could be that this organized gene expression is necessary for subsequent differentiation into the epaxial and hypaxial muscles85 and may represent the earliest distinction of mediolateral identity in the somites. It also demonstrates that neural tube-derived signals are sufficient to initiate mediolateral patterning in the somites, even in the absence of the intermediate or lateral plate mesoderm that would normally be localized laterally.

We also identified spontaneous patterning of the neural tube orthogonal to the AP axis, on the basis of somite-adjacent localization and due to RA-induced signalling emanating from the somites. While this is likely to reflect RA dependency rather than DV axis patterning per se, somite-derived signals in the human embryo could certainly contribute to DV axis patterning alongside the influence of the notochord. Previous research in animal models has suggested that RA signalling indeed plays an important role in DV patterning, but its precise function is often difficult to isolate owing to the complex interactions with other signalling pathways, including the SHH, Wnt and FGF pathways. For instance, VAD quail embryos exhibit a ‘dorsal shift' in neural tube patterning, with expanded domains of genes associated with a ventral identity compared with WT77, suggesting a dorsalizing role for RA signalling. This is complementary to the results we describe following RA signalling inhibition under SAG exposure, where hTLS neural tubes are ventralized. Embryo models such as hTLSs may therefore allow us to isolate pathways, disentangling the roles of different signalling mechanisms in tissue patterning.

However, while the hTLS model offers many advantages, it is important to recognize its limitations. For example, our data suggest that the notochord is not strictly required for neural tube-derived signalling to the somites, but we cannot exclude the possibility that additional relay interactions, such as notochord-induced floor plate maturation, may additionally occur in the embryo. We also cannot rule out that some of the differences between somite-only (axioloids) and somite and neural tube-containing hTLS might be partially due to differences in Chi concentration exposure. Dissection experiments where tissues are removed after specification may resolve this by decoupling the signalling induction from tissue presence or absence but would be technically challenging. These considerations highlight the distinction between embryo models and embryos, emphasizing the complementary role of such models in developmental research.

Moreover, we anticipate that hTLS models could be of value in disease modelling in the future, given their origin from human iPS cells. One notable observation from our study is the formation of the hTLS neural tube via a secondary neurulation-like process, which could prove valuable for investigating rare NTDs.

Overall, we have shown that interactions between the somites and the neural tube leads to patterning events including mediolateral ALDH1A2 expression in somites and patterning in the neural tube, mediated through localized RA signalling. These events are spontaneous and self organized, and they can enable us to explore how feedback and relay mechanisms combine to enable co-development across tissues in a human developmental context.

The hTLS model as described in this manuscript represents a human stem cell-based embryo model of post-gastrulation stages. However, the model lacks extraembryonic tissues (and is therefore ‘non-integrated' by 2021 International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) terminology on embryo models86) and additionally lacks tissues including the anterior neural, intermediate and lateral mesoderm; notochord; endoderm and non-neural ectoderm, among others. No human embryos were used in this research. All research with human ES cells was performed at the Francis Crick Institute under approval from the UK Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee (approval no. SCSC21-06). This work has been conducted in accordance with the 2021 ISSCR Guidelines.

All experiments carried out on mice (Mus musculus) were conducted according to the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act under licence no. PP6551133. The CD-1 animals were held within a Techniplast individually ventilated cage Green Line system, and the air movement in the cages was regulated by a Techniplast air management unit on negative pressure, 75 ACH/−20%, with all cages placed on automatic watering. The humidity and temperature were regulated at room level, set at code-of-practice standard levels of 20–24 °C and 55% (±10%) humidity. The light cycle was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., including dawn and dusk settings. The animals were kept on Datesand Eco Pure Chips sawdust, Bed-r'Nest nesting and smart homes enrichment, with sterilized Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet (2018S).

Embryos were obtained from five pregnant adult female mice at E9.5 and were dissected from maternal and extraembryonic tissues. Before fixation, embryos were washed in PBS for a few minutes. Mouse embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; v/v; Alfa Aesar, 43368.9 M) in RNase-free PBS (Invitrogen, AM9625) at 4 °C, then dehydrated gradually into methanol by incubating them for 5 min in a series of increasing concentrations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume, respectively) in RNase-free PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379) (PBST) on ice.

The cell lines used in this study include the human iPS cell lines HES7::Achilles49, SOX2::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0074-026)87, ZO-1::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0023)87, β-catenin::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0058 cl.67)87, LaminB1::mTagRFP-T (FCI-AICS-0034 cl.62)87 and H2B::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0061 cl.36)87; and the human ES cell lines RUES2-GLR47 and H9 SOX2::H2B-tdTomato/T::H2B-GFP dual reporter88 (H9-SBR). Cell lines engineered to report RA activity and associated control cell lines were derived from the parental WTC-11 cell line (Coriell Institute, GM25256) expanded at the Francis Crick Institute (FCI-GM25256). This research used Crick Human Embryo and Stem Cell Unit (now Human Biology) core facility expanded cell lines made possible through the Allen Cell Collection (NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository), available from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (repository ID nos. AICS-0074-026, AICS-0023, AICS-0058, AICS-0034, AICS-0061 and GM25256). The HES7::Achilles iPS cell line was a gift from Olivier Pourquie. The H9-SBR ES cell line was a gift from Ting Zhou. The RUES2-GLR ES cell line was a gift from Ali Brivanlou. All cells were cultured in incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human PS cells were cultured routinely in either StemFit Basic 02 (Ajinomoto, discontinued in the European Union) supplemented with 80 ng ml−1 bFGF (PeproTech, 100-18B) or mTeSR 1 (STEMCELL Technologies, 85850) on 0.25 µg cm−2 recombinant Laminin iMatrix-511 silk E8-coated plates (AMSbio, AMS892 021). Cultures of 80–90% confluency were routinely passaged using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies, 07922), and single cells were seeded with medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris Biosciences, 1254). Fresh medium was exchanged daily. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.

Human cell lines genetically engineered to contain the RARE were established from FCI-GM25256 cells by transfection with the RARE/DR5 Lentiviral Dual-Reporter System (Fluorescence) (TRS-0043-2, LipExoGen Biotech). Two sets of cell lines were generated via lentiviral transfection, one reporting RA activity and the other as a negative control. In both systems, the lentiviral vector contains a dual fluorescent reporter system, containing (1) mCherry, constitutively expressed, and (2) eGFP, of which the expression is controlled by RA signalling. Specifically, eGFP expression is activated when RAR–RXR heterodimers bind to tandem direct-repeat-5 (DR5) response elements in the presence of the ligand ATRA. The control cell lines contain the eGFP sequence but lack the DR5 elements and therefore do not respond to ATRA.

FCI-GM25256 cells were transduced via lentiviral particles with the addition of polybrene 9 μg ml−1 (Sigma; TR-1003-G). Infection efficiency, as assessed by the proportion of mCherry+ cells, was evaluated 48–72 h later. A few days after infection, monoclonal and polyclonal cell lines for each construct were generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer) sorting 1 or 100 mCherry+ cells, respectively, per well. Newly generated cell lines were expanded and cultured in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 µg ml−1 blasticidin (Gibco, R21001) for selection. Functional validation of the reporter cell lines to 100 nM ATRA (Sigma-Aldrich, R2625) was evaluated after exposing the cells to ATRA for 24 h. Requests for use of this reporter line should be directed to the corresponding author.

RUES2-GLR human ES cells grown routinely in NutriStem hPSC XF were first plated as single cells at a density of 5.2–6.7 × 103 cells cm−2 on a layer of vitronectin (ThermoFisher, A14700; 5 μg ml−1, 0.5 μg cm−2) with 5 µM Y-27632 (Tocris Biosciences, 1254) for the first 24 h after plating. After further culture, they were pre-treated on the fourth day (96 h) with 4 µM CHIR99021 (Chiron; Tocris Biosciences, 4423) and 10 µM SB431542 (Stratech (Selleck Chemicals), S1067; TGFβ inhibitor) in NutriStem hPSC XF for 24 h. After this, they were dissociated in StemPro Accutase (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1110501), and 700 cells were seeded into each well of an ultralow-adherence 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 650970) in 50 μl Essential 6 medium (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1516401) supplemented with 5 µM Y-27632 and 3 µM Chiron. The medium was replaced daily with fresh Essential 6. At 76 h, the structures were embedded in 20% (v/v) Corning Matrigel growth factor-reduced basement membrane matrix, phenol red free, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus free (Corning, 356231) or Corning Matrigel human ES cell-qualified matrix, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus free (Corning, 354277) in Essential 6 medium to a final protein concentration of 1.96 mg ml−1. The 20% (v/v) Matrigel solutions were prepared on ice with ice-cold Essential 6, before plating as 5-μl droplets onto tissue-culture treated plastic on ice. Human gastruloids were collected and transferred individually into separate 5-μl droplets with a micropipette. After transfer, droplets were left to gelate for 1 h in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, before covering gently with excess Essential 6 medium pre-warmed to 37 °C.

The full protocol is available on https://www.protocols.io (ref. 29). In brief, once human PS cells were around 70–80% confluent, cells were dissociated in Accutase and seeded at a density dependent on the cell line (2–3.5 × 104 cells per well; see protocol) per well of a laminin-coated six-well plate with 2 ml StemFit 02 with 80 ng ml−1 bFGF supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632. After 5 or 6 days, cultures were pre-treated in StemFit 02 with 20 ng ml−1 bFGF supplemented with CHIR99021 (Chiron; Tocris Biosciences, 4423). Alternatively, cultures maintained in mTeSR1 were pre-treated with N2B27 supplemented with CHIR99021. N2B27 medium was prepared from a 1:1 mix of Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 12634028) and Neurobasal medium (Gibco, 21103049) supplemented with N-2 Supplement (100×; Gibco, 17502048), B27 supplement (50×) without vitamin A (Gibco, 12587010) and 1% GlutaMAX supplement (v/v; Gibco, 35050061). The optimal concentration of Chiron for pre-treatment needed to be adjusted depending on the cell line and medium used but ranged between 2 and 5 µM. The concentrations for the lines used in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

After 24 h of pre-treatment, cells were dissociated with Accutase. Cell numbers were determined using an automated cell counter (NuceloCounter NC-202, ChemoMetec), and 500 cells were seeded into one well of an ultralow-adherence 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 650970) with 50 μl of either StemFit medium with 20 ng ml−1 bFGF or N2B27 (depending on the medium used for pre-treatment) and supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632, 10 µM SB431542 (TGFβ inhibitor) and a cell line-dependent concentration of Chiron (Supplementary Table 1). The plate was centrifuged at 160g at room temperature (RT) for 2 min to form a cell pellet at the bottom of the well. The following day, 150 μl fresh StemFit 02 or N2B27 was added to each well and exchanged again after 24 h with 150 μl medium. At 72 h after aggregation, 150 μl medium was removed from aggregates and they were embedded into medium containing 10% (v/v) growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 356231; protein concentration 7.3–8.8 mg ml−1) and 1 µM all-trans Retinal (Merck Sigma-Aldrich, R2500-100MG), unless stated otherwise. No further medium changes were required from this point.

hTLSs, made from the LaminB1::mTagRFP-T line at 120 h after aggregation, were recovered from Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, 354253) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS without Mg2+ or Ca2+ (Gibco, 14190144) and fixed overnight in 4% PFA (v/v) in PBS at 4 °C.

They were then additionally fixed in 4% PFA/2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 1 h at RT, washed three times for 5 min in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, v/v) in 0.1 M PB, post-fixed in 1% reduced osmium (1% OsO4/1.5% K3Fe(CN)6; v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times for 5 min in PB and then dehydrated with a graded ethanol series (70%, 90% and 2 × 100% by volume) for 20 min each at RT. The samples were then critical point dried (Leica EM CPD300 Critical Point Dryer), mounted on stubs, sputter coated with 5 nm of platinum (Quorum 150RS) and then imaged on the Quanta 250 FEG SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The SEM was operated between a chamber pressure of 4.0 and 4.38 Pa, with 30 μm aperture inserted using an accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV (Fig. 1e, top right), 3 kV (Fig. 1e, left) and 5 kV (Fig. 1e, middle and bottom right); a dwell time of 20 μs; and a working distance of 7.4 mm (Fig. 1e, bottom right), 7.6 mm (Fig. 1e, middle right), 9.2 mm (Fig. 1e, left) and 11.6 mm (Fig. 1e, top right). A 90° tilt sample holder was used for Fig. 1e (top right).

Pre-embedded structures were transferred into 1.5-ml tubes for fixation. Some structures were first recovered from Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution for 30 min at 4 °C (Figs. 4c,e and 6a and Extended Data Figs. 7g (top), 8c and 10c,e,g), although we noticed some lack of morphological integrity upon exposure, so this was not used routinely. They were then washed with PBS twice, fixed overnight in 4% PFA (v/v) at 4 °C and then washed again three times for 10 min in PBS. Then, samples were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) and 3% BSA (w/v) (PBS-BT) at RT and blocked for 2 h in PBS-BT at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C, with gentle rocking. Following several washes in PBS-BT (2 × 5 min at RT, 3 × 10 min at 4 °C and 4 × 30 min at 4 °C), samples were incubated with Alex-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies with 1:500 Phalloidin CruzFluor 647 (Santa Cruz, sc-363797) or 1:800 Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, H3570) in PBS-BT with 10% normal donkey serum (v/v) overnight at 4 °C, with gentle rocking away from light. After additional washes (3 × 10 min in PBS-BT at RT, 2 × 5 min in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Merck, T8787) and 0.2% BSA (PBT) and 3 × 15 min in PBT at RT), samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1900-10) or RapiClear 1.52 (SunJin Lab, #RC152001:10 ml) onto either a Superfrost microscopy slide (Epredia, AA00008032E01MNZ10) or coverslip (VWR, 631-0138).

The antibodies used in this study were 1:200 rabbit anti-Brachyury (Abcam, ab209665); 1:500 mouse anti-MEOX1 (ThermoFisher, TA-804716); 1:200 goat anti-SOX2 (R&D Systems, AF2018-SP), 1:200 rat anti-SOX2 (Invitrogen, 14-9811-82), 1:400 rabbit anti-PAX6 (ThermoFisher, 42-6600) and 1:500 rabbit anti-ALDH1A2 (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA010022). The mouse anti-PAX7 monoclonal antibody (1:10) developed by A. Kawakami, Tokyo Institute of Technology, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health and maintained at the Department of Biology of the University of Iowa. All secondary antibodies were raised in donkey and diluted 1:500, and included Alexa Fluor 488-, 594- and 647-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All primary antibodies were validated for sensitivity and specificity by the manufacturers, are reactive to human proteins and have been previously published.

Custom probe sets (all probe set sizes, 20 pairs), hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplifiers and buffers (hybridization, wash and amplification buffers) were purchased from Molecular Instruments. Pre-embedded structures were fixed in 4% PFA (v/v) in RNase-free PBS overnight, as described above. Samples were dehydrated gradually into methanol by incubating them for 5 min in a series of increasing concentrations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume, respectively) in PBST and stored at −20 °C. For the HCR, samples were rehydrated gradually by incubating them for 5 min in a series of decreasing concentrations of methanol (75%, 50%, 25% and 0% by volume, respectively) in PBST. Samples were washed once more in PBST, incubated for 5 min with hybridization buffer at RT and then for a further 30 min at 37 °C, alongside a combination of probes (8 nM final), in hybridization buffer. Samples were then incubated with the probe solution overnight at 37 °C. To remove excess probes, samples were washed with probe wash buffer four times for 15 min each at 37 °C, followed by a further three washes in 5× SSCT three times for 5 min at RT. Samples were pre-amplified in amplification buffer for 30 min at RT, gently rocking. Amplifier hairpins h1 and h2 were snap-cooled separately by first heating at 95 °C for 90 s and then cooling down at RT for 30 min in the dark. Hairpin amplifiers were diluted to 6 nM in amplification buffer, added to samples and then incubated overnight in the dark at RT. Next, samples were washed in 5 × SSCT four times for 5 min, then two times for 30 min, with a final wash in PBST for 2 min. Samples were counterstained 1:1000 with Hoechst 33342 overnight at 4 °C. The next day, samples were washed three times with PBST for 5 min and post-fixed with 4% PFA (v/v) in RNase-free PBS for 20 min. Thereafter, they were washed a further three times with PBST for 5 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Samples were mounted in Vectashield or Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, P36980) onto either a Superfrost microscopy slide or coverslip, then coverslipped. The HCR probe targets and the associated amplifiers used are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

For HCR of mouse embryos, samples were rehydrated gradually by incubating them for 5 min in a series of decreasing concentrations of methanol (75%, 50%, 25% and 0% by volume, respectively) in PBST. Embryos were bleached in 6% H2O2 (v/v) in PBS for 15 min and were washed three times for 5 min each in PBST at RT. Samples were treated with 10 μg ml−1 Proteinase K (Roche, 3115879001) for 10 min (no rocking) and then washed twice for 5 min in PBST (no rocking). Afterwards, embryos were post-fixed for 20 min with 4% PFA (v/v) in RNase-free PBS at RT, gently rocking, and then washed three times for 5 min with PBST. To equilibrate embryos, samples were washed in 1:1 pre-warmed hybridization buffer and PBST for 5 min. Embryos were washed with pre-warmed hybridization buffer for 5 min before following the HCR protocol as described above.

Full details of imaging hardware and settings are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss Invert880 with Airyscan 2014 or Zeiss Invert880 NLO OPO, using a Zeiss Pan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 objective. Z-stacks were obtained with 5-µm steps, averaging each slice four times, unless stated otherwise. Any tiled images were acquired with a 10% overlap. Spectral unmixing was used for imaging HCR samples, unless stated otherwise (track method used for Figs. 1d, 2f, 3i,j and 5b,c and Extended Data Figs. 1h and 9a). In brief, spectra were set up for all HCR amplifiers by imaging droplets of snap-cooled mixed-hairpin pairs using lambda mode, and then areas were selected to save each spectrum to a spectral database. HCR images were recorded using lambda mode and linear unmixing was run with saved spectra of amplifiers, nuclear signal and autofluorescence spectra of the hTLS. Imaging data were acquired with Zeiss ZEN Black 2.3 SP1 software. Confocal images are presented either as optical slices or maximum intensity projections, generated using FIJI (2.14.0/1.54f) or Imaris (10.1.1, Oxford Instruments), unless stated otherwise. For Fig. 5g, XY images and YX optical slices were taken of hTLSs imaged in Fig. 5e using average mode in Imaris.

Brightfield, widefield or confocal spinning disk images on live samples were obtained on an ImageXpress Confocal HT.ai system with Nikon 10× S Plan Apo Lambda objective. Time-lapse imaging was acquired with intervals between 20 and 30 min under environmental control at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Data were acquired using MetaXpress (6.7.1.157) software.

After post-fixation following the HCR protocol, mouse embryos for lightsheet imaging were embedded in a cryomold in warm 1% ultralow melting agarose (Sigma, A5030) and placed on ice to polymerize. Samples were then prepared for clearing with a 1:2 solution of benzyl alcohol (Sigma, 24122) and benzyl benzoate (ThermoFisher, 105860010) (BABB). All steps were carried out in a glass vial, which was covered with foil. Mouse embryos were dehydrated gradually into methanol by incubating them for 1 h at RT with gentle rocking in a series of increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and twice in 100% by volume, respectively) in deionized water. Embryos were then incubated in a solution of 1:1 100% methanol and BABB for 1 h at RT with gentle rocking. Samples were then transferred into a 100% solution of BABB and left overnight. The next day, BABB was removed and the samples were washed in ethyl cinnamate (ECi; Sigma, 112372) for 5 min before transferring samples into fresh ECi for storage. Mouse embryos were imaged using Miltenyi-Lavision UM II with ECi as the imaging solution. Z-stacks were obtained with 1.88–4 µm steps with dynamic focus. Imaging data were collected with Imspector (7.5.4) software. Lightsheet images and videos were generated with Imaris.

Confocal images of hTLS stained with Hoechst, TBXT and SOX2 were processed through Imaris. Surfaces of whole hTLSs were generated from the Hoechst, TBXT and SOX2 channels. A new channel of the colocalized region was generated using the colocalization package in Imaris, and then a new surface was generated from this channel.

Confocal images of hTLSs stained with Hoechst, TBXT and SOX2 were processed through Imaris. Spots of nuclei were generated from the Hoechst channel and then subset to those that co-expressed TBXT and SOX2 above set thresholds that were the same across all conditions (TBXT >7,927; SOX2 >7,625). The numbers of NMP spots were then normalized to the total number of spots (nuclei).

Confocal images were imported into Imaris, and the Hoechst channel was used to create a manual surface rendering of the whole hTLS, the individual somites and the neural tube. New channels were created for fluorescent HCR signal within each structure, and this was then used to generate surfaces corresponding to positive signals within each somite.

Confocal images were imported into Imaris before using either the SOX2 channel automatically or the Hoechst channel manually to create a surface rendering of the neural tube. DLL1 expression was masked within this surface, and spots were created corresponding to the DLL1 signal within the neural tube.

The pixel classification tool Ilastik (1.4.1rc2)89 was used to label hTLS (24–144 h) in transmitted light images to generate probability maps, distinguishing the hTLS from background. CellProfiler (4.2.8)90 was used to obtain basic morphometry through the generation and measurement of objects using these probability maps. Objects touching the edge of the image and those below a pixel threshold were automatically discarded. Images were then manually checked, and sample images containing fibres and debris were discarded. The medial length was obtained through CellProfiler via ImageJ91: objects were skeletonized, and the largest, shortest branch length was selected. Quantification of somite number was measured through manual counting of segmented structures on 96–144 h hTLSs.

HES7-Achilles samples were imaged on the ImageXpress Confocal HT.ai system from 100 to 115.75 h in the hTLS protocol. Initial image analysis was performed in FIJI92, where regions of interest for HES7 oscillations and background were selected. Integrated density, mean pixel intensity and area were measured and inputted into the following formula: corrected total fluorescence = integrated density – (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background readings). De-trending was then performed in terminal on MacOS, and peaks and valleys were calculated in Microsoft Excel (16.101.2) and plotted in RStudio (2023.06.0+421).

For RA signalling manipulation of hTLSs, retinal was replaced with either dimethylsulfoxide or ATRA (100 nM) or treated with BMS493 (2.5 µM; Tocris 3509) at 72 h during embedding. In addition, for 96-h RA inhibition of hTLS, BMS493 was added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal and gently added to each well for a final concentration of 2.5 µM.

For SHH signalling activation of hTLS models, SAG (Tocris, 4366) was added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal and gently added to each well for the following final concentrations: 100 nM, 200 nM, 300 nM, 400 nM and 500 nM at 96 h. For RA inhibition of Shh signalling-activated hTLS, BMS493 was added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal for a final concentration of 2.5 µM BMS493 with final SAG concentrations of 100 nM, 200 nM, 300 nM, 400 nM and 500 nM at 96 h.

For Wnt signalling manipulation of 96 h hTLS, Wnt inhibitors, IWP 2 (PORCN inhibitor; Tocris, 3533) and XAV-939 (Selleck Chemicals, S1180) and Wnt activators, WNT5A (Bio-techne, 645-WN) and WNT5B (Bio-techne, 7347-WN), were added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal for final concentrations of 5 µM, 5 µM, 100 ng ml−1 and 100 ng ml−1, respectively.

Samples from each timepoint were collected from 96-well plates and pooled together. TrypLE Select was added to the samples and they were incubated at 37 °C for 15–20 min. Samples were gently pipetted up and down until the hTLSs were dissociated into single cells. The cells were then spun in the centrifuge at 170g for 4 min and resuspended in PBS−/− + 0.04% BSA (v/v) and kept on ice until further processing. The concentration and viability of the single-cell suspension was measured using acridine orange and propidium iodide with a Luna-FX7 Automatic Cell Counter. A total of 13,200 cells were loaded onto a chromium chip and partitioned in nanolitre scale droplets using the Chromium Controller and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Reagents (where GEM is Gel Bead-in Emulsion; CG000315 Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1, Dual Index)). Within each droplet, the cells were lysed and the RNA was reverse transcribed. All of the resulting complementary DNA within a droplet shared the same cell barcode. Illumina-compatible libraries were generated from the cDNA using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell library reagents in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics, CG000315 Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1, Dual Index)). Final libraries were quality controlled using the Agilent TapeStation and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The sequencing read configuration was 28–10–10–90.

FASTQ files were aligned to the hg38 transcriptome, and count matrices were generated, filtering for GEM cell barcodes (excluding GEMs with free-floating mRNA from lysed or dead cells) using CellRanger (version 6.0.1). Count matrices were imported into R (version 4.1.0) and processed using the Seurat library (version 4.4.0) following the standard pipeline93. Low-quality cells were removed, with cells kept for further analysis if they met the following criteria: the mitochondrial content was within three standard deviations from the median, more than 500 genes were detected and more than 1,000 RNA molecules were detected. DoubletFinder was used to identify doublets, assuming a theoretical doublet rate of 7.5%, which were removed from subsequent analysis94. In total, 18,405 cells were sequenced, of which 17,661 cells passed the quality control and 15,808 passed subsequent doublet filtration for downstream analysis (5,979 cells from the 72 h sample, 3,669 cells from the 96 h sample and 6,160 cells from the 120 h sample).

All samples were integrated using the reciprocal principal component analysis (RPCA) method, implemented by Seurat's functions FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData(), using the top 3,000 variable features and the first 25 principal components as determined using the ‘maxLikGlobalDimEst' function from the intrinsicDimension package (version 1.2.0). Effects of cell cycle heterogeneity was calculated using cell cycle phase scores on the basis of canonical markers and regressed out of the data using ScaleData. Eight clusters were identified at a resolution of 0.5.

For RNA velocity analysis, loom files containing spliced and unspliced matrices were calculated, from BAM files generated by CellRanger, using the package velocyto (version 0.17.8) and Python 3.6.4. The matrices were used as input to scVelo (version 0.2.4) to calculate the RNA velocity values for each gene of each cell using the package loompy (version 3.0.6) and scanpy (version 1.8.2). scVelo was used in the dynamical mode with default settings. The resulting RNA velocity vector was overlaid onto the UMAP space by translating the RNA velocities into likely cell transitions using cosine correlation to compute the probabilities of one cell transitioning into another cell.

Lineages for trajectory analyses were identified separately for the somite and neural fates with the NMP cluster as the starting population using Monocle3 (version 1.3.0)95. Differentially expressed genes along each of the lineages were identified with the ‘graph_test' function using the Morans I test. The top 100 genes were used to draw smoothed heat maps using Tradeseq (version 1.7.07)96 and ComplexHeatmap (version 2.2.0)97.

Cell-to-cell crosstalk was inferred using the R library CellChat (version 2.1.2)74 and the CellChat human database. Clusters designated NP1, NP2, NP3 and neuronal were merged to create one cluster. Only the somites and the merged neuronal clusters were considered for Cellchat analysis. The CellChat analysis was performed as outlined in the CellChat vignette, with the ‘population.size' parameter set to 'true' when computing the communication probability between clusters. Significant interactions were filtered on inter-cluster and intra-cluster interactions were removed.

Published datasets were reprocessed using Seurat93 (version 4.4.0) from either the counts matrix of a Seurat object or downloaded outputs of CellRanger from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Four samples (comprising hAxioloid_48h, hAxioloid_72h, 96h_MG_RAL and 120h_MG_RAL from the axioloid dataset (GSE199576)15) were downloaded as count matrices and processed using Seurat version 4.4.0. Samples were integrated using methods highlighted in the authors' publication and cells assigned clusters according to published cell metadata. Cells from this dataset were projected onto our integrated dataset using the functions ‘FindTransferAnchors' (using the first 30 dimensions of the principle component analysis space) and ‘MapQuery'. To determine the similarity between axioloid clusters and hTLS-integrated clusters, a two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation was calculated on the aggregated cell expression using the mean gene expression per cluster and per sample, after filtering on the basis of common genes between datasets.

The full human embryo dataset (GSE157329)38 was downloaded and processed using scripts provided by the authors (https://github.com/zhirongbaolab/heoa) with Seurat 4.4.0. Cells were annotated using published annotation. Predicted cell type cluster and stage annotation scores were filtered using a threshold of >0.5.

The human neural tube dataset71 was used to look for similarity of clusters within our integrated neuronal clusters (labelled NP1, NP2, NP3 and neuronal). A two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation test was used on aggregated cell expression per cluster using common genes between both datasets.

Single-cell datasets from refs. 15,21,22,38 and our hTLS data were integrated using harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony) to account for experimental batch effects with the following parameters (group.by.vars = experiment; reduction.used = pca, nclust = 100). The normalized expression for the integrated multi-experiment dataset was aggregated per cluster. To look for similarities between clusters, a Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated using the normalized aggregated expression for genes, which was identified as the union of the top 50 markers per cluster per dataset. The Spearman's correlations are shown as a tile plot, where the rows and columns are hierarchically clustered, using the ‘ward.d2' method.

No statistical method was used to pre-determine the sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications15. Statistical testing included tests of normality to guide the use of appropriate statistical methods. Data were excluded from morphometric analyses where images were of empty wells or debris, where structures were partially out of the field of view, where pixel values fell beneath a threshold for object detection or where manual validation identified poor segmentation. In bioinformatic analyses, low-quality cells or doublets (identified by DoubletFinder with a theoretical rate of 7.5%) were removed from downstream analysis. Cells were only retained if they met the following criteria: the mitochondrial content was within three standard deviations from the median, more than 500 genes were detected and more than 1,000 RNA molecules were detected. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during the experiments and outcome assessment. Data collection and analyses were not performed blinded to the conditions of the experiments.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures brain activity indirectly by monitoring changes in blood oxygenation levels, known as the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, rather than directly measuring neuronal activity. This approach crucially relies on neurovascular coupling, the mechanism that links neuronal activity to changes in cerebral blood flow. However, it remains unclear whether this relationship is consistent for both positive and negative BOLD responses across the human cortex. Here we found that about 40% of voxels with significant BOLD signal changes during various tasks showed reversed oxygen metabolism, particularly in the default mode network. These ‘discordant' voxels differed in baseline oxygen extraction fraction and regulated oxygen demand via oxygen extraction fraction changes, whereas ‘concordant' voxels depended mainly on cerebral blood flow changes. Our findings challenge the canonical interpretation of the BOLD signal, indicating that quantitative functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a more reliable assessment of both absolute and relative changes in neuronal activity.

Neuronal activity is the primary energy consumer in the brain, driven by oxygen metabolism and quantified as the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2)1. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) maps this activity indirectly by detecting regional changes in blood oxygenation2. The resulting blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal originates from fluctuations in deoxygenated hemoglobin, rather than from neuronal activity itself.

Interpreting BOLD signal changes (∆BOLD) as changes in neuronal activity depends on neurovascular coupling, the process that links neuronal activity to local changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF)3,4,5,6,7. Classical work in human sensory cortices using positron emission tomography (PET) showed that sensory stimulation evokes modest increases in CMRO2 but a disproportionately larger increase in CBF, resulting in a positive coupling ratio of ∆CBF/∆CMRO2 (n-ratio ~2–4)8. This surplus in CBF forms the basis of the canonical hemodynamic response (n-ratio > 1), which generally allows the interpretation of a positive BOLD response as increased neuronal activity and vice versa9,10. Mesoscopic studies have supported this principle by linking heightened neural or synaptic activity to increased CBF and positive BOLD responses11,12,13. Likewise, others have shown that inhibitory processes and decreased activity are linked to negative BOLD changes14,15,16,17,18. However, it remains unclear whether the canonical hemodynamic response applies uniformly beyond sensory cortices, particularly throughout the entire human cortex.

Several studies have shown that ∆BOLD does not always accurately reflect neuronal activity. Animal studies identified task-induced changes in CBF and metabolic activity, accompanied by minimal or opposite BOLD signal responses19,20, indicating conditions where hemodynamics and neuronal activity are decoupled4,21. Reports of unchanged or even increased metabolism despite significant negative ∆BOLD or ∆CBF further challenge the assumption of uniform neurovascular coupling22,23,24,25. The BOLD signal itself reflects a complex interplay among changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV) and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) during capillary passage, making its interpretation region-dependent10,26. Consequently, various studies have reported inconsistencies between BOLD signal responses and cognitive or neuronal activity in humans25,27,28,29,30. Moreover, variations in vasculature31 and hemodynamic responsiveness9,31,32,33,34 can produce similar macroscopic BOLD patterns through distinct underlying mechanisms. These differences particularly affect the interpretation of BOLD signal patterns in patients with altered hemodynamics10,30. Together, these studies challenge the reliability of the BOLD signal response as an indicator of neuronal activity across the cortex, motivating a more quantitative examination of neurovascular coupling.

We addressed this question by measuring absolute oxygen metabolism and individual vascular components underlying positive and negative ∆BOLD. The gold standard for CBF and CMRO2 measurements is 15O PET; but this technique requires an on-site cyclotron, a sophisticated imaging setup and substantial experience in handling three different radiotracers (CBF, 15O-water; CBV, 15O-CO; OEF, 15O-gas) of short half-lives8,35. Furthermore, this invasive method poses certain risks to participants owing to the exposure to radioactivity and arterial sampling. As an alternative, various MRI approaches have been developed over the past three decades to quantify voxel-wise oxygen extraction and metabolism in the human cortex36,37,38. The quantitative BOLD (qBOLD) approach is based on an analytical model39 that relates R2′ to OEF40,41,42. A multiparametric variant of the qBOLD technique (mqBOLD) combines separate measurements of the intrinsic and effective relaxation times, T2 and T2* for reversible transverse relaxation rate (R2′), with an independent quantification of CBV for OEF measurement. mqBOLD imaging has been widely applied to study patient groups with vascular pathologies and brain tumors42,43,44,45,46,47, summarized recently by ref. 36.

In this study, we used both quantitative and conventional BOLD imaging to test the hypothesis that ∆BOLD would not reliably reflect changes in oxygen metabolism throughout the entire cortex. We found that in a substantial fraction of voxels with significant BOLD responses, oxygen metabolism changes in the opposite direction to both positive and negative BOLD signals. Notably, these discordant voxels regulated oxygen demand primarily via changes in OEF, rather than CBF. These findings challenge the canonical hemodynamic response model, demonstrating that ∆BOLD alone can lead to misleading interpretations of underlying neuronal activity.

Brain imaging data were collected using BOLD and quantitative fMRI while participants completed four experimental conditions within a single session (Fig. 1a,b). These conditions allowed identification of (1) ‘task-positive' regions with increased BOLD signal and (2) ‘task-negative' regions with negative BOLD response during calculation (CALC). We also examined (3) positive BOLD responses in the ‘task-negative' regions during an autobiographical memory task (MEM). BOLD-contrast images for CALC and MEM were calculated relative to a controlled baseline task (CTRL) or an uncontrolled resting state (REST).

a, We performed BOLD and quantitative fMRI on healthy subjects performing four different conditions within the same imaging session: CALC, MEM, CTRL and REST. b, During each imaging session, we acquired BOLD fMRI data with a 30-s block design, together with multiparametric, quantitative fMRI data. Conditions were presented in pseudorandomized order: T2* mapping to measure both reversible and irreversible dephasing; pCASL to measure CBF during each condition; T2 mapping to measure irreversible dephasing due to tissue properties; and DSC MRI using a contrast agent to measure CBV during CTRL, at the end of the session. c, Quantitative fMRI delivers voxelwise CMRO2 by integrating T2, T2*, CBV and CBF parameters via Fick's principle (see Methods section for detailed equations). Brain slices of subject-average parameter maps and boxplots illustrating average GM values across all 40 subjects and all conditions of the main study (line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR); individual dots, subject average per condition). R2′ reflects a voxel's overall dHb content. The OEF is proportional to R2′/CBV. Voxel-wise CMRO2 is then calculated as the product of OEF, CBF and the arterial oxygen content of the blood (CaO2) as derived from individual measures of oxygen saturation and hematocrit. d, The canonical hemodynamic response model of the BOLD signal: increased neuronal activity leads to higher CMRO2, which results in decreased oxygenation levels and an increased concentration of dHb in venous blood. Neurovascular coupling mechanisms initiate an increase in CBV and CBF. This hemodynamic response counteracts the effects of oxygen metabolism, ultimately leading to a decrease in dHb content. In BOLD fMRI, the net fluctuation of dHb levels is dynamically measured with T2*-weighted (T2*w) EPI. ΔBOLD during any task condition is calculated by subtracting task (T) from baseline (B) T2*w data. Based on the canonical hemodynamic response function, positive ∆BOLD are commonly interpreted as increased neuronal activity.

Quantitative fMRI, combining mqBOLD and pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI, estimates CMRO2 as a metabolic marker of neuronal activity. CMRO2 was calculated using Fick's principle, integrating parameter maps of several aspects of the hemodynamic response into a measure of oxygen metabolism (Fig. 1c and Methods). Table 1 lists parameter and CMRO2 values averaged across all subjects and conditions.

The canonical hemodynamic response model (Fig. 1d) assumes an identical hemodynamic response across voxels, with ∆CBF exceeding ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio > 1). In this study, we used quantitative fMRI to measure hemodynamic parameters per condition and compared them to task-induced BOLD changes relative to an experimental baseline (∆BOLD (%)).

We performed separate partial least squares (PLS) analyses on BOLD and mqBOLD parameter maps to compare BOLD and quantitative fMRI results. Bootstrap ratios were used for statistical mapping (Fig. 2a shows CALC versus CTRL; additional contrasts in Supplementary Fig. 2). We found widespread significant positive and negative ∆BOLD for CALC versus CTRL. Group histograms (Fig. 2b) show task-related changes for each parameter within significant ∆BOLD regions (CALC-positive, CALC-negative). In CALC-positive masks, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 showed canonical amplitudes: ∆BOLD = 0.37%, ∆CBF = 6.5%, ∆CMRO2 = 3.1%, n-ratio (∆CBF(%)/∆CMRO2(%)) = 2.1 (Fig. 2b). CALC-negative masks showed near-zero ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2, despite negative ∆BOLD reaching 70% of the positive amplitude (−0.26%). To address potential normalization distortions, we also analyzed native-space data using individual BOLD masks, confirming robust positive ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 in CALC-positive masks, with no significant response in CALC-negative masks across subjects (Fig. 2c). A second-level GLM model (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), instead of the PLS approach, confirmed near-zero changes of median ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 in CALC-negative masks. Overall, positive ∆BOLD values matched the canonical hemodynamic response, with ∆CBF (in %) being at least ten times higher than ∆BOLD and twice the amplitude of ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio > 2). However, no significant negative ∆CBF, ∆CBV, ∆T2* or ∆CMRO2 were found in negative ∆BOLD masks across subjects.

All analyses across N = 40 subjects of the main study, CBV results across N = 10. a, Statistical results of the PLS group analysis in standard MNI space, comparing CALC and CTRL, for both BOLD and quantitative fMRI parameter maps. Maps projected on the brain surface show non-thresholded bootstrap ratios (BSRs) (akin to z values) of the first latent variable, which was significant in each analysis: that is, for BOLD, CBF, CBV (N = 10), T2* and CMRO2, respectively (permutation tests, P < 0.001). Red voxels indicate higher values during CALC compared to CTRL, and blue voxels represent the opposite contrast. Axial slices display significant brain clusters, thresholded at BSR ± 2 (akin to P < 0.05, cluster size > 30 voxels) for each parameter. b, Histograms depict group-average median voxel distributions of all parameters (CALC minus CTRL) within the binarized CALC-positive and CALC-negative group masks (shown as surface plot). c, Subject distribution of all parameters in native space.

Any signal increase or decrease for which error bars cross the zero line is considered nonsignificant; an asterisk denotes P < 0.05, not corrected for multiple comparisons. (iii), Clusters are located in different functional networks, as depicted on the brain surface and in axial slices79. Yeo networks: DAN, dorsal attention; FPN, frontoparietal; L, left; R, right; SMN, somatomotor; VAN, ventral attention; VIS, visual; LIM, limbic network.

We then analyzed metabolic parameters regionally, avoiding brain-wide averaging effects. Eight clusters showed positive ∆BOLD, and nine clusters showed negative ∆BOLD (Fig. 2d(i)). Median ∆CMRO2 was significantly positive in half of the positive ∆BOLD clusters but negative in none of the negative clusters (Fig. 2d(ii)). Notably, two auditory network clusters (SMN 1, SMN 2) with negative ∆BOLD had significant positive ∆CMRO2.

We also examined ∆BOLD and ∆CMRO2 for the other contrasts, CALC versus REST (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c) and MEM versus CTRL (Supplementary Fig. 2d–g). CALC-positive and CALC-negative masks showed higher overall ∆BOLD, ∆T2*, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 compared to CTRL, but changes within CALC-negative masks remained nonsignificant (Supplementary Fig. 2c). For the MEM task, results mirrored the CALC patterns, with similar BOLD signal amplitudes and stronger positive than negative ∆BOLD. However, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 were significant only in the MEM-positive mask. Thus, positive ∆BOLD reliably indicated significant positive ∆CMRO2 across conditions, but the metabolic interpretation of negative ∆BOLD remained unclear. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes average parameter changes for all conditions.

Several factors could explain the absence of hemodynamic and metabolic changes, especially related to negative ∆BOLD: (1) voxel-specific signal confounds, (2) limited sensitivity for detecting negative ∆CBF or ∆CMRO2 or (3) distinct hemodynamic mechanisms in certain regions. We address each explanation below.

Most MEM-positive voxels overlapped with the default mode network (DMN), which showed negative ∆BOLD during CALC (Supplementary Fig. 2f). To test for voxel-specific confounds, we analyzed CBF and CMRO2 in voxels occurring in both MEM-positive and CALC-negative masks. Supplementary Fig. 2h shows the histograms of ∆BOLD, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 for all voxels of a conjunction mask (MEM-positive ∧ CALC-negative). For positive ∆BOLD (0.32%), we observed a canonical increase in ∆CBF (5.94%) and ∆CMRO2 (3.54%). However, in the same voxels, a negative ∆BOLD (−0.29%) was associated with a much weaker ∆CBF (−0.47%), resulting in a positive ∆CMRO2 (1.68%). Thus, a lower ∆CBF than expected from the canonical framework results in negative ∆BOLD for elevated ∆CMRO2. Crucially, the absence of canonical negative BOLD responses in ‘conjunction voxels' cannot be explained by voxel-specific confounds, as those same voxels do display a canonical response for positive ∆BOLD.

According to the hemodynamic response model (Fig. 1d), neurovascular coupling is primarily driven by changes in CBF. To validate the sensitivity of pCASL imaging for detecting ∆CBF, we performed several control analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found ∆CBF magnitudes ranging from −9% to +27%, with regions of positive ∆CBF showing higher n-ratios than those with negative ∆CBF (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Moreover, the spatial pattern of negative ∆CBF during CALC matched that observed with PET from a different study (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Notably, CBF decreases identified by PET and MRI were more localized than BOLD decreases and centered on peak regions. Additionally, we also validated the homogeneity of our MRI-derived OEF with independent PET data (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

We also assessed signal stability of BOLD and CBF measurements during continuous task performance. In the main study (Fig. 1), block durations vary for BOLD (30 s) and quantitative (~6 min) fMRI to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each modality. In a control study (N = 18), participants performed 3-min CALC and MEM blocks while BOLD data were collected. BOLD signals remained stable without habituation or drift (Supplementary Fig. 3d), with amplitude changes comparable to the main study (CALC-positive/negative/MEM-positive: 0.6%/−0.46%/0.34% versus 0.70%/−0.34%/0.51%). Time-resolved pCASL analysis from the main study also showed constant CBF data throughout measurement blocks (Supplementary Fig. 3e).

We next assessed the ∆BOLD–∆CMRO2 relationships on the voxel level and compared our data to an established model of hemodynamic responses. The Davis model predicts ∆BOLD responses based on realistic cortical ranges for ∆CMRO2(%) and ∆CBF(%)48. Figure 3a displays the model's prediction of ∆BOLD (contours, −3% to +3%) for a set of typical hemodynamic response parameters. A canonical BOLD response occurs when ∆CBF exceeds ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio > 1). However, the model also predicts discordant responses—where ∆BOLD disagrees with metabolic change—when ∆CBF is lower than ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio < 1) or their signs differ (Fig. 3a, violet shading). For example, a negative ∆BOLD of −1.3% would arise if CBF increased by only about 5% during a ∆CMRO2 of +23%. In other words, the same metabolic change can result in opposite signs of the BOLD signal, depending on the magnitude of related ∆CBF. Because we measured all relevant parameters and calculated ∆CMRO2 using Fick's principle, we next compared our empirical data to the model predictions.

a, Visualization of the Davis model. Predicted BOLD responses (ΔBOLD (%)) are depicted as colored contour lines across ΔCBF (%) and ΔCMRO2 (%). The model illustrates that for a given ΔCMRO2(%), the direction and magnitude of the BOLD response depend on the amplitudes of ΔCBF(%). The canonical hemodynamic response assumes that an increase in ΔCBF will exceed the increase in ΔCMRO2, resulting in a positive ΔBOLD and vice versa for negative ∆BOLD. However, the Davis model also predicts a range of BOLD responses with discordant signs compared to the changes in underlying metabolic activity (violet shading). b, Empirical data from BOLD and quantitative fMRI for all cortical voxels, median across N = 40 subjects of the main study. ΔCMRO2 was calculated from BOLD-derived ΔR2′ (Methods), median across all subjects per voxel, with colors indicating ΔBOLD (%). Our experimental data replicate the slope and range of values predicted by the Davis model, particularly demonstrating a substantial number of voxels with ΔBOLD opposing ΔCMRO2. c, Voxels representing the median across N = 40 subjects from the main study display significantly positive (top) and negative (bottom) BOLD responses from b. Voxels with ΔBOLD concordant to ΔCMRO2 are highlighted on a light yellow/turquoise background, and voxels with discordant ΔBOLD values are shown on a violet background. The pie charts illustrate the ratio of discordant to concordant voxels. Bottom, the pie chart with black contours specifically summarizes the ratio of discordant voxels within the DMN. Axial slices illustrate the spatial distribution of significantly concordant and discordant BOLD voxels, with black contours indicating the DMN. Right, center, stacked bars illustrate the amplitude distribution of discordant and concordant voxels across BOLD amplitude quartiles. It is noteworthy that discordant voxels show neither spatial nor amplitude preference. d, The boxplots summarize ΔCMRO2 (%) and ΔCBF (%) across all voxels, median across N = 40 subjects of the main study, with either concordant or discordant ΔBOLD (%); (line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; based on median voxel values across subjects). Please note that discordant and concordant voxels exhibit similar ΔBOLD amplitude distributions, even though they signal opposite metabolic responses.

Figure 3b presents subject-averaged voxel data for CALC versus CTRL, colored by positive/negative ∆BOLD (Supplementary Fig. 4a for CALC versus REST and Supplementary Fig. 4b for MEM versus CTRL). To mitigate low SNR at the voxel level, ∆CMRO2 was calculated using more stable ∆R2′ data from BOLD fMRI (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5 for sensitivity analysis). Our empirical data support several predictions of the Davis model: positive ∆BOLD voxels cluster above the line with a slope of 1, indicating an n-ratio > 1. We also identify a substantial number of discordant voxels: those with opposite ∆BOLD and ∆CMRO2. Those can be summarized as red voxels on the left and blue voxels on the right side of zero ∆CMRO2 (Fig. 3b, red dashed line). Interpreting the activity in discordant voxels using only BOLD data and assuming a uniform canonical response would lead to substantial misinterpretation.

To highlight the number of discordant responses, we plotted CALC-positive (Fig. 3c, top) and CALC-negative (Fig. 3c, bottom) voxels separately, highlighting discordant voxels (violet shading). Discordant voxels account for 31% and 66% of positive and negative ∆BOLD, respectively (Fig. 3c, pie charts); with a similar ratio of discordant negative ∆BOLD within the DMN (pie chart ‘DMN only‘), the network with the most consistently reported negative BOLD signal responses. Moreover, discordant voxels are spatially distributed across the cortex (Fig. 3c, brain slices) and occur equally among voxels from the lowest to highest quartile of BOLD signal amplitudes (Fig. 3c, bar plots). We repeated these analyses for CALC versus REST (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and MEM versus CTRL (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Again, discordant voxels appeared with a uniform cortical distribution and across the full range of ∆BOLD, amounting to 36%/52% of significant positive/negative ∆BOLD voxels in CALC versus REST and 12%/54% in MEM versus CTRL.

Figure 3d summarizes voxel median parameter values separately for concordant and discordant voxels. Concordant voxels with either positive or negative ∆BOLD demonstrate a canonical hemodynamic response (n-ratio 2.0 for positive, 1.6 for negative ∆BOLD; Fig. 3d, yellow and turquoise bars). Discordant voxels, however, show ∆BOLD opposite to their metabolic response and lower than expected ∆CBF (Fig. 3d, violet bars). Notably, discordant ∆BOLD occurred in about one-third of positive and two-thirds of negative ∆BOLD voxels across different tasks and all magnitude ranges, distributed evenly throughout the cortex.

Potentially, discordance between ∆BOLD and ∆CMRO2 could result from partial volume effects when integrating voxel data from imaging sequences with heterogeneous voxel sizes, as occurred in our main study. To address this, we conducted a replication study (N = 10) using harmonized acquisition matrices for BOLD and mqBOLD data. Results mirrored the main study (Supplementary Fig. 6): 40% of all voxels with either significant positive or negative ∆BOLD were classified as discordant, and discordant voxels again showed smaller CBF responses than expected from canonical neurovascular coupling.

Finally, we directly estimated the parameters of the Davis model using our own data. With measurements of ∆BOLD, CBV, OEF and CBF, we calculated α and each subject's calibration factor M empirically. The average values were α = 0.38 and M = 11.2 ± 1% (N = 40). Supplementary Fig. 7 replicates Fig. 3 using the Davis model parameters instead of Fick's formula to quantify CMRO2.

Next, we examined whether voxels with both positive and negative BOLD responses during CALC or MEM (using the conjunction mask of the control analysis in Supplementary Fig. 2h) exhibit consistent hemodynamic response patterns for both signs of ∆BOLD. Voxels were classified as ‘concordant only‘, ‘discordant only' or ‘mixed' based on whether BOLD and metabolic responses matched in both tasks, differed in both tasks or showed a mixed pattern (Fig. 4a). The pie chart illustrates that most voxels (48%) were ‘mixed‘, and 35% and 18% were consistently concordant or discordant, respectively. Figure 4b displays the spatial and amplitude distributions for ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 across the three categories. ‘Concordant only' voxels showed canonical hemodynamic responses (n-ratio ~2) regardless of BOLD sign or task (yellow/turquoise bars), and ‘discordant only' voxels lacked canonical responses for either direction (violet/lilac bars). ‘Mixed' voxels exhibited canonical coupling for positive BOLD, but not for negative BOLD (red/orange bars). Because changes in CMRO2, which are not modulated by CBF, must be matched by OEF changes, we tested whether baseline OEF varies by voxel type. We hypothesized that ‘discordant only' voxels, with the lowest ∆CBF during a task, would have the lowest baseline OEF (indicating the highest oxygen buffer). In line with this hypothesis, baseline OEF was lowest in ‘discordant only' voxels, intermediate in ‘mixed' and highest in ‘concordant only' voxels (Fig. 4c), suggesting that discordant voxels compensate for higher oxygen demand mainly via OEF changes. Importantly, OEF data were independently acquired from CBF data.

Median voxel values across N = 30 subjects of the main study. a, Conjunction voxels (i; green outlines) display both positive and negative changes in BOLD signal during the CALC and MEM conditions. (ii), these voxels were categorized based on their response types. (iii), the pie chart summarizes the consistency of these response types across voxels: 35% of all conjunction voxels showed concordant responses, meaning they had the same sign of ΔBOLD and ΔCMRO2 during both MEM and CALC conditions (‘concordant only'); 18% of all conjunction voxels showed discordant responses in both conditions (‘discordant only'); 48% of the conjunction voxels (‘mixed' voxels) showed concordant responses in one condition and discordant responses in the other. b, The spatial distribution (i) of voxel categories is illustrated on brain slices with consistent color overlays: ‘concordant only' and ‘mixed' voxels primarily cluster in regions of the DMN, and ‘discordant only' voxels occur in the medial part of the VAN. The boxplots display subject-median parameter values separately for 1,410 ‘concordant only' (ii), 1,943 ‘mixed' (iii) and 723 ‘discordant only' voxels (iv) (line, median; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; based on median voxel values across subjects). Although the range of ΔBOLD is similar across the three categories, ΔCBF and ΔCMRO2 vary strongly as expressed by their n-ratios. Asterisks indicate significant differences from zero, tested via independent t-tests, two-sided, corrected for multiple comparisons. c, The three voxel categories exhibit significantly different OEF during CTRL baseline, with ‘concordant only' voxels having significantly higher OEF and ‘discordant only' voxels having significantly lower OEF than ‘mixed' voxels. **P < 0.001, independent-sample permutation test on the median values, two-sided, conducted for ‘mixed' versus the two other voxel types, 2,000 permutations. rOEF, relative OEF.

We next examined baseline hemodynamics across the cortex by pooling all voxels with significant ∆BOLD during either task (CALC, MEM)—comprising 53% of all gray matter (GM) voxels—and categorizing them as concordant, discordant or not task-involved (Fig. 5a(i)). Regression plots show that baseline CMRO2 correlates linearly with CBF, OEF and CBV across all voxel groups, consistent with Fick's principle. Multiple linear regression analyses using all three parameters showed that baseline OEF accounted for >68% of CMRO2 variance, followed by CBF (>28%) and CBV (>1%), with similar model parameters for concordant and discordant voxels (concordant model: F(3,21,809) = 72,070, P < 0.001, CMRO2 = 139.9 + 321.1 × OEF + 3.3 × CBF + 0.4 × CBV + e, R2 = 0.91; discordant model: F(3,14,544) = 48,390, P < 0.001, CMRO2 = 128.1 + 309.2 × OEF + 3.2 × CBF + 1.3 × CBV + e; R2 = 0.91; all predictors mean-centered, P < 0.001 for all beta values). According to the CMRO2 model parameter, discordant voxels have a lower baseline metabolism, whereas concordant voxels have significantly higher baseline CBF and OEF but lower CBV (Fig. 5b).

a, Across all task conditions, 22% of all GM voxels showed discordant and 32% showed concordant responses, and 46% were not significantly involved in any task (i). Regression plots (ii): during baseline, CMRO2 and CBF show a moderate correlation (Pearson's r > 0.32, P < 0.001), CMRO2 and OEF are highly correlated (r > 0.7, P < 0.001), and CMRO2 and CBV show a weak negative correlation (r < −0.1, P < 0.001) across all groups of voxels; voxel medians across 40 subjects. b, In CTRL baseline, across all 40 subjects, discordant voxels, on average, show significantly lower CBF (−3.4%), lower OEF (−5.7%) and higher CBV (2.1%) than concordant voxels (paired samples, two-sided t-test, P < 0.001). Boxplots: line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; individual dots, median subject values across voxels; gray line, median of remaining GM voxels. c, Marginally but significantly lower baseline susceptibility (QSM) and higher venous density in discordant versus concordant voxels, revealed by two external datasets68,69. Boxplots: line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; based on voxel values; gray line, median of remaining GM voxels. **P < 0.001, independent samples permutation test on the median values, two-sided, conducted for discordant versus concordant voxels, 2,000 permutations. d, Correlation of ΔCMRO2(%) with either ΔCBF(%), ΔOEF(%) or ΔCBV(%) across all task contrasts (CALC versus CTRL, voxel median across 40 subjects; MEM versus CTRL, voxel median across 30 subjects), separately for concordant (pale) and discordant (dark violet) voxels. ΔCMRO2 and ΔCBF showed a strong positive correlation across concordant voxels (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation across discordant voxels (r = 0.48, P < 0.001). In contrast, ΔCMRO2 and ΔOEF showed a moderate, positive correlation across discordant voxels (r = 0.60, P < 0.001) and a weak, negative correlation across concordant voxels (r = −0.41, P < 0.001). ΔCBV could only be evaluated for a subset of 10 subjects and only across the CALC versus CTRL contrast (Methods). ΔCMRO2 and ΔCBV showed a weak correlation around zero across concordant voxels (r = −0.07) and a moderate, negative correlation across discordant voxels (r = −0.46, P < 0.001). Conc., concordant; Disc., discordant.

To validate lower OEF and higher CBV in discordant voxels, we analyzed two external quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) datasets (Fig. 5c). Projecting our voxel masks onto these data, we observed that discordant voxels had slightly but significantly lower susceptibility (indicating lower deoxyhemoglobin (dHb)) and significantly higher venous density, supporting our findings.

Finally, we investigated whether ∆OEF might serve as an alternative mechanism to ∆CBF in accommodating oxygen demand during task processing. Regression plots show the linear correlation between ∆CMRO2 and ∆CBF, ∆OEF and ∆CBV, separately for concordant and discordant voxels, illustrating the significant contribution of each hemodynamic parameter to oxygen metabolism (Fig. 5d). However, we also identified two distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that in concordant voxels, ∆CMRO2 was mainly driven by ∆CBF (concordant model: F(2,21,971) = 67,980, P < 0.001, with ∆CBF explaining 87% and ∆OEF 16% of a total explained variance of R2 = 0.86 of the model: ∆CMRO2(%) = 2.6 + 0.83 × ∆OEF(%) + 0.86 × ∆CBF(%) + e; all predictors mean-centered, P < 0.001 for all beta values). In discordant voxels, ∆OEF was the primary regulator, with ∆CBF secondary (discordant model: F(2,14,694) = 39,320, P < 0.001, with ∆OEF explaining 58% and ∆CBF 42% of a total explained variance of R2 = 0.84 of the model: ∆CMRO2(%) = 1.2 + 1.1 × ∆OEF(%) + 0.88 × ∆CBF(%) + e; all predictors mean-centered, P < 0.001 for all beta values). The negative ∆CMRO2 − ∆OEF correlation for concordant voxels reflects compensatory oxygenation during ∆CBF surplus (Fig. 5d, center). CBV was not included in these regressions, as ∆CBV was only acquired for the CALC–CTRL contrast. In summary, concordant voxels regulate CMRO2 mostly via ∆CBF (87%), whereas discordant voxels rely more on ∆OEF (58%) compared to ∆CBF (42%).

In this study, we evaluated the consistency between changes in the BOLD signal and oxygen metabolism in GM voxels across the human cortex. This would support the common interpretation of positive and negative ∆BOLD as indicators of increased or decreased neuronal activity. Contrary to the canonical BOLD response model, we found that approximately 40% of brain voxels with significant ∆BOLD exhibited opposing changes in oxygen metabolism. Specifically, voxels with positive ∆BOLD showed decreased ∆CMRO2, whereas those with negative ∆BOLD exhibited increased ∆CMRO2. By measuring the BOLD signal, CBF, OEF and CMRO2 in the same session, we uncovered distinct neurovascular mechanisms in regions with concordant versus discordant responses. Discordant voxels primarily regulate oxygen demand via ∆OEF, whereas concordant voxels display a larger increase in ∆CBF, aligning with canonical predictions. Moreover, discordant voxels demonstrated lower baseline CMRO2 and OEF, indicating that their baseline oxygen supply is sufficient to meet higher metabolic demands. In conclusion, we identified two distinct hemodynamic responses to neuronal activity changes, influenced by baseline OEF and metabolism.

We combined BOLD with quantitative fMRI to investigate hemodynamic and metabolic changes in relation to ∆BOLD. Participants performed cognitive tasks eliciting both positive and negative BOLD signal responses across the cortex. Specifically, we aimed to elicit both response types in identical voxels, facilitating a direct comparison of their hemodynamic responses. We employed a cognitively demanding calculation task that induced positive ∆BOLD in various attention-related regions49,50 while concurrently inducing negative ∆BOLD in DMN regions50,51. Additionally, participants undertook an autobiographical memory task known to induce positive ∆BOLD in DMN regions, partially overlapping with those of negative ΔBOLD during CALC52,53. This allowed us to examine opposing ∆BOLD within the same voxels.

Our study also addressed the implications of differing baseline states. Although BOLD signal responses to cognitive tasks are usually compared against low-level control tasks53,54,55, negative ∆BOLD was often reported in comparison to an uncontrolled resting state51,56. Consequently, we included both baseline types into the study design, and all experimental conditions successfully elicited anticipated BOLD signal responses. On average, negative BOLD signal responses constituted approximately 50–70% of the amplitude of positive ΔBOLD (Fig. 2). Additionally, ΔBOLD was larger when compared to REST than to CTRL baseline (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c).

Compared to BOLD fMRI, which requires subtraction analyses between conditions, the mqBOLD approach provides quantitative measures for each condition. During CTRL baseline, we observed average GM values of CMRO2 and hemodynamic parameters (Table 1) consistent with existing literature on the healthy human brain35,38,42,51,57,58,59. Likewise, task-related changes (Supplementary Table 1) aligned with prior findings58,60,61, where ∆CMRO2 and ∆CBF exceeded positive ∆BOLD by factors of 10–20, yielding an n-ratio of approximately 2 (Fig. 2) and thereby conforming to the canonical hemodynamic response10,62.

Despite a canonical hemodynamic response for mean positive ΔBOLD, we did not find significant hemodynamic or metabolic changes for negative ΔBOLD (see CALC versus CTRL, Fig. 2c) for either task condition (see MEM versus CTRL, Supplementary Fig. 2g) or when comparing against REST baseline (Supplementary Fig. 2c). In a region-specific analysis, we also observed significant deviations from the canonical response in four out of eight clusters with positive ΔBOLD (Fig. 2d). One could argue that voxels with discordant ΔBOLD might suffer from voxel-specific artifacts such as partial volume effects or differences in vasculature, leading to insignificant ΔCBF. To address this issue, we designed our study to achieve significant ΔBOLD during both CALC and MEM tasks in identical voxels, facilitating within-voxel comparisons of ΔBOLD and quantitative measures. Among these voxels (Supplementary Fig. 2h, ‘conjunction voxels'), we observed only weak ΔCBF (−0.5%) for negative ΔBOLD but strong positive ΔCBF (5.9%) for positive ΔBOLD, despite similar ΔBOLD amplitudes (−0.29% and 0.32%). For this voxel subset, discordant negative ΔBOLD is unlikely due to artifacts, as a canonical hemodynamic response was confirmed for positive ∆BOLD.

In summary, we identified a canonical hemodynamic response for mean positive ΔBOLD, but inconsistencies in certain regions. For negative ΔBOLD, we did not find significant negative ΔCBF or ΔCMRO2 across subjects. Our findings align with previous animal studies indicating inconsistent hemodynamic responses in cortical and subcortical regions31,34,63.

On the voxel level, we evaluated our findings in comparison to a well-established model of cerebral hemodynamic responses (Fig. 3). The Davis model predicts BOLD signal amplitudes for realistic ranges of ∆CMRO2 and ∆CBF in the human brain48. Despite it being published more than 20 years ago, no study has examined the model's accuracy across the human cortex. Intriguingly, the Davis model predicts a range of discordant positive and negative ΔBOLD for biologically plausible ΔCBF in relation to ΔCMRO2 (Fig. 3, violet shading and voxels). Our empirical findings (Fig. 3b) align closely with these predictions using established model parameters from the literature. For all voxels with concordant positive and negative ∆BOLD, we observed a canonical hemodynamic response with average n-ratios of 2.0 and 1.6, respectively (Fig. 3d). Our data also confirm the presence of a substantial number of discordant voxels, comprising 31% of voxels with positive and 66% of voxels with negative ΔBOLD for CALC versus CTRL (Fig. 3c), and similarly for the REST (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and the MEM condition (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Additionally, we recalculated ΔCMRO2 via the Davis model using parameters (α, M) derived from our own data, yielding a similar percentage and regional distribution of discordant voxels, along with comparable CMRO2 responses (Supplementary Fig. 7). In conclusion, these results strengthen the reliability of the mqBOLD approach, successfully validating the decades-old model parameters of the Davis model.

One could argue that discordant ΔBOLD arises from misalignment and partial volume effects when integrating voxel data across modalities. Thus, we performed a replication study with matched voxel sizes and matrices in BOLD and mqBOLD sequences, albeit sacrificing whole-brain coverage for higher voxel resolution in pCASL imaging. Utilizing the same study design and analysis pipeline of the main study, we again found an n-ratio > 1 for concordant voxels (BOLD pos/neg: 1.7/1.2) and, critically, a considerable proportion of discordant voxels (BOLD pos/neg: 40%/40%) (Supplementary Fig. 6). One may also discuss sensitivity issues of mqBOLD across cortical voxels. For instance, low pCASL sensitivity or high vascular effects (high R2′ or CBV) might lead to low ΔCBF and thus artificially induce discordant ΔBOLD. Consequently, we validated our results using control masks focusing on voxels with significant ΔCBF or ΔCMRO2, while excluding those with high vascular contributions (Supplementary Fig. 8). All control analyses confirmed the presence of discordant voxels, with both positive (11–29%) and negative (68–78%) ΔBOLD values. As a final control against voxel-specific artifacts, we investigated hemodynamic and metabolic responses for both signs of ∆BOLD within identical voxels (Fig. 4, conjunction mask). We assessed response patterns in approximately 4,000 voxels and classified them by response type. The ‘concordant only' voxels displayed a canonical hemodynamic response for both positive and negative ∆BOLD (Fig. 4b(ii)), demonstrating that the mqBOLD method reliably detects canonical responses across the ΔBOLD spectrum. The largest group, labeled ‘mixed' voxels, showed a canonical hemodynamic response for positive ∆BOLD (Fig. 4b(iii), red) but lacked a significant CBF response for negative ∆BOLD (Fig. 4b(iii), orange). Paradoxically, interpretation based solely on BOLD fMRI data would suggest increased activity in one condition and decreased in another, despite both tasks indicating a significant increase in ∆CMRO2 of similar magnitude in those voxels (Fig. 4b)(iii).

Discordant voxels occurred for both positive and negative ∆BOLD, as well as for ∆CMRO2 derived from Fick's formula and the Davis model. The presence of both concordant and discordant responses within identical voxels implies different hemodynamic mechanisms serving varying oxygen demands. Reference 31 identified microvascular variations between cortical and subcortical regions, and simultaneous recordings of neuronal activity and CBF suggest that interneuron activity may influence blood flow more than other neuronal activity64,65,66. In humans, refs. 16,67 both found discrepancies in the coupling of CBF and ∆BOLD in sensory cortices, which they interpreted as distinct neurovascular coupling mechanisms, particularly for negative ∆BOLD. In conclusion, mqBOLD effectively identifies canonical hemodynamic responses but also a considerable number of voxels exhibiting discordant ∆BOLD across various tasks and in relation to varying baseline conditions.

According to Fick's principle, a change in CMRO2 without CBF alteration arises from ∆OEF. We hypothesized that baseline OEF varies across voxels with different hemodynamic response types, suggesting the presence of regionally varying oxygen buffers. Our findings confirmed significantly different baseline OEFs across three response types among ‘conjunction voxels' (Fig. 4c). Baseline OEF was lowest in ‘discordant only' voxels and highest in ‘concordant only' voxels, with ‘mixed' voxels in between. We also observed a significant positive linear relationship between baseline CMRO2, CBF and OEF across voxels of all tasks, covering more than 50% of all GM voxels (Fig. 5a(ii)). Multiple linear regression showed that OEF accounts for the majority of baseline CMRO2 variability (>68%), followed by CBF (>28%) and CBV (>1%), which also aligned with QSM data68,69 (Fig. 5c). Collectively, our results suggest that OEF is a key modulator of baseline metabolism across the human cortex, potentially predicting regional hemodynamic responses during tasks (Fig. 5d). In line with baseline results, multiple linear regression revealed that ∆OEF significantly contributes (58% of the total explained variance) to task-related oxygen demand in discordant voxels. Conversely, concordant voxels primarily accommodate ∆CMRO2 through ∆CBF (87%), supporting the canonical hemodynamic response. In summary, OEF is a strong predictor of baseline metabolism across the cortex, and ∆OEF regulates oxygen demand in spatially distributed voxels. Our findings align with rodent studies demonstrating varying neurovascular coupling based on variations in vascular composition14,28,31.

The mqBOLD method, although less invasive than PET, has notable limitations. Still, systematic biases in CBF, OEF and CMRO2 quantification affect only across-subject comparisons and do not account for task effects, which are derived from ΔOEF or ΔCMRO2 within identical voxels.

Absolute quantification of CBV through dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is challenging, reflecting total rather than venous CBV. Yet this limitation applies to nearly all available CBV measurements, including PET70. To enhance intersubject comparability of CBV values, we implemented a global normalization procedure44. Despite these limitations, our CBV data are valuable as they represent a rare attempt to quantify baseline CBV and ΔCBV during task processing in healthy individuals.

We further evaluated the sensitivity of our mqBOLD method to accurately detect both positive and negative ∆CBF. Our analysis replicated the amplitude and extent of reduced CBF observed in a prior PET study (Supplementary Fig. 3b) using a similar analysis approach71. Additionally, our findings reveal ∆CBF in regions exhibiting significant positive ∆BOLD, aligning with earlier MRI-based CBF measurements50,72.

Furthermore, CMRO2 values in white matter (WM) are not interpretable because T2 and T2* quantification is influenced by orientation effects of myelinated nerve fibers and differences in lipid concentration between GM and WM. In prior work, our group addressed these systematic errors of background magnetic fields44, T2-related bias45 and orientation-related effects in WM structures73. Additionally, we used masking to reduce partial volume effects of adjacent WM structures, confirmed our main result in a replication study and demonstrated that mqBOLD-based OEF agreed well with PET-based OEF46.

We also performed several control analyses to confirm the study design. A separate control study validated the stability of the BOLD (Supplementary Fig. 3d) and CBF (Supplementary Fig. 3e) signals during extended measurements. Crucially, neither signal exhibited habituation or drift effects during prolonged acquisition.

Our study reveals spatial variability in hemodynamic changes across the human cortex, suggesting diverse underlying mechanisms. First, voxels primarily governed by ∆OEF exhibit a greater oxygen buffer, maintaining adequate oxygen pressure during tasks7,19. Second, OEF regulation may indicate different signaling mechanisms6, including astrocytic activity74, shifts in excitatory/inhibitory signaling75,76 or neuromodulatory regulation77. Third, our findings underscore the importance of quantitative mqBOLD fMRI for future research, particularly when examining groups with altered hemodynamics, such as in aging30 or neurodegenerative conditions78.

Forty-seven healthy adults were enrolled; 7 were excluded due to task difficulties (n = 1), contrast-agent issues (n = 2) or poor data quality (n = 4; for example, motion or susceptibility artifacts, unilateral CBF), leaving 40 right-handed participants (22 women, 18 men; mean age 32.1 ± 9.2 years) for analysis. Of these, 30 completed all four conditions (CALC, MEM, CTRL, REST), and 10 performed only CALC and CTRL but underwent two DSC scans, enabling within-subject ∆CBV estimation; analyses of MEM or REST thus includes 30 participants.

To assess BOLD fMRI stability during prolonged tasks, a separate cohort of 18 right-handed healthy adults (11 women, 7 men; mean age 28.1 ± 4.8 years) underwent BOLD fMRI.

For a replication with harmonized voxel matrices and resolution across BOLD and mqBOLD sequences, ten healthy adults (five women, five men; mean age 31.8 ± 6.8 years) performed CALC and CTRL.

All participants gave written informed consent. Procedures were approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, and participants were compensated.

Participants were scanned supine, viewing instructions on a screen via a mirror mounted on the head coil. Right-hand responses were recorded with a button box (Cambridge Research Systems). Tasks were explained and briefly practiced before scanning, emphasizing accuracy over speed. All tasks were designed to maintain continuous engagement during BOLD and quantitative fMRI.

CALC (calculation task): This task aimed to elicit negative BOLD responses in the DMN and positive BOLD responses in task-positive networks. Participants solved arithmetic problems at their own pace, with a maximum response time of 10 s per task, following a design similar to that of ref. 50. Each trial presented a row of three numbers plus a question mark (n1, n2, n3,?) with instructions to solve the arithmetic and fill in the missing number. The solution followed this rule: n2 − n1 = DIFF, n2 = n1 + (1 × DIFF), n3 = n2 + (2 × DIFF) and ? = n3 + (3 × DIFF). For example, for the row 33 38 48?, DIFF = 5, making the correct answer 63. Participants selected from three response options, including the correct answer, each corresponding to a button on the response box.

MEM (autobiographical memory task): The MEM condition was based on the design of refs. 53,55, using cue words instead of pictures for consistency across tasks. Participants recalled a specific autobiographical event with as many details as possible, with the cue word displayed for up to 15 s. They pressed the first button twice upon recalling an event. If they couldn't recall any details, they pressed the second and third buttons in succession for a new cue word, ensuring uniformity in button presses across tasks.

CTRL (low-level baseline): The CTRL condition involved a simple task with minimal cognitive demands. A row of random letters was displayed for 5.9–8.9 s, and participants pressed a button to indicate whether the first letter was a vowel. This active baseline ensured visual input, and button presses were consistent with the CALC and MEM tasks.

REST (resting state baseline): Although studies on DMN activations typically use matched control tasks for contrasts53,54,55, such as our CTRL condition, DMN deactivation studies often compare to an uncontrolled resting state baseline50,51,56. To replicate these DMN contrasts, we also collected REST data, featuring a white fixation cross on a black screen.

MRI was conducted on a 3 T Philips Ingenia MRI scanner with an Elition upgrade and a 32-channel head coil. The quantitative fMRI protocol included multiparametric, quantitative BOLD (mqBOLD) and ASL imaging:

Multiecho spin-echo T2 mapping: Three-dimensional (3D) gradient spin echo readout as implemented by our group45 with 8 echoes of even-spaced echo times (TE): TE1 = ΔTE = 16 ms; TR = 251; readout duration = 128 ms; α = 90°; voxel size 2 × 2 × 3.3 mm3; 35 slices (30 slices in 4 subjects); total acquisition time = 2:28 min (for 35 slices).

Multiecho gradient-echo T2* mapping, as implemented by our group44,45: 12 echoes, TE1 = ΔTE = 5 ms; TR = 2,229 ms; readout duration = 60 ms; α = 30°; voxel size 2 × 2 × 3 mm3; gap 0.3 mm; 35 slices (30 slices in 4 subjects). Correction for magnetic background gradients with a standard sinc-Gauss excitation pulse80,81; acquisition of half- and quarter-resolution data in k-space center for motion correction82; total acquisition time = 6:08 min (for 35 slices).

DSC, as implemented by our group83: Single-shot GRE-EPI; echo planar imaging (EPI) factor 49; 80 dynamics; TR = 2.0 s; α = 60°; acquisition voxel size 2 × 2 × 3.5 mm3; 35 slices (30 slices in 4 subjects). Injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent as a bolus after five dynamics, 0.1 ml kg−1, minimum 6 ml, maximum 8 ml per injection, flow rate: 4 ml s−1, additionally flushing with 25 ml NaCl; total acquisition time = 2:49 min (for 35 slices).

Pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL): following ref. 84 and as implemented by our group45,85. Post-labeling delay 1,800 ms, label duration 1,800 ms; 4 background suppression pulses; two-dimensional EPI readout; TE = 11 ms; TR = 4,500 ms; α = 90°; 20 slices (16 slices in 1 subject); EPI factor 29; acquisition voxel size 3.28 × 3.5 × 6.0 mm3; gap 0.6 mm; 39 dynamics plus one proton-density-weighted M0 scan; total acquisition time = 6:00 min.

In addition to quantitative fMRI, we acquired

BOLD fMRI using single-shot EPI, EPI factor 43; voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm3; FOV 192 × 192 × 127.8 mm3; TE = 30 ms; TR = 1.2 s; α = 70°; 40 slices; SENSE-factor = 2; MB-SENSE-factor = 2; 400 dynamics (8:05 min) for 4 conditions, 200 dynamics (4:05 min) for 2 conditions, 1,650 dynamics (33:05 min) for the long-block control study acquisition. For susceptibility correction, a B0 field map was acquired with two echoes; TR/TE1/TE2 = 525 ms/6.0 ms/9.8 ms; 40 slices; parallel acquisition; α = 60°; voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm3; FOV 192 × 192 × 127.8 mm3; total acquisition time = 0:35 s.

T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE pre- and post-gadolinium (TI/TR/TE/α = 100 ms/9 ms/4 ms/8°; CS-SENSE-factor = 7.5; 170 slices; FOV = 240 × 253 × 170 mm3; voxel size 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3; acquisition time = 2:05 min) and T2-weighted 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (TR/TE/α = 4,800/293/40°; CS-SENSE-factor = 10; 140 slices; FOV = 240 × 248.9 × 168 mm3; acquisition voxel size 1.2 × 1.2 × 1.2 mm3; turbo spin-echo factor 170; inversion delay 1,650 ms; acquisition time = 2:09 min) images were acquired for anatomical reference and to exclude brain lesions.

MRI was performed on a 3 T Philips Ingenia scanner with a 32-channel head coil and included only T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE and BOLD fMRI, with all acquisition parameters being identical to those described above.

MRI was performed identical to the main study, but with matching voxel matrices: T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE, multiecho spin-echo T2 mapping and multiecho gradient-echo T2* mapping as described above, with T2/T2* voxel size = 2 × 2 × 3.0 mm3, gap 0.3 mm. BOLD fMRI as described above, but with a voxel acquisition size = 4 × 4 × 3 mm3, gap 0.3 mm, 40 slices. pCASL as described above, with BOLD fMRI voxel size (4 × 4 × 3 mm3, gap 0.3 mm; 26 slices). As a result, subject data were acquired with harmonized voxel dimensions: that is, matching BOLD and pCASL voxel sizes and four T2/T2* voxels per BOLD/pCASL voxels in the x–y plane. Whole-brain coverage was not possible with this higher-resolution pCASL sequence; thus, we positioned the volume at the same angle as before to cover all key regions of interest (ROIs) from our main study (‘brain coverage', Supplementary Fig. 6).

After obtaining informed written consent, a physician placed a venous catheter for blood sampling (hemoglobin, hematocrit (Hct), creatinine). DSC contrast was administered only if creatinine was normal, ensuring renal health. Arterial oxygen saturation was tracked via pulse oximetry (Nonin Medical B.V.).

Figure 1b illustrates the imaging session from the main study.

BOLD fMRI: The four task conditions were presented using a 30-second block design, each repeated four times in random order. BOLD alternated with mqBOLD fMRI runs to reduce habituation or fatigue effects. During mqBOLD imaging, conditions were presented pseudo-randomly for pCASL and T2* mapping. DSC (CTRL) were performed at the end of the session to avoid signal artifacts. The contrast agent was administered via a pump (Medtron AG) under a medical doctor's supervision.

After the imaging session, participants completed a memory questionnaire about the MEM condition, rating the ease of recalling specific events on a difficulty scale (1 = ‘very easy' to 4 = ‘very difficult‘) and the detail of their memories on a concreteness scale (1 = ‘very detailed' to 4 = ‘very vague‘). On average, participants scored 1.8 ± 0.7 on difficulty and 2.0 ± 0.6 on concreteness, indicating that recalling events was relatively easy and memories were reasonably detailed. Participants took an average of only 2.5 ± 1 s to recall an event.

A subsample of N = 10 subjects from the main study performed only the CALC and CTRL conditions but instead received two DSC scans (totaling a full clinical dose of 16 ml). This enabled calculation of within-subject ∆CBV for task effects.

fMRI BOLD data were obtained for CALC and MEM tasks with a 30-s block design (four repetitions each, interleaved with 30-s CTRL blocks), alongside extended 3-min blocks (four repetitions each, interleaved with 1-min CTRL blocks), totaling 41 min of scan time.

Study design and data acquisition were identical to the main study, utilizing the group median CBV data from the main study for analyses.

BOLD fMRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 20.2.4 (ref. 86) within a Docker container based on Nipype 1.6.1 (ref. 87). Preprocessing involved segmentation, estimation of motion parameters and other confounds, correction for susceptibility distortions, coregistration in native T1w space and normalization to MNI152-ICBM-2mm space with a nonlinear sixth-generation registration model developed by Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. fMRIPrep relies on FSL 5.0.9 for registering EPI time-series data to T1w data with boundary-based registration, FSL FAST for brain tissue segmentation and ANTs 2.3.3 (ref. 88) for spatial normalization to MNI space in a multiscale, mutual-information-based, nonlinear registration scheme, where all transforms are first concatenated and registration steps applied at once. As part of the fMRIPrep pipeline89,90, correction for head motion and susceptibility distortions was performed in the subject's native space, applying a single composite transform to the BOLD fMRI time series. The same data were also resampled into standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin6Asym space. Preprocessed BOLD fMRI data, without global signal regression, were then used as input to the PLS model. All datasets from the main, control and replication studies underwent identical processing.

We calculated quantitative parameter maps using in-house scripts (in Matlab) and SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL). Figure 1 illustrates the procedure and shows representative subject-averaged parameter maps.

T2/T2*-mapping: Quantitative T2 and T2* parameter maps were obtained by applying monoexponential fits to multiecho spin and gradient echo data, as described by our group44,45,91. Corrections for macroscopic magnetic background fields were implemented81, and motion artifacts were addressed through redundant acquisitions of k-space centers82.

R2′ maps were calculated via

yielding the transverse, reversible relaxation rate that depends on the vascular dHb content within a voxel92,93. Caution is required when interpreting these values at air–tissue boundaries (magnetic field inhomogeneities), in deep GM (iron deposition) or in WM structures (orientation effects in myelin), as previously discussed45,81.

CBV maps were derived from DSC MRI after contrast agent application via integration of leakage-corrected ΔR2* curves94 and subsequent normalization to a WM value of 2.5% (ref. 95). The DSC procedure has been described by our group83,96.

OEF maps were calculated from R2′ and CBV parameter maps via the mqBOLD approach39,43 and, as implemented by our group44, via

with c = γ × \(\frac{4}{3}\,\) × π × Δχ0 × Hct × B0 (gyromagnetic ratio γ = 2.675 × 108 s−1 T−1; susceptibility difference between fully deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin Δχ0 = 0.264 × 10−6; magnetic field strength B0 = 3 T; small-vessel hematocrit Hct, calculated as 85% of the (large-vessel) hematocrit values measured in each subject44,97). OEF (ratio) represents the amount of oxygen extracted from capillaries among passage.

CBF maps were calculated from pCASL data as described in ref. 84. Specifically, CBF was calculated as the pairwise difference of the averaged and motion-corrected label and control images and then scaled by a proton-density-weighted image.

CMRO2 maps: For each condition separately, we calculated the voxel-wise CMRO2 by combining all parameter maps via Fick's principle:

where CaO2 reflects the arterial oxygen content (in µmol) for each subject and was calculated as CaO2 = 0.334 × Hct × 55.6 × O2sat, with O2sat being the oxygen saturation measured by a pulse oximeter93.

All parameter maps were calculated in subject space and coregistered to the first echo of the T2 data. Any normalization into MNI space was performed afterward. Specifically, parameter maps were first coregistered to native T1w space before applying the normalization matrix to MNI space, as derived from fMRIPrep. CBF values were upscaled by 25% to account for the systematic underestimation of CBF due to the four background suppression pulses, as motivated here98,99. The data of the replication study were processed identically to those of the main study.

For our analyses in standard space, we excluded voxels that fell within the lowest 15th percentile of the temporal SNR for more than 66% of participants, based on the BOLD fMRI data from each subject and voxel. The excluded voxels were primarily found in regions with significant susceptibility artifacts, such as the fronto- and temporo-basal brain areas. Additionally, we masked out the cerebellum and any voxels with a GM probability of less than 0.5. The resulting group mask was then applied to both the output of the GLM group analysis and the input matrices for the PLS analyses. For the analyses in native space, we additionally masked CSF-prone areas (T2 > 90 ms), high-susceptibility areas (R2′ > 9 s−1), voxels with a high percentage of blood volume (CBV > 10%, probably driven by larger veins/arteries) and voxels with biologically implausible values, such as T2′ > 90 ms, OEF > 0.9 and CBF > 90 milliliters per 100 grams per minute.

After a sensitivity analysis at our institution, we found that half the clinical dosage of contrast agent was sufficient to reliably assess CBV in healthy subjects. Therefore, the final subset of ten participants received two half-dosages during the CALC and CTRL conditions, allowing us to quantify CBV in both conditions. We calculated the voxel ∆CBV for CALC compared to CTRL in subject space and averaged the results across Glasser's 360 functional ROIs100. This subject-averaged ∆CBV map was then used to estimate a CBV surrogate map for the remaining 30 subjects, who had only one baseline CBV measurement. These data are among the most empirically supported data for ∆CBV in quantitative fMRI studies, but this was possible only for the CALC condition. Hence, we continued using the CBV CTRL map to calculate CMRO2 during the MEM condition.

The estimation of quantitative CMRO2 maps relies on the combination of R2′, CBV and CBF values, according to equation (3). To control for potential error propagation during voxel-wise analyses, especially from R2′ measurements (see appendix in ref. 73), we calculated R2′ parameter maps during MEM and CALC from baseline R2′ and BOLD fMRI data as suggested by ref. 101. Instead of calculating ΔR2′ from quantitative R2′ (multiecho gradient-echo-based T2*) during task conditions, ΔR2′ is approximated as

with TE = 30 ms, R2′0 being the baseline R2′ and \(\frac{\Delta S}{{S}_{0}}\) the BOLD signal change, derived from task data. R2′ in CALC and MEM was calculated via R2′ = R2′0 + (ΔR2′ × R2′0) and fed into OEF and CMRO2 calculations according to equations (2) and (3). These semiquantitative CMRO2 parameter maps differ from the regional CMRO2 maps only in their underlying R2′ values. In Supplementary Fig. 5, we compared the PLS results of the BOLD-informed approach with those of the fully quantitative approach and found very similar signal ranges and voxel distributions.

The Davis model was originally designed for calibrated fMRI and allows to derive ∆CMRO2 by using carbon dioxide breathing as a physiological method to manipulate CBF independently of CMRO2. The model relies on the parameters M, α and β (ref. 48):

where α is a power-law exponent relating ∆CBV to ∆CBF, β reflects the microvascular anatomy93 and M is commonly referred to the maximum ∆BOLD that occurs when all hemoglobin is fully oxygenated and depends on baseline OEF92. Previously, α = 0.38 was used102, but more recent studies have identified lower values. In Fig. 3a, we plotted the range of predicted ∆BOLD using empirical values for all parameters, derived from recent calibration studies with α = 0.23, β = 1.3 (ref. 93) and M = 5.5 (ref. 78). Assuming α and β, the fractional change in CMRO2 can be calculated from combined BOLD signal and CBF measurements during tasks78,92,103.

PLS analyses were performed using the pyls library in the Python language (Python Software Foundation, version 3.8). Mean-centered PLS is a data-reduction method that computes latent variables (LVs) and corresponding brain patterns, optimizing the relationship between brain signals and experimental design104. In this study, we used PLS analyses to perform group-level statistics to identify brain regions that distinguish between task conditions (CALC or MEM) and a baseline condition (CTRL or REST). This analysis was applied to both BOLD fMRI and mqBOLD data, allowing for comparison of statistical maps. For mqBOLD data, we used quantitative OEF, CBF or CMRO2 values per voxel and subject. For BOLD fMRI data, we used median percent signal change (from either CTRL or REST) across 24 s (20 TRs) per task condition, excluding the first 6 s of each task block to account for the hemodynamic response lag.

The significance of the LVs (multivariate patterns) was tested using permutation tests (3,000 permutations), and the reliability of brain saliences (voxel contributions) was assessed through bootstrap resampling (3,000 samples). Significant brain regions were identified using the bootstrap ratio (BSR), where a BSR > ±2 suggests a 95% confidence interval (CI) if the bootstrap distribution is normal105,106. To interpret BSR maps, they must be compared to design scores of each condition within each LV for task differences. In this manuscript, orange-red indicates a positive task effect (higher values during the task versus baseline), and blue indicates the opposite. We visualized the whole-brain, non-thresholded PLS results by transforming statistical maps from native to surface space with the ‘vol_to_surf' function from nilearn's surface toolbox and plotted them on the ‘fsaverage pial left and right mesh' using ‘plot_surf_stat_mat.‘

The BOLD clusters in Fig. 2d are based on a PLS analysis of BOLD data, with statistical maps thresholded at a BSR score of >±3. We extracted regions with a size of >1,000 connected voxels using Nilearn's region package in Python and fused fragmented clusters that belonged to the same Yeo network upon visual inspection79.

To validate the PLS analyses, we used a general linear model (GLM) approach as recommended by ref. 107. The GLM included confound variables such as CSF and WM signals, dvars, framewise displacement and translations/rotations across the x, y and z axes. We applied a high-pass filter (100 s) and a 6-mm smoothing kernel. For native space analyses, we used individual first-level z maps (z > 2.5). The contrasts calculated were CALC-positive (CALC > CTRL or REST), CALC-negative (CALC < CTRL or REST), MEM-positive (MEM > CTRL) and MEM-negative (MEM < CTRL). To cross-validate the PLS results, we used FWE-corrected z maps from the second-level analysis.

For the native space analyses, we calculated median values within each native-space ROI from the first-level GLM output (z > 2.5) for each subject. We assessed significant task-related differences compared to baseline using paired-samples two-sided t-tests across subjects. For other analyses, we obtained median voxel values in standard space across subjects (Figs. 2b, 3b and 4a,d). Bar plots (Fig. 2d) were created using Python's seaborn library108 with error bars indicating a 95% CI based on 2,000 bootstraps. A CI that included zero indicated a statistically nonsignificant median delta value. To analyze hemodynamic differences between discordant and concordant voxels, we conducted paired t-tests on median subject values, and baseline differences were assessed using independent-sample permutation tests. High-resolution external maps were downsampled to 2-mm MNI standard space before analysis.

Enhancer–promoter (E-P) interactions regulate transcription during cell fate determination. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying E-P interactions have remained elusive. Here we present a chromatin-interaction-based proteomic approach, LoopID, to profile proteins (termed the looposome) at certain E-P anchors. We find that histone demethylase JMJD2, a key looposome component, can regulate E-P interactions and the looposome in a catalytic-independent manner through formation of biomolecular condensates. Furthermore, we introduce a system to engineer E-P interactions by assembling JMJD2 condensates at certain genomic loci, enabling construction of cell-type-specific E-P interactions to promote cellular reprogramming into pluripotent or two-cell-like cells. Our findings reveal a noncanonical function of a histone demethylase in regulation of chromatin organization and provide a strategy to regulate cell fate transitions through E-P interactions.

In September, the US government announced a one-off US$495-million funding boost for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). This is welcome news — but doesn't redress their chronic underfunding.

The financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States

The financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States

In the United States, HBCUs educate 1.5% of all university students — yet receive only 0.9% of federal research and development (R&D) funding. Data reported in 2024 show combined HBCU endowment assets around $100,000 per student. By contrast, the ten wealthiest US universities received $2 million to $7 million per student in 2023.

As a scientist and administrator at Meharry Medical College — a 150-year-old private historically Black health-sciences institution in Nashville, Tennessee, with some 1,500 students — I've seen how hard it can be to manage on scant budgets. I urge the government to redress funding levels. In the meantime, HBCUs and TCUs can target their investments, as Meharry has done with some success.

Over the past decade, Meharry has increased its funds for research, and its scholarly output, by using metrics to guide budgeting and investments. We tracked publications and citations, grants, awards, student engagement, graduation and career placement rates, facility use, data generation and sharing (how many samples were processed, what data sets were produced and how were shared), research collaborations and investigator diversity. We also expanded our number of sponsors and monitored how funds were used.

Between the periods of 2010–15 and 2020–25, the number of cross-disciplinary collaborations increased, both between groups at Meharry and with external investigators. The number of papers with Meharry authors indexed in the PubMed database of biomedical literature rose from 444 to 1,067.

End racism in science

End racism in science

Three measures underpin this growth. First, we established transdisciplinary pilot grants of $50,000–$75,000 per faculty member lasting for 12–18 months — funded by federal research endowments or private foundations — to seed ideas and support core staff and infrastructure. While maintaining budgets for ongoing cancer, HIV and oral-health studies, we prioritized new projects in genomics, inflammation, immunity and cardiometabolic health. We also launched two new schools: one in applied computational sciences, in 2021; and one in global health, in 2023.

Second, we invested in infrastructure to handle, store and analyse data securely. We established procedures — including some around human consent and data sovereignty — that meet both federal and Tribal Nations' standards. Studies that involve human participants must be co-designed with community members to ensure that any concerns — for example, about privacy, potential stigma or data misuse — are addressed early on. Steps such as pre-consented sharing of electronic health records or clinical notes can help to accelerate the analysis of disease risk, treatment response and gaps in care, to inform services and policies that benefit local people. This transparent and respectful approach deepens public confidence in science, especially among populations long marginalized in research.

How will artificial intelligence reshape the global economy? Some economists predict only a small boost — around a 0.9% increase in gross domestic product over the next ten years1. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today's jobs by 20452. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today — steering young people's career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres.

Why evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now

Why evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now

Given the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning.

Yet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI's effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools3. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022–23 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools4. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT's release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before5. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects.

Second, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers3 and software developers4 found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. If they do, the effect on those individuals could be the opposite of that estimated in controlled studies. Indeed, payroll data suggest that employment of younger workers has declined since 2022, particularly in occupations that include tasks that AI excels at, such as customer service and software development6. However, researchers are still trying to understand how much of the pattern is attributable to AI technology.

Carefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence.

Social science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.

One approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction7 — speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces.

For example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse8. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the ‘externality'.

Another illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI's disruptive potential. Studies9,10 suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated — such as creative direction or vetting final outputs — will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. These opportunities could cushion some of the disruptive effects of automation. But it might also deepen inequalities between people who thrive in these roles and those who do not.

More thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader.

As well as theory, policymakers will also need evidence to understand how the economy will change. Different types of information need to combine to form a more complete picture.

One common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking — testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. Benchmarks can assess an AI system's ability to solve mathematics problems, respond to customer-support requests or diagnose medical conditions. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance.

If AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption11,12. Other indicators include employment, job openings and whether firms that integrate AI earn higher profits and expand. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies.

Estimating AI's causal effects is difficult because the technology is evolving and organizations are adapting. But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme — whether in business, education or public health — will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer — for example, a government agency — rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots13–15. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments.

One important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. For example, one study16 examined AI usage by teachers in Sierra Leone who pay for Internet access by the megabyte. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive.

The capabilities of AI are another crucial determinant of its impact. It is hard to predict how these will evolve, but researchers can try to anticipate how humans might respond to more-powerful systems. Even as technology advances, human behaviour tends to follow stable patterns — in terms of how people develop trust, how they respond to incentives and how they adapt to automation.

Here we present the ambiphilic reactivity of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in the stereoselective synthesis of diverse cyclopropanes from olefins, under palladium(II) catalysis. The sulfonyl fluoride functionality serves as both an acidifying group and an internal oxidant within the ambiphile, enabling successive carbopalladation and oxidative addition steps in the catalytic cycle, respectively. The transformation grants access to cis-substituted cyclopropanes and exhibits broad compatibility with various alkyl sulfonyl fluorides, including those bearing –CN, –CO2R, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl and aryl groups. With internal alkene substrates, 1,2,3-trisubstituted cyclopropanes that are otherwise challenging to synthesize are formed in good-to-moderate yields and predictable diastereoselectivity. Detailed mechanistic insights from reaction progress kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the SN2-type C–SO2F oxidative addition is the turnover-limiting and diastereoselectivity-determining step.

Organosulfonyl fluorides have emerged as central players in organic synthesis1,2,3, owing to the rise of sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEX) chemistry, which enables rapid and reliable diversification through nucleophilic displacement of fluoride with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles4,5,6. The utility of organosulfonyl fluorides in this context has motivated the development of a growing number of methods to synthesize structurally diverse sulfonyl fluorides in an efficient, selective and modular manner7,8,9,10,11 (Fig. 1a).

In contrast to widely studied aryl-12,13,14,15,16,17, alkenyl-18,19,20,21 and alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides11, alkyl sulfonyl fluorides have been less thoroughly investigated despite offering unique opportunities as synthetic building blocks owing to the acidifying effect of the sulfonyl group on the α-protons5. In recent work, Bull developed an elegant series of desulfonative couplings of azetidine and oxetane sulfonyl fluorides for C–heteroatom bond formation22,23. Prior work has demonstrated the utility of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in C–C bond formation through reaction with classical electrophiles, such as alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds, in the presence of base16,17,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 (Fig. 1b). We surmised that alkyl sulfonyl fluorides could exhibit unique ambiphilic reactivity in transition metal catalysis, capitalizing on the ability of the sulfonyl fluoride group to serve the dual role as a pronucleophile activator and electrophilic reactive group (internal oxidant).

Our laboratory previously developed a palladium-catalysed anti-cyclopropanation of olefins with various carbon pronucleophiles and I2 as the bystanding oxidant, where the hypothesized mechanism involves initial α-iodination of the nucleophile, directed carbopalladation, PdII/PdIV oxidative addition of the newly formed C(sp3)–I bond and, finally, C(sp3)–C(sp3) reductive elimination from the palladacyclobutane intermediate31. The need for doubly activated carbon pronucleophiles in all cases but nitromethane limits the scope of substituted cyclopropanes that can be accessed with this method, leading us to search for alternative nucleophilic coupling partners in which a leaving group and an acidifying group could be merged into the same entity.

Here, we demonstrate alkyl sulfonyl fluorides acting as ambiphilic coupling partners in the stereoselective cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins through the PdII/PdIV redox couple. The catalytic cycle leverages a novel mode of reactivity, C(sp3)–SO2F bonds oxidatively adding to organopalladium(II) intermediates, to deliver stereochemical outcomes that are inaccessible using conventional leaving groups32,33,34,35 (Fig. 1b). While this paper was in revision, Mane and Baidya reported a directed cyclopropanation reaction involving ketone-derived sulfoxonium ylides to access related cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclopropane products36.

In this context, alkenyl amide 1a, featuring the 8-aminoquinoline directing auxiliary required for reactivity31, and alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a were selected as model substrates. After extensive screening, we identified optimal reaction conditions using a combination of Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%) and Na2CO3 (1.0 equiv.) in dimethylacetamide (DMA) (0.33 M) under a nitrogen atmosphere to afford cyclopropane 3aa in 94% yield with 98:2 diastereomeric ratio (d.r.); the unusual cis-configuration of the major product was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction37,38,39,40,41,42 (Table 1). Key findings from our optimization campaign include the important role of Na2CO3 as the base, as other carbonate salts, such as K2CO3 and Cs2CO3, led to substantially lower yields (entries 2 and 3), as did bases with other counteranions (entries 4 and 5). Other commonly used PdII sources, such as PdCl2 and Pd(TFA)2 (where TFA is trifluoroacetate), gave slightly lower yields and comparable diastereoselectivity (entries 6 and 7). Increasing the concentration of the reaction mixture decreased the yield (entry 8). The use of a polar aprotic solvent was crucial, and dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were reasonably effective alternatives to DMA (entries 9–13). We were also pleased to find that the reaction gave 92% yield even when set up and run under air with anhydrous DMA (entry 14). In control experiments, we found that changing the leaving group to sulfonyl chloride (LG2), phenyl sulfonyl (LG3) or methyl sulfonyl (LG4) groups led to no reaction or trace product formation (entry 15), indicating that the sulfonyl fluoride is key for the observed reaction. A representative sulfonium bromide sulfur ylide precursor (LG5) gave moderate yields but poor d.r. Beyond sulfur-based leaving groups, halides were also tested but found to be ineffective. An additional control experiment revealed that 2a furnished a different product, a tri-substituted cyclopropane with the –SO2F group intact, when subjected to previously reported conditions for PdII-catalysed cyclopropanation31 (see ‘Pd(0) salt screening and control experiments' section in Supplementary Information).

In seeking to rationalize the optimization data, we considered previous reports that found alkyl sulfonyl fluorides, such as phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), to be highly unstable in aqueous solutions43. We questioned whether yield differences could be partially attributed to the competitive decomposition of the nucleophile under different conditions (in different solvents and in the presence or absence of adventitious water). To this end, we examined the stability of alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a in DMA, DMF and DMSO (see Table 2 and ‘Stability tests' section in Supplementary Information for details). Surprisingly, alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a was fully decomposed in anhydrous DMSO after 2 h but proved to be relatively stable in anhydrous DMF. Similarly, we found no decomposition of alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a in anhydrous DMA under an inert atmosphere. However, under air, moderate levels of decomposition in DMA could be detected, and complete decomposition was observed in wet DMA. Under aerobic conditions, oxidation and subsequent decomposition of DMA into N-methylacetamide and formaldehyde has been previously documented and could be a contributing factor to these observations44. These results indicate that the rate of decomposition of 2a is dependent on the solvent identity and amount of adventitious water in the solution.

Having optimized the conditions, we began investigating the scope with respect to the alkyl sulfonyl fluoride, many of which are commercially available or readily accessible using routine procedures (see ‘General procedures for starting material preparation' section in Supplementary Information) (Fig. 2). The reaction proceeded in moderate-to-excellent yields with various ester nucleophiles, including ethyl ester (3ab), tert-butyl ester (3ac), benzyl ester (3ad), allyl ester (3ae) and phenyl ester (3af), providing the corresponding cis-cyclopropanes as the major products with high diastereoselectivity and without appreciable base-mediated epimerization45. Amide or nitrile-based coupling partners (3ag–3ah) led to diminished yield but maintained excellent cis-diastereoselectivity (>20:1). We found that the reaction could tolerate weaker electron-withdrawing groups, including a 2-bromopropenyl group (3ai) and various heterocycles, including isoxazole (3aj) and 1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (3ak), which gave 32%, 43% and 20% yield, respectively. An α-aryl alkyl sulfonyl fluoride nucleophile participated in the reaction to form a fully substituted carbon centre within the cyclopropane, albeit with moderate yield and d.r. (3al). Aryl-substituted methylene sulfonyl fluorides were also investigated. Interestingly, the reaction did not proceed with unsubstituted, electron-neutral benzylsulfonyl fluoride, but proceeded with substituted benzylsulfonyl fluoride substrates bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position (3am–3ap). Stronger electron-withdrawing groups led to improved yields and diastereoselectivity. A meta-nitro substrate was also tolerated (3aq).

Reactions performed on 0.1 mmol scale. Percentages represent isolated yields. The d.r. was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of crude or purified reaction mixture. The diastereomeric centre is highlighted with a blue circle. aReactions performed under 20 mol% catalyst loading. bReactions performed under 5 equiv. alkyl fluoride loading. cReactions performed under 24 h. dReactions performed under 36 h.

Next, the scope of alkenes was investigated. Internal alkenes afforded good-to-moderate yields (4aa–4ae). Notably, (Z)-alkenes reacted with excellent diastereoselectivity (>20:1), affording a single diastereomer. To our delight, under the standard condition, the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable all-cis cyclopropane could be synthesized from an (E)-configured internal alkene in one step in moderate yield (4ad) with 1.1:1 d.r. In addition, α-substituted β,γ-unsaturated amide substrates are well tolerated, giving the desired products in moderate-to-excellent yields (4af–4ai). Specifically, a diene substrate (4ag) could be chemoselectively cyclopropanated at the β,γ-alkene, while leaving the δ,ε-alkene unperturbed. When the tether length between the alkene and directing group was extended and a γ,δ-unsaturated amide was tested, the cyclopropane product was furnished in moderate yield with excellent diastereoselectivity (4ak).

The methodology could be easily scaled up and performed on 1.0-mmol scale under the standard reaction conditions, giving cis-cyclopropane 3aa in 86% yield (Fig. 3a). Performing the reaction on 100 mmol scale resulted in 81% yield with 9:1 d.r. Removal of the directing auxiliary was possible through a two-step sequence46. Initial introduction of an N-Boc activating group proceeded in 83% yield (5aa). Then, hydrolysis with LiOOH/water gave carboxylic acid 6aa in 86% yield on multigram-scale, which has been commercialized by Enamine (Fig. 3b). Alternatively, a representative amine could be used in the second step in a net transamidation (58% yield, 6ab). If desired by the practitioner, the loading of nucleophile 2a can be lowered to 1.5 equiv. while maintaining comparable yield and diastereoselectivity with a dual base system (0.75 equiv. NaF and 0.25 equiv. Na2CO3) (Fig. 3c; see ‘Base screening at lower nucleophile loading' section in Supplementary Information for details).

The distinctive reactivity of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in this cyclopropanation, along with the observed stereochemical outcomes, prompted us to examine the mechanism through experimental and computational techniques. We performed reaction progress kinetic analysis to determine key mechanistic features of the reaction from a minimal number of experiments47. First, we compared the standard reaction profile with a ‘same excess' experiment that simulated 25% conversion (Fig. 4a). Time-shifting reveals that the two curves overlap as the reaction proceeds to approximately 50% conversion; beyond this point, a slight deviation emerges—an indication of either mild product inhibition or partial catalyst deactivation. To distinguish between the two possibilities, a third experiment was performed with product 3aa (83 mM) as an additive, and overlay with the same excess experiment confirmed mild catalyst deactivation. The lack of product inhibition is notable given the capacity of the product to bind to the catalyst in a polydentate fashion. To explore potential coordination between the product and catalyst further, 3aa was treated with Pd(OAc)2 (1 equiv.), resulting in the formation of N,N,C-palladacycle Pd–3aa in which the 3 °C (cyclopropyl)–H bond was cleaved (Fig. 4b) as characterized by X-ray crystallography48. Complex Pd–3aa proved to be catalytically competent under the standard reaction conditions, showing the reversibility of C–H activation, consistent with the lack of product inhibition. Next, to estimate the order of the reaction components, we performed a series of ‘different excess' experiments (Fig. 4c). Considering that catalyst deactivation becomes more pronounced at higher conversion, we focused on the early stages of the reaction (<50% conversion). The variable time normalization analysis49 plot showed both alkene (1a) and nucleophile (2a) to be close to zero-order and Pd(OAc)2 to be close to first-order. Overall, the kinetic data are consistent with either oxidative addition or reductive elimination as the rate-determining step. To gain further insights into the rate-determining step, we conducted an Eyring analysis to obtain activation parameters (Fig. 4d). At temperatures close to standard conditions (70–100 °C), the experimental ΔS‡ was determined to be −25.8 e.u. and ΔH‡ to be 16.1 kcal mol−1 (ΔG‡80°C = 25.2 kcal mol−1). Given that large negative ΔS‡ values are commonly observed with bimolecular associative reactions50, and oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the current system are unimolecular steps, the data suggest potential desolvation and coordination of a ligand to the metal centre in traversing from the catalyst resting state to the rate-limiting transition state along the potential energy surface, which informed subsequent density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Source data

DFT calculations with alkene 1a and alkyl sulfonyl fluoride nucleophile 2a as model substrates were performed to gain insights into various facets of the catalytic cycle, including the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining steps (Fig. 5a). A particular focus was placed on the oxidative addition mechanisms and the origin of diastereoselectivity favouring the cis-cyclopropane product 3aa. Ligand exchange of the precatalyst Pd(OAc)2 with 1a forms π-alkene PdII complex Pd-1 with the 8-aminoquinoline directing group binding to the Pd in a bidentate fashion. Two competing anti-nucleopalladation transition states with the deprotonated nucleophile 2aʹ were considered (TS1 and TS1ʹ), which lead to two different diastereomers of the palladacycle intermediate (A and Aʹ, respectively). The deprotonation of 2a to form 2aʹ is expected to be facile based on its predicted aqueous pKa value of 7.75 for 2a and the experimental pKa of 6.83 for the analogous trifluoromethanesulfonyl51,52,53 (see Supplementary Fig. 10 for details). In the more stable transition state TS1, the largest substituent on the nucleophile, SO2F, is placed anti-periplanar with the alkene C=C bond, which could minimize steric strain, whereas in the less stable diastereomeric transition state TS1ʹ, the ester group is anti-periplanar with the C=C bond (Supplementary Fig. 4). This steric effect probably leads to the 3.4 kcal mol−1 higher energy of TS1ʹ than that of TS1. Although the formation of palladacycle A is kinetically favoured in the anti-nucleopalladation, diastereomers A and Aʹ rapidly epimerize via deprotonation of the acidic α-C–H. The Na2CO3-mediated deprotonation of A to form enolate Aʹʹ is predicted to be exergonic by 8.4 kcal mol−1 (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for details). This deprotonation process is in part entropy-driven as the enolate oxygen replaces the acetate ligand in A to form a six-membered chelation with the Pd centre.

The reaction energy profile was calculated at the experimental reaction temperature (80 °C). See the ‘Density functional theory (DFT) calculations' section in Supplementary Information for computational details. All Gibbs free energies and enthalpies are with respect to Pd-1. b, Oxidative addition transition states. All activation barriers are with respect to the enolate resting state Aʹʹ.

Due to the ablation of the new α-stereocentre formed after nucleopalladation, under the Curtin–Hammett conditions, the product diastereoselectivity is determined in the subsequent steps. Our calculations indicate that the oxidative addition proceeds via an SN2-type stereoinvertive mechanism (TS2 and TS2ʹ). Other oxidative addition pathways, including the four- and three-centred C–S oxidative addition (TS4–TS6; Fig. 5b) and the S–F oxidative addition16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 6), were found to be less favourable. Subsequent reductive elimination from the PdIV intermediate B (TS3) is kinetically facile with a low barrier of 1.7 kcal mol−1 with respect to B, consistent with our recent computational study on the strain-release-promoted reductive elimination from PdIV to form cyclopropane rings31. The liberated SO2F− anion then decomposes to SO2 gas and F− anion, similar to previous reports by Bull and coworkers22,23. In situ 19F NMR spectroscopy monitoring indicates that F− is ultimately converted to bifluoride (FHF−) (see ‘Fluorine tracking experiments' section in Supplementary Information for details). The computed reaction energy profile indicates that the irreversible intramolecular SN2-type oxidative addition (TS2) is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step. The computed overall barrier from the Pd–enolate resting state Aʹʹ to TS2 (ΔG‡ = 28.7 kcal mol−1, ΔH‡ = 17.5 kcal mol−1) is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally determined activation parameters. The large negative activation entropy (ΔS‡ = − 31.7 e.u. compared with the experimental value of −25.8 e.u.) is primarily attributed to entropy loss during the association of an OAc− ligand upon reprotonation of the enolate resting state Aʹʹ. The computed diastereoselectivity indicates that the SN2-type oxidative addition via TS2 leading to the cis-cyclopropane product is 3.0 kcal mol−1 more favourable than the minor pathway via TS2ʹ leading to the trans product, which is consistent with the experimentally observed diastereoselectivity (>20:1 d.r.). TS2ʹ is probably destabilized by steric interactions between the acetate ligand and the ester group. The SN2-type oxidative addition with a phenyl ester (2f) had an increased barrier (ΔG‡ = 30.9 kcal mol−1) and lower computed diastereoselectivity (ΔΔG‡ = 1.2 kcal mol−1), attributed to steric repulsions between the directing group and the ester that stabilize the transition state leading to the cis-cyclopropane product (Supplementary Fig. 9).

A highly diastereoselective PdII/PdIV-catalysed cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with alkyl sulfonyl fluorides has been developed. The synthetic versatility of this method stems from the diverse array of pronucleophiles that are compatible. With internal alkenes, all cis-substituted cyclopropanes that are otherwise difficult to access can be prepared in one step. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the SN2-type oxidative addition is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step.

Outside of the glovebox, the appropriate alkene substrate (0.1 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.01 mmol, 10mol%) and Na2CO3 (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) were added to an oven-dried 1-dram (4 ml) vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The vial was then introduced into a nitrogen-filled glovebox antechamber. Once transferred inside the glovebox, alkyl sulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) was added to the vial, followed by anhydrous DMA (0.3 ml, 0.33 M). The vial was sealed with a screw-top septum cap, removed from the glovebox and placed in a heating block that was preheated to 80 °C for 14 h. After this time period, the resulting mixture was filtered through a pad of celite. Saturated NaHCO3 solution (10 ml) was added to the filtrate, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 2 ml). The combined organic layers were concentrated and purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexanes as the eluent.

OpenAI has quietly reversed a major change to how hundreds of millions of people use ChatGPT.

On a low-profile blog that tracks product changes, the company said that it rolled back ChatGPT's model router—an automated system that sends complicated user questions to more advanced “reasoning” models—for users on its Free and $5-a-month Go tiers. Instead, those users will now default to GPT-5.2 Instant, the fastest and cheapest-to-serve version of OpenAI's new model series. Free and Go users will still be able to access reasoning models, but they will have to select them manually.

The model router launched just four months ago as part of OpenAI's push to unify the user experience with the debut of GPT-5. The feature analyzes user questions before choosing whether ChatGPT answers them with a fast-responding, cheap-to-serve AI model or a slower, more expensive reasoning AI model. Ideally, the router is supposed to direct users to OpenAI's smartest AI models exactly when they need them. Previously, users accessed advanced systems through a confusing “model picker” menu; a feature that CEO Sam Altman said the company hates “as much as you do.”

In practice, the router seemed to send many more free users to OpenAI's advanced reasoning models, which are more expensive for OpenAI to serve. Shortly after its launch, Altman said the router increased usage of reasoning models among free users from less than 1 percent to 7 percent. It was a costly bet aimed at improving ChatGPT's answers, but the model router was not as widely embraced as OpenAI expected.

One source familiar with the matter tells WIRED that the router negatively affected the company's daily active users metric. While reasoning models are widely seen as the frontier of AI performance, they can spend minutes working through complex questions at significantly higher computational cost. Most consumers don't want to wait, even if it means getting a better answer.

Fast-responding AI models continue to dominate in general consumer chatbots, according to Chris Clark, the chief operating officer of AI inference provider OpenRouter. On these platforms, he says, the speed and tone of responses tend to be paramount.

“If somebody types something, and then you have to show thinking dots for 20 seconds, it's just not very engaging,” says Clark. “For general AI chatbots, you're competing with Google [Search]. Google has always focused on making Search as fast as possible; they were never like, ‘Gosh, we should get a better answer, but do it slower.'”

An OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED that the company determined, based on user feedback, that Free and Go users preferred staying in the default chat experience, with the option to manually select a reasoning experience when needed. OpenAI declined to specify which user signals informed that decision. The company also said its Instant models can now take more time to answer questions, much like its reasoning models, narrowing the gap for most users.

The spokesperson said ChatGPT's paid users, however, continue to value the model router, and the company expects the technology underlying it to keep evolving. OpenAI will likely relaunch the model router for free and Go users when it's improved, according to sources familiar with the situation.

The change comes as OpenAI scrambles to shore up ChatGPT amid intensifying competition, particularly from Google. Last month, Altman announced a company-wide “code red” to marshal resources around improving its core consumer product. While ChatGPT is a juggernaut in the AI space, with more than 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar reportedly told investors that the amount of time users spend on the platform has dipped slightly following recent content restrictions. Since August, OpenAI has introduced several safeguards into ChatGPT, such as having the chatbot suggest breaks to users during excessively long conversations, and increasing the scope of its classifiers to block more content that's deemed unsafe.

Third-party data suggests competitive pressure is mounting. According to audience-tracking firm SimilarWeb, Google Gemini has grown significantly in recent months, while ChatGPT's growth has flattened. SimilarWeb's vice president of data and DaaS product, Omri Shtayer, tells WIRED that average visit duration on ChatGPT has fallen below Gemini since September.

The model router has been controversial since it was launched in August. OpenAI's executives were caught off-guard by a strong backlash from users who preferred chatting with specific models. Within a week, OpenAI reinstated the model picker and some of its older AI models, while keeping the router as the default in ChatGPT via a newly branded mode: “Auto.”

The episode shows how leading tech companies are still figuring out the best way to integrate powerful AI models into mass-market consumer products.

As OpenAI pushes for higher usage in ChatGPT, it has to do so without backtracking on its safety commitments. In a recent report, the company said hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT users exhibited possible signs of mental health emergencies related to psychosis or mania every week, and it was taking steps to address how its AI models respond to them. OpenAI's model router was one of those steps, routing sensitive queries to reasoning models, which were previously deemed better equipped to handle users in distress.

An OpenAI spokesperson tells WIRED that it will no longer route sensitive conversations to reasoning models due to GPT-5.2 Instant's increased performance on safety benchmarks..

The model router still exists for ChatGPT's paid subscribers, including its $20-a-month Plus or $200-a-month Pro tiers, signaling that the company is still committed to the idea. Robert Nishihara, cofounder of the AI training and inference platform Anyscale, says he expects model routers to stick around in the long term, even if the versions available today aren't perfect.

“Fundamentally, using different models and amounts of computational power is appropriate for different problems,” says Nishihara. “No matter what happens in the short term, I expect routing to continue to be right.”

In 2012, San Francisco apparel shop American Giant released its very first product, a zip-up hooded sweatshirt that put the company on the map. Officially called the Classic Full Zip, most people know it as “the greatest hoodie ever made,” thanks to the headline on a Slate article touting its charms.

After that story, things took off for American Giant. In the 13 years since, the company has sold 1 million hoodies. It has also grown its brand and added a range of casual tops and bottoms, all of it sourced and manufactured in the US. But one thing that hasn't changed much is the design of that Classic Full Zip hoodie. Until today.

The Classic Full Zip has just been relaunched as a softer and more breathable piece, thanks to an overall refresh centered around a new cotton fleece construction. The hallmarks of the design remain: the double-lined hood, stretchy side panels, and the elbow patches. But slip it on and zip it up, and you'll notice it's not as snug around the waist or around the shoulders.

For me, a big-shouldered person, the cut of the cotton around the shoulders was one of my quibbles with AG's hoodie. I always liked the piece as a whole, but the fit wasn't as relaxed as I'd like, and even after years of wear, it always felt a little stiff. The new design just gives you more room to move. The slightly more forgiving elastic in the cuffs around the wrists and waist is also something I consider an upgrade.

American Giant has been hailed as a success story for US-based manufacturing.

Inside one of the company's factories.

The biggest upgrade, though, is to the cotton fleece itself. The fabric is softer and more breathable. This can be attributed to a change in the cotton fibers in the hoodie.

If you have a cheap, thick cotton T-shirt in your collection—probably something that has a heavy-metal band logo silkscreened to it—then you know it feels a little rough, and the shirt isn't all that breathable. These cheaper shirts use short staple cotton fibers. The longer the fiber, the softer and more breathable the cotton gets. For this new fleece, AG is using the type of longer-staple cotton fibers found in soft cottony things like fancy dress shirts and expensive bedsheets.

The cotton in the fleece is grown, spun, and dyed in the US.

Cotton gets dyed at an American Giant factory.

At launch, the original Classic Full Zip Hoodie cost $138. The price jumped to $168 last year because of changes in American Giant's supply chain, the biggest of which was the closing of its key supplier, Carolina Cotton Works, in May 2024. The good news is that there's no additional price hike for the new hoodie. It's still $168, and it's available today.

The original hoodie is currently our staff favorite and occupies the rank of “best overall” in WIRED's Best Hoodies guide. We'll test out the new one and see if it can keep that top slot.

Amid the breathless coverage and relentless AI hype of recent years, one of the world's biggest tech companies—Amazon—has been notably absent.

Matt Garman, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, is looking to change that. At the recent AWS re:Invent conference, Garman announced a bunch of frontier AI models, as well as a tool designed to let AWS customers build models of their own. That tool, Nova Forge, allows companies to engage in what's known as custom pretraining—adding their data in the process of building a base model—which should allow for vastly more customized models that suit a given company's needs. Sure, it doesn't quite have the sexiness of a Sora 2 announcement, but that's not Garman's goal: He's less interested in mass consumer use of AI and more interested in enterprise solutions that'll integrate AI into all of AWS's offerings—and have a material impact on a corporate P&L.

For this week's episode of The Big Interview, I caught up with Garman after AWS re:Invent to talk about what the company announced, whether he feels behind in the AI race, how he thinks about managing huge teams (and managing internal dissent), and why he's not convinced that AI is (or should be) the great job thief of our era. Here's our conversation.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Matt Garman, welcome to the Big Interview.

MATT GARMAN: Thank you. Thanks for having me.

We always start these conversations with some very quick questions, like a warmup. Are you ready?

Go ahead. Fire away.

If AWS had a mascot, what would it be?

We have a big S3 bucket sometimes that goes around, so we'll call it that.

Sorry, what is an S3 bucket?

An S3 bucket is like a thing that you store your S3 objects in, but we actually have a large foam big bucket that walks around and actually looks like a paint bucket.

So you do have a mascot.

Well, S3 has a bucket, it has a mascot. It's probably the closest we have, and I like it.

What's the most expensive mistake you've ever made?

Personally or professionally? That's a good question. Personally, the most expensive mistake I ever made was playing basketball too long and I tore my Achilles. So that cost me about nine months of being able to walk. I probably should have known that into my thirties I was well past basketball-playing age. I lost a little bit of time there.

That sounds personally expensive.

Yes.

If you could rename the cloud today, what would you call it?

What is it called today?

The cloud.

I actually think the cloud is a pretty good name. So I don't know if I would rename it. I would rename what we called Amazon AWS, or Amazon Web Services. Now, no one knows what web services are. So that, I might rename a little bit, but I actually like the name of the cloud, so I'm not sure I would rename it.

Maybe Amazon Cloud Services.

Yeah, maybe.

What's the part of your job you would love to outsource to an AI agent?

I try to outsource a lot of the parts of my jobs to AI agents, if I can. But I find that I still haven't figured out how to outsource answering my day-to-day emails yet. That still, I find, takes up a lot of my time. If I could figure that out, I think that would be great.

But it sounds like you've tried, and I know we're supposed to be doing quick questions, but I was going to ask about this later. Tell me a bit about how you've tried to incorporate artificial intelligence into your workflow, into your personal and professional life.

There's a number of ways that I've done it. In particular for me, though, a lot of the benefits that I get in my job are taking a lot of information inputs and then kind of sharing those out to either the same or other people and connecting a lot of those dots.

For my particular role, I haven't yet found a huge shortcut for being able to do that, particularly with regards to the medium in which we communicate, like email or other places like that.

Because I find that all of the shortcuts lose some of that nuance. There's some summaries and things that work. There's definitely some tools that allow me to summarize content more quickly or learn new content more quickly, which I find to be super useful. But I haven't found a huge time win for my role in particular, where there's not as much repetitive work or other things like that.

It largely is knowledge that I'm trying to get from a bunch of sources and then consolidate to send out to others.

That's actually very interesting to me, and reassuring in a way, because I sometimes feel like I should have found a bunch of shortcuts by now.

So, from one former AWS intern—that's you—to a future one, what is your best piece of advice?

I find that people always overestimate how much technology has already been invented and think that there's nothing left to do. What I find is that we continue to be at the early stages of evolution. As long as you're curious and looking and willing to try new technologies, new areas, we're always at that early stage of what can be invented.

Sometimes I run into interns who are like, “When you started AWS it was small, but now it's a big company and there's not the same opportunity.” And I'd say that that's just not true. I think there's just as much, if not more, opportunity than there ever has been.

Which leads me to my next question: How do people know when you're unimpressed?

When I'm unimpressed, I would tell them directly.

Fair. So, direct feedback.

Largely, though, it's not about impressing me. I like when people are thoughtful, when they've come up with the right sets of decisions. It's not like people are coming up with something that's super novel every day. I like it when people have done the work so that we have all the information, whether it's customer input or data input or sales input or whatever, so that as a group we can make thoughtful decisions.

I'm impressed when people have done that work ahead of time so that when we do get together, we can make good decisions, and thoughtful decisions. I'll often tell people it's not necessarily the recommendation that I'm going to be impressed by, but I want us to have all the information so that as a team, we can move forward and make great decisions.

What is a hobby you wish you had more time for? I'm assuming it's not basketball, based on what we just learned about you.

It's not; I've switched to golf. I caught the bug a couple years ago and quite love playing golf. I don't get to play as much, but I enjoy it.

Let me set the stage a little bit. We're here to talk, in particular, about a bunch of announcements that you recently made around AWS and AI and agentic AI that WIRED covered. I'm biased, but I thought we did a great job with that coverage. But I also want to learn a little about you in a professional context. So tell me, and tell all of us, about your career journey thus far. Now you're the CEO of AWS, but you had a very long career at Amazon before that. How did you end up where you are now?

I'll start at the beginning. I worked for a couple of startups early on in my career. None of them did particularly well, but I learned a ton from them, which was great. After my second startup, my wife and I both quit our jobs and went to business school, which was a fantastic opportunity.

When I was there, one of the things during my internship that I wanted to try to explore was what entrepreneurship looked like inside of a company. My goal was always to go back and do a startup again. So as part of that, I looked at a bunch of different companies and I ran across Amazon and actually talked to [president and CEO] Andy Jassy, and they talked about building this technology services capability inside of Amazon. I thought that was exactly what I wanted to see. I wanted to see what it would look like for a successful technology company to try to build something new inside of it, because I just wanted to see what that motion looked like and how I could learn from experienced entrepreneurs and what was different than at a startup.

Got it.

So I did my internship for what turned into AWS in 2005 before we launched. I was fascinated by it. I thought it was an awesome opportunity, and I said, “Great, I wanna come back and work here for a couple years,” and then I would go back and do a startup.

So then I started full-time in 2006, effectively as the product manager for all of AWS. It was largely defining all of the services as we launched them. So I started a couple weeks after S3 launched, and before the rest of our services launched, and helped launch them and name them and price them and do a bunch of things.

Then I kept getting more and more responsibility. I focused on EC2, which was our compute service. I started taking on engineering teams, actually launched our block storage service, kind of wrote the PR/FAQ for that and hired the first engineering team and launched that.

Then I grew to lead most of our core compute and networking and storage product areas. So all of the product and engineering teams for that. It was fun. I got to learn a lot along the way. I'm not necessarily, or I wasn't originally, a deep technology person, but I got to learn about hypervisors and kernel engineering and a bunch of these really low-level core technology pieces, which was cool. It was super interesting. It's just such a fascinating space, and as AWS grew really rapidly, we grew along with it, and we grew the team pretty significantly.

We were fortunate enough to work with some of the best technology people in the world as we built the service, and a bunch of services, as the business group. I can't remember the exact time, but it was after about 12 or 13 years, so it would've been like 2019, something like that, Andy Jassy called me in his office one day and asked if I would lead sales and marketing. I literally didn't know anything about sales and marketing. In fact, I was kind of looking around to see if he was talking to someone else. But it was a great opportunity to learn that space, and it was a unique opportunity, right?

Yes.

I was basically handed one of the world's two or three biggest enterprise sales and marketing organizations, having never done any of those jobs before. I think Amazon's a bit unique in that we trust people. If you're smart, you know how to operate, you know the business, you don't necessarily have to know the exact thing that you're going into. The team was gracious and helped me learn that. That was a great opportunity to get to learn how to run a field organization at scale and get to spend a ton more time with customers, to really understand the nuances of what a startup customer was looking for versus enterprise, versus the governments, which was awesome.

Then I took over as CEO two years ago, or a year and a half ago. So I've spent almost 20 years here at Amazon, all in AWS.

How big is the organization by employee size?

I don't know the exact numbers, but it's in the hundreds of thousands. We have large data centers. We run a very large operational organization. We have data centers all around the world. So it's a pretty big team.

I love management, and it was clear fairly early in my career that that is where I wanted to go. Was that always clear for you, the idea that you wanted to be taking on more and more of the enterprise? That you were doing what you were meant to be doing?

Yes, I like it and I think that I'm reasonably good at it, I guess.

We'll ask some of your employees.

I took on more and more as it went. You can ask others. I guess that's not for me to say, but I liked it. You know, it was a ton of learning. What I really love is when I get to take on roles where I get to learn more, and get to stretch myself.

Frankly, I love building and love having an impact on what the business is doing and what our customers are doing. It's hard because you don't get some of the joy of actually physically getting to build the thing or deliver the thing yourself.

In my world, that's like not getting to write the story.

That's right. But you can write a lot more stories in that case. And you learn to do that through others, which is an interesting and useful skill. You learn how to communicate to teams, first through direct management, then through layers of management.

So you gotta think about how you build mechanisms. This is one of the things I enjoyed learning, which is how do you think about building mechanisms that allow you to help those individual contributors make some of the right kinds of decisions, and the strategy that you're trying to drive for the team or the business or the company? I've quite enjoyed learning how to leverage some of those mechanisms at different scale. That's been fun to do, too.

You just talked about going from managing people to managing managers, and I swear I'm asking for a friend, but do you have any particular mechanisms that you have picked up in those 20 years that stand out to you as particularly effective strategies? Because I will say there is something very specifically different about managing someone who then manages people who then manage teams of people.

Yeah.

It has the potential to be a very unproductive game of telephone. What mechanisms do you employ to make it much more effective than that?

I mean, look, everybody has their own way of doing this. So you a little bit have to find what works, and I do think that as your team in your organization gets larger, you have to change some of those things. I think that's one of the common pitfalls that I see people fall into is that they will assume that the thing that worked great when they were a line manager, managing a team of six to 10 people, will work the same as when they're managing a team of a hundred people.

Those same things won't work. There's another shift that's like when you don't know the name of everyone in your team. Or your organization, which I can't unfortunately know today. Usually that breaks somewhere around a hundred to 200 people, somewhere in there.

Right.

You'll run into people who are in your team that you don't know or don't know their names. You just have to think about all of those things differently. You want to give the broadest set of people in your team as possible mental models on how you would make decisions in their place as opposed to what the decision actually is.

Because if you send down edicts all day—like, we're going to do this, or you wanna do this, or I'm going to make a decision on that—it's not as empowering to your team. And there's a chance that whatever you say gets miscommunicated. But if you can give people mental models of, for example, “If I was going to approach this situation, this is how I would think about it, or these are the ways in which I would make trade-offs,” then you can empower tens of thousands of people to make decisions.

Then you can focus on making sure that you hire smart people and don't punish them when they make bad decisions, but instead course-correct. That's how I've kind of learned at scale, where your real leverage points are ensuring that you have those right mechanisms at place.

I appreciate the free management advice. I'm sure many of our listeners do, too, so thank you.

I want to now ask you about AWS in a broad context. I would describe WIRED's audience as sort of curious generalists. Obviously, they're listening to this, or reading this, because they're interested in technology and where it's taking the world. They probably have some sense of what AWS is. But they probably don't know how big AWS is and how vital it is in terms of just infrastructure. Can you explain it to us?

Not like we're five, but like we're 21, we just graduated with a humanities degree, trying to understand this thing that you are in charge of.

At a high level, our idea behind AWS hasn't changed in the last 20 years, which is that there are a bunch of pieces of technology that were really non-differentiating that companies had to do on their own for a long time. It used to be that they had to build a data center. They had to go find servers, they had to take care of the servers. When a disk drive broke, they had to go fix it. They had to set up their networks, et cetera. There's a whole bunch of work that they had to do before they could ever write a cool application that would let them stream a movie or connect individuals with people who had rooms they wanted to rent out.

When you think about all of that work, our goal was: What if we could do that work for companies so that they didn't have to do that? That was the thesis when we started. So that someone could come and say, “Great, give me servers, give me storage, give me databases,” and we'd provision it for them. Then, through an internet connection, they could have access to that. It turns out that was a very powerful idea. I think we did a good job executing on some of the abstractions that made it really powerful.

Netflix and Airbnb and Pinterest are all some of these early customers that we had that built their business from the beginning on AWS and the cloud. They don't own data centers, they largely just run inside of AWS. Initially, when we first launched the business, we thought this was going to be incredibly compelling for startups and some technology companies, which it was, but as we grew, we found out that enterprises and really large organizations were equally compelled by this value proposition, and we had to build a lot more capabilities for them. Whether it was like encryption capabilities or audit logs or abilities to hit particular compliance things or whatever it is.

Got it.

But now we have customers like Pfizer and JP Morgan, and the United States government and the intelligence agencies. That was a big win for us when we kind of convinced the US government that we could build a top-secret region and that they could run intelligence workloads inside of AWS.

I would've loved to have been a fly on the wall in those meetings. What does it take to convince the United States government that they should run on the back of AWS?

We walked through some architectural questions that they had, and … you know, there was a whole [request for proposal] process and there's a lot of work that we did, but it was also just some whiteboarding where we kind of walked through how it would work, and at the end of the day, the cloud sounds like it's a magical technology, but it's data centers and it's networks and it's servers, and other things that we run at very high reliability, at very high security.

We found some forward-leaning technology folks that wanted to figure out how they could get the benefits to the government. It turns out that if you can find the right person in an organization, even somewhere as large and bureaucratic as the US government, you'll find people who want to lean forward, go faster—they want to deliver value for citizens. So, finding that right person and then being able to collaborate with them, their eyes light up just like they do for a startup company, right?

These people are oftentimes very mission-driven, and if they can see an opportunity to deliver more value for the mission that they're on they're super excited about that.

So today, now it's across almost every country and every industry that you think about throughout your daily life. There's still lots more to go, but I would say there's a bunch of companies that now use AWS as their core infrastructure. NASDAQ trading markets run on AWS; financial services companies run on AWS; hospitals run on AWS; media and entertainment—live broadcasting or streaming—we power a lot of that technology.

Just when you thought you were done learning the job, along comes artificial intelligence. Which brings me to my next question. Obviously, we are in this new era for you and your organization. You held this re:Invent conference in December, and you streamed it on Fortnite, I might add …

Yep.

You announced some pretty significant changes to AWS, to your mission, to your priorities, and to what you would be offering to your consumers. I'm hoping you can talk us through that transformation.

Technology is always iterating and going through transformations. So for us staying at the forefront of every innovation is incredibly important. I think there's been almost no technology leap since maybe the cloud, and the internet before that, [as big as AI]. So we've been investing in AI, in AWS and Amazon, for the last decade-plus, two decades maybe. But definitely with the leap forward from generative AI over the last three years, we've just seen a massive change in what's possible for customers.

So we've had this vision that it's not just going to be, AI is over on one side and then the rest of your business is going to be over on the other side. Basically AI is going to be built into what everyone does. In order for that to happen, number one is you have to have all of your data in the cloud world. And we've built this whole platform of tools that then allow you, once you have that data in the cloud, to deliver differentiated value to your customers.

Some of the things that we launched—that I'm quite excited about—at re:Invent are really around AI agents and the difference between the first generation of AI tools [and the next]. The first generation were really around summarization and content creation, right? We were all quite excited and got a lot of value out of those. But there's only so far that goes. I think the next stage is these agents. The real value is they can take access to your data—they can still do some summarization and content creation, but they can actually accomplish tasks. They're able to reason.

When you have these agents that can reason and accomplish tasks on your behalf, all of a sudden you can kind of force-multiply what you're able to do. So we launched a couple of things. One was called Nova Forge, where we allow customers to actually take their data and integrate it in at the early stages of training one of these frontier models. So that gives enterprises one of these AI models that deeply understands their data and their domain. Then we launched a number of these frontier agents that allow customers to really deliver big bodies of work, whether it's in coding or operations or security.

We've spent the time to really build this platform where it could actually deliver value. I think broadly people have understood what that long-term strategy was. They really get it. As they see projects really delivering, where there's real value, they see that AWS is the platform where they want to go do that. That's what customers were telling us over and over again [at re:Invent].

I feel like 2025—which we are, thank God, almost done with—was a confusing year in the narrative for AI. I say that because I feel like in January I went to some conferences, talked to some people, and the sentiment was “This is the year of the agent. Agentic AI is here. It's about to change everything.” That was almost a year ago.

Yeah.

Am I using agentic AI right now? Absolutely not. Has that come to fruition in the way people were talking about in January? No. At the same time, you've seen reports from MIT, for example, finding that 95 percent of gen AI pilots in companies are failing to yield the productivity gains that I think those corporate leaders thought they would see.

How do you make sense of all of those narratives coming together? Were companies just moving too quickly?

If you jump forward and don't build that strong foundation of I have my data, I know the workflows, I really know how some of these things are going to tie together, then you're not going to get any value out of it.

You're going to have just a chatbot, which is kind of cool and looks neat. Then everybody has a chatbot and then what? So it is those differentiated workflows, you know, and they're less sexy and interesting for people to look at, but a workflow that can help you automate insurance claim processing is super valuable, right? You can actually get people's claims processed faster, make sure that you cut your costs, have a better customer experience, make sure you have better accuracy—you can deliver all these things.

Some of the technologies weren't available in January. This technology is moving so fast that the capabilities are much better today.

I will tell you, at re:Invent I sat in a room of executives for a broad set of companies, and I asked for a show of hands of who is either now starting to see positive ROI on their AI investments or see a clear path to meaningful positive ROI in the next six months. I think 90 percent of the hands went up.

Hmm.

That's not the answer I would've gotten a year ago, but it's because we've done a bunch of this work, and it's because we've done a bunch of this work together with customers to understand exactly what they want, how do we solve their problems, and how do we deliver solutions that deliver them real value and not just, you know, clickbait headlines that sound good.

On that note, I will say candidly, Amazon has not been a key part of a lot of these AI narratives, right? There have been other companies that have been out there making announcements. I can tell you, leading WIRED, it's this constant stream of news, “We're doing this, we're doing that.” Does that worry you? Do you worry about Amazon not being in that narrative, or do you feel like you took your time?

I think both of those things are true. I do worry about it, because I don't want customers to think we're not innovating or driving the latest technologies they need. I want to make sure that it's not just headline-grabbing stuff and it's actually great.

Jeff Bezos used to have a saying that you have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. For us, I think that's what some of the last two years entailed.

I think a lot of that narrative has changed now. If you talk to lots of analysts, if you talk to folks in the press, if I talk to customers they're saying, “Look, actually AWS has by far the strongest agentic platform to go build on. They have the broadest set of models that I can build on. They have the broadest set of security controls and compliance controls that actually, if I go put these agents in production, I can actually audit, know what they're doing, control what they're doing.” That is what we're seeing.

That's not to take anything away from [other AI tools]. ChatGPT is an incredible consumer application, but it's just a different thing. That's not our business. Our business is to make sure that banks and health care companies and media and entertainment companies and energy companies can drive their businesses and deliver more outcomes for their customers or cut costs or whatever they want to do.

So, I'm quite pleased with where we are now, and I think we've already seen that narrative largely shift.

I wanted to ask you a little bit more about Nova Forge. What was particularly interesting to me here is this idea of custom pretraining, as opposed to the idea of fine tuning, as a way that a company can take a model and really make it their own. Can you explain that distinction to everybody before I dig in a little more?

It's not new that people have thought, “OK, there's these out-of-the-box models that I wanna customize,” and the best mechanism that we've had to date to customize are these open-weights models. Meta was great and released that with their first Llama model, but now we've seen a variety of these, whether it's Mistral or DeepSeek or Qwen or whatever.

There's a number of these, but they're still black boxes, right? You basically get a fully pretrained model, and then they open the weights and you can tune the weights to focus in particular areas. Or there's new techniques like reinforcement learning where you can start to send more information to these models that train them after the fact.

What we find is that if you put too much new data into these models in the later stages, they forget the early stuff and so they forget what made them great at reasoning. Or they actually forget some of that data because they get what's called overtrained on some of the data you're giving it.

Right.

Then they lose what was valuable in the first place. So there's only so far that that can go. What we also find is that those techniques are very ineffective if the model wasn't already trained on your domain. So if you try to teach one of these open-weight models about protein folding and they know nothing about protein folding, it doesn't work, because it doesn't know how to inherently reason about that thing.

What we found is that if you can train them earlier, and I use this analogy in my re:Invent talk about the human brain, it's like learning languages. You're able to learn new languages early when you're younger. Much easier. Now, if I try to learn a new language, it's much harder to do. So models are somewhat similar to that.

What we've done, which is a unique thing, we refer to it as open training, but really the idea is that you have this corpus of data that is from your domain and your particular company and the ways that you do things. If you're able to insert it into the pretraining stages and then mix in a bunch of the data that was used to originally train that model and then finish pretraining the model, when it's done the model actually inherently knows all of your stuff. It knows about your data, it knows about your company, it knows about your domain, and anything that you do with fine-tuning or post-training after that is actually much more effective.

It's just never been possible before. Because open-weight models never would expose their data, and there was no kind of mechanism for them to be able to go do this. So we did this with our Nova models and our Nova 2 models.

Take a financial services company. You can take all your information, inject your data, mix it with an Amazon-curated dataset. This is the data that we have proprietary use. We'll give you tools to easily mix that together. And then you finish pretraining the model, and you effectively have your own custom frontier model that understands your business that you were able to train for a couple hundred thousand dollars or whatever the cost is to finish that training, versus billions of dollars of doing all the research to actually go and build a frontier model.

I'm curious about risk in the context of Nova Forge in a few different ways. You already deal with companies that have confidential proprietary information, right? You just mentioned financial services inputting all of that data into this model and into this training. You also offered a really compelling example off the back of re:Invent from Reddit, which is using Nova Forge to develop a model that can be used for content moderation, which essentially means training a model that breaks a lot of conventional rules around how these models are typically designed, right? They would be designed to avoid offensive or violent content entirely. Reddit, on the other hand, needs a model that can lean into that kind of content in order to do the moderation. So those are two very distinct examples that I just offered, but I'm curious what kind of risks exist when we start down the road of this kind of custom pretraining, and are there distinct risks that might be different from what we've seen historically?

I don't know if there's any particular, different risks. I think from a data protection point of view, we have all sorts of protections around this. That's one of the things we pride ourselves on, and have over the last 20 years, is really protecting customer data and making sure that it's isolated and protected.

When people are building their own model, this is true no matter what, if they're fine-tuning it, if they're doing any of that work, companies have to think about what is the output, and they have to own the output of their own models.

Mmm-hmm.

Even if they're using an off-the-shelf model, by the way, you have to own the outputs of that.

I think that's one of the key pieces: You can't just give up responsibility for whatever your technology is doing. You can't give up responsibility because a database makes a particular join and you're like, “I don't know, it's just how the database did it.” AI is no different from that.

We deliver powerful tools to customers, but they have to own those outputs and think about them. We still have safety classifiers, by the way, for things. You can't pretrain something and then create it to build a bomb or things like that. We still have a lot of those safety controls, and there's no circumventing those.

But with regards to things like content moderation, that's someone else's choice, and they can make a choice and they own what that looks like. They have to be sure that they make great choices for the content that's on their website, that's appropriate for their site.

So, we're talking about this premise whereby AI agents will be much more integrated into enterprise settings, and I'm curious how you think about that in the context of the workforce. I'm looking back at 2025 and remembering comments that other AI executives have made about job disruption, cuts to the workforce, et cetera.

You actually made an interesting comment where you said that replacing junior employees with AI is, quote, “one of the dumbest ideas” you've ever heard, which made me laugh.

Ha!

Could you talk more about that and more about how you see artificial intelligence and agentic AI changing the workplace in the years to come. Because I think you have a point of view on this that some people might find reassuring, and that I think is different from what we hear from a lot of other leaders.

That point, by the way, was specifically about software developers, but I think it applies to lots. There was this thought that you'll just replace all of your junior engineers and all of your junior employees and you'll just have the most senior, most experienced employees and then agents.

Number one, my experience is that many of the most junior folks are actually the most experienced with the AI tools. So they're actually most able to get the most out of them. Number two, they're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.

Three, at some point that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.

We get the new fresh blood into the company from hires out of college. There's a lot of excitement. There's a lot of new thoughts. You've gotta think longer term about the health of a company, and just saying “OK great, we're never going to hire junior people anymore,” that's just a nonstarter for anyone who's trying to build a long-term company.

What does this mean, though, for the workforce broadly? What does it mean for Amazon's workforce? What does this look like as AI agents infiltrate—which is not a generous word, but it's the word that comes to mind—the way we work and live.

One of the things that I tell our own employees is “Your job is going to change.” There's no two ways about it. If there's only one thing I can promise you, it is that the way that you did your job four years ago is not how you're going to do your job next year. You're going to be able to have a bigger impact. You're going to be able to do more things, you're going to be able to have a broader scope of responsibilities, and it's just not going to be the same things that made you successful five years ago. You're going to have to learn new skills, you're going to have to learn new ways of working. We may have to organize our teams differently. We may have to go after problems differently. So people are going to need to be flexible. There is for sure going to be disruption in how work is done, because jobs are going to change and industries are going to change.

If they don't, they'll most likely get left behind by people who move faster and do change. There is going to be some disruption in there for sure. Like there is no question in my mind.

When you say disruption, do you mean in the context of job loss, in a big picture, economic way?

That is uncertain to me. I'm very confident in the medium to longer term that AI will definitely create more jobs than it removes at first. I think anytime you find opportunities to create new economic prosperity or build new experiences or things like that, there are more jobs that get created. But they will be different. There are jobs that will be eliminated as part of it, or reduced, almost for sure.

There are some things where you just no longer need quite as many people to do a particular job. So our job is to also provide training and upskilling so that we can retrain, so that there are other roles that some of those folks can do. Not all people want to do that. There may be some churn in the short term, as people either are hesitant to learn new skills or don't wanna learn new skills or other things like that.

But this is true of almost every single technology change: It was true of industrial automation in the 1930s. It was true when personal computers came around, and when the internet came. It will be true for AI too. There'll be some jobs that there won't be as many of, that is true. And I think there'll be new jobs.

I'm curious how you're thinking about all of this from an environmental perspective. I think one of the notable pieces of agentic AI is having them run continuously for hours or days. I would imagine there is a sustained energy demand in that context. We're already talking about a very energy-intensive technology. Amazon right now is the single biggest purchaser of new renewable energy contracts in the world, at least for the last five years.

That's right.

How do you put that commitment together with this drastically increased need for energy?

Look, part of what that is, is us investing. This is not just going out and buying existing things. That is investing in new projects and bringing new renewable energy projects online. That's a huge commitment for us. It's something we do every single year and we'll continue to do. Because we think that's important from an environmental impact point-of-view, and frankly, from an energy availability point-of-view. I do think we're going to have to keep looking at other energy sources. I think that nuclear power is one of those that's going to be very important for us to look at in the medium to longer term.

We have to make sure that we have enough carbon-zero energy out there, but we need to look at all of those sources of energy, and it doesn't mean that no one's going to use natural gas in the inter-medium term. I'm sure some of that is true, too. Our goal is, how do we continuously, period over period, year over year, reduce the carbon intensity of the energy that we consume? We're still committed to that as a company, and we've spent an enormous amount of time on that.

How do you respond to criticism of this venture, which is an enormous undertaking, internally? I'm curious about the management piece there. A few weeks ago you had over a thousand Amazon employees—granted, it's a company with a seven-figure employee base, if I'm correct—but they described the company's quote, “all-costs-justified” warp-speed approach to AI development. They say that it will cause, quote, “staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the Earth.” That's quite a statement from Amazon's own employees. When you hear that read back to you, how do you address it?

Number one, we encourage our employees to have their own thoughts as to how they're thinking about things.

Well, that's good because a lot of tech companies these days are not happy to see that happen.

I would also say that when you have an organization of any size, you have viewpoints from a lot of different places. I would say that that is not the majority opinion from our employees or even close. I think most of our employees are excited about the technology we're building. Excited about the value that we're giving customers, and excited about the potential and the climate pledge that we have and the path that we're on. So, I think that's OK. As long as those concerns are respectful, we're willing to listen to them. But I think they're far from the majority.

I mentioned at the top of the conversation that in January 2025 everyone promised me this was the year of agentic AI. They were wrong. And so as we look out to 2026, I'm curious for your prediction: In the context of AI, what is next year all about for us? Then in 12 months, I'm going to call you and we'll see.

Just be super, super clear, I'm awful at predicting the future.

I am too, but I have to ask.

You could call me, I just probably won't be right. But I will say I think one of the big things that we are going to be incredibly focused on for our customers is delivering real business returns for them. Whether that's through agents, whether that's through customized models, whether that's through scalable infrastructure, whether that's eliminating tech debt through using [Amazon's] Transform to get them off of mainframes or get them off of legacy databases. That, I think, is going to be a big focus. It's not going to be about going and experimenting. It's not going and trying new technology. It is really delivering value to the end customers and to the business.

So it's time for the P&L to look a little bit different next year.

Yep. I think that's where customers have relied on AWS to help them improve for the last 20 years. And it's what we're particularly great at.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","OpenAI's Chief Communications Officer Is Leaving the Company","https://www.wired.com/story/openai-chief-communications-officer-hannah-wong-leaves/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:10:00 GMT","

OpenAI's chief communications officer, Hannah Wong, announced internally on Monday that she is leaving the company in January, WIRED has learned. In a statement to WIRED, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood confirmed the departure.

“Hannah has played a defining role in shaping how people understand OpenAI and the work we do,” said CEO Sam Altman and CEO of applications Fidji Simo in a joint statement. “She has an extraordinary ability to bring clarity to complex ideas, and to do it with care and grace. We're deeply grateful for her leadership and partnership these last five years, and we wish her the very best.”

Wong joined OpenAI in 2021 when it was a relatively small research lab and has led the company's communications team as ChatGPT has grown into one of the world's largest consumer products. She was considered instrumental in leading the company through the PR crisis that was Altman's brief ouster and rehiring in 2023—a period the company internally calls “the blip.” Wong assumed the chief communications officer role in August 2024 and has expanded the company's communications team since then.

In a drafted LinkedIn post shared with WIRED, Wong said that OpenAI's VP of communications, Lindsey Held, will lead the company's communications team until a new chief communications officer is hired. OpenAI's chief marketing officer, Kate Rouch, is leading the search for Wong's replacement.

“These years have been intense and deeply formative,” said Wong in the LinkedIn post. “I'm grateful I got to help tell OpenAI's story, introduce ChatGPT and other incredible products to the world, and share more about the people forging the path to AGI during an extraordinary moment of growth and momentum.”

Wong says she looks forward to spending more time with her husband and kids as she figures out the next chapter in her career.

Update: 12/15/2025, 7:30 pm EDT: WIRED has clarified Kate Rouch's title.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","New Head of Trump's Cancer Panel Questioned Links Between Vaccines and Cancer","https://www.wired.com/story/risch-trump-panel-vaccines-turbo-cancer-ivermectin-hcq/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:17:00 GMT","

An epidemiologist who has speculated about whether there is a connection between Covid-19 vaccines and “turbo cancer” in young people, and works as chief epidemiologist at a company that sells ivermectin alongside reviews that claim it has efficacy as a cancer treatment, has been appointed by president Donald Trump to a key position overseeing the National Cancer Program.

Harvey Risch, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, announced his appointment as chair of the President's Cancer Panel on X earlier this month. Risch's profile page on the Yale website has also been updated to read “In November 2025, President Trump appointed Dr. Risch to Chair the President's Cancer panel.”

No formal announcement was made by the president or the White House, and the Cancer Panel website's list of current members does not include Risch. The White House, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Cancer Panel, and Risch did not respond to requests for comment.

In his new position, Risch will oversee a group which is assigned to monitor “the development and execution of the activities of the National Cancer Program and report to the President on progress, efficacy, and opportunities for improvement,” according to the Cancer Panel's website.

As well as lending credibility to unproven treatments for Covid-19 like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin—he promoted the former in congressional testimony—Risch has more recently wondered whether the Covid-19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer” in some people. Now experts are worried that he could derail critical research into the causes and treatments for cancer.

“Having him on the panel charged with monitoring the progress of efforts to improve cancer treatment and providing recommendations to the president is a disaster for cancer patients, as he will inject conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and false claims about cancer into the panel's reports,” alleges David Gorski, a surgical oncologist.

Another expert, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they're afraid of retribution for speaking out about a Trump appointee, warned that they are concerned his conspiracy-adjacent beliefs might bleed into the National Cancer Program, a longstanding effort to coordinate the funding of critical cancer research and training.

“I am genuinely concerned that we are going to see ivermectin for cancer promoted at the federal level,” the doctor, who closely tracks the spread of medical disinformation, tells WIRED.

Risch is just the latest in a litany of controversial or unqualified figures who have been appointed to key public health positions in the federal government in Trump's second term in office, including the appointments of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and former daytime talk show host Dr. Memhet Oz being appointed to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Trump has also nominated Casey Means to be surgeon general despite the fact she does not currently have a licence to practice medicine. Kennedy, meanwhile, has filled his vaccine advisory committee with doctors who have promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.

Risch was among a cohort of medical professionals who embraced the use of alternative treatments for Covid-19 during the global pandemic in 2020. He was an early proponent of hydroxychloroquine, relying on questionable data to back up his claims.

At the time, his Yale colleagues publicly criticized his efforts. “As his colleagues, we defend the right of Dr. Risch, a respected cancer epidemiologist, to voice his opinions,” they wrote in a public letter. “But he is not an expert in infectious disease epidemiology and he has not been swayed by the body of scientific evidence from rigorously conducted clinical trials, which refute the plausibility of his belief and arguments.”

Despite—or perhaps because of—this, Risch became a fixture on right-wing media outlets during the pandemic, including appearances on Fox News and Steve Bannon's War Room podcast. A 2022 House Select Committee report also revealed that Risch was in direct contact with people adjacent to the Trump administration about the use of hydroxychloroquine.

As well as his position at Yale, Risch is also the chief epidemiologist for The Wellness Company, a MAGA-aligned alternative health organization that sells supplements as well as hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and a treatment that has been advocated for as a Covid vaccine “detox.” While the website does not advertise ivermectin as a cancer treatment, the reviews of the products clearly show that customers are using it as a way to treat their cancer. The Wellness Company did not respond to requests for comments.

In 2023, Risch speculated about whether there is a link between the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine and so-called “turbo cancers.” This echoed claims that anti-vaccine activists online had been promoting for years, suggesting without evidence that the vaccines could cause more aggressive forms of cancer.

“The most serious errors in his beliefs are in regards to ‘turbo cancer,'” says Frank Han, a pediatric subspecialist at the Heart Center at Connecticut Children's hospital. “This is so fundamentally against basic principles of oncology and epidemiology that it is hard to believe someone professionally trained in epidemiology would make this mistake.”

Risch's speculation is in direct opposition to the advice dispensed by the National Cancer Institute. “There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” the NCI website reads. “Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines do not change your DNA.”

In fact, the NCI says that cancer patients tend to be older, have weakened immune systems, and other comorbidities, which “are all reasons for them to get vaccinated.”

Risch, if his appointment is confirmed, will replace Elizabeth Jaffee, a pancreatic cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University whose term as the panel's chair ended in March,. “There typically is turnover with a new administration,“ Jaffee, who has been critical of the Trump administration's cuts to funding for cancer research, tells WIRED. “My term was toward the end at that point.”

The panel currently has two other members, Mitchel Berger, a neurosurgeon and Carol Brown, gynecologic cancer surgeon. Neither responded to requests for comment.

How many penguins are in this wildlife video? Can you track the orange ball in the cat video? Which teams are playing, and who scored? Give me step-by-step instructions from this cooking video?

Those are examples of queries that can be fielded by Molmo 2, a new family of open-source AI vision models from the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) that can watch, track, analyze and answer questions about videos: describing what's happening, and pinpointing exactly where and when.

Ai2 cites benchmark tests showing Molmo 2 beating open-source models on short video analysis and tracking, and surpassing closed systems like Google's Gemini 3 on video tracking, while approaching their performance on other image and video tasks.

In a series of demos for reporters recently at the Ai2 offices in Seattle, researchers showed how Molmo 2 could analyze a variety of short video clips in different ways. 

Molmo 2, announced Tuesday morning, caps a year of major milestones for the Seattle-based nonprofit, which has developed a loyal following in business and scientific circles by building fully open AI systems. Its approach contrasts sharply with the closed or partially open approaches of industry giants like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.

Founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Ai2 this year landed $152 million from the NSF and Nvidia, partnered on an AI cancer research initiative led by Seattle's Fred Hutch, and released Olmo 3, a text model rivaling Meta, DeepSeek and others.

Ai2 has seen more than 21 million downloads of its models this year and nearly 3 billion queries across its systems, said Ali Farhadi, the Ai2 CEO, during the media briefing last week at the institute's new headquarters on the northern shore of Seattle's Lake Union. 

As a nonprofit, Ai2 isn't trying to compete commercially with the tech giants — it's aiming to advance the state of the art and make those advances freely available.

The institute has released open models for text (OLMo), images (the original Molmo), and now video — building toward what he described as a unified model that reasons across all modalities.

“We're basically building models that are competitive with the best things out there,” Farhadi said — but in a completely open manner, for a succession of different media and situations.

In addition to Molmo 2, Ai2 on Monday released Bolmo, an experimental text model that processes language at the character level rather than in word fragments — a technical shift that improves handling of spelling, rare words, and multilingual text.

With the newly released Molmo 2, the focus is video. To be clear: the model analyzes video, it doesn't generate video — think understanding footage rather than creating it.

The original Molmo, released last September, could analyze static images with precision rivaling closed-source competitors. It introduced a “pointing” capability that let it identify specific objects within a frame. Molmo 2 brings that same approach to video and multi-image understanding.

The concept isn't new. Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT-4o, and Meta's Perception LM can all process video. But in line with Ai2's broader mission as a nonprofit institute, Molmo 2 is fully open, with its model weights, training code, and training data all publicly released.

That's different from “open weight” models that release the final product but not the original recipe, and a stark contrast to closed systems from Google, OpenAI and others.

The distinction is not just an academic principle. Ai2's approach means developers can trace a model's behavior back to its training data, customize it for specific uses, and avoid being locked into a vendor's ecosystem.

Ai2 also emphasizes efficiency. For example, Meta's Perception LM was trained on 72.5 million videos. Molmo 2 used about 9 million, relying on high-quality human annotations.

The result, Ai2 claims, is a smaller, more efficient model that outperforms their own much larger model from last year, and comes close to matching commercial systems from Google and OpenAI, while being simple enough to run on a single machine.

When the original Molmo introduced its pointing capability last year — allowing the model to identify specific objects in an image — competing models quickly adopted the feature.

“We know they adopted our data because they perform exactly as well as we do,” said Ranjay Krishna, who leads Ai2's computer vision team. Krishna is also a University of Washington assistant professor, and several of his graduate students also work on the project.

Farhadi frames the competitive dynamic differently than most in the industry.

“If you do real open source, I would actually change the word competition to collaboration,” he said. “Because there is no need to compete. Everything is out there. You don't need to reverse engineer. You don't need to rebuild it. Just grab it, build on top of it, do the next thing. And we love it when people do that.”

At the same time, Molmo 2 has some clear constraints. The tracking capability — following objects across frames — currently tops out at about 10 items. Ask it to track a crowd or a busy highway, and the model can't keep up.

“This is a very, very new capability, and it's one that's so experimental that we're starting out very small,” Krishna said. “There's no technological limit to this, it just requires more data, more examples of really crowded scenes.”

Long-form video also remains a challenge. The model performs well on short clips, but analyzing longer footage requires compute that Ai2 isn't yet willing to spend. In the playground launching alongside Molmo 2, uploaded videos are limited to 15 seconds.

And unlike some commercial systems, Molmo 2 doesn't process live video streams. It analyzes recordings after the fact. Krishna said the team is exploring streaming capabilities for applications like robotics, where a model would need to respond to observations in real time, but that work is still early.

“There are methods that people have come up with in terms of processing videos over time, streaming videos,” Krishna said. “Those are directions we're looking into next.”

Molmo 2 is available starting today on Hugging Face and Ai2's playground.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Washington and 35 other states reached a settlement with Hyundai and Kia in which the automakers will provide restitution to consumers and fixes to millions of eligible vehicles nationwide that lacked industry-standard, anti-theft technology.

Washington Attorney General Nick Brown's office announced details of the settlement Tuesday, in which Hyundai and Kia have agreed to:

Eligible car owners can receive up $4,500 for a total loss or up to $2,250 for a partial loss, according to compensation details on the settlement website. The claim deadline is March 31, 2027.

An engine immobilizer prevents thieves from starting a vehicle's engine without the vehicle's “smart” key, which stores the vehicle's electronic security code. The lack of the necessary tech on cars resulted in “an epidemic of car thefts and joy riding” across Washington and the country, 

“Security is a key piece for families looking to buy a vehicle, but Hyundai and Kia spent years selling people cars that lacked the industry's standard protections,” Brown said in a statement. “Year after year, consumers have been easily victimized because of the automakers' failure here.”

In late 2020, teenage boys began posting videos on social media describing how to steal the cars simply by removing a plastic piece under the steering wheel and using a USB cord. Posts with the hashtag “Kia Boys” racked up more than 33 million views on TikTok by September 2022, according to CNBC. The videos included teens engaged in reckless driving of the stolen vehicles.

Despite years of evidence, Hyundai and Kia waited until 2023 to launch a service campaign to update the software on most of the affected vehicles, Brown's office said. The update was easily bypassed by thieves.

Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison filed a similar lawsuit against Kia and Hyundai in January 2023.

“Kia and Hyundai chose to cut corners and cut costs at the expense of their customers and the public. As a result, our police force has had to tackle a huge rise in vehicle theft and related problems with already stretched resources,” Davison said in a statement at the time.

In May 2023, Hyundai and Kia agreed to a consumer class-action lawsuit settlement worth $200 million over rampant thefts of the Korean automakers' vehicles. The Seattle City Attorney's Office said at the time that it was a “good first step for consumers” but that the settlement involving individual owners “does not include the litigation brought by the City.”

We reached out to the City Attorney for comment on Tuesday and will update when we hear back.

Under the new multistate settlement, eligible consumers will be notified by the companies that they will have one year from the date of the notice to make an appointment to have the zinc-reinforced ignition cylinder protector installed at their local Hyundai or Kia authorized dealerships. Consumers are urged to schedule the installation of the zinc-reinforce ignition cylinder protector as soon as possible.

Consumers who previously installed the software update on their vehicles (or were scheduled to do so) but nonetheless experienced a theft or attempted theft of their vehicle on or after April 29, 2025, are eligible to file a claim for restitution for certain theft and attempted-theft related expenses.

Don't take your eyes off the road to read new research from the University of Washington.

In partnership with Toyota Research Institute, UW researchers are exploring how modern touch screens in cars affect driving now that dashboard knobs and buttons are increasingly a thing of the past. The results could help auto manufacturers design safer, more responsive screens and in-car interfaces.

The team's study, which was presented this fall at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in Busan, Korea, adds to what we already know about the dangers of distracted driving when it comes to phone use.

Participants driving a vehicle simulator and interacting with a touch screen (see video above) were given memory tests that mimic the mental effort demanded by traffic conditions and other distractions, the UW reported. Sensors tracked their gaze, finger movements, pupil diameter and electrodermal activity. 

While driving, participants had to touch specific targets on a 12-inch touch screen, similar to how they would interact with apps and widgets. They did this while completing three levels of an “N-back task,” a memory test in which the participants hear a series of numbers, 2.5 seconds apart, and have to repeat specific digits. 

Researchers found that when people try to multitask behind the wheel, their driving and their ability to use a touch screen both suffer. The simulator car drifted in its lane, and speed and accuracy using the screen declined while driving.

“Touch screens are widespread today in automobile dashboards, so it is vital to understand how interacting with touch screens affects drivers and driving,” said co-senior author Jacob O. Wobbrock, a UW professor in the Information School. “Our research is some of the first that scientifically examines this issue, suggesting ways for making these interfaces safer and more effective.”

Popular Mechanics wrote about the mental bandwidth and finger precision that many modern infotainment screens require in cars.

Based on the UW/Toyota findings, researchers suggest future in-car touch screen systems might use simple sensors in the car — eye tracking, or touch sensors on the steering wheel — to monitor drivers' attention and cognitive load. Based on these readings, the car's system might adjust the touch screen's interface to make important controls more prominent and safer to access.

Instagram is expanding Reels-viewing beyond mobile, the social network announced on Tuesday. The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.

By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don't have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.

IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.

Reels will also play automatically, so you won't have to keep scrolling to watch what's next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.

Users have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. 

It's worth noting that IG for TV shouldn't be confused with IGTV, which was Instagram's app for watching long-form content before being shut down in 2022. 

The launch of the TV app doesn't come as a surprise, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in October that the company was planning a dedicated TV app. 

“We're exploring TV,” Mosseri said at Bloomberg's Screentime event. “TV is an increasingly important surface, it's been very important for YouTube […] it's been very important for TikTok. So we'd like to figure out how to make sure that we show up in a compelling way on all the relevant devices.”

Mosseri went on to note that it was a mistake for the company not to have explored a TV app earlier, and that he wishes they had done so a few years ago.

Netflix and audio powerhouse iHeartMedia have entered into a new partnership to bring 14 video podcasts exclusively to Netflix in early 2026, the companies announced Tuesday. This represents Netflix's second major step into the podcast space, following its recent collaboration with Spotify.

The new video podcast episodes will premiere on Netflix in the U.S. in early 2026, with plans to expand to additional markets. 

As part of the agreement, Netflix will get a diverse range of shows spanning comedy, crime, history, sports, and more, which feature notable names such as “Dear Chelsea” with Chelsea Handler, “The Breakfast Club” with Charlamagne, and “My Favorite Murder” with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark. 

The deal covers all new episodes from the podcast lineup, as well as select library episodes from each show. Meanwhile, iHeartMedia will retain the audio-only rights and distribution, ensuring podcasts remain available on iHeartRadio and other major podcast platforms.

Netflix hopes that the millions of people who prefer the video version of these shows will flock to the streaming platform over competitors like YouTube. However, since these podcasters are no longer getting video versions of their shows on YouTube, they could lose out on ad revenue and reach, potentially alienating fans who are accustomed to watching there. 

The deal follows Netflix's announcement of a similar deal with Spotify for shows including “The Ringer,” “The Bill Simmons Podcast,” and “The Zach Lowe Show.”

Netflix's push into video podcasts is part of its mission to broaden its offerings beyond TV shows and movies. For instance, Netflix struck a deal with YouTube personalities Ms. Rachel and Mark Rober to appeal to a wider audience and tap into the growing creator economy. And Netflix recently launched party games on TV screens. 

Most notably, the streamer is looking to dive headfirst into the theater business as it seeks to acquire Warner Bros. 

Here are the shows included in the new partnership:

The IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it?

Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago.

This is Databricks' third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. 

The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers' vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products.

Series L rounds aren't really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts.

Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. 

“The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers.

“Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks' co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement.

The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated.

Digantara, an Indian space surveillance startup, has raised $50 million in a new funding round as it moves beyond space situational awareness into missile tracking, citing growing demand from governments for space-based defense capabilities.

The all-equity Series B round included new investors such as 360 ONE Asset and SBI Investment of Japan, as well as serial entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, with existing backers Peak XV Partners and Kalaari Capital also participating. The funding comes more than two years after the startup's $10 million Series A1 round, bringing its total capital raised to $64.5 million.

Globally, governments are investing more heavily in space-based surveillance and early-warning systems as missile launches and satellite interference become more frequent, with many seeking faster detection than traditional ground-based radar can provide. Digantara aims to tap that market by using its space- and ground-based infrared sensors along with software-based analytics and intelligence.

Founded in 2020, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup initially focused on space situational awareness, tracking debris and objects that could damage satellites. The startup has since expanded its scope to include missile detection and tracking, building on the space- and ground-based sensing and analytics technologies it developed for space surveillance, its founder and chief executive Anirudh Sharma (pictured above) said in an interview.

Digantara launched its first space surveillance satellite, SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking), in January aboard SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission, enabling space-to-space observation. A month later, the startup opened an office in Colorado Springs as part of its push into the U.S. defense market, a move that has since led to contracts with U.S. Space Command for analytics as a service. Its U.S. entity has also been selected for the Missile Defense Agency's SHIELD contract vehicle, which supports next-generation missile defense programs.

“Given we've already built IR sensors, we are now extending our IR capabilities to other domains like mid- and long-wave infrared,” Sharma told TechCrunch.

Digantara has split its operations across geographies to meet national security requirements. Its U.S. team is focused on building larger satellites and spacecraft in the 100-kilogram class tailored to American defense needs, while its India operation concentrates on analytics, data processing, and space situational awareness. The structure reflects the regulatory realities of defense procurement, where sensitive systems must be designed and built domestically for each market.

Digantara has so far closed contracts with a combined value of about $25 million, Sharma told TechCrunch. The startup currently operates across India, Singapore, and the U.S., and plans to expand into Europe by setting up a local entity there as early as 2026.

In India, Digantara operates a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility capable of producing up to five satellites simultaneously, and plans to scale that capacity significantly. The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government of Andhra Pradesh to set up a larger facility that could manufacture as many as 30 satellites at once, which it aims to bring online next year.

Digantara has already been selected as the winning bidder for government defense tenders in India and is completing administrative formalities before work begins, Sharma said.

Through 2026–27, Digantara plans to expand its space- and ground-based infrastructure, including additional electro-optical and lidar satellites for space surveillance, space-based sensors for early missile warning and tracking, and a larger network of ground-based observatories, the company said. It is also exploring the potential use of its lidar and laser technologies for future interceptor systems, Sharma asserted.

Digantara plans to launch another satellite through SpaceX in March, followed by additional launches in June and October, with multiple satellites scheduled for the latter mission. The company aims to deploy a total of 15 satellites over the next two years, Sharma said.

The latest funding, he noted, will support those launches, with about $7 million to $10 million earmarked for expansion in the United States and roughly $2 million to $3 million set aside to establish operations in Europe, while the remainder will be used to scale its India-based manufacturing and operations.

Digantara has seen revenues grow more than tenfold over the past two years, Sharma said, declining to disclose current figures. He added that the company is targeting annual revenues of $25 million to $30 million over the next 18 months as defense and government work ramps up.

The startup currently employs around 125 people, including roughly 80 to 85 engineers.

Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices. The appeal is obvious: If you've ever worn cashmere, you know it's soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that's hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.

Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That's not a lot of supply for a growing market.

“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you're seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they're being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it's creating unsustainable herding practices.”

Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors, including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.

To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine-tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.

At its core, Everbloom's process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: They're all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom's process.

The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”

To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.

The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement. 

“All the components that we're using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.

Plus, it should be cheaper. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don't believe in a ‘sustainable premium'” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That's what we're aiming for.”

Adobe is updating its AI video-generation app, Firefly, with a new video editor that supports precise prompt-based edits, as well as adding new third-party models for image and video generation, including Black Forest Labs' FLUX.2 and Topaz Astra. 

Until now, Firefly only supported prompt-based generation, so you would have to recreate the entire clip if any part of the video was not to your liking. With the new editor, you can use text prompts to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, and we also get a new timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds, and other characteristics easily.

The company first announced the new video editor in October in private beta, and now it is rolling out to all users.

The company said that using Runway's Aleph model, users can give Firefly specific instructions, such as “Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject.”

And with Adobe's own Firefly Video model, users can now do stuff like upload a start frame and a reference video of a camera motion and tell it to recreate that camera angle for the video they're working on.

The company also said users can now use the Topaz Labs' Astra model to upscale videos to 1080p or 4K. Black Forest Labs' FLUX.2 image generation model is coming to the app, too, along with a collaborative boards feature. 

The company said FLUX.2 will be available on Firefly across platforms immediately, and Adobe Express users will be able to use FLUX.2 from January.

With competitors releasing new models for image and video generation, Adobe wants to lure users into engaging with its app more. Along with new updates to the Firefly app, the company said subscribers of the Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit, and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model in the Firefly app until January 15.

Adobe has made a ton of changes to its Firefly models and apps this year. In February, the company launched a subscription that let users access various levels of image and video generation; then it launched a new Firefly web app along with mobile apps later in the year, and has added support for more third-party models within the Firefly app.

Two things are important to think about.1. Power should be measured in relative terms not absolute. (For a good treatise on this, read Paul Kennedy's Rise and Fall of the Great Powers). The US would have to be keeping up with China, India, and rest of world to maintain its previous pole position.2. Great nations/empires generally become so at least partially through population growth. This can be organic or engineered (ie: continuously conquering more and more territory) but rising dominance almost never coincides with demographic stagnation, which the US is experiencing. This population plateau has been accurately predicted by the US Census for my entire lifetime.Also nothing about this decline is unusual or unexpected. This is the course of empire, which is not a new concept.

It's the exact opposite: US citizens got fed up with the domestic problems created by Triffin's Dilemma and wanted out.Remember, the ""imperial revenue"" in our model doesn't get helicoptered into the economy, it pumps assets. Stocks, bonds, and real estate. Your share of the imperial loot is proportional to the value of the assets that you own, and worse, even if you don't have a big house and fat brokerage account you still have to compete with people who do and they're going to bid up the price of anything that doesn't have highly elastic supply. Health care, housing, and education are the ones creating problems. America got a great deal, but most Americans got a raw deal: costs went up, income didn't, misery ensued.Pumped bonds allow (force, really) the government to run deficits (homework: what breaks if they don't? It happened in Clinton's term, you can go and check) and to some extent that distributes the money. There's the whole services narrative which held that the services sector would pump hard enough to backfill manufacturing, but it never did. The people who got the door slammed in their face are no longer convinced that the door is their path to prosperity and now they want to tear the whole thing down.If you want to hear an actual economist talk about this, see ""Trade Wars are Class Wars"" by Klein and Pettis.

The exporter countries contain smart people who may seek to suppress this process to maintain revenue flows. This prevents the development from happening.Two examples:1: the 'unequal treaties' between 19th century Japan and America prohibited certain kinds of tariffs and subsidies by Japan. This allowed westerners, prominently Americans, to maintain market share in Japan by product dumping.2: in 18th and 19th century India various British offices at different times had policies of having their sepoys arrest textile workers and maim them by the forcible amputation of both thumbs, to preserve the market share of British textiles.

If only there was a conflict somewhere with a perieved superpower, maybe a nuclear country or something that would be relatively easy to win without even entering into a direct altercation. Oh, wait!America could've easily won the war in Ukraine by just ging away a bit more weapons, specifically long range missiles. It could even just tell European countries to give their long rhange missiles in exchange for a resupply for some plausible deniability.It could've been a bit more generous with intelligence.Unfortunately, America elected Trump. A person who doesn't believe in anything that doesn't directly concern him. If it doesn't benefit (or hurt) him personally it might as well not exist. Which make it easy to sway his foreign policy. Russia is actively trying to buy him and he thinks it's great. It's going to be a very fast decline of American influence as more and more countries around the world will see that it takes very little to buy an american president, allegedly the most powerful person in the world. And if any petty dictator can buy him, what worth is his power?

India is yet to harmonise widespread organisation.Relative gaps are smaller, but the persistance of gap is never more entrenched than ever.That is not a decline.  It is however a Great Game, not played with nations but with ideology and where the US and China are quite aligned.  That game is less visible until it is seen.

I've always said that if India got a unified national language they would become a nearly instant world power.Imagine an India where English was mandated in every public school - and every child, regardless of caste (which officially doesn't exist...), attended school. English, because it's more internationally useful than Hindi, and doesn't have the same ethnological competition (Hindi vs Bengali vs Tamil vs <297 others>).Then imagine that, now that all of India can actually speak to each other, they get their shit together, and build a truly functional national highway system. Top it off with a safe railway system, complete with modern trains. Enough trains that you don't have to ride on top. (OK, I'm starting to dream big.)One generation later India is a dominant world power. Pakistan is completely fucked, sure, because Delhi will never get over their petty sibling hatred. But India can start power-brokering between all other nations.

English, because it's more internationally useful than Hindi, and doesn't have the same ethnological competition (Hindi vs Bengali vs Tamil vs <297 others>).Then imagine that, now that all of India can actually speak to each other, they get their shit together, and build a truly functional national highway system. Top it off with a safe railway system, complete with modern trains. Enough trains that you don't have to ride on top. (OK, I'm starting to dream big.)One generation later India is a dominant world power. Pakistan is completely fucked, sure, because Delhi will never get over their petty sibling hatred. But India can start power-brokering between all other nations.

India is similar to the USSR in that it buckets disparate languages, religions and cultures into a single nation with inevitable separatist tendencies.

India's big problem is lack of natural resources, and lack of clear hierarchy to manage the limited resources (including choosing to screw some people for the greater good).  China had the same issue of enormous population relative to natural resources, but it had the clear hierarchy to be able to execute.

It was dragged into the first world war (despite strong public aversion) because J.P. Morgan Jr started lending money to Britain and France to buy American steel, thus setting in motion a cycle of investment and production protection that eventually required boots on the ground.It was dragged into the second world war by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor (and Germany's subsequent declaration of war, as it was obligated to do under its treaty with Japan).It protected Europe and SE Asia in the post-war years in order to contain communism, which it feared more than anything else. Once that threat subsided, there wasn't much reason for it to continue with its overseas footprint other than inertia and protecting important trade routes.Gulf Wars I was to protect oil prices (and because they already had the equipment for war), and Gulf Wars II was to be seen to be doing something about 9/11.Now that Trump is in power, America is performing its ""great reset"" (which was going to come eventually), where it becomes isolationist again, sticking to the Americas (reinvigorating the Monroe Doctrine), and leaving everyone else to their own devices.

On the other hand, the emergence of China, India, and to a lesser extent Russia (as a puppet of the Chinese) upon the world stage as independent actors, out of the shadows of Western domination, is another way in which the US is ""losing control"" but this is much less politically interesting in the sense that it was an inevitable and expected outcome.

But I think this past year really changed the direction of the US and to a lesser extent the EU with respect to oil and gas versus renewables.As the US has realized at the institutional level that China has secured a very strong position on refining rare earth materials into batteries and other green technology it is doubling down on oil and gas as the energy choice for the foreseeable future, climate change be damned. Not that China ever really cared about the climate, they just, for good reasons, wanted an alternative energy production source because even if they seized Taiwan the US Navy can bring oil and gas imports to near 0. Pipelines from Russia are sitting ducks too, so not much reprieve there.US is putting $40 billion into Al Udeid and signing AI deals with the Middle East powers, and is close enough on a deal to legitimize Israel. Add Venezuela. You can see where this is going.The EU politically wants to switch to green tech but it's facing a problem which is doing so will result in effective deindustrialization since they would wind up buying most equipment from China including cars. The EU either did or is about to shelve the requirement that cars are EVs by 2035. I expect this to be fully repealed. While the EU likes to not mince words about US tariffs, they're ultimately heading in the same direction. China had a $1 trillion export surplus. If the US isn't buying their subsidized products who is? Brazil? Right now it's Europe, but do you think Germany will let its manufacturing sector go away? If so I have a ticket to sell you to the next AfD rally. The product dumping from China is going to be too much and in a judo move the west will be able to use China's manufacturing capacity against it. Nice factories you have there, too bad nobody buys anything you make (relatively speaking).So the EU is sitting between two oil and gas energy superpowers oh and the Middle East is just around the bend. Politically they'll still work on climate change initiatives but as push comes to shove, and with China overplaying its hand with export controls on rare earth materials and creating more panic in Brussels (never mind China's support for Russia invading Ukraine), the EU will generally maintain an oil and gas industrial direction, if I were to guess.I'm not pro gas/oil or anything like that. Drive an EV and love it. But that's my fun armchair take on what's going on here.

Drive an EV and love it. But that's my fun armchair take on what's going on here.

The EU politically wants to switch to green tech but it's facing a problem which is doing so will result in effective deindustrialization since they would wind up buying most equipment from China including cars. The EU either did or is about to shelve the requirement that cars are EVs by 2035. I expect this to be fully repealed. While the EU likes to not mince words about US tariffs, they're ultimately heading in the same direction. China had a $1 trillion export surplus. If the US isn't buying their subsidized products who is? Brazil? Right now it's Europe, but do you think Germany will let its manufacturing sector go away? If so I have a ticket to sell you to the next AfD rally. The product dumping from China is going to be too much and in a judo move the west will be able to use China's manufacturing capacity against it.

The us detached itself from the world after ww I and it seems to want to do it again.  The tariffs might recapitulate the 30's but that decade didn't turn out well at all.  So I hope the historical behaviour breaks down first.

Silicon Valley is great for innovating new ""intellectual property,"" but they don't manufacture any real products any more.China has entire cities which not only can develop IP, but they have the entire ecosystem collocated.Catching up with them will be expensive and will need focus. Focus is not something the current president seems to excel in.

If a rebalancing were to occur, it is the surplus countries hit with mass unemployment that will hurt much more than deficit countries that can move production back at a much quicker pace. The author is making the mistake of viewing tings from a supply side perspective when given excessive reliance on investment and high savings the world is constrained by chronic underconsumption.

No they're not sending it for free, the US dollars and IOUs are real and ultimately translated into maintaining the salaries of millions of factory workers. Thats the whole point of export driven growth. Trying to abstract away the balance sheet as imaginary is not how real economics works.The CCP, the IMF, World Bank, BIS, etc certainly aren't thinking like you are, growing consumption has proven extremely difficult in practice over growing industry.

I mean, what makes american so special in their ability to consume? An african can watch football on their 54"" TV just as well as an american. Just ship this crap there instead of in the US if you're so concerned about consuming it.It's trade imbalance! You ship stuff, and the IOUs you get in return are never claimed. It's no better than shipping stuff in Africa and getting Zimbabwean money in return. Everyone knows that it can't be claimed for anything tangible, except from other countries who also owe fealty to the US and are forced to give this currency value. If everyone ""asked"" for something in return of those IOUs from the US itself, they'd get nothing of tangible value in return. These IOUs only have value insofar as the US is the world police.

Well if you believe so you can go present your findings to policymakers or the CCP rather than in internet forum comments. They would be VERY interested to know what revolutionary insights you have that hundreds of economists are unable to solve.

reply

We don't refer to the same problem. This problem you're referring to is not about finding those people who have the ability, so rare among non-american people, to consume stuff. It's about ramping up production while at the same time paying tribute to the US. This is, indeed, a difficult problem to solve and no doubts requires the best minds of the economic academia world.However, the nature of the problem changes once the US stops being the world police. The problem becomes figuring out what's the pecking order now.

It seems the US wasn't in the war until two years after it started, and was drawn in due to Pearl Harbor. Even the protection of Atlantic trade was handled by the UK and Canada until 1941: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United...

It's also a useless discussion: whatever faith you may have in European progressive/socialist parties, they are not willing to give up the prosperity they have. They want fairness in addition to MORE than what the European people already have. If the demand is to give up more than 100% of European economic growth, you will not find them allies. Oh and there's the problem that they've got maybe 10-20% of the vote, and all other parties are not nearly as willing to help.So these utopian outcomes won't happen. What will?What these people never discuss is who will replace the US? Because the only real contender is the Chinese CCP. That will, to put it mildly, not be good. Frankly, the absurdly huge distinction between US hegemony and all others, whether you mean British hegemony, Ottoman hegemony or even going as far back as Roman or Greek hegemony is that every hegemon with the sole exception of the US conquered and murdered their empire together using slave armies (to their credit, some European powers, not all but some, at least refused to use slavery)You might say ""but China has promised not to ..."". Ok, let's go there. Let's say China doesn't actually go ahead and try to conquer 1/3 of the world. Or, at least somewhat realistically, let's say they take over Taiwan and the Phillippines and stop there. Or let's even say they add Indonesia and Malaysia maybe even Japan to that ... and then stop.Note: the CCP ideology is authoritarian and racist. We can perhaps argue if they'll go as far as the Nazi's did in the past century, but I don't understand how any rational person can argue it isn't at least going to go quite a ways in that direction. But if you don't live there ... who cares right? Also: if you live in these countries: get the fuck out of there (because the EU is definitely going to refuse to pay for the US securing the seas)Or you might say you actually believe the CCP, and let's say that you're right to do so. The result is that the US withdraws from the global oceans ... and that's the end of that. What will happen?The problem is ""multilateralism"" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was at the end of WW1, at the real ending of Colonialism (I mean that yes, colonies endured a bit more, but the economic domination of European powers ended there. Their last big hurrah. At that point European Colonial powers had enjoyed a large surplus but right there and then, it was gone, and that's the point where the decline became totally inevitable, and exactly what happened became a certainty: a very large, protracted, slow economic decline. We might also mention what people chose to do in response to this happening: WW2)This is not theory. This is history. This is what actually happened. Any rational person should at least consider it might happen again.But let's discuss what will happen to us. Because that's what matters, right?First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. As a result international trade will largely collapse.Maybe EU-US trade will survive, and maybe even US-China trade. But EU-Africa? EU-China? It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Or put it this way. If you erased Serbia from the map, the Serbia-Kosovo conflict would continue. If you erased Kosovo from the map, the conflict would stop). Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. India-Pakistan. China vs essentially everyone. And so on and so forth.The problem is ""multilateralism"" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls ""justice"". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. We need that influence, because other forces are looking to destroy the rights we currently enjoy. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in ""the West"".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps they simply think the US will win WW3 and the world will go back to 1950. Perhaps their theory is that the best idea for the US is for WW3 to start before this economic crisis really hits the US, that the only thing they need to do is to withdraw the US army, weapons and diplomacy currently standing between a great many adversaries.Hell, that may be exactly what happens. But this is both giving these people way too much credit AND ignores that of course WW3 will make the world suck pretty fucking bad for a long time.

Because that's what matters, right?First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. As a result international trade will largely collapse.Maybe EU-US trade will survive, and maybe even US-China trade. But EU-Africa? EU-China? It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Or put it this way. If you erased Serbia from the map, the Serbia-Kosovo conflict would continue. If you erased Kosovo from the map, the conflict would stop). Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. India-Pakistan. China vs essentially everyone. And so on and so forth.The problem is ""multilateralism"" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls ""justice"". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. We need that influence, because other forces are looking to destroy the rights we currently enjoy. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in ""the West"".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps they simply think the US will win WW3 and the world will go back to 1950. Perhaps their theory is that the best idea for the US is for WW3 to start before this economic crisis really hits the US, that the only thing they need to do is to withdraw the US army, weapons and diplomacy currently standing between a great many adversaries.Hell, that may be exactly what happens. But this is both giving these people way too much credit AND ignores that of course WW3 will make the world suck pretty fucking bad for a long time.

The problem is ""multilateralism"" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was at the end of WW1, at the real ending of Colonialism (I mean that yes, colonies endured a bit more, but the economic domination of European powers ended there. Their last big hurrah. At that point European Colonial powers had enjoyed a large surplus but right there and then, it was gone, and that's the point where the decline became totally inevitable, and exactly what happened became a certainty: a very large, protracted, slow economic decline.

The US are by no means innocent of terrorism and invasion of other countries, but at least with countries commonly counted as ""the west"", the US was a friendly nation. If we have the likes of terrorist states like Russia taking over, then we got some very dark times ahead of us.Even worse, if the right wing and right extreme talking points and policies in the US don't stop, we might face the (still) strongest military on the planet becoming the arm of a fascist state. It might even get worse than the WW2, since the US military is probably more superior compared to almost any other nation on the planet, than Nazi Germany's military was, and already has presence in basically all parts of the world, plus the logistics.So lets hope that the current period of idiocy ends soon, and we can get back to peaceful international relations, with a sane US leadership, instead of one, that seemingly seeks to tear down as many bridges as possible. However, we are only in year one (!) of the current US government, so we will probably have to hold out breath a little longer, and Europe will have to rely on itself.

Given how often people love to swear with certainty that they remember Berenstain spelled as Berenstein [0], I find it kind of neat/interesting when this sort of digital archaeology refutes the silliness with undeniable proof.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenstain_Bears#Name_discrepa...Edit: that's one of the ROMs they recovered from tape backup -- wanted to add context since, if you don't actively expand the list in the article, my comment appears wildly non-sequitur

Of course, the silliness has always been refuted, since nobody has an authentic example of ""Berenstein"" that isn't itself an error or misprint.It also touches on the lack of care that people tend to have when it comes to getting names right. The creators of the Bears dealt with this in school, with a teacher who absolutely refused to believe that the A spelling was correct, asserting ""there is no such name"". A very large number of people throughout history have suffered similar fates, where others would dispute the spelling of their name, or indeed their entire name.

> The Sega Channel was an online game service developed by Sega for the Sega Genesis video game console, serving as a content delivery system. Launched on December 12, 1994, the Sega Channel was provided to the public by TCI and Time Warner Cable through cable television services by way of coaxial cable. It was a pay to play service, through which customers could access Genesis games online, play game demos, and get cheat codes. Lasting until July 31, 1998, the Sega Channel operated three years after the release of Sega's next generation console, the Sega Saturn. Though criticized for its poorly timed launch and costly subscription fee, the Sega Channel has been praised for its innovations in downloadable content and impact on online game services.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Channel

The fact remains that for things which are claimed to be true but turn out to not be true later, the p values that were provided in the paper are very often near the significance threshold.  Not so much for things which are obviously and strongly true.  This is direct evidence of something that we already know, which is thst nobody cares about p values per se, they only use them to communicate information about something being true or false in the real world, and the technical claim of ""well maybe x or y is true, but when I said p=0.49 I was only talking about a hypothetical world where x is true, and my statement about that world still holds true"" is no solace.

This is an interesting post but the author's usage of Lindley's paradox seems to be unrelated to the Lindley's paradox I'm familiar with:> If we raise the power even further, we get to “Lindley's paradox”, the fact that p-values in this bin can be less likely then they are under the null.Lindley's paradox as I know it (and as described by Wikipedia [1]) is about the potential for arbitrarily large disagreements between frequentist and Bayesian analyses of the same data. In particular, you can have an arbitrarily small p-value (p < epsilon) from the frequentist analysis while at the same time having arbitrarily large posterior probabilities for the null hypothesis model (P(M_0|X) > 1-epsilon) from the Bayesian analysis of the same data, without any particularly funky priors or anything like that.I don't see any relationship to the phenomenon given the name of Lindley's paradox in the blog post.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley%27s_paradox

That said you can give a Bayesian argument for p-circling provided you have a prior on the power of the test. The details are almost impossible to work out except for a case by case calculation because unless I'm mistake the shape of the p-value distribution when the null-hypothesis does not hold is very ill defined.However it's quite possible to give some examples where intuitively a p-value of just below 0.05 would be highly suspicious. You just need to mix tests with high power with unclear results. Say for example you're testing the existence of gravity with various objects and you get a probability of <0.04% that objects just stay in the air indefinitely.

(1) You can get the same effect with a prior distribution concentrated around a point instead of a point prior. The null hypothesis prior being a point prior is not what causes Lindley's paradox.(2) Point priors aren't intrinsically nonsensical. I suspect that you might accept a point prior for an ESP effect, for example (maybe not—I know one prominent statistician who believes ESP is real).(3) The prior probability assigned to each of the two models also doesn't really matter, Lindley's
paradox arises from the marginal likelihoods (which depend on the priors for parameters within each model but not the prior probability of each model).

You pretty much have to choose a smallest effect size of interest in order to do a power analysis in the first place, to figure out how many samples to collect, so this is a neat next step to then base significance level off of it.

Given rampant incentive misalignments (the goal in academic research is often to publish something as much as—or more than—to discover truth), having fixed significance levels as standards across whole fields may be superior in practice.

I have a slightly older WebOS LG TV, it has PS5, Switch 2, and FireStick 4K Max and an Onkyo receiver plugged in, and as an OLED TV it's incredible, LG would always be my first choice for picture. Don't care about built-in sound as I use a sound-system.Right now I'm in the market for another TV at around 65inches and was looking at the 2025 model LG OLED, I likely won't connect it to the internet and will probably just hook up an Apple TV following some discussion in another comment section about how much I hate my Fire TV for being ad-ridden.Really I wish LG or someone would just make a dumb TV with 4+ HDMI, ARC, perhaps DP and a remote and let us hook up what we want; but it'll never happen.

If you don't want WiFi you can still get a top rated washer. The LG WM3400CW, which is in a 3 way tie for high score, does not have WiFi (or Bluetooth, or any other radio).Note: Consumer Reports says that it does have WiFi but they are mistaken. It does have LG's ""SmartDiagnosis"" which lets you view diagnostic data in their app which is probably what confused them. On models with WiFi the app gets the data via the network.On the 3400 you press some buttons on the washer to tell it to send diagnostics, and then it sends them acoustically similar to the way analog modems sent data. You tell their app to use the mic to listen to that and decode the data.The WM3470CW, #10 on the Consumer Reports list, also is radio free and uses sound for SmartDiagnosis. Consumer Reports correctly lists this one as not having WiFi.

Here's the chapter on debugging in the book I mentioned if you want to take a look: https://lazyvim-ambitious-devs.phillips.codes/course/chapter...

reply

If you've only ever used this type of debugging, you should really try out a real IDE debugger once. The difference in productivity when you can use your IDE to navigate to, say, the usages of a function and then just press a keyboard shortcut to put a breakpoint on the line with that usage is immense.Compare this to the native debug support: you have to leave the interactive debugger, move to your editor, find usages, note down the file name and line number, then go back to your interactive debugger and type a manual break command (break my_file.rb:2517 or something). All of that context switching and remembering is replaced by a single keyboard shortcut in Emacs, VS Code, or any other integrated debugger. And no, adding manual breakpoints in your source code is not simpler - what I'm describing works interactively while your code is already running, whereas a breakpoint statement requires you to restart the whole process.

It's the opposite, I learned to program with java for android so a full IDE was my first experience. As I moved to node and then go and ruby I just gradually used it less and less as I generally 'debug' creating tests to check/reproduce behavior.I do think I should improve my debugging, but mostly in terms of profiling. I very rarely feel the need to see a codepath run line by line.I'm not saying my system is better or worse to be clear, I've just naturally gravitated to not using the debugger - I couldn't tell you why.

reply

Well, kinda. I define a workable system as a system I, personally, can work with straight away, with a minimum loss of productivity. It is not at all meant as a judgement on how good plain vim/emacs are.This workability indeed might require temporally replicating old habits while I learn the new ones, which lazyvim does. Vscode-like file trees, global search, or integrated terminal, for example.It's also about discoverability, like the helpers shown through which-key. And the guarantee that a set of default plugins play well with each other, so that I can leave toying with the config for whenever I have the time.Some people might think this is a crutch for properly learning the tool, but this is not my experience. I'm much more likely to get comfortable with vim and learn further if I can be in it 8 hours a day from the start. At first I used the integrated terminal to run git commands, now I invoke lazygit, which I love. At first I used the file tree to navigate, now I have custom commands to bring a file and its test suite side to side on a keypress. This gradual curve is what I was missing earlier.

I'm not judging your for it, but to me that sounds like learning the violin by plucking the strings like a guitar. You're increasing the learning period by following old habits which may even be harmful.I think it's better to just use the new editor sparingly, learning what you need, then switch fully once you're comfortable. A filetree is never necessary unless you're actually exploring and a file manager would be better for that. Vim has global search with `grep` and the terminal is available through `ctrl-z` and the `:terminal` command.I've seen people touting Neovim setup that are just making things complex and fragile for no reason.

For example, <leader> ft toggles a terminal in a bottom split. This is familiar enough that I knew I could rely on it whenever needed.Could I have used :term and manually set splits each time? or learn tmux? or use ctrl+z and fg to move back and forth ? Sure, but that's extra cognitive load.Maybe I want to focus first on becoming fluid with regex for search and replace, or improving the flow for running unit tests, or get used to using macros as a replacement for multicursor. There's a lot of gaps to cover, each small enough that it's ""just do X"" for a veteran, but enough when added up that I would much rather pay the cost gradually.

That's when you know you want to create a keybinding, here's a suggestion that opens a split below the current window with 10% height and starts a terminal: `nnoremap <leader>ft :belowright 10 split | terminal<CR>`But is a terminal really what you want or do you just want to run a command? Maybe just `:!command` is enough 9/10 times that you reach for <leader>ft? In that case a common binding is `nnoremap ! :!` which puts you in that mode with a single key.> get used to using macros as a replacement for multicursorThis exact example was how I realized the vim way is better than my assumptions. I used to install a multicursor plugin and bind to Ctrl+d because that's what I knew. When I learned macros and s/old/new it became irrelevant.You seem to already know a lot of the possibilities that you can learn, I didn't and discoverability in vim isn't great. So I just forced myself to search for whatever I didn't know how to achieve and many times ended up learning something extremely powerful.Today I have all sorts of useful little functions, <leader>m is make, or gcc if no Makefile exists. And now I've extended it to generate mermaid charts in markdown files and open them in my imageviewer and so on.That's the true power of vim to me, adding standard tools from the system in keybindings and just getting it to do things MY WAY, not how I was taught it should work.

They're replacing an EXTENSION, so it has basically nothing to do with VSCode itself. If they developed an ""IntelliCode for Vim"" plugin, they would also replace ""IntelliCode for Vim"" with Copilot.

In hindsight it's obvious why: it was the only free editor that has a product mindset and a product team behind. Microsoft put heavy hitters on it, some of their best engineers, treated it as some companies treat their core products.Other IDEs/editors are mostly open source with no real direction and resources, or are proprietary expensive software.It's unfortunate but to compete with VS Code you need a lot.

without going into the actual qualities of the editor, they simply lack extension support, for now.In the embedded space, many manufacturers have switched - or are switching - to a suite of VSCode plugins and gradually discontinued the previous tools. Which is great on one hand: they don't have to keep supporting heavily modified IDEs from 10 or 20 years ago and they can better integrate with the rest of the ecosystem of plugins, scripts automation and such. LSP has been a good thing.The problem is that you are now at the mercy of microsoft not fucking up with the environment at every other release. To put it simply, we are screwed.

For GUI, Zed is also really nice, has a great Vim mode, and auto-installs anything you might need. It loses a couple of points to VS Code on account of not being arbitrarily extensible, although that can also be seen as a plus, as it prevents extensions from randomly slowing everything down.

In fact, the intent here is exactly the opposite of what you're hoping for (less AI badgering). They're trying to get people to actually use Copilot after recently missing internal adoption goals on all the AI products they're trying to shove down people's throats. The badgering is only going to get worse, and they're going to continue removing functioning, free features to do so. You should not be glad that Microsoft is killing a free lightweight product for a bloated, ecologically harmful and economically wasteful one.

IntelliCode has 60M downloads and is the 11th most downloaded extension for all of VS Code. Also consider that there's 6 official Python-related extensions above it that could all be rolled into one, and Copilot just above it which (to my knowledge) is installed by default in newer versions of VS Code.Just because it doesn't affect you personally doesn't mean it affects no one.

Data center REITs were not meme stocks and there was every reason for them to respond to economic gravity. There was a lot of inflow of capital during ZIRP leading to a lot of buildout, but with the end of ZIRP the low return on capital in their business was going to kill them.

The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. Hype Correction is the antidote.

Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It's one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can't help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there's good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That's the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it's time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package's intro essay, “You can't help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what's left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?” 

Elsewhere in the package, James O'Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever. 

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let's remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don't know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn't going anywhere. We shouldn't be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven't come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we're at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations. 

Let's all catch our breath, shall we?

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The rise of GPS vulnerability is putting more resilient, atom-based navigational tools on the map.

In late September, a Spanish military plane carrying the country's defense minister to a base in Lithuania was reportedly the subject of a kind of attack—not by a rocket or anti-aircraft rounds, but by radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system. 

The flight landed safely, but it was one of thousands that have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of GPS interference since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it's somewhere else. 

US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data. 

But another approach that's emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment. 

Tracking changes

Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it's difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK's Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation & Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour. 

“If you're guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you're in an airliner, that's definitely not good enough.” 

A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.

Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle's bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it's traveled. Infleqtion's sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they're measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret. 

Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.

Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine. 

“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips. 

Magnetic fields

Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle. 

Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond's location, making it possible to infer where it's situated on the globe. 

Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth's magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location. 

The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.” 

Delicate systems

Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors' functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there's 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.” 

After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane's location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring. 

In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its ""software-ruggedized"" mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer. 

“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”

Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year. 

Sensor fusion

Even as quantum navigation emerges as a legitimate alternative to satellite-based navigation, the satellites themselves are improving. Modern GPS III satellites include new civilian signals called L1C and L5, which should be more accurate and harder to jam and spoof than current signals. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade. 

US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. The latter will start to become available when the GPS IIIF generation of satellites is in orbit, with the first scheduled to go up in 2027. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson says new GPS satellites with M-code are eight times as powerful as previous ones, while the GPS IIIF model will be 60 times as strong.

Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX's internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,” says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. “They can get a good position in just a few minutes. So that is a huge leap.”

Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says. 

The navigation resources that a vehicle draws on will change according to its environment—whether it's an airliner, a submarine, or an autonomous car in an urban canyon. But quantum navigation will be one important resource. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it's stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

When Fallout hit Prime Video last spring, not even Amazon itself might have expected the rip-roaring response to the show's spin on the beloved video game RPG series (although the signs were there that the streamer knew it was onto something). It's no surprise then that, having found Fallout a hit, the show is leaning on an iterative, rather than evolutionary, arc for its sophomore season. But while that overall means that more Fallout is a good thing—especially in the interesting ways it builds upon what made season one work in the first place—it also means that, quite like its oft-quoted line about war, the show itself never really changes.

In many ways, across the six episodes of Fallout season two that Amazon provided for review (out of eight total), the show is in a state of second verse, same as the first. The show still follows the separate-yet-intermingled stories of three wasteland inhabitants—Ella Purnell as Lucy, a vault dweller learning the lay of the post-apocalyptic land; Walton Goggins as the Ghoul/Cooper Howard, an irradiated undead wanderer on the hunt for revenge; and Aaron Moten as Maximus, a member of the heavily armored Brotherhood of Steel realizing the faction he's given much of his life to is on the verge of moral and perhaps literal collapse—as they march from one place to another on their merry quests.

The show still strikes a balance between an irreverent, hyper-violence-fueled jokey tone, pairing buckets of gore with '50s-nostalgia music cues, with a smarter, deeper emotionality that has its key players reflect on the nature of violence and capital in a world destroyed by both. The show still, for the most part, methodically lays out a breadcrumb of mystery for its players in the “present” of the late 2200s, tied through flashbacks to the past of the pre-war 2070s. If you liked how Fallout season one approached the worldview and general approach to the legacy of the games—even as it occasionally controversially strayed from established game lore—then you will continue to like season two, as it keeps doing the same kinds of things in a slowly evolving context.

That's not to necessarily diminish what Fallout continues to succeed at, however. With the broader mystery of the origins of the apocalypse already laid out on the table, season two roots itself in exploring not so much the structural hows and whys of it all but the personal drama that paved the way to that apocalypse in the first place—and how those same kinds of conflicts have continued to emerge on macro and micro scales in the distant present. Lucy's arc, now that she knows about her father Hank's (the returning Kyle MacLachlan) part in not just the underground vaults' creation but also his part in Vault-Tec's sinister plans to rule the wasteland, is less about trying to find him and more about how she is beginning to grapple with the ways the wasteland and its penchant for violent solutions have changed her, and what her sense of justice will mean by the time she comes face-to-face with her father.

The Ghoul's arc, meanwhile—largely more intersected with Lucy's as the duo more willingly work together to find Hank—turns further inward. The series' arching flashbacks to his life as Cooper Howard exist less to add context to that seasonal mystery and more to flesh out who the Ghoul is as a person and how a man like Howard could become the cold, driven bounty hunter in the first place. It means Goggins' role this season is less the terrifying anti-hero and more a sympathetically driven man, but it's equally compelling a role, if not arguably more, given the ways it gets to feed into and parallel Lucy's arc about the nature of violence as they spend more screentime together.

Maximus, while distinctly the most separate of the three primary storylines, still builds on his role in season one, his higher place in the Brotherhood—after inadvertently taking claim for the Brotherhood's victory against the New California Republic in season one's climax—only complicating his own personal need to survive and try and do the right thing, even as he continues to make spectacularly messy decisions to get there. Of the main trio, Maximus' story suffers the most simply because he doesn't have Lucy to bounce off of anymore, but it still manages to smartly tie in to Fallout‘s broader musings on power, justice, and violence—musings that now individually shape and drive these characters as people, instead of necessarily just informing the broader context of the world around them as it did in season one. If Fallout‘s debut was about setting up the lay of the land, then season two is all about diving deeper into how this world has impacted upon our “heroes,” for want of a better word.

In lieu of the Ghoul himself filling in for more of an antagonistic role this time round, Fallout season two finds some more explicit villains to shape itself around, although rather indirectly. Returning, of course, is Hank MacLean, his allegiance to Vault-Tec in the past and present now out in the open, but he largely exists in season two as a looming specter, a distant point for Lucy and the Ghoul to eventually reach, rather than an active participant. Similarly distant, but arguably much more influential to the show's broader themes, is Justin Theroux's Robert House, an infamous figure from the beloved Fallout: New Vegas.

While New Vegas fans may bristle at some elements of the city and its sinister overlord's transition from game to TV not aligning with what was established in the former, House is a fascinating and deeply personal foil for the show to play off of, even if his presence is largely kept to allusions and flashback appearances. More so than Hank or any other force in the show's narrative, House's persona embodies every ugly thing Fallout has to say about capital, control, and power, and the consequences of those driving factors within him ripple out and touch almost every corner of the show's narratives, no matter how disconnected they appear to be in the here and now. It says a lot that House has relatively little screentime and yet compellingly dominates Fallout‘s narrative this season, if not directly, then by what he represents in the show's thematic core.

But while Fallout does find plenty to chew on as it explores most of its cast more deeply this season, it often takes its time doing so to a degree that almost threatens to stretch its pacing a little too laboriously. It doesn't help that, although it's being positioned this season as a weekly release compared to the binge format of season one, season two doesn't feel like it's been made with that kind of rollout in mind, with each individual episode struggling to stand alone even as they fit into a broader, stronger narrative picture. The jury's out on whether or not audiences will react better or worse to not simply being able to keep watching, but even being able to access a majority of the season for the review, Fallout feels more methodical this time around compared to before, and that occasionally leads to a distinctly lacking sense of momentum that may frustrate viewers checking in every week.

Thankfully, that issue isn't fatal. Fallout is a show confident in itself, just as it was when it first stepped out of the vaults last year—and while that means its formula hasn't really changed too dramatically for season two, minor faults and all, it means the show now knows it can dive a little deeper into its characters and world, marinate in the ideas it's playing with a little more, and turn out a show that, while familiar to us now, is as strong and interesting as ever.

Fallout season two begins streaming on Prime Video later today, December 16, at 9 p.m. ET, before rolling out weekly on the streamer.

As I've established previously, AI is coming for your wireless earbuds, whether you like it or not, and that trend may extend to AirPods. According to leaked code from an iPhone prototype running an early build of iOS 26, AirPods might get a hefty dose of Apple Intelligence as soon as spring 2026.

Per MacRumors, among those incoming features is Visual Look Up, which is an existing Apple Intelligence feature that surfaces information on things you point your camera at or photos on your phone. That feature has traditionally worked in Safari and the Photos/Camera app and functions similarly to other computer vision-based lookup features seen in Pixel phones, as well as AI gadgets like Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Does this just mean AirPods will integrate better with Visual Look Up on your iPhone? Or is there a more pivotal (camera-based) AirPods upgrade at play here, too?

See AirPods Pro 3 at Amazon

There is also a reference to Contextual Reminders, according to MacRumors, which is another Apple Intelligence feature that uses AI to surface reminders based on stuff like location data. Theoretically, you could use this feature to set reminders like “remind me to get milk when I'm at the store” or “remind me to drink water when I'm at the gym,” but hopefully you don't need your phone to do the second one.

Maybe the most mysterious AI feature reference in MacRumors' findings is “ConversationBreakthroughVQA,” which may reference Intelligent Breakthrough, an Apple Intelligence feature that uses AI to determine when to break the parameters of your Focus modes or Do Not Disturb to deliver important notifications. I'm not 100% sure on this one, though, since it doesn't actually reference “Intelligent Breakthrough” word for word. Maybe it's a similar feature that decides when to interrupt you with notification readouts while translating or listening to music? Maybe it's just Intelligent Breakthrough by a different internal name?

One thing that piques my interest is the fact that it features “VQA” at the end, which could be a reference to “visual question answering,” a technical way of describing computer vision that answers questions about your environment. Speaking of “visual,” two of the three features are also setting off alarm bells with the context of rumors that Apple is considering including cameras in future versions of its AirPods. Needless to say, both Visual Look Up and Conversation Breakthrough with “VQA” slapped on the end evoke computer vision and the cameras it requires. Maybe those camera pods really are around the corner?

It's not all AI in the code reviewed by MacRumors. There's also a reference to “precise outdoor location understanding,” which feels like a reference to some kind of AirTags-level location finding. While certain models of AirPods (AirPods Pro 2 and above, as well as AirPods Max) have precision finding, the range is currently limited. About 30 to 60 feet if you have AirPods Pro 2, and 200 feet if you have AirPods Pro 3 with Apple's U2 Ultra Wideband chip. That chip, for reference, is in the charging case, not the earbuds. It's hard to say if Apple plans on extending that range or if it just found a way to make the tracking more precise within that range, but it's hard to argue in either case since both could save your ass.

Obviously, code references aren't much to go off, so a lot of this is still speculation, but if those bits of code are right, we won't have to wait very long to find out for sure what new features Apple has in store for AirPods.

CEOs at the world's biggest companies are preparing to dump even more money into AI next year, despite mounting evidence that their existing investments aren't actually paying off.

The Wall Street Journal reported today that 68% of chief executives plan to increase AI spending in 2026, citing an annual survey of more than 350 public-company CEOs conducted by advisory firm Teneo. Bewilderingly, those same executives admitted that fewer than half of their current AI projects have generated returns that exceeded their initial costs. The survey focused on CEOs at public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue and was conducted this fall.

The survey's findings arrive as fears of an AI bubble continue to rise. AI investments now account for roughly 40% of U.S. GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for about 80% of gains in the American stock market. Despite the U.S. economy becoming more dependent on AI, there is surprisingly little to show for it as of now, even in small ways at non-AI corporations.

Wall Street analysts have increasingly noted the circular nature of major AI investments. For example, Nvidia announced this year that it is investing $100 million in OpenAI, which then turns around and buys Nvidia chips for data centers it has planned with Oracle. Making things worse, those data centers have been slow to materialize. Reports that Oracle is delaying some of its data center projects have only heightened Wall Street's anxiety, as they push any tangible payoffs further into the future. Meanwhile, AI companies continue to promise that more advanced models will unlock significant productivity gains, spark innovation, and maybe even help cure diseases.

Non-AI companies have already started putting the tech to the test, rolling out AI tools across various departments including customer service, IT, marketing, and human resources. But there's still little evidence that even in those spaces AI tools are transforming operations or even meaningfully improving bottom lines.

Today's survey echoes a report released by MIT in August. Despite the major push to adopt AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs have produced real revenue gains, the report found. The MIT analysis drew from  150 executive interviews, a survey of 350 employees, and a review of 300 public AI deployments.

“Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable [profit and loss] impact,” the report said. Meaning that “95 per cent of organizations are getting zero return.”

The findings briefly rattled investors and sent AI stocks sliding at the time.

And yet, CEOs still appear convinced that AI will eventually justify the spending spree. According to Teneo's survey, 84% of leaders at companies with more than $10 billion in annual revenue believe it will take longer than six months for AI investments to start paying off.

The animated adaptation of The Mighty Nein is based on the Critical Role campaign played via Dungeons & Dragons. Like Vox Machina, there are a lot of D&D-isms implemented throughout each episode, and this week's features the most important of all: shopping.

io9's got an exclusive clip of tomorrow's episode, “Belonging.” With the Nein back in Zadash, Caleb (Liam O'Brien) finds himself in need of some spell components, which takes him to the Invulnerable Vagrant, a magic shop that's got everything he needs. It's also owned by Pumat Sol, a firbolg who runs it with the help of his three simulacra handling the front work while Pumat Prime takes care of everything in the back. And like in the campaign, all four Pumats are voiced by Matthew Mercer.

Pumat's a fan-favorite character owing to his kind disposition and the imagined (and now real) sight gag of three of the same guy finishing each other's sentences, working around the shop, and people reacting to seeing that for the first time. Think of him as the Nein's equivalent to Gilmore from Vox Machina: he pops up throughout the campaign whenever the Mighty Nein end up back in Zadash, and he's a hoot each time, so expect to see him again whenever they eventually come back into town.

If that wasn't enough, we've also got a behind-the-scenes look at how Pumat's introduction was brought to life. Check it out below!

The penultimate episode of The Mighty Nein lands on Prime Video overnight, followed by the season finale next week.

The last time Apple made a “small” iPhone—the iPhone 13 mini—it flopped. The message was clear: people want big phones because they have large screens and huge batteries that last longer. However, a new leak claims Apple's first foldable iPhone, currently rumored to launch in fall 2026, could be both the company's smallest iPhone since the iPhone mini and its largest ever.

From leaker Digital Chat Station, which MacRumors reminds everybody has accurately leaked many details on iPhones going back to the iPhone 12, is the bold claim that the foldable iPhone—based on a current engineering prototype—will have a 5.25-inch (diagonal) external screen.

See iPhones at Best Buy

See iPhones at Apple.com

This nugget is notable not only because the external screen would be smaller than the iPhone 13 mini's 5.4-inch display when the foldable iPhone is closed, but also because it'd be the smallest one on a book-style foldable since the original Samsung Galaxy Fold, which had a 4.6-inch external display sandwiched by super thick top and bottom bezels. A quick search reminded me that Google's first-gen Pixel Fold had a 5.8-inch exterior screen and the Oppo Find N had an even smaller 5.49-inch display when folded up.

I don't know about you, but I'd greatly welcome a phone that I could use with one hand again. The upside to a book-style foldable is that you also get a larger, tablet-sized device when it's unfolded. In that regard, Digital Chat Station claims the flexible interior display is around 7.58 inches (diagonal). That, too, would be smaller than the 8-inch folding screens on Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

My only concern is whether the foldable iPhone will be thin enough. The iPhone Air is proof Apple can make a skinny phone, but if the foldable is thicker than two Airs, then it takes away from the compactness, which is an important consideration when it comes to foldables. The Z Fold 7 feels so good because it's both thin and light.

In the same leak, Digital Chat Station also shared details about the foldable iPhone's cameras, which might have a mix of different camera designs. The rear camera system is said to have twin 48-megapixel sensors (my guess is a main and an ultrawide, but who knows, it could be a telephoto). The external screen is said to have a hole-punch camera (maybe a Dynamic Island?) and the interior folding screen might have a “UPC” or under-panel camera, which would appear “invisible” when the camera app is not open. Samsung used a UPC camera in the Z Fold 3, Fold 4, and Fold 5. It switched to a hole-punch camera starting with the Z Fold 6 because the UPC resolution was only four megapixels, which made selfies look like trash. The leak aligns with a previous report that said there would be four cameras on Apple's first foldable.

The foldable iPhone will reportedly use Touch ID instead of Face ID (also previously reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman), presumably because there's not enough space to fit in the TrueDepth camera system, which includes a dot projector, an infrared camera, and an infrared flood illuminator to securely recognize a face in 3D.

Outside of design compromises, the biggest deciding factor will be how much Apple will price the foldable iPhone at. Everybody is estimating at least $2,000, which is what the Z Fold 7 starts at. Apple, being Apple, would likely charge more just because the device has the iPhone name.

Kingston Datacenter SSD Business Manager Cameron Crandall said in an interview that NAND prices for RAM and SSD are expected to rise throughout 2026. The Kingston employee said on The Full Nerd Network podcast that NAND prices increased by 246% from 1Q25, 70% of that happening in just the last 60 days. And with this component making up 90% of the bill of materials for an SSD, the company will have to adjust its pricing accordingly.

When asked how consumers could cope with the ongoing shortage and price hikes, Crandall said, “I think the best thing to do if you're looking at upgrading your system is to do it now and not wait because prices are going to continue to go up.” He also added, “My advice today would be to not hold off on that purchase because it will be more expensive 30 days from now, and more likely it will be more expensive 30 days after that.” Crandall also stated that prices are increasing ""like we've never seen"" in 29 years of working at Kingston.

This contradicts Sapphire's prediction that DRAM prices will stabilize within the next six to eight months, although Crandall says that the memory market has a pricing cycle and that we are in an upswing at the moment. It's likely because of this that memory companies are holding back on expanding their production lines or building new fabs. After all, there is still the threat of the AI bubble that could leave chipmakers holding expensive NAND inventory with zero demand if it bursts.

Another question tackled during the episode is whether Kingston will follow in the footsteps of Micron and exit the consumer business. Thankfully, Crandall confirmed that Kingston is focused on the distribution channel and that the company, alongside other SSD and RAM suppliers, will take up the slack from the shutdown of Crucial.

In the end, Crandall hopes that the shortage doesn't drag on too long. Although he does not believe that this pricing apocalypse would last a decade, as some suggest, he still says that pricing is not headed down anytime soon. So, if you're on the market for memory or storage, he recommends that you get what you can right now.

Arctic has a well-earned reputation for its thermal pastes, with its MX-6 being one of the best thermal pastes on the market. The company has introduced the MX-7 to stay ahead of the competition. It claims the MX-7 is the company's coolest thermal paste to date, with prices ranging from $6-10.

Having launched three years ago, the MX-6 still feels quite new, but in a competitive market where new products come out every year, staying relevant is key. The MX-7 features a new formula that Arctic understandably keeps under wraps. Still, the company shares that the MX-7 boasts low adhesion for even distribution, high viscosity for flow resistance, and high cohesion for more durable bonding.

Arctic takes a different approach from other thermal paste brands by not emphasizing thermal conductivity values for its products. As detailed in the specification sheet, the MX-7 is up to 22% less viscous than the MX-6 and approximately 12% denser than its predecessor. In Arctic's own testing, using a Core Ultra 9 285K at 4.5 GHz and drawing around 284W in an ambient temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the MX-7 managed to deliver temperatures about 3% cooler than the MX-6 and up to 6% cooler than the MX-4.

Rest assured, the thermal paste is completely safe to use with direct-die cooling solutions because it's not electrically conductive or capacitive. This means you don't need to worry about any risk of short circuits or discharges that could damage your devices.

While the MX-7 is less thick than the MX-6, it still has a nice, viscous consistency. Arctic suggests avoiding spreading the paste with a spatula. Instead, applying it in a simple cross pattern is best, and let your CPU cooler do the magic. The pressure from the cooler will evenly spread the MX-7, filling in any gaps and giving you complete coverage. This helpful tip also works well for coolers with direct-touch heat pipes.

Since the MX-7 is non-capacitive and non-conductive, it's simple to wipe away excess or old applications with ease. Arctic also offers a separate MX Cleaner wipe that's perfect for cleaning thermal paste. Plus, these wipes can be purchased together as an MX-7 bundle for added convenience.

You can easily find the MX-7 for sale on Amazon. The latest thermal paste isn't much pricier than the previous version. To give you an idea, the 2-gram and 8-gram syringes cost just about $1.40 more, while the other MX-7 options are less than $0.50 more expensive than their older versions.

With so many Arctic knockoffs out there, it's a good idea to buy your MX-7 from trusted retailers. Arctic has also improved its MX Authenticity Check system, allowing you to easily verify your product's authenticity using a unique QR code for each item. This helps ensure you get the real deal and have peace of mind with your purchase.

The AI race has got senators concerned about rising power costs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Three U.S. Senators — Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. — are looking at how AI data center operations across the country are impacting the cost of electricity for the average American consumer. According to The New York Times, the legislators sent letters to seven tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, CoreWeave, Digital Realty, and Equinix, saying that the massive power demands of the AI data centers they're building have forced utility companies to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their systems.

“We write in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. data centers' energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities,” the letter said. It also mentioned that “Utility companies have spent billions of dollars updating the electrical grid to accommodate the unprecedented energy demands of A.I. data centers and appear to recoup the costs by raising residential utility bills.”

Many big tech companies are investing in energy infrastructure to support their growth. But because most of the contracts between them and energy providers, it's difficult for the public to ascertain whether the recent price hikes were caused by the infrastructure build-out for AI data centers or by the utility companies' own upgrade programs. After all, aside from needing to build additional power lines, substations, and power plants to support all these new data centers, they also need to replace older facilities and harden equipment in the face of threats caused by changing conditions, like wildfires.

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory actually discovered that the AI boom probably lowered electricity rates by shouldering some of the upgrade costs necessary for their operations. However, the trend of increasing electricity rates suggests otherwise, with the average household paying 7% more in electricity bills as of September 2025, compared to just a year before.

Electricity is the bottleneck that the AI industry is currently facing, especially as the U.S. aims to outpace China in the development of this technology. The East Asian country recognizes the importance of power generation in this race, with some experts warning that it's already miles ahead, as the U.S.'s lack of supply and infrastructure is setting it back in its long-term AI plan. It has even gotten to the point that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented that “China is going to win the AI race” because of issues with electricity in the U.S.

Spotting this deal gave me some serious deja vu, as one of my PCs looks very similar and also features some of the same components. I have a gaming rig with a 9800X3D and the same Phanteks NV5S Black case - a gorgeous and amazing value case with superb airflow, a built-in GPU bracket, and a PSU shroud. This CyberPower PC offering available at Newegg is only $1739.99, which is a pretty good value for a prebuilt gaming PC that not only packs the king of gaming CPUs - the AMD Ryzen 9800X3D, but also sports the top-end AMD GPU, the Radeon RX 9070 XT. That makes for one potent gaming PC.

The components list for this CyberPower PC (model-GM 70929) includes the aforementioned Phanteks NV5S Black case, AMD Ryzen 9800X3D processor, Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 2TB SSD, B850 motherboard, AIO liquid cooling, and a 1000W power supply.

This is a great combination of hardware specs for a gaming PC that will blast through any game title you throw at it. The 9800X3D dominates at 1080p gaming, and the included Radeon RX 9070 XT is comparable to the RTX 5070 Ti from Nvidia. Faster on rasterisation, but falling behind on ray-tracing and MFG implementation, but if those last two don't concern you, then it's an absolute beast of a GPU.

This CyberPower gaming PC model (GM 70929) packs the king of gaming CPUs, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, and also AMD's top-tier GPU offering, the Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card. This is quite the potent gaming setup, and it also includes 32GB of DDR5 memory and a 2TB SSD for storage. 

If you've had a chance to take a look at the best gaming CPUs list, you will have noticed that AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D tops the charts. AMD's 3D V-Cache has allowed it to climb to the top of the benchmark leaderboards; the single CCD Ryzen 7 9800X3D still edges ahead of the pack, including its stablemates.

It's the fastest gaming CPU by a considerable margin, especially at 1080p, where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D outpaces the likes of Intel's Core i9-14900K by a massive 30% margin in games. Even offering a solid generational improvement over its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is nearly 15% faster.

The risk assessment for term preeclampsia at 36 weeks of gestation and scheduled early-term birth for high-risk women reduced the incidence of subsequent preeclampsia by 30%, without increasing caesarean births or neonatal care unit admissions.

""This is the first trial to show that a personalised approach to near-term preeclampsia risk assessment can reduce the incidence of disease in the maternity population,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by James Goadsby, MD, and Argyro Syngelaki, PhD, Fetal Medicine Research Institute, King's College Hospital, London, England. It was published online on December 04, 2025, in The Lancet.

The trial was conducted at two maternity hospitals in the UK where a 36-week birth-plan scan is part of usual care, thus limiting generalisability. The angiogenic markers used for the risk assessment are not widely available in all clinical settings. This study was restricted to singleton pregnancies; hence, the findings cannot be applied to women with multifoetal pregnancies approaching term gestation.

This study was supported by a grant from the Fetal Medicine Foundation. The authors declared having no competing interests.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

The FDA has approved trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd; Enhertu, Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca) in combination with pertuzumab for the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test.

The agency also gave the nod to two companion tests — Roche's PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody and VENTANA HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail in situ hybridization assay — to identify patients eligible for treatment.

T-DXd, an anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate, was previously approved for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in the second line, after at least one anti-HER2 regimen.

Approval for the first-line indication was based on the DESTINY-Breast09 (DB09) trial, which randomly assigned 1157 patients equally to either T-DXd plus pertuzumab, T-DXd alone, or standard-of-care treatment with taxane chemotherapy plus the HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP).

In an interim analysis, median progression-free survival was 40.7 months in the T-DXd/pertuzumab arm vs 26.9 months with THP (hazard ratio, 0.56). Overall survival data were immature at the time of the analysis. The T-DXd monotherapy arm remains blinded.

Given the strength of the results, breast oncologists have anticipated the approval — and that T-DXd/pertuzumab will likely replace THP as the new standard of care — since the trial was presented in June at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine in October.

As with THP, however, there will probably still be a role for maintenance therapy after initial treatment with T-DXd, breast medical oncologist Erika Hamilton, MD, told Medscape Medical News recently at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.

Currently, after upfront treatment with THP, patients enter a maintenance phase with trastuzumab and pertuzumab alone to avoid adverse events with ongoing, long-term chemotherapy.

The chemotherapy payload of T-DXd presents a similar dilemma, said Hamilton, of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee. 

In the DB09 trial, grade 3 or higher adverse events with T-DXd/pertuzumab included neutropenia (23.9%), hypokalemia (10.2%), anemia (8.4%), fatigue (7.9%), thrombocytopenia (6.3%), and diarrhea, among others. Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in 12.1% of patients in the combination arm.

The prescribing information includes warnings and precautions for neutropenia and left ventricular dysfunction, the FDA said.

Hamilton also noted that the way T-DXd is delivered — an intravenous (IV) infusion with close monitoring — makes long-term treatment problematic.

“I don't think that there's going to be an appetite to continue trastuzumab- deruxtecan indefinitely for patients,” she said. “I think that even if people are using DB09, there's still going to be a desire for a maintenance strategy.”

The recommended T-DXd dose for cycle 1, day 1 is 5.4 mg/kg, followed by pertuzumab 840 mg. For subsequent cycles, the recommended T-DXd dose is 5.4 mg/kg, followed by pertuzumab 420 mg by IV infusion every 3 weeks.

 December 16, 2025  

Female participation in sport has been on the rise in Canada, and with it, concerns about injury. One of the greatest challenges has been that research on female athletes is sorely lacking, leaving millions of women and girls, coaches, parents, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers to rely on data and practice recommendations geared toward men and boys.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s FAIR consensus statement, which was released at the beginning of December, aims to change this situation by providing best practices and policy and strategies.

It contains 56 recommendations that were informed by five systematic reviews and one scoping review. The latter synthesized evidence from more than 600 papers with more than 600,000 participants. The statement also relies on a concept-mapping project with 66 participants. It calls for the involvement of all sport stakeholders (eg, coaches, industry, parents, and athletes) to reduce female athletes' risk for injury.

“The impetus was related to the lack of research focused on women and girls, the lack of recommendations that were female-specific, and the need to bring together the evidence to support female athletes globally for injury prevention,” FAIR co-author Carolyn Emery, PhD, professor of kinesiology at the Cumming School of Medicine and chair of the Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre, both at the University of Calgary in Calgary, told Medscape News Canada.

“We have increased participation rates for women and girls globally (we see that with the professionalization of many sports for women), and injury and concussion rates are reportedly high, even higher than for their male counterparts,” said Emery. “For example, we have some of the highest rates of concussion and injury in girls' rugby compared with any other reported rates across all levels of play.”

The main objective of the recommendations was to focus on primary injury prevention, Emery explained. Strategies include the use of personal protective equipment (such as mouthguards, helmets, neck guards, and face shields in collision sports) and neuromuscular training (NMT). Warm-up using NMT focuses on strength, balance, and movement control. The statement recommends NMT for 10 minutes twice per week to prevent first-time injuries.

The evidence for NMT is strong. In one of the five systematic reviews or meta-analyses conducted for the statement, pooled data from six studies in 4799 females demonstrated with moderate-certainty evidence that NMT was associated with a 39% reduction in ankle strains. It found high-certainty evidence that NMT was associated with a significant 61% reduction in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries (n = 6492 females).

Solid research in NMT is only beginning to emerge, said Connie Klassen, a certified athletic therapist, director of prevention and wellness at Hockey Canada, and head athletic therapist for Ringette Canada in Calgary. Klassen emphasized that NMT, balance coordination, and strength and conditioning need to be age- and body development-appropriate to reflect how children develop. This principle is true even when the athlete enters her early twenties.

“We should be thinking about things like load modification when we are considering sports specialization at an early age and through rapid periods of growth and development,” she said.

The time spent in weekly competition (ie, absolute load), bone stress, and neck injuries are potentially modifiable risk factors that might have protected former international rugby player Kathryn Dane, PhD, a physiotherapist and postdoctoral fellow at the Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre. Dane started playing rugby on an all-boys team in County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland at the age of 8 years. Later, she played for numerous professional women's rugby teams and eventually joined the Barbarians, a British-based invitational rugby club.

“I finished my career there off the back of my second ACL reconstruction surgery,” said Dane. “I'd also had a brain hemorrhage in the middle of my rugby-playing career.”

Dane said that NMT was not entirely missing during her time playing professionally; a lot of time during practice was spent on warm-ups and speed mechanics to prevent lower limb injuries such as hamstring strains.

“It wasn't until the very end of my career that things like neck strengthening and neck stabilization to help build up the neck musculature [to prevent concussions] were included. If something like that had been introduced to me back when I was 8 years old playing with the boys, or even age 12 onward, it would have prevented some of those concussions I had in my career,” said Dane.

An important question raised by the recommendations is how the underrepresentation of females in research correlates not only with injury rates but also with policies that ideally create and foster positive environments.

“We need to build safe spaces for females in sport and exercise, not just from a physical perspective but also from a psychological perspective,” said Kimberly Coros, MD, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician at Sinai Health in Toronto, sport and exercise medicine physician at the Canadian Sport Institute Ontario, and president of the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine.

Coros, whose patients are mostly female, said that she mostly sees adolescent girls in high-performance sports. Their presentations range from concussions and ACL injuries to hypermobility and stress-related bone injuries. Some of her patients have energy deficiencies resulting from factors such as disordered eating. Moreover, a significant proportion of her patients report sexual assault and unwanted attention, which cause many adolescent females to drop out of sports.

“It's not just aesthetic sports like gymnastics, where there's a subjective component to judging. I find that it's more socially acceptable for predominantly male coaches to comment on their bodies. For example, they're looking ‘too muscular,' or there's a weight target, which we know doesn't play out from an evidence-based perspective,” she said.

Research on how gender might affect performance and injury is lacking. “When we look at recovery from injuries, we have to look at things like changes within different systems. How do hormones impact injuries and recovery? Have we looked at the recovery rates of men versus women? During recovery, are women in their menstrual cycle?” asked Klassen. “What role do anatomical differences play, especially related to ACL injuries in sports like basketball? We know that women's basketball tends to see more knee injuries, and men's basketball tends to see more ankle injuries,” said Coros.

“There's so much that we don't know; it's a sort of biopsychosocial model where we don't know how much biology, socialization, and gender roles play into the sport,” she added.

If anything, the FAIR recommendations have highlighted an unmet need in healthcare research overall: the lack of female-specific studies. “Research is only as good as the subject area and population being studied,” said Klassen. “We need to be better informed in these areas. At Hockey Canada, we've just embarked on conversations with women in our sports division on research opportunities,” she said.

The University of Calgary is also forging a path through its work in the community. Efforts at the elite level affect public health by “keeping kids playing sports they love, not only reducing injury rates and costs of injury, but also the consequences of injury, like posttraumatic osteoarthritis following ACL injury,” said Emery.

“The strength of our work is a tight connection with elementary, junior, and senior high schools, parents and coaches, referees, people who make decisions in sport, as well as youth. We really need the youth voice to be the center of this,” she said.

“The best injury is the one that never happens.”

The FAIR consensus was funded by the IOC. Emery, Dane, and Coros reported having no relevant financial relationships. Klassen reported being employed by Hockey Canada and being a contractor for Ringette Canada.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved depemokimab (Exdensur, GSK plc) as add-on therapy for severe asthma and for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), introducing the first twice-yearly biologic option for these indications in the UK.

Depemokimab is approved as a 6-monthly subcutaneous injection. It is indicated for adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older with severe asthma, and for adults with CRSwNP whose symptoms remain inadequately controlled despite standard care and, where applicable, surgery. 

Asthma inflames and narrows lung airways, making breathing difficult. Severe chronic rhinosinusitis causes inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses with symptoms persisting for more than 12 weeks, often leading to nasal polyps.

Julian Beach, interim executive director of healthcare quality and access at the MHRA, noted that these conditions affect a significant number of people across the UK and can be difficult to manage despite existing treatments. 

Depemokimab blocks interleukin (IL)-5, a key mediator of type 2 inflammation that drives eosinophilic disease in both asthma and CRSwNP. By reducing IL‑5 activity, the drug helps lower eosinophilic inflammation linked to airway narrowing and persistent sinonasal inflammation and polyp growth. 

The approved regimen is 100 mg administered subcutaneously every 26 weeks as add‑on treatment to existing therapy.

The ANCHOR-1 and ANCHOR-2 phase 3 trials evaluated depemokimab in 528 patients with inadequately controlled CRSwNP. Participants had previous surgery or prior treatment with, or intolerance to, systemic corticosteroids. 

Patients received either depemokimab (100 mg subcutaneously) or placebo every 26 weeks (with standard of care). 

Depemokimab significantly reduced total nasal polyps scores and mean nasal obstruction scores vs placebo. The treatment difference for total nasal polyp score was -0.7 in ANCHOR-1 and -0.6 in ANCHOR-2. For nasal obstruction, treatment differences were -0.23 and -0.25, respectively. 

Adverse event rates were similar between the depemokimab and placebo groups.

In severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype, the SWIFT-1 and SWIFT-2 phase 3 trials enrolled 762 patients with high eosinophil counts and a history of exacerbations despite medium- or high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids. Patients received either subcutaneous depemokimab 100 mg or placebo at weeks 0 and 26, plus standard care.

Annualised exacerbation rates were reduced to 0.46 in SWIFT-1 and 0.56 in SWIFT-2 with depemokimab, compared with 1.11 and 1.08, respectively, with placebo.

The most common side effects, which may affect more than 1 in 10 people, include itchy skin, headache, tiredness, and injection-site reactions.

A full list of side effects will be published in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflets on the MHRA website within 7 days of approval.

The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) was associated with a modest increase in the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), without a clear overall dose-response relationship. Programmed frozen cycles showed a stronger association with CVD and a clear dose-response relationship as their number increased.

""Our findings support the notion that women who have undergone ART might benefit from monitoring of their cardiovascular health,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Huong Thu Nguyen, PhD, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway. It was published online on December 03, 2025, in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

Exposure may have been misclassified because natural frozen cycles and private clinic procedures were not captured. Certain confounding factors were unaccounted for. The sample size limited analyses by subtypes of CVD.

This study received funding through a grant from the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Additional support came from the Research Council of Norway, Centre of Excellence funding scheme, Central Norway Regional Health Authorities, and British Heart Foundation. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

An EHU study reveals that the food served to children in canteens exceeds fat, protein and sodium recommendations.

The Microfluidics & BIOMICS Cluster, the Neuropsychopharmacology group and Biobizkaia have collaborated to assess school canteen meals. They concluded that the food served to the children does not fully comply with nutritional recommendations, and saw, among other things, that the food left uneaten by the children on their plates is hugely significant in terms of both nutrition and sustainability. Differences between public schools and charter schools were also detected.

A balanced diet in childhood is key to enjoying good health in the short and long term. For example, to prevent the growing obesity among children and the disorders linked to it. As many children usually have their midday meal in the school canteen, these areas offer an unprecedented opportunity for promoting healthy habits. So researchers at the University of the Basque Country (EHU) assessed the menus served to children in school canteens: ""We know that, in compliance with the legislation, school menus are carefully designed to ensure they are suitable. But one thing is what appears on paper, and another is what happens at school. We aimed to diagnose what the children are given and what they actually eat, so that if a change needs to be made, it is possible to know from which perspective the matter should be approached,"" said the researcher Naiara Martinez.

So they assessed 1,000 menus served to 11-12 year-olds at 10 schools across the province of Bizkaia (Basque Autonomous Community). One of the researchers took photos of the plates before the children ate the food, and afterwards. That enabled them to assess what food was served, consumed and rejected. As Martinez pointed out, ""knowing what the children are offered is as important as seeing what they eat and reject. Indeed, even if the menu is suitable, if they do not eat everything, the nutritional values may be undermined by the food left on their plates. And so is the sustainability of the menus. And that is, in fact, what the research has shown"".

Regarding the composition of the menus served, on the one hand, the EHU research found that the amount of protein, fat and sodium was higher than the recommended amounts, and on the other, the amount of carbohydrate and fiber was lower than in the guidelines. ""It came as no surprise. We had anticipated these results. The fact is that we are moving away from the traditional Mediterranean diet. What we saw in the canteens reflects nutrition in our society. There is too much protein on the menus, above all because there is a lot of meat; the fat is a consequence of fried food; and of course we eat a lot of salt,"" said Martinez.

The study also revealed that the food the children are served exceeds the recommended number of calories. ""So lunch needs to cover 30% of energy needs for the whole day. The dishes we assessed, by contrast, provide 40%. That might be appropriate if our children were athletes, but the reality is that the activity level of most of them is average or low,"" explained Martinez.

Nevertheless, that excess energy is balanced by what the children leave on their plates, because the researchers saw that the students do not eat everything, and when what they don't consume is subtracted, the number of calories is not that high. Paying attention to the rejected food is important for the researchers: ""In 12.2% of the menus assessed, more than a quarter is left on the plate uneaten. And in the case of vegetables and pulses, over half the consumers leave 25% uneaten. So, the nutritional values of what they actually eat are not in line with the intended ones, because they consume fewer vitamins, fiber, iron, etc.""

The EHU researchers put forward strategies for addressing this: ""For example, it was clear that children prefer puréed vegetables. When vegetables are served whole or as a garnish to accompany the main course (peas, peppers, salad, etc.), they do not eat so much. Attention needs to be paid to things like this, and taking the children's characteristics into account, results could be achieved with small changes.""

Furthermore, the research stresses that a dual aim is met if less food is rejected by the children: the children are better fed and sustainability is increased. Indeed, canteen menus also take the environmental impact into consideration. Besides measuring the food that ends up as waste in the rubbish, CO2- emissions were also measured and Martinez said there are opportunities for reducing emissions. ""Meat is one of the foods that produces the most CO2. It is also one of the main sources of protein that the children are offered. Canteen menus have too much protein in terms of nutritional values, so it would be possible to reduce the protein amounts directly. More sustainable proteins could be used, those of plant origin (pulses, among others) or those of animal origin well accepted by the children, such as eggs.""

Among the schools visited, five were public and the other five charter ones. The EHU research compared them and detected a number of differences: ""In both cases we found good models that followed the recommendations, but we saw that, on the whole, the menus in public school canteens were more in line with nutritional guidelines. By contrast, the amount of food that the schoolchildren left on their plates was lower in the charter schools. What that shows is that a balance needs to be sought; the menus need to be healthy, but they need to be more in line with the children's tastes. Indeed, even if they are nutritionally suitable, if they are not eaten up afterwards, we won't achieve anything. For example, we noticed that the food served provides the children with little fiber. An easy way of starting to change that would be to serve wholegrain rather than refined cereals. But would the children eat wholegrain rice and wholegrain pasta just the same? One of the main challenges of canteen menus is making them simultaneously healthy, tasty and sustainable. And to achieve that, many things have to be taken into consideration.""

Even if coming up with a formula to get everything right in all this is no easy task, Martinez is calling for things to be changed: ""I did a bibliographical review of this subject in my degree dissertation about ten years ago, and I found very similar data on the nutritional values of canteen menus. An effort is made to make the diets more suitable, but that is not enough. For example, school meals have improved, and more or less we have all learnt what healthy nutrition is. However, the results show that what has been done until now is not totally effective. That is why children's tastes and nutritional requirements need to be taken into account, canteen menus need to be updated and measures that will truly promote healthy eating habits need to be sought.""

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Igor Mezine, Guru Valicherla, Chris Bode, and Sid Bhoopathy.

The evaluation of reactive metabolite (RM) production is an important aspect of the modern drug development process.

Most common for producing and trapping RM in vitro are liver microsomes and/or S9 fractions.

The detection of trapped RM (TRM), which is frequently present at low levels, is facilitated in large part by using a mixture of glutathione (GSH) and stable isotope labeled (SIL)-GSH. These labels enable the automatic filtering of peaks of interest by searching for the relevant monoisotopic pattern (MIP).

Because such subcellular systems lack a comprehensive set of enzymatic machinery involved in drug metabolism, hepatocytes are frequently used instead of or in conjunction with subcellular fractions to research drug metabolism.

However, detecting low-level TRM in hepatocytes is far more difficult than in subcellular models.

To aid in the detection of TRM, the researchers studied the SILAC method employing SIL-glycine (SIL-Gly). The researchers plated human, rat, and dog hepatocytes in vendor-supplied seeding media supplemented with SIL-Gly (1 mM).

The plated hepatocytes (PH) were then treated with the model chemical, clozapine (CLZ, 30 mM) for 24 hours.

The medium was withdrawn, and the attached cells were extracted with 50 % MeCN. After centrifugation, the cell extract supernatants and medium were evaluated using liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRAMS) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos.

The collected data was then processed with Compound Discoverer (CD) and Xcalibur software.

Assessment of the data revealed the presence of numerous known CLZ GSH conjugates in medium alone, as well as the incorporation of SIL-Gly in GSH.

Interestingly, MIP ratios, defined as the proportion of A0 (SIL-GSH)/A0 (GSH), were both conjugate-specific and species-dependent, ranging from 20 % to 90 %. These results show a complicated interplay between the kinetics of model compound metabolism, SIL-Gly absorption, GSH production, and efflux.

As a result, the researchers employed CLZ as a positive control molecule to develop MIP search acceptability criteria in CD software. The new SILAC technique can be combined with CYP induction investigations to undertake further metabolite profiling and facilitate TRM detection.

Plated human and animal CYP induction-certified hepatocytes were purchased from XenoTech. CLZ and glycine-(13C2, 15N) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Thermo Fisher supplied HPLC-grade solvents.

Thermo Fisher's Accucore C18 column (1.5 µm, 150 x 2.1 mm) was used for UPLC separation using a MeCN gradient in water (constant at 0.1 % formic acid).

Figures 1 and 2 show extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) with peaks of CLZ and GSH conjugates G1-G6 in human and rat incubation samples, respectively.

Figures 3 and 4 compare observed HRAMS spectra to theoretical monoisotopic patterns of GSH and SIL-GSH conjugates G2 (human) and G3 (rat), respectively.

MIP values in human and rat incubation samples ranged consistently from 20 to 45 %. Interestingly, dogs have significantly higher MIP values, particularly in the case of G3, where MIP exceeded 100 % (Figure 5).

Advancements in HIV/AIDS research, drug development and clinical practice since the 1980s have made it possible for people living with HIV to lead long, productive lives and keep the virus in check at undetectable levels and nontransmissible as long as therapy is maintained. However, a cure - completely ridding the body of the virus - has only been documented in a handful of patients who underwent complex and high-risk bone marrow transplants for life-threatening blood cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma.

In a paper published today in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI), researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine report they may have taken an early step toward a more practical HIV cure. The researchers - in a study done largely with federal funding - focused on a patient undergoing cancer treatment and also living with HIV, who after receiving chemotherapy, had a significant reduction in the number of CD4+ T immune cells that contained an HIV provirus - a key player in HIV's ability to persist in the body. 

In a person living with HIV, proviruses - strands of HIV DNA - are typically integrated into the T cell genome and become a permanent part of the cell's genetic makeup. This integration enables the provirus to be passed on to daughter T cells when the parent cell divides - a process known as clonal expansion of HIV-infected T cells.

Over time, clonal expansion leads to an increase in the frequency of infected cells in a patient. The proviruses in daughter T cells can remain dormant or become active and begin producing new HIV particles, especially if antiretroviral therapy is stopped.

CD4+ T cells (also known as helper T cells) are immune cells that recognize antigens, the body's foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses; stimulate antibody production by another type of immune cell, the B cell; and help a third type of immune cell, the CD8+ T cell (also known as a killer T cell), target and remove antigens from the body.

CD4+ T cells with dormant HIV proviruses make it difficult to eradicate the virus from the body, because the potential is always there for a renewed HIV infection. It's vitally important for us to learn why there were significantly fewer clonally expanded, infected CD4+ T cells in the patient who received chemotherapy. If we can understand the mechanism by which that happened, perhaps it can be translated into a means of curing HIV.""

Joel Blankson, M.D., Ph.D., study co-senior author, professor of medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine

Blankson says that the patient in the JCI study received two chemotherapeutic drugs for metastatic lung cancer: paclitaxel and carboplatin. ""We suspect that the HIV-infected CD4+ T cells might have been highly susceptible to these drugs and were kept from proliferating in the patient,"" says Blankson. ""Our experiment was designed to learn if that's what really occurred.""

In the JCI study, the researchers studied an HIV-infected CD4+ T cell clone from the patient, a cell with an active, replication-competent (able to infect other T cells) provirus integrated into its genome. They stimulated the clones with the T cell's cognate peptide, a portion of HIV protein that activates the infected T cell and enables proliferation.

""We treated the stimulated T cells with paclitaxel and carboplatin in one experimental group, and an antiproliferative drug, mycophenolate mofetil, in another experimental group while leaving the stimulated clones in the control group untreated,"" says Blankson. ""The untreated infected clones continued to proliferate, but the treated infected ones did not. This was a significant finding, because it suggests a means by which infected cells could be selectively eliminated.""

As this phenomenon was only seen in T cell clones from one patient, Blankson says his team plans to look at the HIV elimination ability of CD4+ T cells from other people living with HIV.

""We suspect the reason that the infected T cell clones we studied were so susceptible to chemotherapy and the antiproliferative drug is because they rely on frequent proliferation to persist in the body,"" says study co-senior author Francesco Simonetti, M.B.Ch.B, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Showing this happens in other people living with HIV will provide evidence that this suspicion is correct, and in turn, direct future research toward HIV cure strategies.""

""A key advantage of such an approach is that it can eliminate infected T cells without having to deal with other mechanisms that enable HIV to persist in the body,"" says Simonetti.

Along with Blankson, the members of the research team from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine are Tyler Beckley, study lead author Filippo Dragoni, Isha Gurumurthy, Kellie Smith and Joel Sop.

Federal funding for the study includes support from the Office of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director, grant DP5OD031834 from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at NIH, grant UM1AI164566 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH, and NIH grants R01AI140789 and R21AI172542.

Non-federal support for the study includes grants from the Johns Hopkins University Center for AIDS Research, the Vivien Thomas Scholars Initiative, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research and the Cancer Research Institute.

Simonetti received payments from Gilead Sciences for participation at scientific meetings. Smith is an inventor of a subset of technologies related to the FEST assay described in the paper, receives research support from AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and owns founder's equity in Clasp Therapeutics.

COVID-19 does not just affect the respiratory system, but also significantly alters the brain in people who have fully recovered from the infectious disease, highlighting the long-term neurological impact of the virus.

Researchers from Griffith University's National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Disease (NCNED) used advanced MRI techniques to ascertain the neurological implications of COVID-19 compared with those who had never been infected.

The research provided compelling evidence that even in the absence of ongoing symptoms, prior infection with the virus could leave a measurable imprint on the brain.

Lead author, Dr Kiran Thapaliya, said: ""We used multimodal MRI techniques to examine both grey and white matter brain regions critical for memory, cognition and overall brain health and found clear differences across all participant groups.""

""The unique MRI approach identified significant alterations in brain neurochemicals, brain signal intensity, and tissue structure not only in individuals with Long COVID but also in those who considered themselves fully recovered,"" he said. 

""The research also reported that altered brain tissue was associated with symptom severity in individuals with Long COVID, suggesting the virus may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health.""

These findings offer vital insights into how COVID 19 affects the central nervous system and may help explain the cognitive problems, such as memory and concentration, reported both shortly after infection and months or even years later.

NCNED Director, Professor Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik, said: ""The NCNED brings together a critical mass of talented researchers and clinicians committed to improving the lives of the patients.""

""We are privileged to access state-of-the-art technologies which drive transformative scientific discoveries.""

The research was funded by ME Research UK and the Stafford Fox Medical Research Foundation.

For much of the past century, Alzheimer's disease has been one of medicine's most daunting frontiers – biologically complex, devastating in impact, and difficult to diagnose early. Conventional diagnostic methods like positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis offer precision but remain invasive, costly, and logistically challenging, especially in low- and middle-income regions.

That is now changing. Ultra-sensitive, blood-based biomarkers are transforming how clinicians and researchers detect, monitor, and study Alzheimer's. These advances are reshaping diagnostics and collaboration between the public and private sectors to speed up drug development and scale innovation.

Blood-based biomarkers – like p-tau217, p-tau181, Aβ42/40 ratios, NfL, and GFAP – enable Alzheimer's pathology measurement with a simple blood draw. The availability of clinically validated blood tests are changing how clinicians diagnose and treat Alzheimer's disease and how clinical trials are designed. Furthermore, researchers are evaluating blood tests that may identify disease progression years before symptoms, potentially allowing health systems to extend early detection from tertiary care to primary and community settings.

Globally, this could help expand access for disease detection and management. Many countries face rapid ageing, increased rates of dementia, and limited access to imaging. Blood tests offer a scalable, cost-efficient way to expand early detection and better allocate specialist resources. Tests that combine multiple biomarkers in a single blood draw, such as Quanterix's LucentAD Complete - which measures five AD biomarkers simultaneously – further democratize the process. Over time, this could help reduce diagnostic disparities linked to income and geography.

These same biomarkers are changing drug development. In clinical research, they help reduce imaging needs, monitor responses to therapy, and enable adaptive trials.

This approach accelerates discovery and approval. Researchers can now track molecular changes indicating true disease modification, not just late-stage cognitive outcomes. As combination therapies and precision neurology emerge, these insights will be essential for selecting patients and optimizing trial success.

Government-funded initiatives have long built the foundation for Alzheimer's research – such as NIH cohort studies in the U.S. and efforts in Japan, Korea, China, and Singapore. These projects built the datasets and insights essential to today's biomarker development.

Now, as government research budgets shrink and approval processes shift, the private sector is taking a larger role in translational science. Pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, as well as laboratories, increasingly partner to validate assays, set reference standards, and advance the clinical readiness of tests.

This shift creates a new balance: the public sector generates knowledge and long-term data, while industry supplies speed, capital, and technical infrastructure to turn that knowledge into patient-ready solutions. When coordinated, these strengths can move research to patient care more quickly than ever.

To fulfill their promise, blood-based biomarkers must remain accessible and sustainable in healthcare systems. Reimbursement and pricing are persistent global challenges. In 2024, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed reimbursement levels for AD biomarkers that many labs called unsustainable, highlighting a bigger issue: the economic model for next-generation diagnostics still lags behind their clinical value.

Policymakers, payers, and industry must align on frameworks that acknowledge the cost savings of earlier diagnosis and optimized treatment. Demonstrating that biomarker results alter decisions and outcomes will be key to securing coverage. Harmonized standards, quality controls, and international collaboration will ensure tests work reliably across regions and populations.

The story of blood-based biomarkers is a convergence of biology, technology, and shared commitment. Public research lays the foundation; private enterprise scales innovation. Both sectors transform discovery into diagnostic products, leading to better patient outcomes.

In Alzheimer's and beyond, biomarkers let us detect disease earlier and act sooner. Sustaining progress requires ongoing collaboration across borders, sectors, and disciplines. With thoughtful investment and equitable access, blood-based diagnostics can move from promise to practice and redefine brain health.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Xiaohui Chi, Rong Zhang, Jiafu Mu, Tong Li, Xinhao Xie, Yujie Duan, Chunyan Han and Man Xu.

Drug binding in primary hepatocytes is an important test for in vitro ADME research. To effectively detect drug binding in hepatocytes, it is necessary to deactivate their metabolic activity.

This has been accomplished traditionally by using heat inactivation, enzyme inhibitors, or freeze-thaw cycles. This study used these three ways to assess the unbound percentage of ten commercial drugs in hepatocytes and determined which method was most suited for routine testing.



Image Credit: Pharmaron 

By comparing the percentage unbound (%) and the three approaches, it was discovered that, for the majority of substances, the three methods produced comparable findings.

For the chemical carvedilol, however, the freeze-thaw approach increased the stability from 26.43 % to 73.93 % when compared to the Enzyme Inhibitor method, demonstrating that the freeze-thaw method has a higher enzyme inactivity ability.

For the majority of substances, the three approaches produced comparable results, just as they did for rats. However, for the chemical carvedilol, the freeze-thaw approach increased its recovery from 54.84 % to 82.16 % when compared to the Enzyme Inhibitor method, demonstrating that the freeze-thaw method has a better enzyme inactivation ability.

For most substances, the Enzyme Inhibitor and Freeze-Thaw techniques produced similar binding results.

For carvedilol, the FreezeThaw approach significantly improved metabolic stability (26.43 % vs. 73.93 % after 4 hours), and microscopy revealed higher membrane rupture, indicating more efficient inactivation.

Overall, the Freeze-Thaw method provides practical benefits such as better inactivation for some medicines, streamlined processes, and clear morphological evidence, making it a more convenient and trustworthy option for routine in vitro ADME research.

During this unique study, scientists sought to understand if artificial intelligence could be used to predict how the interior of antibodies are assembled in the body. Antibodies, which are comprised of 'heavy' and 'light' protein chains, are produced by B cells within the immune system and protect against viruses and bacteria.

Franca Fraternali, Professor of Integrative Computational Biology at University College London, said:""Until now, it was widely assumed that the pairing of heavy and light chains within antibodies occurred at random. Using Immunomatch, we show for the first time that this assembly is, in fact, highly specific. Understanding these pairing rules is crucial for predicting antibody stability and performance and opens the door to the rational design of more effective therapeutics.""To learn more, scientists created ImmunoMatch, based on an antibody-specific language model, which was applied to heavy and light chain antibody sequences collected from millions of single human B cells. The AI model was able to identify and predict pairings of chains, giving scientists an invaluable insight into how antibodies are combined.The team also showed that ImmunoMatch can accurately analyze antibody sequences from immune cells actively responding to disease, including those from hematological cancers and B cells within solid tumours. These insights could accelerate the rational design of new therapeutic antibodies.Professor Deborah Dunn-Walters, Professor of Immunology, at the University of Surrey, said:""Using AI has helped us discover that the combinations of 'heavy' and 'light' chains are not as random as we previously thought.""This information enables us to learn the nature-derived rules governing how proteins are combined to create functional antibodies.""Antibodies are the single largest class of modern therapeutics. Around a quarter of all newly approved therapeutics are monoclonal antibodies, so understanding how antibodies are made is critical for their effective design.""This study was published in Nature Methods.

A research team of Prof. Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) has discovered that the bacterium Ewingella americana, isolated from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs (Dryophytes japonicus), possesses remarkably potent anticancer activity. This groundbreaking research has been published in the international journal Gut Microbes.

While the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has attracted considerable attention in recent years, most approaches have focused on indirect methods such as microbiome modulation or fecal microbiota transplantation. In contrast, this study takes a completely different approach: isolating, culturing, and directly administering individual bacterial strains intravenously to attack tumors - representing an innovative therapeutic strategy.

The research team isolated a total of 45 bacterial strains from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs, Japanese fire belly newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster), and Japanese grass lizards (Takydromus tachydromoides). Through systematic screening, nine strains demonstrated antitumor effects, with E. americana exhibiting the most exceptional therapeutic efficacy.

In a mouse colorectal cancer model, a single intravenous administration of E. americana achieved complete tumor elimination with a 100% complete response (CR) rate. This dramatically surpasses the therapeutic efficacy of current standard treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 antibody) and liposomal doxorubicin (chemotherapy agent).

E. americana attacks cancer through two complementary mechanisms:

E. americana selectively accumulates in tumor tissues with zero colonization in normal organs. This remarkable tumor specificity arises from multiple synergistic mechanisms:

Comprehensive safety evaluation revealed that E. americana demonstrates:

This research has established proof-of-concept for a novel cancer therapy using natural bacteria. Future research and development will focus on:

This research demonstrates that unexplored biodiversity represents a treasure trove for novel medical technology development and holds promise for providing new therapeutic options for patients with refractory cancers.

Every movement you make and every memory you form depends on precise communication between neurons. When that communication is disrupted, the brain must rapidly rebalance its internal signaling to keep circuits functioning properly. New research from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences shows that neurons can stabilize their signaling using a fast, physical mechanism - not the electrical activity scientists long assumed was required.

The discovery, supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals a system that doesn't depend on the flow of charged particles to maintain signaling when part of a synapse - the junction between neurons - suddenly stops working.

Maintaining this balance between neurons is essential for muscle control, learning and overall brain health. Failure to maintain this ""homeostasis"" has been linked to neurological conditions such as epilepsy and autism.

USC Dornsife researchers led by Dion Dickman, professor of biological sciences, set out to understand how neurons compensate when communication between them falters. Specifically, they wanted to know how the receiving side of a synapse detects a sudden loss of function and signals the sending neuron to increase its output to restore homeostasis.

Working with fruit flies, a standard model for studying the nervous system, the team blocked glutamate receptors on the receiving side of the synapse with a chemical known to shut them down, then used electrical recordings and high-resolution microscopy to observe how the synapse responded. To identify the molecules responsible for triggering the response, the researchers used CRISPR gene-editing tools to remove specific structural proteins one by one and observe what changed in the cells.

This process of elimination revealed that the key trigger for the rapid adjustment is not the loss of electrical activity but the physical reorganization of a specific type of receptor. When these receptors were blocked, they rearranged themselves within the synapse, which set off a signaling process that instructed the sending neuron to release more neurotransmitter, helping maintain steady communication.

A scaffold protein called DLG proved essential for this response. When DLG was removed using CRISPR, the rapid compensation failed.

The researchers also showed that this fast signaling process continues even when all electrical synapse activity is silenced, indicating that the system relies on structural cues rather than electrical signals.

Understanding how synapses quickly adapt could help guide future research into treatments that strengthen neural resilience and ward off neurological diseases.

Sample prioritization is possible by integrating HTPD with Pharmaron's tiered testing approach, resulting in lower costs and faster, data-driven decisions.

Pharmaron's platform provides constant scalability, from lab to GMP. Once optimization is complete, results are tested using lab-scale studies and demonstrated at pilot size, or technology is transported immediately into the GMP plant, depending on the partner's requirements.

Both the process and analytical data show consistency across scales. In the example below, the ideal circumstances mentioned above are duplicated at all scales.

Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) found that an increased fMRI signal is associated with reduced brain activity in around 40 percent of cases. At the same time, they observed decreased fMRI signals in regions with elevated activity.

This contradicts the long-standing assumption that increased brain activity is always accompanied by an increased blood flow to meet higher oxygen demand. Since tens of thousands of fMRI studies worldwide are based on this assumption, our results could lead to opposite interpretations in many of them.""

Dr. Samira Epp, First Author 

PD Dr. Valentin Riedl, now Professor at FAU, and his colleague Epp examined more than 40 healthy participants during their time at TUM. Each was given several experimental tasks – such as mental arithmetic or autobiographical memory recall – which are known to produce predictable fMRI signal changes in distributed brain regions. During these experiments, the researchers simultaneously measured the actual oxygen consumption using a novel quantitative MRI technique.Depending on the task and the brain region, the physiological results varied. Increased oxygen consumption – for instance in areas involved in calculation – did not coincide with the expected rise in blood flow. Instead, the quantitative analyses showed that these regions met their additional energy demand by extracting more oxygen from the unchanged blood supply. Thus, they used the oxygen available in the blood more efficiently without requiring greater perfusion.

According to Riedl, these insights also affect the interpretation of research findings in brain disorders: ""Many fMRI studies on psychiatric or neurological diseases – from depression to Alzheimer's – interpret changes in blood flow as a reliable signal of neuronal under- or over-activation. Given the limited validity of such measurements, this must now be reassessed. Especially in patient groups with vascular changes – for instance due to aging or vascular disease – the measured values may primarily reflect vascular differences rather than neuronal deficits."" Previous animal studies already point in this direction.The researchers therefore propose complementing the conventional MRI approach with quantitative measurements. In the long term, this combination could form the basis for energy-based brain models: rather than showing activation maps that depend on assumptions about blood flow, future analyses could display values indicating how much oxygen – and therefore energy – is actually consumed for information processing. This opens new perspectives for examining aging, psychiatric, or neurodegenerative diseases in terms of absolute changes in energy metabolism – and for understanding them more accurately.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Relationship quality impacts heart health, study shows","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251216/Relationship-quality-impacts-heart-health-study-shows.aspx","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:05:00 GMT","

With heart disease as the leading cause of death worldwide, there is growing recognition that recovery is not only physical but also emotional and social. A new study shows that strong and supportive relationships can indeed improve heart health for individuals with cardiovascular disease. The work is described in an article in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, published by Elsevier, which calls for intimate partners to be included in cardiac rehabilitation programs to support long-term heart health and quality of life for both members of the couple.

An evaluation of the effectiveness of couples-based interventions on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac outcomes, mental health, and relationship quality in adults with diagnosed heart disease and their partners shows that 77% of the reviewed studies report health behavior improvements, with evidence presented for both cardiac and mental health outcomes.

""Considering the well-established literature highlighting that relationship quality impacts heart health, it is surprising that such a limited number of studies have targeted relationship quality in their interventions,"" notes Heather E. Tulloch, PhD, CPsych, University of Ottawa Heart Institute.

Sometimes heart disease brings couples closer together, but often it's a challenge for the relationship and both people in it. We've learned over the years that cardiac events do not only happen to the patient, but to the couple.""

Heather E. Tulloch, PhD, CPsych, University of Ottawa Heart Institute

In Canada, one in 12 adults over the age of 20 has a diagnosis of heart disease, which represents 2.6 million people. In the European Union, cardiovascular disease is responsible for one third of all deaths and 20% of all deaths prior to the age of 65.

Most cardiac care focuses only on the individual patient. Couples-based programs, reviewed in the paper, aim to change that by involving both partners in recovery and lifestyle changes. This approach recognizes that partners are often key facilitators of recovery, for example, by cooking heart-healthy meals, encouraging regular physical activity, and ensuring medications are taken correctly. While there is growing evidence that these interventions can improve health behaviors, less is known about how they affect emotional adjustment or the quality of the relationship itself. The authors call for future research to focus more on emotional and relational factors to strengthen both partners' recovery and well-being.

Healthcare systems are increasingly emphasizing patient-centered and family-oriented care. Couples-based approaches could help healthcare professionals better support both patients and their partners during cardiac rehabilitation. Not only will patients receive important interventions for improved health but, their partners-who may have similar cardiovascular risk factors-may also benefit.

Dr. Tulloch says, ""Interventions that include the partner as an active participant and meaningfully address what's happening in patients' relationships ought to be developed and tested, with the aim of helping couples better cope with heart disease by enhancing their mental and physical health and the health of their relationship.""

The investigators propose a stepped care model within cardiac rehabilitation as a viable pathway for systematic screening and referral to appropriate services to help couples deal with distress. To address current knowledge gaps, future studies should include more diverse populations and measure outcomes for both patients and partners.

""We need to treat the heart and nurture relationships to enhance health behaviors, mental health and, possibly, cardiovascular outcomes among those with heart disease,"" Dr. Tulloch concludes. ""This could lead to stronger emotional and social adjustment during patients' recovery and ultimately to better health behaviors.""

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Jing Lai, Gang Yang, Yushi Cao, Xuehua Zhang, Yi Li, Bojia Liu, Youpeng Yang, Ning Yang and Mandy Xu.

Sulfonation (also known as sulfurylation) is a significant phase II conjugation reaction that occurs throughout the metabolism of both xenobiotics and endogenous substances.

It is catalyzed by sulfotransferases (SULT). In humans, the eighteen SULT genes are divided into five gene families.

Recognizing the metabolic phenotyping and inhibition of sulfotransferases is essential for analyzing drug-drug interactions during drug discovery and development.

Conventional probe substrates, such as 4-nitrophenol and dopamine, frequently require ion-pairing reagents and can damage instruments, rendering them unsuitable for high-throughput LC-MS/MS analysis.

To address these constraints, this study utilized new probe substrates, developing a panel of in vitro phenotyping and inhibition tests to characterize SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1 via recombinant enzymes and optimized LC-MS/MS methodologies.

The researchers in this study designed and validated LC-MS/MS-based phenotyping assays for SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1. These assays allow for the assessment of compound substrate potential towards various SULT enzymes.

To improve the accuracy and throughput of SULT inhibition tests, probe substrates were selected and adjusted for each enzyme.

The relevant LCMS/MS procedures were also optimized. Key parameters such as probe substrate Km and IC50 values, as well as appropriate protein concentrations for recombinant SULT enzymes, were identified.

The validated in vitro SULT phenotyping and inhibition assays are now ready for use in evaluating compounds of interest during drug discovery and development.

Canada should rethink its reduced pledge to the Global Fund to protect the health of people in Canada as well as around the globe, argue authors in an editorial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.252036.

In November, Canada reduced its pledge by 16% to the Global Fund, which fights AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria and strengthens pandemic preparedness. Two related commentaries in the same issue describe increases in tuberculosis in Canada and the backsliding in addressing HIV/AIDS around the world and potential solutions.

""Canada's reduced pledge to the Global Fund reflects shortsighted political thinking that fails to appreciate the complexity of global health threats and long-term health consequences,"" write Drs. Kirsten Patrick, editor-in-chief, CMAJ, and deputy editor Helena Swinkels. ""If the anticipated shortfall in pledges to the Fund is not offset, Canada should anticipate reduced success in domestic TB and HIV control in forthcoming years, rather than the progress toward elimination that is hoped for now.""

Reduced funding will also open the door to other infectious disease threats.

""Unfortunately, HIV and TB control will not be the only casualties of the current global funding shortsightedness,"" write the authors. ""In public and global health, managing problems in silos may seem appealing, but health threats do not fit into neat containers; they affect systems. As the COVID-19 pandemic revealed plainly, surges in rates of 1 infectious disease can ultimately affect health systems' ability to manage others. A decrease in resources for disease management adds complexity to this problem.""

The CMAJ editors urge Canada's government to invest in improving social determinants of health that underly TB and HIV infection, and to implement disease-specific suggestions outlined in the related commentaries published in CMAJ, such as creating a national body to address TB and providing better access to data and medications for both diseases.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","LEGACY: The iconic 2002 World Cup run that set the benchmark for American soccer","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/legacy-iconic-2002-world-cup-run-benchmark-american-soccer/bltbff688d2c88cc481","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

Despite all that's happened in American soccer in the 23 years since an unforgettable 2002 World Cup, it's still worth wondering: 'What if they called that damn handball?' There was no VAR in the summer back then, no pathway for the referees to change course. Torsten Frings' hand struck the ball - imagine what could have happened if it was acknowledged on the day, and not just 23 years later?

If that had happened, if that day had gone the U.S. men's national team's way, a legendary run could have gone at least one step further. Yet, even without that call, the summer of 2002 remains a defining moment in American soccer. It was the moment in which the USMNT truly arrived on the global stage, paving the way for all that has come since.

That was the summer the U.S. made it to the quarter-finals of the World Cup, the nation's deepest run to date. Yes, the 1994 World Cup ushered in an era of American soccer but, in many ways, 2002 was the peak of that era. During that run through South Korea and Japan, the USMNT made it further than any of its predecessors or successors.

Along the way, they toppled a powerhouse, won a defining match against a fierce rival and, throughout the journey, the world was introduced to characters such Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley, icons who would go on to define a generation.

So, even now, all these years later, the impact of that tournament is undeniable. It's still the benchmark for the USMNT program, one that the nation has yet to replicate. This was the USMNT's best World Cup performance, and it has influenced all of the World Cups that followed.

""We showed the world we can play,"" U.S. coach Bruce Arena said after the loss to Germany. ""We haven't arrived, but there's a bright future for the game in the United States.""

To truly grasp just how improbable that 2002 run was, you have to understand what came before it. This was a USMNT group approaching the modern era, but hadn't reached it. While 1994 was the catalyst for the game in America, it was the 1990 tournament in which the U.S. returned from a 40-year absence from the world's greatest sporting show. They were promptly swept aside, losing all three games by a combined six goals.

Then, in 1994, with the world watching, the U.S. put in a respectable performance on home soil, emerging from the group before falling in the last 16, showing signs of life in a country in which soccer was on the upswing.

Then came 1998. With momentum building over the previous four years, the U.S. fell totally flat in France that summer, once again losing all three games. It raised all the obvious questions: Was 1994 a fluke? Could this U.S. team, realistically, compete with the world's elite outside of America?

It seemed the U.S. might not even get the chance. Under coach Arena, the U.S. ushered in a new era, featuring 37 players across the qualifying run. Controversy engulfed the journey, particularly towards the end of the hexagonal stage as the U.S. squandered an early lead in the table with consecutive losses to Mexico, Honduras and Costa Rica. They would need results to go their way - and they did. With a win over Jamaica in the penultimate game, and a draw with Trinidad and Tobago to close out qualifying, the U.S. made it, but barely.

""The mission was simple,"" midfielder Earnie Stewart told U.S. Soccer in 2022. ""We had to win games and then you have to wait on the rest that you don't have any influence on. You try to block that out for as much as possible because it doesn't help the game.""

""I was just so elated that we qualified,"" added Brian McBride.

It wouldn't be easy once the U.S. got to Asia, though. First up was the mighty Portugal. What followed was one of the all-time great upsets...

The Portugal team that the U.S. met in their first game was one led by a golden generation. Rui Costa, Luis Figo, Pauleta - all legendary figures. The U.S. team? Not so much. Yet, it was the USMNT that left victorious in that opening match following an all-time performance.

They fell behind early thanks to a John O'Brien goal in the fourth minute, but that was just the beginning. A Jorge Costa own goal doubled the lead before Player of the Match McBride made it three in the 36th minute, leaving one of the world's best teams shellshocked. Portugal fought back, scoring two goals of their own, but it wasn't enough - when the whistle blew at the Suwon World Cup Stadium, the scoreboard read 'USA 3, Portugal 2'.

""It is probably the biggest win in the modern era,"" Arena said after a match that also featured the World Cup debuts of two players who would go on to define the USMNT for a generation. Helping to lead the line was Donovan, who was making waves after winning a Golden Ball at the Under-17 World Cup in 1999. It was Donovan who set up the Costa own goal, banking a shot off the defender and in to really give the U.S. momentum.

On the left of the U.S. team was Beasley, who also emerged as a standout during the tournament. The two young stars would go on to feature in all three of the USMNT's group-stage matches, which included a draw with South Korea and then a 3-1 loss to Poland that at least featured a Donovan goal. Ultimately, the U.S. finished second in the group, three points behind co-hosts South Korea, while that legendary Portugal team went home early.

The next test, though, would be the most unique. Up next was the USMNT's most familiar rival for a game on the biggest stage: Mexico.

If you follow the USMNT, you've heard of 'Dos a Cero'. It's become a legendary scoreline in the rivalry between the USMNT and Mexico. The biggest and best moment in that scoreline's history happened on June 17, 2002 in Jeonju, South Korea. It was on that day that 'Dos a Cero' became a legend.

Meeting for the first - and so far only - time at a World Cup in their combined histories, the U.S. and Mexico were matched up in the first round of the knockout stages. Pride was on the line, as was a spot in the World Cup quarter-finals.

The U.S., once again, seized an early lead thanks to a goal from McBride, an advantage they'd never relinquish. When Donovan netted in the 65th minute, it was effectively over. 'Dos a Cero', and the U.S. were into the last eight.

""I certainly had an understanding, even though I was 20, that it was possible that we would never play them again in a World Cup,"" Donovan told ESPN. ""There's a historical context here that if this was the only time we ever played them... We wanted to make sure that we always had that victory. The result cemented in Mexican fans' minds that this rivalry was now real. No matter what happens in qualifying or friendlies, they can never, ever, ever take that away from us. Immediately, it gave us more credibility, and I think it made the rivalry very real for the first time.""

With that credibility in their back pocket, the U.S. had nothing to lose in the quarter-finals.

All these years later, it remains one of the World Cup's most controversial moments, and the U.S. was on the wrong side of it, ultimately leading to their exit. Paired up with the mighty German team including the likes of Oliver Kahn and Michael Ballack, the U.S. were, once again, underdogs. That belief was only justified late in the first half when Ballack found the back of the net, sending the U.S. into half-time needing a goal to keep their World Cup dreams alive.

The U.S., though, had reason to believe it was coming. Donovan had forced two saves out of the legendary Kahn, giving them some semblance of momentum heading into the second half. Then it happened. A cross in from Claudio Reyna found future USMNT boss Gregg Berhalter, whose volley was blocked by Kahn. The ensuing rebound clearly hit the arm of defender Frings on the line. It could have been a red card and a penalty that would have changed the game. Instead, it was nothing. No call. Play on.

""It was a 100-per-cent penalty,"" Arena said. ""I hate to say we were cheated out of it... We had the momentum in the game. We controlled the game. We would have beaten Germany and gone on to the semi-finals. One of my conclusions out of that is that we still as a country had not earned the respect of the world.""

In some ways, though, they did on that day. Legendary German defender Franz Beckenbauer was among those to say the U.S. deserved to go through. Kahn, for his heroics, was named Player of the Match, showing just how much the U.S. actually threatened a star-studded German team.

On that day in 2002, the U.S. showed they could play with anyone in the world and, all these years later, it remains one of the biggest statements in American soccer history, despite the result.

Even now, 23 years later, the USMNT is still chasing that summer. The team has yet to match the heights of 2002 and, while there have been some big World Cup moments in the tournaments since, none have reached the same dizzying level.

It was, in many ways, the USMNT's true introduction to the elite of the game. Everything that happened after can be traced back to that 2002 team. Donovan, who was recognised as the Best Young Player at the tournament, went on to set the tone for a generation alongside long-time team-mate Beasley, leading the team through some of its biggest moments. Players such as McBride, Reyna and Brad Friedel were among those to earn status as legends. So, too, did Arena, the USMNT's most successful coach. Berhalter took the reins for a time, too, leading the U.S. back onto the global stage in 2022 in Qatar before falling a step short of the one his 2002 team reached.

And so now, with the 2026 tournament on home soil looming, 2002 remains the benchmark. To move through a World Cup, a team has to, inevitably, slay some giants. The U.S. did just that and, with another break or two, could have extended the remarkable run. It's a reminder, then, that a little bit of fortune goes a long way.

Maybe that'll happen next summer. Maybe 2026 is finally the year the U.S. breaks through that glass ceiling and takes the next step - USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has set the quarter-finals as the target for success as co-hosts next year. Until then, though, that 2002 run will have its place in history for those who remember not just how much the U.S. achieved, but how much the American game grew as a result.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

United States men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams has suspected medial collateral ligament damage after limping out of Bournemouth's 4-4 draw with Manchester United in the Premier League on Monday.

In the second minute of the match at Old Trafford, Adams was injured while challenging Matheus Cunha. He came off after treatment on the pitch.

""He's the worst news from the game, definitely,"" Bournemouth coach Andoni Iraola said. ""The knee twisted, I think the MCL. We'll have to check and see if it is a small sprain or bigger.

""To lose a player like Tyler for us is massive, especially when you don't have Lewis Cook (suspended). Alex (Scott) has to play in that holding midfield position and he has done it really well but it's bad news for us because Tyler is massive for us.""

Adams captained the United States at the last World Cup in 2022 in Qatar. The next U.S. games are not until March, a pair of friendlies.

He's been invaluable again for Bournemouth, appearing in all but one Premier League round and scoring twice, including the goal of the month for November.

Red Bull New York has completed the signing of American winger Cade Cowell from Mexican side Chivas de Guadalajara on a one-year loan with an option to buy, a source tells amNewYork. 
It is the first significant attacking signing under new head of sport, Julian de Guzman, and comes shortly after officially announcing the hiring of US soccer legend Michael Bradley as head coach. 
Cowell, 22, is coming off a difficult 2025 campaign with Chivas, where playing time grew scarce, and production dried up with it. He recorded just a single goal and assist in 20 appearances across all competitions after recording 10 in 43 matches over the previous two seasons, which featured Liga MX Player of the Month honors in July of 2024.

He rose to prominence with the San Jose Earthquakes, scoring 12 goals and providing 12 assists in 114 matches for the MLS side before being purchased for $4 million by Chivas. All the while, he had broken into the United States men's national team, making 11 appearances for the Stars and Stripes. The last one, however, came in November of 2024, early in Mauricio Pochettino's tenure as US head coach.

Cowell now joins a Red Bulls squad that is currently in transition, but claims to have a clear vision under de Guzman and Bradley. While the new head of sport has promised a more entertaining, attacking brand of soccer, Bradley will likely institute a 4-3-3 formation that will highlight the club's attacking wealth — whenever that picture clarifies. 
Former Bayern Munich star Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting is the anchor up front, while captain and Swedish international Emil Forsberg pulls the strings from the midfield. But the Red Bulls have traded away Scottish international Lewis Morgan to San Diego FC, who, when healthy, was one of the squad's most valuable players. Peter Stroud was also dealt to Minnesota United. AmNewYork had learned of both transactions last week.
Cowell is expected to play a significant role in Bradley's plans on the wing, working alongside Choupo-Moting, and he is likely to be the first domino to fall in addressing de Guzman and Bradley's vision. 

Should the partnership thrive, there is no reason why Cowell could not at least force his way back into the national team conversation, too. The only thing working against him is time, as the 2026 FIFA World Cup on American soil is just six months away.

Addressing its depth issue within its back line, New York has also signed right back Justin Che from Brondby of the Danish first division on a three-year contract with an option for the 2029 season.







The 22-year-old was once a can't-miss prospect of the US youth national team while with FC Dallas' academy, but injuries have slowed his development. Following a loan spell with German powerhouse Bayern Munich's academy, he made 15 MLS appearances with Dallas before moving to the second team of Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. After signing with Brondby three seasons ago, he proceeded to bounce around Europe on a pair of loans.
Still a young, moldable prospect, he is known for his ability to play out of the back, which jives with New York's new style. He will likely compete for the significant minutes at right back with veteran Dylan Nealis. 
“Justin is an intelligent defender that has great speed and will help add to our backline this upcoming season,” Bradley said. “He has played a lot of minutes all across Europe and will be another great person to add to our roster to help our club accomplish its goals.”

Chelsea injuries up 44% on previous year, Howden finds

It calculates injury cost in top leagues over past five years

Chelsea experienced a 44% increase in injuries between June and October compared with the previous season, a report released on Tuesday has found. This year's period covers their participation in the Club World Cup and its aftermath.

The figure, which goes some way towards vindicating Enzo Maresca's rotation and his complaints about injuries, is contained in a report published by the insurance company Howden, which puts the cost of injuries to clubs in Europe's top five leagues over the past five years at almost £3bn.

Maresca cited the impact of the Club World Cup in September when Chelsea were missing five defenders through injury and lost three successive games in the Champions League and Premier League. He made five changes last week for the Champions League defeat at Atalanta, a setback followed by cryptic comments on Saturday after a Premier League win against Everton that he had endured his “worst 48 hours” at the club owing to a lack of support from unspecified people.

The report found Chelsea had 23 injuries between 1 June and 31 October, including seven during the Club World Cup in the US, the same number as Paris Saint-Germain, whom they beat in the final.

Howden calculated the financial loss to Chelsea of players missing through injury as £17m up to October, almost a quarter of their £80m Club World Cup prize money, and more than a third of their £45m loss last season. It calculates financial loss according to wages paid to injured players.

Manchester City were found to have had the second-most injuries among Club World Cup teams, at 22, although they did not sustain any during the tournament, perhaps because they were knocked out in the last 16. PSG were found to have had 19 injuries, including seven during the Club World Cup.

Howden's findings echo concerns expressed by the global players' union Fifpro regarding workload. A Fifpro report in October showed Chelsea's players were given 20 days off after the Club World Cup and that PSG rested their players for 22 days.

“The Howden report demonstrates the impact of pushing players to their limits through a year-round schedule of football,” the Professional Footballers' Association chief executive and Fifpro board member, Maheta Molango, said.

“Serious injuries are always going to happen if players are not given proper breaks for rest and recovery. Players are exposed to an extreme schedule at a younger and younger age. That will have an impact on their careers and their wellbeing. The current calendar makes no sense for players, fans or clubs.”

Howden has produced the Men's European Football Injury Index for the past five years, with the report released on Tuesday calculating there have been 22,596 injuries in Europe's top five men's leagues over that period, costing clubs a combined £2.97bn. Premier League clubs account for 24% of these injuries, with more than £1bn paid out in salaries to injured players.

Chelsea experienced a significant 44 per cent surge in injuries following their participation in this year's expanded Club World Cup, new findings revealed on Tuesday.

However, the latest edition of the Men's European Football Injury Index suggests the newly enlarged tournament has, so far, had a ""minimal impact"" on overall injury rates across European football.

The decision by Fifa in 2023 to expand its flagship club event from seven to 32 teams faced considerable opposition, with players' unions voicing concerns over potential physical and mental burnout due to an ever-growing match schedule.

Despite these warnings, Fifa proceeded, staging the tournament in the United States during June and July.

Chelsea emerged victorious in the inaugural competition, receiving the trophy from U.S. President Donald Trump at MetLife Stadium and securing approximately $125 million in prize money.

Yet, according to the Index, between June and October, Chelsea recorded 23 injuries – more than any of the nine participating clubs from Europe's top leagues.

This figure, which included star player Cole Palmer, represents a 44 per cent increase compared to the same period last year.

While Chelsea, who played 64 games across the 2024-25 season, saw their injury count rise, the Index, compiled by global insurance firm Howden, noted an overall decrease in injuries among the top European clubs.

""In principle you would expect this increased workload to lead to an increase in the number of injuries sustained, as a possible rise in overall injury severity,"" the Index report stated, but concluded: ""The data would suggest a minimal impact on overall injury figures.""

The nine teams from Europe's top leagues – England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France – recorded 146 injuries from June to October, a reduction from 174 in the previous year.

Specifically, the August-October period saw 121 injuries, marking the lowest figure for that three-month span in the Index's six-year history.

Manchester City, however, sustained 22 injuries since the tournament, the highest among the nine teams.

Despite these figures, the report's authors acknowledge it is too early to fully assess the Club World Cup's impact, as the findings only extend to October.

James Burrows, Head of Sport at Howden, commented: ""We would expect to see the impact to spike in that sort of November to February period. What we've seen previously is that's where the impact is seen from summer tournaments.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

File Copy: Super Eagles Players

Kindly share this story:

The Nigeria Football Federation has confirmed that it has initiated a probe into DR Congo's use of ineligible players during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, a development that could reopen Nigeria's path to the tournament in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, PUNCH Online reports.
DR Congo eliminated Nigeria from the African play-offs in November after a 4–3 penalty shoot-out victory in Morocco, a result that ended the Super Eagles' hopes of progressing to the FIFA intercontinental play-off.
The Congolese side has since been handed a bye into the final of the intercontinental play-off tournament, where they are scheduled to face the winner of the semi-final between New Caledonia and Jamaica.
However, their participation at that stage could now be in doubt following concerns raised by the NFF over the eligibility of several DR Congo players fielded during the African play-offs. 






Reports suggest that between six and nine DR Congo players who switched national allegiance may not have fully complied with the eligibility requirements under Congolese law before representing the country.
While FIFA reportedly cleared the players on the basis that they possessed valid DR Congo passports, it is alleged that they failed to formally renounce their previous citizenships, contrary to the Central African nation's constitution, which does not permit dual nationality.
“NFF has done the needful,” a member of the federation's executive board told PUNCH Online.          Related News  Super Eagles unveil squad for Egypt friendly clash  AFCON: Osimhen 'on another level,' defenders'll be scared - Onyeka  Super Eagles camp swells to 22 ahead of Egypt friendly   
“Their constitution does not allow dual citizenship, and about six to nine players had that status during the play-off. That is the loophole we are exploring. Our lawyers must have submitted the relevant documents to FIFA as well.”
NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, also confirmed that the NFF has faulted the players' switch.
“We're waiting. The Congolese rules say you cannot have dual citizenship or nationality,” Sanusi said. “Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; some of them have French passports, others Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition.
“FIFA rules say once you have a passport of your country, you're eligible, and that is why they were cleared,” Sanusi explained. “But our concern is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. It is not FIFA's responsibility to enforce Congo's domestic regulations; FIFA acts based on what is submitted to it. What we are saying is that the process was fraudulent.”
The development has boosted Nigeria's hope of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The country had been condemned to missing back-to-back World Cups after failing to qualify for the 2022 edition in Qatar as well.
DR Congo, meanwhile, has appeared at the FIFA World Cup on one occasion in 1974 when they were known as Zaire.

Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)

Nigeria's hopes of reaching the 2026 FIFA World Cup remain alive following a formal protest lodged by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) against the Democratic Republic of Congo over alleged breaches of player eligibility rules.
The Super Eagles were eliminated in November after losing to DR Congo on penalties in the African playoff round. However, questions have since arisen regarding the eligibility of several Congolese players who featured in that match. Reports suggest that up to six players may not have completed the full nationality switch process required under FIFA regulations.
Central to the allegations is the claim that the players did not formally renounce their previous citizenships, a requirement under Congolese law, which does not recognise dual nationality. Further concerns have been raised about players holding European passports and being over the age of 21, circumstances that could place them in breach of FIFA's eligibility rules.
Confirming Nigeria's position, the NFF Secretary General, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, disclosed that a petition has been submitted to FIFA challenging the participation of the players.
“We're waiting. The Congolese rules say you cannot have a dual citizenship or nationality. Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; there are some of them that have French passports, some of them Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition,” he said.       Related News  Eagles test might against Pharaohs today  10 players hit Super Eagles camp for 2025 AFCON  Uzoho, Nwabali are early birds as Super Eagles launch ‘Naija 4 The Win' campaign   
Sanusi explained that FIFA's clearance of the players was based on documentation provided by DR Congo, but Nigeria believes the process may have been compromised.
“That's why FIFA cleared them. FIFA rules say once you have passports of your country, you're eligible, as far as FIFA is concerned, they are eligible and that's why they were cleared. But right now, our concern is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. It is not the responsibility of FIFA to ensure that the regulations of Congo are followed. FIFA goes by its own regulations, and it was on the basis of what was submitted to FIFA that they cleared them. What we are saying is that it was fraudulent,” he added.
The matter is now before FIFA, which will determine whether DR Congo breached eligibility rules. Should Nigeria's petition succeed, the Super Eagles could be reinstated into contention for the Intercontinental Playoffs scheduled to take place in Mexico in March 2026, provided the fixtures have not already been played.
The development has rekindled hope among Nigerian supporters who had resigned themselves to missing out on the World Cup following the defeat in November. The outcome of FIFA's investigation will be decisive in determining whether Nigeria's campaign can be revived.

Confirming Nigeria's position, the NFF Secretary General, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, disclosed that a petition has been submitted to FIFA challenging the participation of the players.
“We're waiting. The Congolese rules say you cannot have a dual citizenship or nationality. Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; there are some of them that have French passports, some of them Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition,” he said.       Related News  Eagles test might against Pharaohs today  10 players hit Super Eagles camp for 2025 AFCON  Uzoho, Nwabali are early birds as Super Eagles launch ‘Naija 4 The Win' campaign   
Sanusi explained that FIFA's clearance of the players was based on documentation provided by DR Congo, but Nigeria believes the process may have been compromised.
“That's why FIFA cleared them. FIFA rules say once you have passports of your country, you're eligible, as far as FIFA is concerned, they are eligible and that's why they were cleared. But right now, our concern is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. It is not the responsibility of FIFA to ensure that the regulations of Congo are followed. FIFA goes by its own regulations, and it was on the basis of what was submitted to FIFA that they cleared them. What we are saying is that it was fraudulent,” he added.
The matter is now before FIFA, which will determine whether DR Congo breached eligibility rules. Should Nigeria's petition succeed, the Super Eagles could be reinstated into contention for the Intercontinental Playoffs scheduled to take place in Mexico in March 2026, provided the fixtures have not already been played.
The development has rekindled hope among Nigerian supporters who had resigned themselves to missing out on the World Cup following the defeat in November. The outcome of FIFA's investigation will be decisive in determining whether Nigeria's campaign can be revived.

				The U.S. administration is making a concerted effort to boost ideological allies in Europe. 			

AI generated Text-to-speech

Slovakia's populist Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that U.S. President Donald Trump has invited him to America to sign a nuclear power deal — and attend the FIFA World Cup next summer.

""It is an honor for me that yesterday the special envoy of U.S. President D. Trump handed me a written invitation to visit the United States and meet with him,"" Fico said in a social media post on Monday.

""Together, we aim to support the signing of an intergovernmental agreement between the Slovak Republic and the United States on cooperation in nuclear energy and to exchange views on the most pressing global issues,"" he added. ""The timeframe of my visit will coincide with the celebrations of the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence and the hosting of the FIFA World Cup.""

The invitation comes on the heels of the Dec. 4 publication of the U.S. National Security Strategy, which caused an uproar in Europe for suggesting that the Trump administration will support ideologically aligned European patriotic parties, such as Fico's leftist-populist and nationalist Smer.

Late last week, U.S. Ambassador to France Charles Kushner met with senior figures from that country's far-right opposition National Rally, while U.S. Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers met with opposition far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party politician Markus Frohnmaier in Washington.

The letter from Trump, dated Dec. 11, was given to Fico by U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary James Danly, who was in Bratislava this week.

""Our relationship means a great deal to me and reflects the strength of the tremendous bond between the United States of America and Slovakia. Our countries have never been closer. I am confident that, by continuing to work together, we will achieve even greater things — including formalizing our civil nuclear cooperation,"" Trump wrote in the letter.

Washington and Bratislava are preparing to sign a nuclear power deal that will formally tap Westinghouse, the major American nuclear power company, to build a new nuclear reactor in western Slovakia, with costs estimated at €13 billion to €15 billion.

The decision was announced earlier in July and drew criticism from the Slovak opposition after Fico's government bypassed the tender process to award what is the largest investment project in Slovakia's history.

Slovakia faces a football playoff in March against Kosovo, and then a potential final qualifier against Turkey or Romania in order to reach the 2026 Men's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.



New Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has said he opposes an EU proposal to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine.

Court filing in Moscow comes days ahead of next week's EU summit to discuss using the Russian assets to underpin a loan to Ukraine. 


Commission president hits back at U.S. plan to undermine the European orthodoxy it says will lead to “civilizational erasure.”

“We hear the voice of the citizens protesting against the government,” says outgoing PM Rosen Zhelyazkov.","{'href': 'https://www.politico.eu', 'title': 'politico.eu'}","soccer"

Want a piece?","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/12/16/atlantas-hospitality-industry-set-to-make-millions-during-world-cup-get-a-piece-airbnb/87780198007/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:34:00 GMT","

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is coming to Atlanta, and with it tens of thousands of soccer fans ready to spend money.

The city's hospitality industry is gearing up as Atlanta becomes host for eight matches, five during the group stage and three later in the tournament.

Demand for short-term rentals has already skyrocketed as prospective spectators take to travel sites and plan their World Cup experience.

Now, a report from Airbnb and Deloitte found the tournament could drive as much as $70 million for the accommodation sector in Atlanta — and you can get a piece.

""Tourists' spending initiates a chain reaction throughout the economy, starting with direct impacts on sectors such as accommodations and restaurants. As businesses respond to this increased demand, indirect effects ripple throughout the supply chain,"" according to the report. ""Additionally, induced effects arise as higher wages circulate within the economies, further stimulating economic activity across different sectors.""

The full impact of this ""multiplier effect"" will be clear during the World Cup, where Deloitte estimates the city will see $23 million in direct impact to the hospitality industry by Airbnb guests, but an additional $24 million in indirect financial gains and $23 million in induced gains, bringing a total positive impact on the sector to $70 million.

Airbnb guests will not only bring money to their accommodations, but also to restaurants and bars, cultural activities, retail spaces and private and public transit, according to the report.

Airbnb rental availability is directly impacted by how many Atlanta residents are willing to rent their apartments or homes, but there is a clear financial incentive.

More than 200,000 people will be looking for a place to stay during the World Cup, including at least 6,000 Airbnb rentals. Guests are expected to spend an accumulated 45,000 guest nights in the city.

Deloitte and Airbnb estimate each guest will spend about $500 a night during their stay, primarily within the city or the neighborhoods just outside of the perimeter.

That money isn't just going to Airbnb, but a majority portion goes into the pockets of hosts.

""We project total host earnings in Atlanta and surrounding areas during the World Cup to reach nearly ($3 million), resulting in an average earnings per host of approximately ($3,700) over the event duration. These earnings could be particularly impactful for women, who represent 59% of Airbnb hosts in the USA, and for seniors, who represent 20% of hosts,"" according to the report.

In the days after the group stage matches were set for the World Cup, global flight interest for Atlanta was up 154%, according to a report from KAYAK. Travel searches for U.S.-bound trips was also up more than 200%, the company said.

Flight interest for Atlanta for the same time period domestically was also up more than 70% from the previous year, KAYAK said.

The same report found that hotels had increased their prices in Atlanta by 59% for the period of the World Cup, averaging about $319 per night. This means both U.S. and international travelers may be turning to sites like Airbnb and VRBO for their stay.

Teams and fans from Spain, Cabo Verde, South Africa, Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Haiti, Uzbekistan, Congo, Jamaica and New Caledonia could all make appearances in Atlanta.

North Texas now knows exactly what the world will be watching. Following the official FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw, the full match schedule confirms that Dallas Stadium in Arlington will host a tournament-high nine matches, including a semifinal on July 14, 2026, cementing the region's role as a central hub of the world's biggest sporting event.

According to FIFA, the expanded 2026 tournament will feature 104 matches across 16 host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Dallas Stadium will host more matches than any other venue, welcoming eight national teams during the group stage and continuing through multiple knockout rounds.

Group stage play in Arlington will feature Argentina, Austria, Croatia, England, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands and the winner of European Play-off Final B, which will be decided in March 2026.

“We are thrilled with the teams selected to play at Dallas Stadium in Arlington,” said Monica Paul, president of the North Texas FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee, during the press conference following the draw held on Dec. 9. “Hosting a tournament-high nine matches featuring some of the world's best players will be an unforgettable experience for fans across our region.”

Five group stage matches will be played in Arlington, drawing global attention throughout June 2026:

Kickoff times were finalized as part of the global schedule to balance team recovery, travel and worldwide viewership, according to FIFA.

Dallas Stadium's role will extend well beyond group play. The venue will host two Round of 32 matches on June 30 and July 3, followed by a Round of 16 match on July 6. The run culminates with a semifinal on July 14, placing North Texas squarely in the spotlight during the tournament's final stretch.

“This is a special and historic time,” said Dan Hunt, FIFA World Cup co-chair and president of FC Dallas, during the press conference. “We have the greatest match schedule I've ever seen at a World Cup in the group stages.”

Beyond matchdays, North Texas will serve as a major operational center for the tournament. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas will host the International Broadcast Center, while cities across the region, including Frisco, are being evaluated as team base camps.

“We truly are the epicenter of World Cup 2026,” Hunt said. “We have nine matches, a semifinal, the International Broadcast Center and all of these base camps.”

Chad Estis, executive vice president of business operations for the Dallas Cowboys, said the stadium was designed with moments like this in mind. “This was the vision of the building back in the early 2000s,” Estis said. “We're excited to show the world what this stadium can be.”

Fans will soon have another chance to secure tickets. FIFA's next sales phase, the Random Selection Draw, opened Dec. 11 and runs through Jan. 13, 2026, at FIFA.com/tickets. According to FIFA, entry timing during the window does not affect selection chances, with successful applicants notified and charged in February.

Hospitality packages that include match tickets are already available through FIFA's official provider, On Location.

With schedules set and teams confirmed, preparations across North Texas are shifting into high gear. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Paul said. “Not just for soccer, but for the future of our region.”

Barcelona have reportedly identified Borussia Dortmund defender Julian Ryerson as a shock transfer target to bolster their defensive options. The Catalan giants are scouring the market for reinforcements amid growing fears that Manchester City could launch a swoop for Jules Kounde, forcing Hansi Flick to draw up contingency plans for the right-back position.

Flick is reportedly looking to raid the Bundesliga for defensive reinforcements, with Ryerson emerging as a surprise candidate to strengthen the Spanish league leaders' backline. The German head coach, who maintains a close eye on football in his homeland, is said to be an admirer of the Norwegian international's industrious style of play and versatility.

According to reports from Sky Sport, the Catalan club have placed the 28-year-old on their shortlist of potential targets as they look to add depth to their defensive unit and have already opened talks with his representatives to sound out his interest in a move. 

The report indicates that Barcelona's sporting department values the profile of the Dortmund man highly. Since joining the Black and Yellows from Union Berlin in January 2023, Ryerson has established himself as a fan favourite at Signal Iduna Park. Known for his tireless work rate, defensive solidity, and aggression in duels, he has become a staple in the starting XI, often keeping more high-profile names out of the team.

Flick is understood to appreciate players who offer tactical discipline and physical intensity, traits that the Norwegian possesses in abundance. While he may not offer the same attacking flair as some of the modern full-backs the Blaugrana have fielded in the past, his reliability and ability to play on both the right and left flanks make him a valuable asset for a squad competing on multiple fronts.

The urgency to recruit a right-back has been heightened by the uncertain future of Jules Kounde. Although the Frenchman has performed admirably on the right side of the defence for both club and country, he has made no secret of his preference to play as a central defender. His performances have reportedly caught the eye of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, who had shown interest in him in the previous transfer window.

He ended up signing a new contract, suggesting his long-term future lies with the Camp Nou club, though City returning for him has not been ruled out. Even if Kounde stays, the lack of a natural, experienced alternative in the squad is a concern for Flick and the club hierarchy is reportedly keen to bring in a seasoned professional who can rotate with the former Sevilla man or step in should he be sold to alleviate the club's well-documented financial issues.

Ryerson represents a potentially cost-effective solution for Barcelona. Unlike other high-profile targets who would command astronomical transfer fees, the full-back could be available for a more modest sum. His contract with Dortmund runs until the summer of 2028, but the report states Dortmund do not have a massive asking price.

Dortmund would likely be reluctant to lose a player described as a ""hero"" by the Yellow Wall for his commitment and fighting spirit. Ryerson was instrumental in the club's run to the Champions League final in 2023-24, proving he can handle the pressure of the biggest stages in European football. However, the allure of playing for Barcelona, combined with the opportunity to work under a manager of Flick's pedigree, could prove difficult for the player to turn down.

One of the key factors driving the interest is the player's ability to play multiple positions. While primarily a right-back, he has frequently been deployed as a left-back during his time in Germany. This two-footedness and tactical flexibility would allow Flick to cover two positions with a single signing, a crucial factor for a squad that has often been stretched thin by injuries.

The Sky Sport report suggests that while no formal offer has been made, the interest is concrete. Barcelona scouts have been monitoring Ryerson's performances throughout the current campaign. With the January transfer window approaching, it remains to be seen whether the reigning Spanish champions will test Dortmund's resolve immediately or wait until the summer to launch their pursuit.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Aaron Ramsey reveals 'surprise' over Pumas ripping up his Liga MX contract amid missing dog ordeal as ex-Arsenal star left with 'no choice' but to return to Wales","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/aaron-ramsey-surprise-pumas-ripping-up-liga-mx-contract-missing-dog-ex-arsenal-star-wales/blt0008942ea1c6ba06","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 09:01:33 GMT","

Former Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has, after enduring a missing dog ordeal in Mexico, aired his surprise at seeing Liga MX side Pumas rip up his contract. The Wales international played just six games for the Central American outfit after stepping out of his comfort zone in Europe. He returned to the UK after seeing his beloved pet go missing in October.

Ramsey, who has struggled to steer clear of injury over the course of his career, picked up a hamstring complaint prior to seeing his dog Halo disappear - in what his family called a “haunting” experience.

Personal problems made life difficult for Ramsey in Mexico, but he was tied to a one-year deal through to the summer of 2026. It was reported following his decision to head back to his homeland that said terms had been terminated by mutual consent.

Ramsey has now confirmed that his deal was torn up, leaving him with “no choice” but to settle again in Wales. The 34-year-old maintains that, despite his issues on and off the field, his release came as a shock to the system.

He has posted on Instagram: “I would like to thank the Mexican people for their kindness and generosity and making me and my family feel so welcome in Mexico City. I also want to give a big thanks to the manager, the coaching staff and particularly the medical staff for helping me through what was a difficult time with injuries.

“However with their help and a lot of hard work I was ready and match fit for the remaining games and I was looking forward to giving my best to the Pumas. Unfortunately my contract was terminated which was a surprise and obviously disappointing. Therefore I had no choice but to come home to Wales. Thank you again for all the support through the time we spent in Mexico. It's a beautiful place and we will definitely come back to visit soon.”

Ramsey took in a brief stint as player-manager of Cardiff at the end of the 2024-25 campaign. He had returned to his roots after spending time in Italy with Serie A giants Juventus and France with Nice.

Eyebrows were raised when he headed to Mexico in July. A matter of months after that move was made, his pet beagle - who was last seen in San Miguel de Allende, in the Guanajuato region - went missing.

Ramsey offered a $20,000 (£15,000) reward to anyone that could help to track down the hound, with Halo's disappearance from a shelter causing confusion and anger. Ramsey has posted: “We've remained quiet trying to understand how you can leave your dog on a ranch and never see her again. Without any explanation? The cameras weren't recording, a tracker couldn't find her, no sightings, no body, and a pile of lies.”

Pumas boss Efrain Juarez said when asked about Ramsey's situation: “We're monitoring it. I said it on Wednesday - let's see what happens in the coming days. He's dealing with his situation, which we all know about, involving his dog. Also, there was an issue before he left during the FIFA break. So, we'll have to wait and see what happens in the next few days.”

It has now been revealed that Ramsey will not be heading back to Mexico City, with a forgettable and distressing saga being brought to a close. His last appearance for Pumas came in a 4-1 defeat to America at the end of September.

An injury picked up at that time prevented him from joining up with the Wales squad and making more appearances at club level. He is now a free agent again and on the look out for another contract.

Ramsey, who is captain of his country, has earned 86 caps for Wales. He helped them to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and will be hoping to grace next summer's World Cup finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico - with Craig Bellamy's side preparing for a play-off semi-final clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina in March.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ex-Arsenal star finds new club! Ajax sign former Gunner Takehiro Tomiyasu on free transfer","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ajax-sign-takehiro-tomiyasu-arsenal/bltc846047910db2c92","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:02:03 GMT","

Japanese international defender Takehiro Tomiyasu has officially joined Dutch club Ajax on a short-term contract, seeking to rebuild his career after a challenging period with injuries at Arsenal. The 27-year-old was a free agent after mutually agreeing to terminate his deal with the Gunners in July of this year. 

Tomiyasu's time in London was significantly impacted by recurring fitness issues, culminating in knee surgery in February that ruled him out for most of the 2024-2025 season. He managed 84 appearances for the Gunners in total following his 2021 transfer from Bologna. Tomiyasu has signed a six-month ""prove-it"" deal with Ajax, running until June next year, with reports suggesting his earnings will be linked to the number of appearances he makes. This arrangement minimises risk for the Dutch giants while offering the player a clear path to consistent playing time once fit. 

On leaving the Gunners, he took to Instagram to say: ""After four unforgettable years, the time has come for me to say goodbye to this incredible club. Obviously, I have got many things to say, but the thing that I want to tell you guys the most is just thank you for the love you guys gave me.  

""ARIGATO and all the best, Tomi.""

Now back in training, the versatile defender, capable of playing at right-back or centre-back, aims to regain match sharpness and put himself back in contention for the Japan national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Ajax Director of Football Marijn Beuker has praised the signing, noting Tomiyasu's experience and ability to add balance to the team's relatively young squad. The move is seen as a strategic opportunity for both the player - with the tournament in the USA, Canada and Mexico on the horizon - and the club.

Beuker said: ""Takehiro has proven himself to be an excellent defender with extensive experience in several top leagues. He is an intelligent, two-footed defender. Together with the scouting department and the coaching staff, we have reviewed a lot of footage of him in recent weeks, and everyone is enthusiastic. His injury history was also an important consideration. From the outset, he has worked hard on his recovery, the medical staff have assessed him thoroughly, and once his work permit is finalised, he can immediately join group training. 

""Although he still needs to regain match sharpness, we believe that, given his experience, he will pick this up almost straight away. Contractually, we have also found a good way to enter into a collaboration together. All in all, we expect that with Takehiro we have brought in a player who can bring more balance to our relatively young, but very talented squad in the short term.""

Tomiyasu arrives at Ajax with the club in dire straits as, despite a recent uptick in results, the club has endured a woeful start to the season, marked by managerial upheaval and disappointing results in Europe. In the Eredivisie, Ajax are currently in third place, but sit a distant 14 points behind league leaders PSV Eindhoven. Results in the Champions League have been even worse with the Amsterdam side sitting 34th in the 36-team league phase, having lost five of their six games so far, though they recently secured a 4-2 victory over Qarabag. 

Off the pitch, the club sacked head coach Johnny Heitinga in November 2025, appointing Fred Grim as caretaker manager. Fan unrest has also been a problem, leading to a match abandonment due to fireworks being let off before the match with Groningen. After the game was called off, a club statement said: ""Ajax considers what happened in the stadium this evening to be utterly outrageous. We offer our apologies to everyone who has been affected in any way. The safety of spectators and players has been put at risk. That is unacceptable. We emphatically distance ourselves from this misconduct. Fireworks do not belong in the stadium.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Pep Guardiola remarked last month that no one wins the title in November, and Manchester City's chasing down of Arsenal in the ensuing weeks has proven him right. The Gunners might still be out in front, but despite often feeling like a team in transition, City are showing many hallmarks of their ruthless title-winning seasons while cracks are showing in their rivals' campaign.

City have won five of their six league games to accrue 15 points since Guardiola sent out his warning to Arsenal, while Mikel Arteta's side have surrendered seven. Aston Villa have been on a perfect run in that period to emerge as the third force in the title shake-up, although recent history, plus Villa's lack of strength-in-depth, suggests this will ultimately be a two-horse race between City and Arsenal. 

And even though both sides ended up taking three points at the weekend, the scorelines and contrasting manners in which they won against opponents of very different magnitude suggest that City are coming into their own just at the right time, while Arsenal are already showing signs that they are wobbling.

While City travelled to a Crystal Palace side that began the weekend in fourth place and had only lost once at Selhurst Park this season, Arsenal were at home to a Wolves team that are currently the worst in Premier League history in statistical terms. It was far from comfortable for City at Selhurst Park as the Eagles twice hit the woodwork, but by the end of the 3-0 victory it looked very easy indeed, recording the club's biggest-ever win away to Palace.

Arsenal, meanwhile, needed two own goals, including one in the 93rd minute, to scrape past Wolves. No one at City envisages anything other than another closely-run title race, and they know, as no doubt Arsenal do, that they are often much stronger in the second half of the season. And despite the problems they have had, including losing two of their first three games, Guardiola's team are now exactly where they want to be.

City were six points behind Arsenal in early November when Guardiola was asked about the Gunners' early charge. He was highly complimentary of Arteta's side at first when he said, ""In the last two or three years in terms of rebuilding a club and a team, then they are there [at the top]. It is exceptional what they are doing and did already for two or three seasons. It looks like every time it is closer and closer.""

Then he sought to get into their heads: ""But we are in early November and in early November no-one wins the title. You can lose it, but you cannot win it.""

That last line was particularly pertinent, as City had gone into November last season in rampant form, unbeaten after dropping just four points in their first nine games. Then came the mother of all hiccups as they lost four matches in a row by an aggregate scoreline of 10-2. 

The last defeat in that sequence was at Liverpool on December 1, after which Guardiola conceded that his side had no chance of catching the Reds and raised six fingers to the baying Anfield faithful - one for each title won - to comfort himself.

In Guardiola's first season, City survived November but had a dismal December, losing three out of their six games, including at home to eventual title winners Chelsea. The message to his team in that press conference in November was clear: Don't let Arsenal run away with it. And City have not. They have chopped a six-point deficit (which actually rose to seven by the end of the month) down to two.

Their latest run of four consecutive wins has not been without drama or concerning moments, with Phil Foden having to rescue the three points after a second-half capitulation against Leeds United before City shipped three goals at Fulham to turn a comfortable 5-1 scoreline into a twitchy 5-4. 

Back-to-back 3-0 wins over Sunderland and Palace have further boosted confidence and left City with something unexpected given their concerning start to the season. They have 34 points from their 16 games, more than in any of their previous four campaigns at the same stage of the season, including when they won the treble in 2022-23 and when they secured a historic fourth successive crown in 2024.

And the bad news for Arsenal is City are nearly always stronger in the second half of the season than the first. Guardiola and his staff deliberately plan the campaign with the objective of the players being as fresh as possible for the business end, and their record in the final 19 games of each season compared to the first 19 says it all. 

City have accrued more points in the second half of the season in five of the last seven years, and on one of the two occasions they were not stronger in the back end, in 2022-23, they eased up after winning the title with three games to spare. The 2017-18 season, when City amassed a record 100 points, is an anomaly as City steamrolled their rivals from the very start. But in every other campaign bar two, they have improved markedly in the back end.

In 2018-19, they were third at the halfway stage of the season but went on to take an astonishing 54 points from a possible 57, pipping Liverpool to the title by a singe point. In the 2023-24 season, they reeled Arsenal back with a similarly ruthless run, winning 16 out of 19 games while remaining unbeaten to to accrue 51 points. The previous season they also overhauled the Gunners, winning 12 matches in a row to make up an eight-point deficit. They earned 44 points from their final 19 games, with the important caveat that they eased up in their final two matches, a draw at Brighton and defeat at Brentford.

The year before that, when City saw off Liverpool in another thrilling toe-to-toe race, they took 46 points in the second half of the season. That was admittedly one point fewer than in the first half, but it was still an astonishing haul, the third-highest under Guardiola. In the latter half of 2020-21, the first season of that record breaking cycle of four successive crowns, they took 45 points. Even last season, when City returned their lowest points total of the Guardiola era, they roared back, taking 40 points compared to 31 in the first half to finish third. City are well aware of their history of strong finishes, too.

""It's true that our teams have always been much better in the second part of the season than the first, and hopefully it happens again this season,"" said Bernardo Silva last week in Madrid. ""In the first month, we beat Wolves and then lost to Brighton and Spurs in performances that were not acceptable at our level. When you go to the first international break with one win and two losses, that means you're not at the Man City level. If you look at the last two months, I would say that points-wise, it has been really good.""

Bernardo is one of three players still in the squad (along with Foden and John Stones) to have won all six titles under Guardiola, while Ruben Dias and Rodri have lifted four.

You could say that City have lost some of that experience which has proved so vital to getting them over the line before by parting with the likes of Kyle Walker, Kevin De Bruyne, Ederson and Ilkay Gundogan. But they have gained a host of young players, such as Rayan Cherki, Nico Gonzalez and Nico O'Reilly, who are desperate to win their first major titles and start building a dynasty of their own. As Bernardo put it: ""The club made the decision to change a lot of players and give a new dynamic. It's a different team, full of potential, full of energy."" 

After beating Palace, Guardiola emphasised that City had not been at their best, but said they were getting closer: ""Still we're not at our top; we see it in some moments during the season. But every time, we can be better and better. We are not in an ideal position, we prefer to be first, but we are close to the top of the league.""

For Arsenal, it sounded like a threat.

The scariest thing of all for the Gunners is that City are about to regain one of their most experienced and most pivotal players: Rodri. The Spain midfielder's absence gets mentioned a lot when City do not win, and the fact that they have managed to keep Arsenal within striking range while missing him for more than two months shows that they are not as dependent on Rodri as before. 

The thought of him returning for the second half of the season, when nearly every other player will be entering their peak, only makes the prospect of City toppling Arsenal again seem more inevitable.

The Gunners have had to contend with many injuries in this period, with Gabriel Magalhaes' absence weighing the heaviest. They will be a stronger unit when he resumes playing at the start of 2026, if not before, and they will be further boosted by Kai Havertz's imminent return. 

But given how they have been chased down by City twice before, they should fear another resurgence. After all, City have already got more points than they had at the same stage in those two seasons - and they are only just getting started.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Atletico Madrid icon Saul Niguez has sparked controversy by claiming bitter rivals Real Madrid have ""no fans"" compared to his current club Flamengo. The midfielder, now playing under former teammate Filipe Luis in Brazil, launched a stinging attack on the Bernabeu atmosphere while praising the passion of the South American giants ahead of their clash with Paris Saint-Germain.

The former Atletico midfielder has reignited the Madrid derby from across the Atlantic, launching a scathing assessment of Real's fanbase while comparing it unfavourably to the support he now receives at Flamengo. The 31-year-old, who made the switch to Rio de Janeiro to reunite with his former teammate and current head coach Filipe Luis, did not hold back in his praise for the Brazilian giants, insisting they dwarf the reigning European champions in terms of genuine passion.

Saul, who spent over a decade at the Metropolitano and made more than 400 appearances for Los Colchoneros, is currently preparing for a high-stakes final against PSG. However, in the build-up to the showpiece event, he took the opportunity to aim a dig at his old crosstown rivals, suggesting that the Santiago Bernabeu lacks the soul found at the Maracana.

Speaking to Spanish outlet AS ahead of the upcoming final, the Spaniard was asked to compare the stature of the two clubs. His response was blunt, claiming that while Los Blancos possess global fame, they lack the visceral connection with their supporters that defines South American football.

""It is more than Madrid,"" he stated when asked if Flamengo is comparable to the Spanish giants. ""In reality, Madrid has no fans. Madrid is famous, yes, for what it has won and it is known all over the world and that is why it has followers. But you go to the stadium and you feel nothing.""

The comments are sure to rile the Madridistas, particularly coming from a player who was a central figure in Diego Simeone's side during the height of their rivalry. He contrasted the ""silent"" nature of the Bernabeu with the deafening noise of his current home ground, emphasising the lengths Brazilian supporters go to follow their team.

""In contrast, you go to the Maracana, an emblematic stadium, and it is always full,"" he explained. ""Away from home, the ground is full of Flamengo fans. We recently played against Sport Recife and they sent us to another stadium because otherwise our fans wouldn't fit. And that's speaking of a flight of three and a half hours duration.

""You go to Lima and our fans fill it 100%. And then you see that Palmeiras doesn't fill it... You say: 'This is a big fanbase'.""

The comments come as the Brazilian side prepare for a monumental clash against PSG in the final of the Intercontinental Cup this December. The match pits the midfielder against a familiar face in Luis Enrique, the manager who handed him several caps during his tenure as Spain head coach.

He was full of praise for the Asturian tactician, acknowledging the transformation the Ligue 1 champions have undergone since his arrival in the French capital.

""I coincided with him in the national team,"" Saul recalled. ""He has a lot of personality and transmits it to his team. They are young players, but with experience. They know how to adapt to the type of match. Since Luis Enrique has been there, I have watched his matches in Paris and he has many solutions. It is going to be very difficult.""

The relationship between the player and his current manager appears to be the driving force behind the club's recent success. The pair shared a dressing room at Atletico for years, winning La Liga and reaching Champions League finals together. Now, with his former colleague in the dugout, he reveals that the coach is instilling a belief that they are on the verge of something special.

""Filipe always tells us that we are a team prepared to make history, it is his most legendary phrase,"" he revealed. ""We players have to believe it more. At first you see it as further away. The final against PSG is very complicated, but we have hope and desire. We play for the 42 million or more followers that Flamengo has.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Joan Laporta has hit back at Real Madrid president Florentino Perez with a scathing diagnosis, claiming the Spanish capital is suffering from a case of ""acute Barcelonitis"". The Barcelona chief dismissed recent attacks regarding the Negreira scandal as proof of an obsession, suggesting Los Blancos are more concerned with their rivals than their own internal issues.

The war of words between Spain's two footballing superpowers has reached a fever pitch, with Barcelona president Laporta launching a sarcastic yet stinging counter-attack against his counterpart at the Santiago Bernabeu. Just days after Real Madrid president Florentino Perez delivered a blistering address to his club's members, describing the 'Negreira Case' as the biggest scandal in football history, Laporta has laughed off the aggression, diagnosing the reigning European champions with a severe complex regarding the Catalan giants.

The relationship between the two clubs, which had recently been defined by a convenient alliance over the European Super League project, appears to have completely fractured. Following Perez's ""scorched earth"" speech in which he attacked Barcelona, La Liga, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and the media, Laporta faced the press to offer his own medical assessment of the situation in the capital.

Speaking to reporters, the Blaugrana supremo suggested that Real Madrid's relentless focus on Barcelona's legal troubles is symptomatic of a deeper psychological issue within the 'heart' of their fanbase. Far from being intimidated by Madrid's private prosecution in the Negreira case or Perez's public denunciations, Laporta claimed the obsession has now mutated into something chronic.

""Before it was 'Barcelonitis', but now it is 'acute Barcelonitis',"" Laporta declared. ""I see that Barcelonitis is installed in the heart of Madrid fans.""

When pressed on why he believes Madrid have adopted such an aggressive stance recently, Laporta shrugged off the specific legal arguments and pointed instead to the mental state of their rivals.

""Ask them,"" he retorted. ""What I see is that they have acute Barcelonitis, and this suits us fine.""

In Laporta's view, the noise coming from the Bernabeu is actually a positive signal for his own club. He argued that if Real Madrid are spending their General Assemblies dissecting Barcelona's history and legal battles, they are neglecting their own house.

""It means that they are more worried about us than what they really have to worry about,"" he added, suggesting that the distraction will ultimately cost Los Blancos on the pitch.

Perhaps the most revealing part of Laporta's rebuttal was his explanation for why the tone has shifted so dramatically. For several years, Laporta and Perez were strange bedfellows, united against UEFA and La Liga president Javier Tebas in their pursuit of the European Super League. They stood shoulder-to-shoulder as the last two holdouts of the breakaway project.

However, Laporta hinted that this alliance is now dead in the water, and that Madrid's renewed hostility stems from Barcelona's decision to pivot back towards the establishment.

""If the discourse has changed, it is possibly because a year ago there were certain coincidences in some projects and now, seeing that this project has not borne fruit, has not gelled,"" Laporta explained, alluding to the stalled Super League plans.

He confirmed that Barcelona are now actively seeking to repair their relationship with European football's governing body, leaving Real Madrid isolated in their rebellion. ""We have a clear positioning of reaching an agreement with UEFA and I think it is best for our club,"" he stated. This strategic divergence appears to have removed the diplomatic muzzle that was previously keeping Perez from fully unleashing his fury over the Negreira scandal.

Laporta's comments come in direct response to Perez's assertion that ""the truth must be known"" regarding the payments Barcelona made to former refereeing official Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira. Perez had told Madrid members that it was ""madness"" that there had been no sporting consequences for Barca paying over €7 million to a vice-president of the Technical Committee of Referees over an 18-year period.

While Madrid manager Xabi Alonso backed his president by claiming the lack of punishment ""surprises people abroad,"" Laporta remains unmoved. He views the constant barrage of criticism from Madrid not as a pursuit of justice, but as a tactic to destabilise his team, a tactic he welcomes.

""Let them keep talking constantly about Barça from the capital, from our eternal rival,"" Laporta concluded with a message of defiance. ""Acute Barcelonitis suits us fine.""

As the legal proceedings concerning the Negreira case continue to wind through the Spanish courts, the diplomatic ceasefire between El Clasico rivals is definitively over. With Madrid demanding ""justice"" and Barca diagnosing ""obsession,"" the stage is set for a season where the battles in the boardroom are just as fierce as those on the pitch.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The ATP has today announced the renewal of its long-standing partnership with Rolex. The Swiss watchmaker continues as the Official Timekeeper and Gold Partner of the ATP.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Can young gun Engel come of age in Jeddah?","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/engel-next-gen-atp-finals-2025-feature-tuesday","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:23:20 GMT","

Being the youngest player in the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF field has historically been a promising sign. Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, and Joao Fonseca all lifted the trophy as the youngest participants in their respective draws at the event in 2019, 2021 and 2024, and this week, Justin Engel will aim to follow in their footsteps.

The 18-year-old German is the youngest competitor in the eight-man draw, having secured his spot in the tournament after a successful season that included an ATP Challenger Tour title in Hamburg. So, does being the youngest alleviate any pressure? Not for Engel, who, with refreshing confidence, told ATPTour.com on Silver Sands Beach in Jeddah that he doesn't feel pressure.

“I never have pressure,” Engel said during Monday's media day. “Of course, I get a little nervous before matches, but that's normal. If you're not nervous, you're not taking your sport seriously. But pressure? No, I don't feel that.”

Twelve months ago, Fonseca, then 18, was both the lowest-ranked and youngest player in the draw. Yet he powered through his opponents to leave Jeddah with the title, setting the stage for his rapid rise. The Brazilian built on that breakthrough triumph by winning two ATP Tour titles in 2025 and climbing to a career-high No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Engel is aware of potential comparisons if he were to go deep in Jeddah, especially since he recently became the second-youngest player after Rafael Nadal to win a tour-level match on all three surfaces. However, he remains firmly focused on his own path.

“I don't really look at what they have done. They won this tournament, but I don't really think much about it,” Engel said. “I just try to play my best tennis and go on court and have fun, that's the focus.”

Engel's love for tennis began at the age of three in Nuremberg, where he grew up idolising Nadal. In 2024, he secured his maiden tour-level win in Almaty, marking a significant milestone in his career. The No. 187 player in the PIF ATP Rankings built on this success with a victory on clay in Hamburg and an impressive quarter-final run at the ATP 250 grass-court event in Stuttgart, showcasing his versatility across surfaces.
“The fans really made a difference for me in Germany, especially in Stuttgart and Hamburg,"" Engel said. ""Playing in front of them was incredible. Hamburg was my favourite tournament because it's an ATP 500, and winning against one of my friends, Jan-Lennard Struff, made it even more special. That period was a real boost for me.”
In Saudi Arabia, Engel will hope to bring his best when he meets Alexander Blockx, Dino Prizmic, and Nishesh Basavareddy in the round-robin stage, starting on Wednesday against Blockx.

It was back to school – albeit briefly – for players in Jeddah Tuesday.

One day ahead of the start of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, the eight competitors gathered for a briefing detailing the innovations, rule changes, history and purpose of the tournament, which annually showcases the sport's best 20-and-under players. 

""It's nice to be here and to know every rule and also all the things that the staff and everyone behind this big tournament have done for us over the whole year,” said Spain's Martin Landaluce, who will make his Jeddah debut after serving as last year's alternate. “It's nice to be here and to meet the people who are working to make our life better.” 

The innovative tournament, first staged in Milan in 2017, features five sets of first-to-four games, reduced time between points, expanded free fan movement, video review and a reduced three-minute warm-up.








A shot clock will keep matches flowing, with no more than eight seconds allowed between first and second serves and a limit of 15 seconds between points that end in fewer than three shots. 

 “I like the rules,” Landaluce said. “I like to play to four games; it makes the game dynamic and makes players try to start better and be more energetic."" 

Players and coaches will have comprehensive data insights available to fine-tune tactics. Live access to ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF data that tracks player performance will be available on tablets provided in courtside team boxes, allowing coaches to communicate takeaways to players during matches as part of the normal on-court coaching protocol. 

Players and coaches will receive video footage tagged with match data post-match. A dedicated tennis analyst is on site for individual education sessions with teams. 

More in-arena match statistics and data analytics will be available to fans. 

 “Sport is increasingly data driven, so providing these stats and analytics to players, teams and fans represents the future direction of the game,” said Tournament Director Adam Hogg.

Iconic Oscar Piastri onboards

Iconic Lando Norris onboards

Oscar Piastri missed out on becoming champion in his third F1 season, finishing behind Lando Norris and Max Verstappen.

Oscar Piastri believes that the lessons he took from engaging in a tense title battle will help him become a better driver in the future, despite losing out in the season finale to his McLaren team mate Lando Norris.

Norris became the 11th Briton to become World Champion after he finished third at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which was enough for him to secure the title by two points over Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

However, it was Piastri who led the standings for the majority of the year. At one stage, he held an advantage of 34 points over his team mate, but a downturn in performance in later rounds culminated in him dropping to third, finishing 13 points behind Norris.

The pair both achieved seven wins, leaving the Australian keen to focus on how much he has improved in just three seasons, and identify how to continue that development to pursue his maiden championship.

Speaking after the season finale, he said: “I think, obviously, I would have wished for a slightly different ending, but I think this year I've learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person.

“I think if you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that.

“And I think even in the tough moments, I've learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future.

“So, I think, ultimately, there's a little bit of disappointment, obviously, but I think I can be very proud of the season I've had and plenty of lessons to take to the future.”

After claiming his first win at the 2024 Hungarian Grand Prix, Piastri quickly settled into being a title contender in the opening half of this season, taking six victories before the summer break as McLaren became the team to beat.

However, he went on to suffer a run of six rounds without standing on the podium, including a rare crash in Azerbaijan and a tough disqualification for both him and Norris in Las Vegas, which allowed both the Briton and Verstappen to leapfrog Piastri in the standings.

He bounced back with a near-perfect weekend in Qatar, before a misjudged strategy call saw him lose out on another win to the Red Bull driver. But ending the year on a relative high with second place in Abu Dhabi helped him focus on taking the positives from the rollercoaster season.

“When I look at this season compared to my first two years in F1, this year has been head and shoulders above the first two,” he said. “Ultimately, whilst the end result is not quite what I wanted, there's a lot of optimism and a lot of strength that I've gained from proving to myself what I can achieve through this season.

“Those are the kinds of things that are not necessarily tied to results. So I think for me, I can definitely take that forward into the future. It's only my third attempt at this in F1. Hopefully, I've got plenty more to go, but there are definitely lessons from this year that will only make me stronger.

“There've definitely been lessons directly to do with how I drive the car, how I can be better in different conditions, and just become a better all-round driver. There have also been lessons outside the car – dealing with adversity, dealing with difficult moments.

“I've learned a lot about myself in those kinds of things. So, there have been lessons both in and out of the car that will definitely help me for the future.”

Iconic Oscar Piastri onboards

Iconic Lando Norris onboards

Lawrence Barretto's new F1 TV series Off The Grid sees him spending time with the great and the good of the F1 paddock away from the racetrack. In the second episode, he heads to Milan to meet Alpine's Pierre Gasly.

When a Formula 1 driver arrives at a racetrack, he selects full race mode and puts everything else out of his mind to focus on the day job. Over the course of the last decade covering the sport, that's usually the mode they're engaged in when I get to talk to them through my role as an interviewer for F1. But for a change of pace and as part of an exclusive new series, I headed Off The Grid to hang out with the sport's elite racers away from the office.

In episode two, French racer and Grand Prix winner Pierre Gasly invited me to Milan, the place he now calls home. The 29-year-old, who like his rival Oscar Piastri in episode one gave up one of his rare days off to take part in filming (rather than via mandatory team media or commercial time), talks about the pain of losing one of his closest friends, his demotion from Red Bull and resurgence at AlphaTauri, his relationship with fellow French racer Esteban Ocon and the next chapter with Alpine.

Pierre Gasly's grandmother was a regional kart champion, his grandfather competed, too. So it's perhaps no surprise that Gasly found himself sat behind the wheel of a kart, which he borrowed from Ocon, when he was six and instantly fell in love with it.

""The speed, the fear, the adrenaline I felt on that day was so strong, I can still remember it even if it was 23 years ago,"" he says when we chat on his very comfortable sofa in his Milan apartment. ""I fell in love with the sport straightaway.""

The Frenchman battled his way through the junior ranks, catching the eye of Red Bull, who brought him into the family as part of their junior programme. He went on to win GP2 – the feeder series to Formula 1 at the time – in his second full-time campaign, and hoped that that would be enough to earn promotion to a Formula 1 seat. Unfortunately, he missed out.

""It was so hard to take as I was told, 'If you win the GP2 championship you are going to get a shot in Formula 1',"" he says. ""It was like a slam in my face. I thought, 'Okay, what do I need to do more?' I kept the mentality that I would get my shot.""

Gasly kept his head down, focused on the testing opportunities he got with Red Bull and Toro Rosso – and then the phone rang. It was Dr Helmut Marko, Red Bull's recently-departed motorsport advisor.

""I remember I was jumping on my bed in Malaysia,"" he says. ""I went as a reserve for Red Bull. He called me to say get ready – this weekend, you are racing. When I got the shot, I was the happiest. I remember going on the grid and knowing I'm given this chance, now it's in my hands, I have the car, the team, the people – now it's up to me and I'm in control.

""I did four or five races in 2017, and then I started the season in 2018. In the second race, bang – P4 in Bahrain. It created straight away massive hype. Right after Budapest, Daniel [Ricciardo] announced he was leaving [Red Bull]. I remember arriving in Greece for my holiday, and it was like, 'Whoa, Daniel is going'.

""Red Bull had Carlos Sainz as an option and they had me. It's between Sainz and myself. The phone rang and Helmut told me 'Okay, you're a Red Bull Racing driver at start of next year – this was six months into my first [full] season in F1.""

We take a break from filming to have a tour around his very tidy apartment. The carpets were all ripped up shortly after he and his girlfriend got their dog Simba. The smooth floors provide endless entertainment for Simba as he excitedly zooms around the apartment on the slippery surface as Gasly shows us around. His balcony offers stunning views across Milan – and is where he often hangs out with friends when he gets some downtime between races.

He's got a games room, complete with simulator and framed shirts of his favourite footballers, including Lionel Messi, who he met while on holiday. Gasly is big into football, so much so, he became a co-owner of French third division club FC Versailles.

We switch back to chat mode – and get into his unfortunately short stint at Red Bull. ""I'm not going to lie, it was sad,"" he says. ""2019, my second year in Formula 1 – there was no support from anywhere, in a very big team which is very much supporting Max [Verstappen] – for good reasons, because he's put on the results.

""But I'm starting with a fresh engineer coming from Formula E who didn't have experience in F1. So it was a strange dynamic. I wasn't really given the tools to really perform. I tried to fight my own way because I wanted, and at the end of the day I'm there to, perform. They were not happy, but I'm not happy too because I could see I couldn't show my potential.""

Gasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso after around six months of racing. ""It almost felt like a relief,"" he says. His first race back was the Belgian Grand Prix and it turned out to be the most intense weekend of his life. Naturally, all the questioning on media day was about his demotion.

""It's not a nice energy,"" he says. ""I'm there to do my thing and try and give my best but it's a lot of negativity. I go through that. I just want to drive. Then came Saturday...""

His friend Anthoine Hubert, with whom he raced in karting from aged nine to around 14, suffered a fatal accident on the second lap of the F2 feature race at Spa, at the same venue where Gasly was set to compete in his first race back with Toro Rosso.

Gasly and Hubert were like brothers growing up. They ate breakfast together, went to class together, trained together. Gasly would do 13 push ups, so Hubert would do 14. They pushed each other to get the very best out of each other.

""Initially, I didn't know who was involved,"" says Gasly, ""It looked bad. The team manager told me Anthoine was involved. As soon as the briefing was done, I ran down to get more info. I saw in the distance my parents just broken in tears. Sadly I understood straight away what had happened.""

He adds: ""You get taught a lot at school and by your parents but you never get told how you're supposed to deal with yourself in this sort of situation. The one thing I regret is that in Budapest after the race [before the summer break], we went to party with Anthoine.

""I didn't want to leave too late. I tried to find him but I couldn't find him. I walked out, I saw him on the terrace. I waved at him and said 'have a good summer and see you at Spa'. I never got to see him again before the crash.

""I just wish I waited a bit longer in the club to hug him or say bye in a slightly different way. It taught me to appreciate the moment we live, with the people we love, and just to never take anything for granted.""

We take a break from the chat to head out onto the streets of Milan in search of Gasly's favourite coffee place. There's naturally a vast selection of sweet treats on offer – and while the Frenchman admits he does take one every now and then, the ones he says he chooses are not much bigger than a Malteser because it won't take him long to burn off on a treadmill.

It's then onto his favourite store in the city for a bit of retail therapy. Gasly loves his fashion, which won't be a surprise if you've ever seen him in his civvies.

""I want to discover other worlds,"" he says. ""The first time I came to Milan, I was staring at how beautiful the people were. The style... everyone is so elegant. I've seen the coolest grandmas walking around town. When you go out, you need to make sure you wear some nice stuff.""

Gasly is a stylish guy. He's also a guy who knows what he wants, so it doesn't take him long to pick out a few pieces.

It's then back to his story. We recall the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he out-dragged Lewis Hamilton to the line to take second – and his first podium. It's a special moment in his life – and one that he is reminded of every day as a painting of that drag race is up on the wall behind his sofa.

""People wrote me off too quickly because they don't know me, they don't know what sort of mindset and mentality I have,"" he says. ""This is my whole life. Thinking of that podium still puts me a smile on my face.""

Gasly is incredibly tough and oozes resilience. That's perhaps not surprising given how much heartache he's endured before he's even turned 30. It's that mental strength that has enabled him to rebuild his career – and led to him achieving his first Grand Prix victory in Monza, the home of his then-AlphaTauri team, in 2020.

“It was incredible, which is why I took that moment on the podium, to process the millions of emotions and thoughts that crossed my mind. I was in my own world. These few seconds, I'll keep with me forever.

""It was a unique moment as it was Covid, so there was no one there. The one year where Monza never looked that empty. It was a bit of a shame, but it gives me a good reason to win again in Monza!""

While Gasly hoped for a shot back at the main Red Bull team, that never looked likely – so when Alpine came calling for 2023, he grasped the opportunity. ""I put pen to paper on Anthoine's birthday,"" says Gasly. ""Anthoine was an Alpine [Academy] driver. Everything fell into place on Anthoine's birthday – I couldn't believe it.""

That put Gasly alongside Ocon at Alpine. The two have history. ""We could make a full documentary about this,"" he says. ""We used to spend Wednesdays and weekends together pretty much every week, him going to my place, me going to his place. We had a strong bond.

""Sadly, there was a turning point in one of the races; it sort of fell apart after that in a dramatic way which is difficult to explain. We know exactly where we come from. We know what we had to go through to make it. We also both know it was actually a good thing that we had that rivalry to push us beyond our potential. I have no doubt that in 10, 20 years we'll be able to talk things out and talk things through in a different way.""

That relationship seems to be improving, as was evidenced when they embraced each other on the podium in Brazil in 2024 after scoring an unlikely double podium for Alpine.

""In the space of eight months, we went from last to getting not one but two cars on the podium,"" he says. ""The faces on the team were priceless. It was one of those races where I'm sure post-career, I'll pinpoint it as very special.""

Gasly has emerged as Alpine's team leader, his most recent contract extension meaning he's set to stay at the team for six years. The hunger to succeed is unwavering – and he firmly believes he has what it takes to reach the very top.

What do the next five years look like for him? ""F1 and hopefully, with Alpine, World Champion!"" he says. ""I know it's difficult for people to process. How can I say that if we're fighting for just a few points, but I believe with the people we have, I can see us fighting at the front.""

Given the way Gasly has fought back from a succession of knockbacks to recover each time, it would be unwise to bet against him. Alpine just need to give him a car that can fight at the sharp end, and then it'll be up to him to deliver.

You can watch the full episode of Off The Grid with Pierre Gasly exclusively on F1 TV now.

As Honda prepare to power Aston Martin from 2026 onwards, the Japanese firm have announced the launch date for their new power unit.

Honda have announced their launch date for the brand new power unit that will be supplied exclusively to Aston Martin from 2026, marking an exciting ""new era"" for both the team and manufacturer.

The Japanese company have drawn a line under their long-standing partnership with Red Bull, which saw them secure a World Championship with Max Verstappen in 2021 before they gradually stepped back, providing support as the team set up their own in-house power unit division.

In 2023, Honda revealed that they would join forces with Aston Martin to coincide with the changing regulations, and they have now confirmed that the power unit will be unveiled in Tokyo on January 20 2026.

The event, which will be livestreamed to fans on YouTube, will feature talks from Toshihiro Mibe, President and CEO of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., Lawrence Stroll, Executive Chairman of Aston Martin, and Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1.

In an official statement, Honda said: ""This is the Japanese marque's first power unit under the dramatically reformed regulations which sees 50% internal combustion power and 50% electric power.

""At this event, we will share the aspirations of Honda and Aston Martin Aramco Formula One™ Team as we take on the challenge of competing in F1, the pinnacle of motorsport. We will also explain the new regulations and reveal our new power unit for the upcoming season.""

Aston Martin have received power units, the gearbox and rear suspension from Mercedes over recent seasons, but have repeatedly outlined their intention to make the most of the upcoming regulation change and return to fighting at the front. This season, they took P7 in the Teams' Standings, with legendary designer Adrian Newey set to take on the role of Team Principal at the start of next year.

He replaces Andy Cowell, who will transition into Chief Strategy Officer and optimise the crucial technical partnership with Honda to set the team on the right path to becoming a frontrunner.

Honda added: ""2026 marks the start of Honda's new era in F1, having first entered in 1964. Since then, Honda has established itself as one of the most successful power unit manufacturers in the sport's history.""

Iconic Lando Norris onboards

Max Verstappen reflects on a season that saw him come up short by just two points in the Drivers' Championship fight.

Max Verstappen has labelled the 2025 season the best he's driven in his career, despite missing out on his fifth World Championship by just two points to McLaren's Lando Norris.

Eventual Teams' Champions McLaren pulled away from their rivals in the first half of the season, with Verstappen only winning two races as Red Bull faced a host of issues with the car that prevented them from maximising their performance.

However, a mighty comeback saw the Dutchman overcome a deficit of 104 points by winning five out of eight Grands Prix before the finale in Abu Dhabi, leaving him 12 points behind Norris heading to Yas Marina.

He needed Norris to finish outside of the podium positions in order to be in with a shot of winning the title – but with Norris taking third place, Verstappen's flawless victory wasn't enough, as he ended the year on 421 points to Norris' 423.

Asked whether, discounting the outcome, he believed this season featured the best performance of his 11 years in the sport, Verstappen replied: “Yeah, I think so. I mean, I have no regrets about my season.

“I think the performance has been strong. I've hated this car at times, but I've also loved it at times. And I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we've had.

“It's been, like I said before, a proper rollercoaster with the car. Luckily, the last, I would say, eight, nine rounds in general have been a lot more enjoyable.

“Also, in the team, we have a great atmosphere at the moment. We're really on a roll – positive energy, belief, confidence – and that's exactly what you want heading into next year.”

The president's remarks were criticized by GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	President Donald Trump spoke out on the deaths of director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, Monday in a post that spurned them for their progressive politics. 


	In the post on Truth Social Monday morning, Trump wrote a “very sad thing happened” to Reiner and his wife but went on to say that it was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.” 




	“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and MIchele rest in peace!,” the post continues. The statement turns what appears to be a homicide into something political, when there's no indication it is.

	The director died at age 78 Sunday along with his wife, Michele, age 70, in their Brentwood home. Their son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and booked on suspicion of murder and is being held without bail. The Los Angeles Police Department has said that the 32-year-old is “responsible” for the homicide of his parents.


	Trump later doubled down on his comments in a press conference in the Oval Office saying that he “wasn't a fan of [Reiner's] at all.”

	











	“He was a deranged person, as far as Trump is concerned,” Trump continued. “He said — he knew it was false, in fact it's the exact opposite — that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia: the Russia hoax, he was one of the people behind it. I think he hurt himself career-wise; he became like a deranged person, Trump Derangement Syndrome.”


	Reiner, the director of When Harry Met Sally, Princess Bride and Stand By Me, among others was also prominent supporter of the Democratic party as well as an activist in his own right, having co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which helped overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage. He also led the campaign to pass Proposition 10, the California Children and Families Initiative, which created a program of early childhood development services. After its passage, he was named the chair of the California Children and Families Commission.


	After Trump's post, many spoke out against him. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who was once a Trump ally but has recently turned to critiquing him, said “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.”


	“Many people deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,” she tweeted.

	Fellow GOP Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also took issue with Trump's comments, calling them “inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”

As the HBO Max-Crave series grows in popularity, the 24-year-old actor is taking his newfound stardom in stride and sharing one reason why the show might be resonating: “If ‘Challengers' was the cocktease of it all, then our show just leans in and gets in there.”


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	It may seem like everything's happened overnight for Heated Rivalry breakout Hudson Williams, but the 24-year-old actor swears it's felt a bit more gradual on his end. 


	“There's no way to prepare for what this side of things looks like,” Williams tells The Hollywood Reporter about his newfound stardom. The actor was in L.A. for the show's first round of in-person U.S. press, and he's in good spirits despite what has to be a long week.




	It's hard to go on the Internet and not see Williams or his co-star, Connor Storrie. The HBO Max–Crave series, based on Rachel Reid's novel of the same name, has been a surprise hit for the streaming services.

	Written and directed for television by Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney, Heated Rivalry follows Williams' Shane Hollander, an anxious and endlessly endearing Canadian hockey prodigy and his rival, Russian phenom Ilya Rozanov, played by Storrie. The show takes audiences along for the ride as the pair navigate a near-decade-long situationship, spanning their entire professional hockey careers.


	Even if things didn't happen overnight, life is looking a different than it used to for Williams. Before taking on Heated Rivalry, he was working as a waiter at The Old Spaghetti Factory in New Westminster, British Columbia. He assures he never once felt better than the job but did feel he was “good enough” at acting that he should be seeing some reward from that front.


	“But I loved it. That was how I paid my rent. It was paycheck to paycheck. Vancouver is more expensive than Los Angeles, so it was very hard,” he says of his old gig. “I had a great outlook. In a lot of ways, it was a lot easier than what it's like now.” 

	











	As Heated Rivalry heads into its penultimate episode, its popularity continues to grow. It was announced last week that it had been renewed for a season two. Williams, however, is proceeding with cautious optimism, looking forward to whatever the future might hold.


	Below, the actor speaks with THR about what he initially thought life would look like after Heated Rivalry, how he deals with negative comments online and what he hopes comes next.


How are you doing? That's a genuine question. I assume you've been a little crazy.


	It is crazy. I feel like I'm a compass on a magnetic field. It's pointing every which way, and I don't know who the hell is right, but I'm very excited. It's very auspicious looking. I was talking with Connor [Storrie] about this. I don't know if someone's going to reach out and be like, “We want you in this new YA show. It's really poorly written, but we think you're perfect.” Or if Luca Guadagnino is going to crawl out of Italy and be like, “I want you.” I don't want to make any assumptions, so I'm just trying to be as calm as I can. But so far, the fan reactions are very nice and mostly wholesome. [I'm] overwhelmed, overscrolling on the socials, so I delete them lots. Every time I post something, I go and delete it again.


Wow, you just delete whole app?


	Connor and I both do that. I deactivate Twitter and fully delete it, and I delete Instagram periodically, always.


Is it because you know you'll look? Are you someone who wants to know?












	Instagram, I don't really have a problem actually. I can just look at it for 10 minutes, and then that's my day. But Twitter's the one [that's a problem] because it's shit posting. People are just thought, or lack of thought, to speech [and] they'll post it. It's still mainly good. I always doubted celebrities when they said, “There are going to be 200 good things, and you'll remember the bad one.” I was like surely that can't be true, and it is true. I also take the bad ones with a grain of salt. Sometimes they're so overtly mean [that] they just make me laugh so hard. Those are the ones I'm sharing with people around me. I think my friends and family sometimes even take joy in really overt assholes. (Laughs.)


Just because it's so ridiculous?


	It's so ridiculous to actually believe these people. To actually go, “Oh my God.” To be offended would be to think they matter. It's like, why be offended? Just kind of laugh.


You now suddenly have a lot of people talking about you on online. It seemed quick from the outside. Do you find it more difficult to deal with because it wasn't as gradual? Or is it simply something you can't prepare for?


	I don't think it's something you can prepare for. I would say to a degree it has been gradual. We saw the fans find us when we were halfway through shooting — they found it through Instagram sleuthing — so it wasn't like, oh, this is a totally normal fan base. It was like, oh, these people can be obsessive. Then I think our Instagrams only went to a few thousand followers. We had a Canadian press [run], which was a little bit more light. We had Montreal day one, which wasn't too crazy. There was a big packed house full of fans, but it wasn't like press, press, press. Then day two was Toronto, and it was more cast and crew. Then we had press later on, so it was kind of a build. But at the end of the day, still feels reminiscent of an overnight success. There's no way to prepare for what this side of things looks like.

	











When you took this project on, what did your life look like? 


	I was serving at The Old Spaghetti Factory [in] New Westminster. It's like y'all's version of an Olive Garden. I would argue less swanky, but I loved it there. Walking through that door every day though, through the server's entrance, is a little bit like… I'm not better than this, but I do feel I'm good enough at acting that I should be reaping some reward for it. But I loved it. That was how I paid my rent. It was paycheck to paycheck. Vancouver is more expensive than Los Angeles, so it was very hard. I had a great outlook. In a lot of ways, it was a lot easier than what it's like now. 


I'm very curious what you thought life was going to look like once the show came out when you initially signed on.


	When I got this role, and I saw the fan base — it wasn't a New York Times bestseller and it didn't have any metrics of how many copies it sold. Jacob was coming off Shoresy and Letterkenny, so I was looking at that as a metric. For him to do two successful shows that are hockey related, I thought it seemed a little bit more commercially viable. If you go gay hockey, less hockey… I didn't think it would blow up to this. I thought it'd be more of a niche fan base. Not that I think of Instagram followers or anything, but unfortunately it is sort of a metric of relevancy in actors. I thought I'd maybe get 100,000 [followers] by episode six release. Episode six drops, five months go past. There's a climb. I'll maybe cap out 100,000 followers, and that'll be the level, so this already is like, oh, fuck, did not expect this. (Laughs.)

	











Why do you think it clicked? What is it that you saw in the show that you're happy that other people are seeing in it?


	I think the writing is brilliant. I know there is a lot of sex and a lot of stuff that's sparking interest in it. There's a very garish title. It's not subtle in advertising. But I always thought from the moment I read [them], they are Emmy's quality scripts, and Jacob is a brilliant writer. I'm honored to be a part of this. All Connor and I could do was fuck it up.


Well, you didn't.


	After seeing how good Connor was at Ilya and then him getting cast, it made me a little bit more confident that Jacob must be casting me somewhat right. If Connor was so good at what he does, maybe if I'm almost as good as that, then I must be pretty OK. I [also] think queer sports hasn't really been done too much. If Challengers was the cocktease of it all, then our show just leans in and gets in there.


How much did you know about this story before? Were you aware of it?


	I didn't even know hockey smut was a thing, let alone popular. I wasn't even very familiar with how these women-catered romance genres, how fucking vulgar they are. Not in a bad way, by any means, but they get into it. They get so nasty and so descriptive. It's beautiful, I love it. But holy fuck, I just didn't realize that was the level. Reading it, the heart permeates way past it. It supersedes the sex and the level of intimacy, and these characters really stay with you after you read them. That's sort of what surprised me to a degree.

	











Shane is such an internal character. Having read this book, it wasn't super clear how that would work on screen. Did that give you pause? Was that something you had to work through day-to-day?


	After reading Jacob's scripts, even before the book, I immediately saw how he would operate. My dad is on the spectrum, he knows it. He's a mechanical engineer, graduated top of his class, first in class in everything, very technical genius in a lot of ways, but sort of socially… I think he would say that he doesn't want to deal with emotions. He has told me, I'm not even paraphrasing, “I relate more with Vulcan than human,” referencing the Star Trek, the hyper-cerebral alien creatures. I love my dad to death, and I've always felt very connected to him. He has a sensitivity to him that is very boyish. I think when I read the script, I took a huge page out of living my life with him. Rachel [Reid] has said [Shane] is autistic, so I think I knew how it should look. I empathized with him a lot, immediately.


What is it about Shane that you love and were drawn to?


	He is hyper competent at this one thing. He's stereotypically masculine in a lot of regards. He's a kind person, and he's so overtly Canadian. He's harboring something that he thinks is a career-ending secret because he just doesn't have the emotional maturity or societal maturity to sort of understand what his own queerness means. To him, it's most likely detrimental, which is the wrong assumption to some degree, but it shatters his own idea of what his masculinity is, or at least it cripples it. And yet, he still never harms a fly.

	











This story takes place over almost a decade. This was all filmed together, correct? How do you handle that as an actor?


	I remember immediately after I heard Jacob was directing all of it, I called him before we even went to Toronto. I [asked him if he was] blockshooting this thing. He [said we were] shooting it one giant five-hour movie. I was like oh, fuck. OK, I know what that means. It means out of order, and it looks like a goddamn headache. I was talking with actors who had done Christopher Nolan-y storylines because I [wanted to know how] they did that. 


What did you find out?


	A lot of the actors I kept hearing [from] were talking about physical maps that they drew, like a cheat sheet of timeline points. I remember I did that pretty early on, drawing a map. Then the scripts were so clear of where they were each time that if I was coming into a day, we're doing year two, and it's the 10th hour of the shoot day, and before that we were shooting year eight. I would have to [ask Jacob] what happened right before. “Pre-Rose, post this, this happened, haven't said this yet.” I got it, and then he would have to tell me very little for me to know exactly what happens after and what has happened right before. I had a pretty dense understanding of the timeline, and so I felt like I could jump in emotionally. It didn't feel like I needed much last minute prep on it. I goof off a lot, but all the work was done was well before I even got to set.


You said something earlier that was essentially that you were doing a gay hockey show minus a lot of the hockey. But hockey was still a part of it. Did you know how to skate? Were you athletic growing up?












	I played a lot of sports, but I did not know how to skate.


Like at all or…


	I could stand without falling, and push and waver around the ice, but it wasn't even a true skate, skate. It was like, I'm just not falling and a little bit past just taking steps. I [asked] Jacob how much hockey he needed us to do. That was one of the first questions I asked him. He was like, “Jump off the bench, skate up to the face off.” I made it my goal to be able to play rec hockey; drop in beer league hockey was my sort of obnoxious goal. I fell short, but from the gist of what I understood from him, it would've been more than what we needed.


What about when you shot the hockey scenes? 


	The hockey section was all packed into one week, and it was much later into the shoot. We didn't step on the ice until our fourth week in or something. Even when we were in Toronto, we were meeting with our hockey coordinator to skate. The closer we got to the hockey, I [started thinking]; how do I hold a mouth guard? How do I jump over the thing? How do I touch my gloves? How do I hold the stick when I'm just chilling? How do I stretch? I realized it wouldn't be all this hockey stuff, it'll be hockey culture stuff. It'll be details.


You seem to be having a lot of fun with this experience, which is nice to see. What are you doing to keep it fun, especially as it gets a bit more daunting perhaps?


	Well, I have one of my best friends for life right beside me through it all, which is already a luxury that a lot of actors don't get. I'm sure I would've probably had a smaller appetite for the amount of stuff we're doing if I didn't have him through this. I'm an omnivert, leaning more to an extrovert, but I still get… I have ADHD, I'm unmedicated, currently, for the last while, so my social battery can just tap [out] pretty quick. At the end of the day, I'm pretty forgiving with myself if I'm talking with a reporter in a polite, more boring way. Then when I've had coffee, and I've had a nap, I let myself be chaotic. I let myself off the leash. I try to say, whatever mood I'm in, just be Canadian, don't be mean. Whatever they get, they get.

	











There was already a built-in fanbase for this project, but you did shoot most of it in a bubble before people knew. Do you think that helped?


	In hindsight, I want to say it was probably really helpful. I did still go on social media and Reddit to hear people's discussion about the book because I did want it to be a shared effort in a way. Also, I've read the scripts. Shane is fucking overthinking things every single second. If this just makes me more neurotic, it can only help. For another character, I would not do that necessarily. It would've probably been more overwhelming with more people hearing about it before we shot it, but I think it would've still looked similar. I had the assurance that whatever I did in the audition without having read the book was something that resonated with Jacob. I think he cried during one of the chemistry reads. I [thought] that was a good sign. After reading the book, and then reading discussions about the book and the character — I think it was good that it got to feel like a student film. At this level of hype, it could've only added more pressure on Connor and me, and just made it a little bit more uncomfortable.


In terms of what's next, what're you hoping for as you continue this journey? Do you know what that is at this point for you? How are you feeling about it?


	Some people talk about this show like it's just smut. I don't know if I can trust my own opinion on if I just did The Vampire Diaries or if I did Normal People. I believe in the work I did. I believe [in] what Jacob wrote. At the end of the day, I believe I have a lot more to offer. As an actor, and an actor who likes character actors, those have always been the role models from a single digit age. That's just where I'd want to go — challenging roles with auteur filmmakers is the very natural, not forced proclivity. If it actually pans out that way, I'm very appreciative. If it leads to very commercial piss and cheap fast food movies, well then, OK, I guess. Not what I envisioned, but I could still be at The Old Spaghetti Factory, so I can't be too much of a prude.

Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver and Kate Winslet head back to the future to continue the Pandoran struggle against genocidal colonists from Earth.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If the title One Battle After Another weren't already taken, it might be a tidy fit for the third installment of James Cameron's sprawling “Blue Man Group” sci-fi adventure, Avatar: Fire and Ash. Yes, the movie offers gargantuan-scale spectacle, imposing technological wizardry and virtually nonstop action involving over-qualified and mostly unrecognizable actors in motion-capture suits. But it's easily the most repetitious entry in the big-screen series, with a been-there, bought-the-T-shirt fatigue that's hard to ignore.


	That leaves way too much time over the movie's ass-numbing three-and-a-quarter hours to wince at the risible dialogue coming from the mouths of Na'vi folk on the distant moon, Pandora. Or to stew in envy over their absence of body fat.

The Bottom Line

	
	Enough with the Modigliani Smurfs already.
	



Release date: Friday, Dec. 19Cast: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Oona Chaplin, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, David Thewlis, Jemaine Clement, Giovanni Ribisi, Britain Dalton, Jamie Flatters, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion, Brendan Cowell, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, Duane Evans Jr.Director: James CameronScreenwriters: James Cameron, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver; story by Cameron, Jaffa, Silver, Josh Friedman, Shane Salerno

									Rated PG-13,
								3 hours 17 minutes			






	The 13-year gap between Avatar and its first sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water, allowed time for a renewed sense of awe at the scope of Cameron's bio-diverse worldbuilding, enhanced by the introduction of a new clan, new creatures and a distinctive new environment. The third movie arrives just three years after its immediate predecessor — and in narrative terms, a few weeks after the events of that film — with the novelty now wearing thin.


	Firstly, it's not a great idea in a film with such an epic run time to have a character urgently shouting, “I've gotta take a leak!” To be fair, it's understandable given that the full bladder belongs to human dude Spider (Jack Champion), revealed in The Way of Water to be the son of vicious Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), sired before the latter was killed and transformed into a new breed of hybrid human/Na'vi soldier. To my knowledge, Spider never does get to pee, unless he just goes in the Metkayina Clan's bioluminescent aquatic ecosystem, like some filthy kid at the pool.

	











	I suppose given his ex-Marine, pre-avatar origins, we can even buy Quaritch's nemesis Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) greeting his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) when she ignores instructions to stay home and watch the kids during a skirmish, instead leaping into the fray with her killer archery skills: “Baby, I don't know whether to kiss you or yell at you!” But that doesn't make it sound any less silly, especially with Worthington's Australian accent.


	And would a young Na'vi really be checking in after a fiery clash by asking his comrade in arms, “Bro, you good?” Surely this biologically and spiritually advanced civilization should have evolved beyond skateboarder vernacular?


	All due respect to a groundbreaking franchise that has thus far raked in over $5.2 billion in theatrical grosses and remains the gold standard for the large-format 3D viewing experience, but Fire and Ash is sound and fury signifying nothing. Or at least nothing excitingly new. (Now might be a good time to clarify that I enjoyed the first two movies.) In the absence of fresh narrative inspiration, Cameron and co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver simply pile on the lore and multiply the clashes, to numbing rather than invigorating effect.


	Even the Darth Vader/Luke factor of honorary Na'vi Spider's conflicted feelings for his hard-ass father on the side of the Military Industrial Complex oppressor — known as the RDA, or Resources Development Administration, led by Edie Falco's stiff-limbed and humorless General Frances Ardmore — goes to few places not already explored in The Way of Water.

	











	Having been forced by the human invaders to flee the lush green forest home of the Omaticaya people, Jake, Neytiri and their family continue to live among the reefs and islands of the Metkayina clan, headed by tribal chief Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his pregnant wife Ronal (Kate Winslet). But the loss of Jake and Neytiri's first-born son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) remains an open wound for the family, especially for his impulsive brother Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), who blames himself. 


	When Quaritch resurfaces with a personal vendetta, Jake refuses to take a knife to a gun fight, instead loading up on military weapons salvaged from the last “Sky People” assault, which goes against the traditional Na'vi way. The women argue that the divine entity Eywa will provide, blathering on about having faith in “the Great Mother's plan.” But they haven't seen Edie Falco crab-walking in an industrial-grade exoskeleton suit.


	Jake, for one, is not buying the Eywa assurance; he has too much at stake protecting his wife, their surviving children Lo'ak and tween sister Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), as well as adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), the offspring of scientist Grace Augustine's avatar body, who develops a direct line to Eywa, even if she can't yet control it. How much you invest in all that will depend on how much you care about moon dwellers plugging their braids into nature's light sockets.


	When the nomadic Wind Traders led by Peylak (David Thewlis) drop by in their monster jellyfish-powered airships with Amazon packages, Jake decides Spider needs to be sent back with them to the science research facility to live with his fellow humans. His best pal Kiri is devastated but Neytiri, whose hatred of humans has intensified since Neteyam's killing, insists Spider will never be one of them so has to go.

	











	Before the Sully family can get him back to the base, a savage air attack rains down on Metkayina territory. Only this time it's not humans but the barbarian Mangkwan Clan, firebombing the Wind Traders' vessels and laying siege to the peaceful community below. Their leader is bad-bitch warrior Varang (Oona Chaplin), who ululates in triumph every time she “scalps” another Na'vi — which means hacking off the ponytails that are their power source, like Ariana Grande's topknot.


	The Mangkwan, aka Ash People, are a bunch of godless warmongers who basically turned on Eywa when a volcano reduced their homeland to barren ash. Varang is their evil queen. She wears a black and red feathered headdress, a micro-kini and stripes of red war paint over what looks like full-body Kiehl's Mud Mask, while swooping around on a scary dragon called a Nightwraith.


	When she starts demanding to be taught how to “make thunder,” she's not talking about rumbling flatulence, even if that might describe much of the action. Instead, she means advanced military firepower. Varang teams up with Quaritch and gets a whole arsenal of weaponry at her disposal, which is bad news for the Sullys, the Metkayina and the highly intelligent whale-like Tulkun that inhabit the oceans, especially as their annual shallow-water “calf communion” approaches.


	Varang is the most interesting new addition here, and Chaplin plays her as a bloodthirsty sorceress, her yellow eyes aflame with rage as she shrieks about ripping out hearts. But the writers give her no complexity beyond being a relentless WMD. She and Neytiri hiss at each other like territorial cats whenever they get close. But the promised Na'vi-on-Na'vi chick action gets sidelined when the injured Ronal goes into labor, with poor Winslet forced to utter the lament of mothers since the dawn of time: “I am dying, but first I will push out this baby.” You got this, girl!

	











	The escalating chaos is so littered with talk of Na'vi arcana, exotic Pandoran creatures and military jargon, that keeping up with the over-mythologized videogame plotting becomes more of a chore than a challenge. Not that narrative deficiencies are likely to hurt the movie's box office or keep the geek faithful away. The battles may become routinely episodic, but there are plenty of them, which might be all many audiences care about seeing through their 3D glasses.


	In the first two films, the sincerity, respect and sheer wonderment with which Cameron captured the Avatar world — and the faith that Indigenous traditions and the purity, spirituality and balance of nature could prevail over rampaging human destruction and military technology — was transporting enough to overcome the dumb dialogue. Here, it all starts to sound like empty bluster, retreading the same ground with just one new face that makes an impression. There's certainly nothing in the story to justify the bloated run time.


	The knowledge that Cameron has at least two more of these in the works might be great for the New Zealand economy — not so much for anyone who cares about original movies. Great Mother, save us.

With a son suspected of murder, recalling a Toronto restaurant session from 10 years ago — and the light it sheds on a dark dynamic.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	I almost didn't have dinner with the Reiners.


	At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, I was consumed with covering a slew of stories for my then-employer the L.A. Times. This included the stir around eventual best picture Spotlight, the buzzy Lenny Abramson movie Room and even a controversy over a court injunction stopping the screening of an Aretha Franklin concert documentary. The days were few and the news was great.




	So when a publicist asked me to meet with Rob and Michele Reiner and two of their adult children for a movie they had made called Being Charlie, I was prepared to tell her no. Obviously Rob was a legend; I grew up on the holy texts of The Princess Bride and This Is Spinal Tap. But a movie dramatizing the addiction troubles of Nick, his little-known 20-something son, on a busy weekend night with 10 other events? And it didn't even have distribution? This one just might have to pay the festival price. But the publicist pressed. “You won't regret it,” she said. I relented. The dinner ended up being revealing, heartwarming and jarring.

					Nick Reiner Revealed Violent Outburst, Family Issues and ""Cocaine Heart Attack"" on 2018 Podcast Taping		
			









	Ever since news broke that Rob and Michele Reiner had been killed in their home — according to the LAPD, by a knife-wielding Nick  —  I have replayed every moment from that night in my mind. Every clang of the fork, every digression from Rob, every uncomfortable Nick shift in the chair. Everything that happened on the second floor of that downtown Toronto restaurant, with loud diners and obsequious servers and barside festival schmoozers creating a din. We sat at a corner table and talked about what it meant to be part of a family with a serious addict — to be a parent, to be a sibling, to be the addict themselves. With the aid of my notes, which I had kept digitally intact from that night, I rewound the DVR in my mind again and again. Trying to connect what allegedly was done by one of the group now with what was happening then. The meal was a decade ago, but alive in front of me.

	Directed by Rob and co-written by Nick, Being Charlie focuses on David, an accomplished actor now running for governor — clearly a Rob stand-in — and his drug-addicted son who feels like he is being pushed hard to get clean so as not to be an embarrassment to his famous father; the character is a clear stand-in for Nick Reiner. The real-life son, who turned 22 on the day of our dinner, had just taken the stage with his father at the premiere a few blocks away. Then they made their way over to the restaurant with me. Nick was sober now, the Reiners said, after some 18 trips to rehab since his early teenage years, some of which he spent on the streets. This movie was going to provide the happy ending to all that sadness.


	“Can you believe this boy?” Rob said as we sat down, beaming. Nick smiled uncomfortably, saying nothing.


	From the start, a kind of fatherly pushing was evident. Rob wanted this story told — wanted, not surprisingly for a man steeped in show business, for the movie to succeed where therapy had failed. But he also genuinely felt pride — “nachas,” as he said, using the Yiddish word for parental joy.


	“I'm so proud; it's incredible. He's been through everything; it's so hard, you're in this position of no control. And how he's sober, here on his 22nd birthday, and he wrote this movie.”


	Nick seemed less game, a little almost like he didn't fully want to be there. He and a fellow addict had originally worked on a treatment for a TV series, so clearly he had some publicizing ambitions. Maybe he was getting cold feet now that his story would be shared with the world. Or maybe he just didn't want his life becoming part of his father's film universe.

	











	“It was tough at first, to think, ‘Am I actually going to do this?'” Nick said after I prodded a little. “I really wasn't sure I wanted to do this. Am I really going to get it out there?”


	Rob jumped in. “That's part of being a creative person — you express it; you get it out there.”


	The director looked lovingly at his wife. “Everybody's so open, and it's because of Michele.”


	“Everybody is,” she said, looking back at her husband. “But we didn't set out to do a public good. We had to do it for each other.”


	We ordered, and Nick explained the ineffectiveness of rehab for him: “I just couldn't get by in these programs. I had resistance every time they tried to reach me.”


	The elder Reiners described their own misgivings.


	“The program works for some people, but it can't work for everybody,” Rob said. “When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen. We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”


	Michele said: “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”


	I looked at Romy, the Reiners' daughter. How did she feel? “This is my best friend, and I was there for all of it,” she said, gesturing to her brother, two years older. ”It's weird but good to see it on the screen,” she added. She struck me as someone deeply admiring of her brother, but also, perhaps, a little tired of explaining his behavior, to her parents, to everyone.

	











	Rob, who had been eating, put down his fork. “What got us through is two books, Tweaked and Beautiful Boy,” he said, citing addiction memoirs. Something poignant, even sad, abided. Unable to access the mind of his own son, he turned to the words of strangers to let him in.


	“And then we started talking about the movie,” he said. “That helped.” Michele nodded. “To be honest, by the time we got to the point of making the movie, it didn't matter [if we actually made it],” Rob said. “Because our relationship had gotten so much closer.”


	This was a happy ending. But something about that phrase didn't feel right. Was it not happy? No, it was. It just didn't feel like an ending.


	For all the talk about catharsis and success, something felt unsuccessful. I checked later with the publicist, who wasn't at dinner but had been spending time with the family. Did she pick up on anything? She thought everything was fine. But it didn't feel fine. It felt like things were better but far from resolved; it felt like the festival had arrived and a lot of what hadn't been resolved had been hurriedly shoved in the closet, like the last pile of living-room mess before company arrives.


	Appearing on a podcast a few weeks later, Nick was more candid about his ambivalence about the movie and the promotional efforts around it. Sobriety, he said, was a relative term. While he'd managed to get off meth and heroin, he was still drinking and smoking pot. “I said to [the film's publicists], ‘Listen, I'm not in a position to do this. I'm not a quote unquote sober guy.' I'm going to have to go on these talk shows. They said you have to do this. They want the whole father-son angle. It just goes to show you how disgusting it is.” But he finally relented. “It was uncomfortable, but I felt like it was part of the job.”

	











	At dinner, the family turned its attention to a line Rob insisted make it into the film — “I'd rather have you alive and hating me than dead on the streets.” Rob really, really wanted the line in. It explained his actions, justified them, even though he was now apologizing for thinking that way, for being so hard on his son. I looked over at Nick. He didn't seem so happy to have the line in the film. It was, perhaps, too excusing of the kind of parental pushing he didn't want to excuse.


	There was another line in the movie, right after that. “So what do you want me to do? Tell me what to do,” David begs his son.


	I asked Nick what he thought of that — what could his father had done? But Nick had no answer. Not at dinner, maybe not ever. Maybe there was nothing Rob could do. Maybe the whole movie, I thought, was Rob coming to terms with that inescapable fact, and all the cheer and the pride, well-earned as it was, could simply not illuminate that darker, more severe reality. He had done everything he could to help his son. He had even set in motion the Hollywood machine to help his son. And yet there was nothing he could do to fully help his son. Some things are beyond our greatest effort.


	At dinner, I saw a man who wanted so badly for resolution to be true, for reconciliation to find its way to them, that maybe he was pushing harder than matters should be pushed — that maybe he was trying to will his son into someone he couldn't be.


	And I also saw a man — not a boy — who had to take responsibility for himself, who was no longer a teenager, who couldn't simply point his finger at a father, much as his body language suggested he wanted to. I saw, in short, an American family, where everyone was sympathetic but no one was blameless.

	











	A festivalgoer approached our table, saying he had just come from the premiere. A niece who had battled addiction had survived several suicide attempts, he said, and he hoped that his wife could find solace in the film. “Thank you, that's the point,” Rob said to him. He almost glowed. His own pain was making others feel less alone. All Rob Reiner wanted to do, with all his movies and now with this one, was to make people feel less alone.


	He turned back to the table. “It was very hard. The number one job of any parent is to keep their child safe. And I hadn't done that.” He was almost tearing up. “And now, here, I have done that. I kept him safe. He came out alive.”


	Here in 2025, the words kept ricocheting through my brain. Yes, Nick had come out alive. It was Rob that hadn't.


	I looked at my notes, rifled through my memory — sought some great unlocking of a box whose contents, once unpacked, would explain what allegedly happened in the family's Brentwood home on Sunday. Were there clues? Did someone say something that night that suggested this would all end horribly badly? Was there some dark foreshadow-y Easter egg embedded within, if only I'd known where to look? I came up with tension, with awkwardness. But nothing made me tilt my head back and put my hands in the air to say, “Of course.” The key didn't come. Perhaps it never would, not even to the participants.


	What makes us turn against the ones we love, the ones who give us life? These are the people who care about us most, the people we live because of, and for. And then we rebel. In some extreme cases, violently.

	











	Confronted with the murder of parents by a child, we face the grimmest puzzle. It is unfathomable, and in the face of the unfathomable, the mind speeds through explanations: addiction, mental illness, a fugue state. We cannot — we must not — believe this was a mindful act. Or a slow-growing one. Something “snapped.” If it didn't, how else could it have happened?


	But what if it didn't? What if it had been building? What if the seeds of this were evident a decade ago at that restaurant? Nothing about that night suggested a specifically bad outcome; I'd be lying if I said it did. And yet I'd be equally dishonest if I said something about that night also didn't make me deeply uneasy. Anyone with even a modest EQ could see it.


	I could see the helplessness.  The missteps of a parent. The futility. The irony was painful to me, and, I could only imagine, to Rob Reiner. Here was the nation's storyteller-in-chief, unable to finish the tale how he wanted. Characters reject our keystrokes. We are all agents in our own story but not authors of it. Even the man who shaped some of the best couldn't be an author of it.


	In the end, I thought, what made this different from any awkward dinner between a 22-year-old and his parents? Strip away the iconic persona of the father and the son's addiction struggles (and maybe not even that) and it becomes any other tense family dinner where baggage and demons hover. And yet it wasn't any family dinner: It was Rob Reiner. It was Meathead and The Bucket List, it was Stand by Me and the I'll-have-what-she's-having scene. (Another Reiner parent, incidentally, in another restaurant.) The kind of figure whose stature was supposed to transcend all of this, was supposed to mind-crush the challenge that would befall a more ordinary family. I mean, that's the implicit bargain when we turn ourselves over to such famous storytelling hands, isn't it? That the savvy and talent that made them our family chroniclers would surely be enough to vanquish whatever pedestrian problem beset their own clan. And yet of course it isn't. In the end, it didn't.

	











	Rob Reiner was great precisely because he highlighted these family foibles and made sense of them. We could relate to an inability to get through to a thickheaded father-in-law, and to a boy who grudgingly wants to be read a story by his grandfather, and to being forced to find makeshift brothers on a body-seeking adventure when our own parents are absent. Maybe that's what makes this extra tragic. Reiner was all about sorting through the complexity of parents and offspring and coming out OK on the other side. He's the one who taught us how hard it was but that we could get through it, just as he did with his own famous father, with whom he bonded over baseball. He just couldn't enact the lesson with his own son.


	As the dinner ended, we pushed back our chairs and stood up. Rob looked at me. He took my hand and clasped it. “Thank you, Steve.”


	Perhaps I imagined it, but in his eyes I saw a pleading, an ask. Not to conceal anything. More the opposite — he wanted this story written in a way that willed the best outcome into being. I clasped his hand back as he held my gaze an extra twinkly, plaintive second. It was the last interaction we had.

This is partner content.


	Billboard News, presented by Amazon Prime, breaks down notable highlights from Billboard's Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs, including fan favorites from Katy Perry, Jonas Brothers and Wham!, to name a few. With festive sound cues and seasonal flair, the segment celebrates seasonal favorites and spotlights chart-topping moments, including Mariah Carey's continued reign with “All I Want for Christmas Is You.”


	Tetris Kelly: Yes, it's that time of year, and everybody's playlist is full of holiday bops. Well, if you need suggestions, we're breaking down some of the songs on Billboard‘s Greatest of All Time, Holiday 100 Songs presented by Amazon Prime. Getting cozy down in No. 79 is a holiday favorite by Katy Perry. 


	Katy Perry: Well, you know, I guess if this was the tester, it went well. I love this song, and I created it especially for Amazon.

The company says it repped the legendary singer for years on tricky rights issues ""at no cost to her"" — in return for a 50 percent cut of her royalties ""in perpetuity.""


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Dionne Warwick is facing a lawsuit claiming the legendary singer has turned her back on a rights management company that negotiated her deal for the famed sample of her song “Walk on By” in Doja Cat‘s chart-topping hit “Paint the Town Red.”


	In a case filed Monday (Dec. 15), a company called Artists Rights Enforcement Corp. says it's repped Warwick for years “at great effort and expense” on tricky issues, ranging from the recent Doja sample to a 2002 lawsuit against Atlantic Records. But the company says she's now trying to back out.


	“After decades of service, Ms. Warwick is now trying to evade paying Artists Rights hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars,” the company's lawyers write. “In so doing, she has violated her contracts with Artists Rights.”


	Artists Rights says it provided its services to Warwick for years “at no cost to her,” assuming all the risk and upfront costs. In return, it says she agreed in 2002 to pay the company a 50 percent cut of any money recovered through the enforcement efforts — and to do so “in perpetuity.”


	Such arrangements are not unheard of in the music industry, which confronts many artists, even legendary stars, with a thicket of complicated rights deals with a slew of different companies. They mirror contingency deals employed by some law firms, which represent plaintiffs for free with the hope of a big payoff in court.


	Warwick's arrangement worked well for both sides for years, according to Artists Rights, resulting in more than $2.5 million in revenue and a “sixtyfold” increase in royalty distributions from her record companies, according to the lawsuit. But in recent years, Warwick has “increasingly expressed her desire to stop paying Artists Rights,” the company says; in September, her lawyers allegedly reached out to “terminate” the agreement entirely.


	“Artists Rights has performed all of its obligations under the contracts,” the company's lawyers write. “Ms. Warwick has wrongfully and unreasonably repudiated the contracts.”


	Among its work for Warwick, Artists Rights says it handled a 2002 lawsuit against Atlantic and others over the royalties to her chart-topping 1974 hit “Then Came You.” When the case finally settled in 2004, and Warwick was “finally was able to receive some of the royalties that she justly deserved,” the settlement deal signed by the star allegedly required that royalties be routed through Artists Rights.


	The company says it later handled issues with SoundExchange, as well as a complicated matter involving Sony Music paying her royalties to the state of California to satisfy unpaid taxes, among other disputes. Then in 2023, Artists Rights says it handled the clearance of a sample of Warwick's “Walk On By” in Doja's “Paint,” which spent three weeks atop the Hot 100 and 37 overall weeks on the chart: “Ms. Warwick profited enormously from Artists Rights' work,” the lawsuit reads.


	A rep for Warwick did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday. Doja Cat, Atlantic Records and others mentioned in the lawsuit were not named as defendants nor accused of any wrongdoing.

	According to law enforcement Reiner and Singer were found dead inside their Brentwood home on Saturday evening (Dec. 14), with reports indicating that both suffered traumatic injuries.

	Nick Reiner was located hours later in South Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California campus — approximately 15 miles from the crime scene — and taken into custody around 9:15 p.m., law enforcement officials confirmed.


	At a news conference on Monday (Dec. 15), Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell addressed the arrest and ongoing investigation.


	“Our hearts go out to the family and friends of the Reiners,” McDonnell said, calling the situation “a tragic incident.” He also confirmed that a search warrant had been issued for the Reiner property, adding, “It's a critical piece of our investigation.”


	Nick Reiner, who co-wrote the 2015 film Being Charlie — a semi-autobiographical story about a young man's battle with addiction — has reportedly struggled with substance abuse and mental health issues for years. Sources told the Los Angeles Times that Reiner had cycled in and out of rehab facilities, experienced periods of homelessness, and had recently moved back into the family's Brentwood home.

	











	Reiner and Singer's family confirmed their deaths in a statement yesterday, writing, “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”


	Rob Reiner, 78, was a prolific actor, writer, and director best known for helming classic films including Stand By Me, When Harry Met Sally, A Few Good Men, and The Princess Bride. 


	The son of The Dick Van Dyke Show creator Carl Reiner, he was also known for his social activism and outspoken political commentary. His wife, Michele Singer Reiner, was a photographer and activist in her own right.


	Tributes poured in online following the news, with high-profile figures from music, film, politics, and beyond posting tributes to the couple.


	From the music world, Paul McCartney shared an emotional Instagram post thanking Reiner “for all the humour” and calling the tragedy “heartbreaking,” while Elton John also paid tribute to the director behind the Spinal Tap films. 


	Members of Spinal Tap, including Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest (with Jamie Lee Curtis), have issued statements mourning Reiner and describing the deaths as “unspeakable” and “like Greek tragedy.”


	As of Tuesday morning (Dec. 16), Nick Reiner remains in custody at the LAPD Metropolitan Detention Center. 


	He is being held without bail pending formal charges from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. A preliminary court appearance is expected later this week.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	The new Steven Spielberg movie from Universal will be titled Disclosure Day. A new trailer dropped Tuesday that you can watch above, and the movie remains set to open on June 12 next year.


	The movie reps Spielberg's return to his extra-terrestrial invasion stomping ground made popular with such tentpoles as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and War of the Worlds. 


	In the trailer we see Emily Blunt's weather girl not holding it together as she becomes possessed by some foreign entity. Whatever is going on in the world — it also has the attention of wild animals and nuns. The studio's logline sent around today: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.”

	











	Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson and Colman Domingo also star in the pic, the plot of which had been mostly under wraps. The story is from Spielberg, with the screenplay from his longtime collaborator David Koepp, who previously teamed on scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

Disclosure Day marks Spielberg's first film since 2022's semi-autobiographical The Fabelmans, which scored seven Oscar nominations.

You know, in this current atmosphere, with so much hate and anger and vileness, I'm honestly not sure I can do this tone. It just feels like nonsense.

I like the teaser. I haven't been interested in seeing any of his films since Crystal Skull.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The original 2009 Avatar sits on top of the box office heap having made $2.9 billion, nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture and winning three. It took 13 years to get the second edition, 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water, but that gap was barely felt, the sequel taking in $2.3 billion and also nominated for Best Picture while again winning for its spectacular visual effects. Avatar is the highest-grossing movie of all time, The Way of Water is the third-highest grosser. Cameron's Titanic is up there too, now in fourth place. Of course, it would be hard to do a sequel to that movie which won a record-tying 11 Oscars — the ship sank. But with the endlessly fertile and fascinating world of Pandora, the landscape and scope seems right for follow-ups and so now we have the third Avatar entry, Avatar: Fire And Ash, and it turns out to be nothing less than an intense 3-hour and 17-minute kickass epic that may be the bluest war film ever made.

	











	This edition ratchets up the action to new heights picking up the story just a few beats after Way of Water's aquatic battle ended with the defeat of Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and the human-led Resources Development Administration which are now regrouping for its eventual goal of making Pandora habitable for the people of Earth, who have destroyed through sheer neglect their own planet and seek to take over this one if they can capture the right elements for human survival. The storyline sees the Na'vi tribe known as Omatikaya but now turned Metkayina, where the Sully family are temporarily hanging with that mellow reef clan. They are also grieving the loss of brave son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), who died in that final battle.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Our main principal warrior Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), who was once a human Marine but now firmly with the Na'vi, is basically readying to go to war. It is what he knows. Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) is at an emotional breaking point, the loss of their son tugging at her heart, and her hatred for all humans making life difficult for their adopted human boy Spider (Jack Champion), freely living with them and at one with them, but still conflicted over his previous life which happens to be as the son of Quaritch. He of course is Pandora Enemy No. 1 and about to have a second act after being eliminated in his human version and now is a Recom or Recombinarts, which makes him a blend of Na'vi and human in order to regenerate and fight another day in the anti-human environment. That time is now and it becomes complex for Spider.


	Jake is leading the clan to High Camp where the RDA is in order to turn Spider in, the arrangement no longer working for them, especially Neytiri, but he is tight with the younger members, notably Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), who you might recall is the 14-year-old Na'vi version of the avatar of Grace Augustine, who ran the Avatar division of RDA. Also key to the gut-wrenching events taking place in this edition is Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), who is feeling tremendous guilt over the death of Neteyam. Back from the Metkayina clan is leader Tonowari (Cliff Curtis), plus his wife Ronal (Kate Winslet) still in personality conflicts and jealousies with Neytiri. New to the storyline, and perhaps the best scene stealer of all, is Varang, the self-made “queen” of the Ash People, a clan that formerly was peaceful but turned angry and vengeful after a volcano wiped out their homeland, now strewn with ash, as are all its inhabitants. Spanish actress Oona Chaplin plays her to the hilt, with grace of movement and purpose as she and her tribe become major threats to the Na'vi which sees Jake fighting on multiple fronts with the Ash and the RDA, and ultimate villain Quaritch.


	Cameron knows how to do spectacle better than anyone, and this Avatar builds out its worlds to such a high degree I would dare to say you could put the first two films together and it still wouldn't add up to the fierce levels and magnitude of the fight in this one. Compared to The Way of Water, this version has far more land action although rest assured, the fan-favorite Tolkuns seafaring whales are back in action when you need them most.


	This is what they used to call in Hollywood a true epic, taking place in the sky, water and land in a visual knockout like you rarely see on this level these days. Its secret sauce however is our emotional connection through the Sully family. They are again the hook, and Cameron and co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver know you have to deliver a compelling family story to keep this all from drowning in too much fire and water. It is a credit to the actors, most having to do performance capture and somehow making us feel for them throughout. Led by exceptional turns again from Worthington and Saldaña, along with standouts Dalton and Champion, plus of course Weaver (convincing even as a 14 year old), there is also room for greater character development than before from Lang, who masters the villainry of Colonel Quaritch in his new guise, but also manages a three-dimensional relationship with Spider that feels authentic. Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement and Giovanni Ribisi also get their moments on the human side of things.

	











	With truly dazzling production elements all around this is a movie hard to resist, even if you think you have already seen what wonders Cameron has in store for this franchise. He isn't committing firmly to the hoped for and scripted fourth and fifth films in the Avatar universe until he sees how this one performs, but my guess is people are gonna go more than once.


	Producers are Cameron and the late Jon Landau, to whom the film is rightly dedicated.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	Much of the political media was chattering about a newly Vanity Fair piece on Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who not only gave a rare interview to writer Chris Whipple but some very candid assessments of the personalities in Trump 2.0.


	The profile accompanied a Vanity Fair photo shoot, from Christopher Anderson, of members of the Trump team, marking full cooperation with a mainstream media outlet of the type that the president often attacks.


	In a series of interviews, Wiles talked of growing up with her father, sportscaster Pat Summerall, who was an alcoholic who later got sober.

	“Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I'm going to say,” Wiles told Vanity Fair. “But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.”


	Trump does not drink, but Wiles said that he has an “alcoholic's personality,” an operates with a view that “there's nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”


	In other parts of her interviews with Whipple, Wiles said that Vance has been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.” She also said that Elon Musk is an “odd, odd duck,” and referred to his ketamine use. 


	She also said that she was “aghast” when Musk shut down USAID, the foreign aid organization. 


	“Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,” Wiles said. “And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.”


	Musk left the White House in May and had a very public falling out with Trump.


	Wiles also criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi over her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.


	“I think she completely whiffed on appreciating that that was the very targeted group that cared about this,” Wiles said, per Whipple's interview. “First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk. There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.”

	











	But Wiles said that she read through what she referred to as the “Epstein file,” and while Trump is named, “he's not in the file doing anything awful.”


	Wiles posted on X on Tuesday, “The article published early this morning is a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history. Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.”

I don't think Vanity Fair needs to paint Donald Trump as chaotic when we can all see it for ourselves every day through his own words and actions. The man is a chaos agent.

Somebody is going to have a lot of free time in 2026.

When your own chief of staff says this… you know you're a fascist dictator

He's not doing anything awful yea just by the way he acts now you can tell that's a lie he's a narcissist and anybody that voted for him I bet y'all are regretting it and he was behind the capital incident everything about him is awful taking away people food stamps to get what he wants that is awful all while remodeling the ballroom something that was not necessary

Yeah… she's getting let go after this. Why did she give this interview!?

Newly released photos show Nick Reiner being pinned to the ground by a police officer while being arrested on suspicion of murdering his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner.

The 32-year-old was seen pressed to the ground by a Los Angeles Police Department officer as several others watched on Sunday night, per photos shared by the LAPD Gang and Narcotics Unit on Monday.

Additional photos, which were deleted shortly after they were posted, showed him being escorted to the front of a police car.

Nick wore a black jacket with white strips and jeans.

According to the police department, the screenwriter was located with the help of the US Marshal Task Force.

Nick was reportedly arrested by a metro station 15 miles away from Rob and Michele's home, with sources telling ABC News he was near University of Southern California.

Page Six confirmed that Nick had been arrested on charges of murder after Rob and Michele were found stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Sunday afternoon.

He was originally booked in Downtown Los Angeles' Parker Center Jail before being transferred to Twin Towers Correctional Facility.

Nick is currently being held without bail and reportedly on suicide watch.

Before the murders, Nick and his parents had attended Conan O'Brien's Christmas party on Saturday night. 

Several sources told People that he was behaving erratically and “freaking everyone out, acting crazy.” 

Additional insiders told TMZ that Nick stuck out at the party, wearing a hoodie while everyone was dressed up in formal attire.

The outlet reported that Nick got into a “very loud argument” with Rob and Michele, resulting in the couple leaving the bash.

Nick has been in and out of rehab due to his drug addiction, and once admitted to destroying his parents' guest house after going on a drug-fueled rage.

Sources close to the Reiner family told the Post Monday that Nick has a history of violence but “never thought it would get to the point” of murder.

Nick Reiner once admitted to losing his virginity to a sex worker he paid with stolen money from his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, years before his arrest in connection to their tragic deaths.

“I was just looking at the different [Craigslist] profiles, and this one [profile picture was] just an ass shot,” the screenwriter, 32, revealed on the “Dopey” podcast in 2017.

“That's the only thing that was her profile picture — and it had a number,” he detailed. “I called her up when I was about 14 or something, and her going rate was about $200.”

“This is the part of the story that I don't usually tell, but I'll tell it anyway,” Nick added. “I got $200 from my parents.”

He clarified that he didn't tell his parents what the money was for. “I didn't say, ‘Hey, look, I'm going to be with a [sex worker] tonight. Do you think you have an extra $200?'”

“It was also like 1 a.m. … She comes over. I didn't know how it worked, so I tried to kiss her.She didn't want that,” he detailed.

Describing the experience, Nick admitted to not finding the woman attractive but not caring because he “was young.” 

“I was like, ‘This is awesome,'” he continued. “[I lasted] 15 seconds … I kind of felt like s–t, but I was like, ‘That's awesome.' Then I realized I had more money on me, and I called her back. She came for a second time.”

“I never asked her name and I never really got into any specifics of anything,” Nick added, explaining he ate a “pot brownie” beforehand and “was extremely blazed.”

“But I still would have done it if I was sober,” he said. 

Nick, who has been in and out of rehab, admitted to getting the idea to contact a sex worker online through a fellow outpatient rehab patient. 

On Sunday, Page Six revealed that Nick had been arrested on murder charges after his parents were found stabbed to death at their Los Angeles home.

He's being held at Twin Towers Correctional Facility without bail.

Leading up to Rob and Michele's death, the actor had reportedly gotten into a heated altercation with Nick at Conan O'Brien's Christmas party on Saturday. 

A neighbor of the couple told The Post on Monday that Nick had a history of violence, but they “never thought it would ever get to this point.”

Nick Reiner went on aggressive, drug-fueled “outbursts” and was reportedly threatened to be kicked out of his parents Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's home before he was arrested in connection to their murders.

“Nick had been living in their guesthouse, the same one he destroyed more than once, but it had been like a revolving door all his adult life,” an insider told the Daily Mail Monday.

“He would do meth and not sleep for days and then have outbursts, breaking things, punching walls,” the source continued, explaining the screenwriter “had no control” and once “punched the bathroom wall.”

“He was a ticking time bomb,” the source said. “His drug use was getting worse and his parents wanted him out.”

The insider claimed Nick “would fight with his parents because they would give him the ultimatum, take medication and stop using, or move out.” 

The 32-year-old allegedly once threatened his sister, Romy Reiner, for confronting him, and “all hell broke loose.” 

“His parents threatened to call authorities multiple times, but in the end didn't,” the source alleged. 

“Nick would reportedly find the aftermath of his rages funny and “brag [about] how he could get away with anything.”

Nick, who has been in and out of rehab, would also allegedly take “money from his parents for drugs and prostitutes.”

“He would talk about this stuff in meetings, but then stopped going because he said it was too cultish,” the insider claimed.

During a 2018 interview on the “Dopey” podcast, Nick recalled a meth-fueled rage that left him “up for days” and “punching out some things in [the] guest house,” such as a TV and lamp

“Everything in the guest house got wrecked,” he said.

Nick was arrested Sunday after his parents were found stabbed to death at their Los Angeles home. He is being held at Twin Towers Correctional Facility and is reportedly on suicide watch.

Patti Lupone is famous for dressing down audience members at her shows. 

But apparently she'll take matters into her own hands when she's there to watch the show as well

Page Six has learned that the Broadway legend “cornered” an unruly patron at show that wasn't even hers and gave them the Full Lupone.

Advertisement

Spies say that “Gypsy” star was at the Duke on 42nd Street this weekend catching Drew Droege's buzz-making “Messy White Gays,” and we're told a woman in the audience “seemed more primed for a bachelorette party than off-Broadway.”

Apparently the offending attendee peppered more than half the one-act show's runtime with “an inebriated cavalcade of four-letter words” and a cackled “Yes b*tch!”

After the show, we're told La LuPone “cornered” the unsuspecting loudmouth, telling her: “Never go to the theater again!”

Advertisement

Our spies tell us the lady “quailed under the diva's stony gaze and apologized.”

Lupone's summary justice is legend.

In 2009 the three-time Tony-winner stopped mid-song in “Gypsy” to yell at someone snapping pictures with a cell phone, and she's snatched phones out of the hands of audience members on many an occasion.

Advertisement

She's even said that the advent of iPhones has led her to consider leaving the stage altogether.

“It isn't changing, it's only getting worse,” she said in a statement after one of her phone-confiscating moments. “And it takes, it's stressful. It's incredibly stressful. So, I will think twice before I sign another Broadway contract. I really will.”

The show has been a big hit not just with gay icons like Lupone but with actual gays.

Cheyenne Jackson, Jeff Hiller, Michael Urie, Bowen Yang, Matt Rogers, Chris Colfer, Todrick Hall, Bryan Safi and even tech billionaire Peter Thiel (who is mentioned in the show) have made it to the Duke to catch it. 

A rep for Lupone didn't get back to us.

Fashioning its latest horror film in the style of its previous successes, Neon offers up the trailer for Hokum, a new nightmare in the style of Osgood Perkins. But neither Hokum nor the creepy bunny in the first teaser comes from Perkins. Hokum was written and directed by Damian Mc Carthy, the filmmaker behind last year's buzzy indie creeper, Oddity. Borrowing the aesthetics from Perkins' Longlegs for the teaser, Neon hopes a couple of flashes of Adam Scott researching a hotel witch will be enough to lure some unsuspecting victims into the theaters. There is some striking imagery here, so it might just work. Hokum stars Scott as a reclusive novelist who heads to a haunted inn to scatter his parents' ashes, as one does. Unsurprisingly, things do not go as he had hoped.

Here's the synopsis from Neon:

When reclusive novelist Ohm Bauman (Scott) retreats to a remote Irish inn to scatter his parents' ashes, the staff's tales of an ancient witch haunting the honeymoon suite take hold of his mind. Soon, disturbing visions and a shocking disappearance draw him into a nightmarish confrontation with the darkest corners of his past.

Hokum creeps into theaters on May 1, 2026.

Anthony Geary has died. Best known for playing the infamous Luke Spencer, one half of the General Hospital supercouple, Luke and Laura, Geary died Sunday from complications from a surgery he underwent days prior, TV Insider reports. He was 78.

“Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for,” said General Hospital executive producer Frank Valentini in a statement. “His legacy, and that of Luke Spencer's, will live on through the generations of GH cast members who have followed in his footsteps. We send our sincerest sympathies to his husband, Claudio, family, and friends. May he rest in peace.”

Born in Coalville, Utah, in 1947, he left Utah for Hollywood after landing a role in the touring company of The Subject Was Roses. In 1970, He made his television debut on James L. Brooks' high school dramedy Room 222 and followed that breakthrough with a role on All In The Family, playing a gay man who challenged Archie Bunker's homophobia. Geary plugged right into the TV landscape of the time, appearing on Mod Squad, The Partridge Family, and Mannix, as well as making his first run on daytime TV on Bright Promise and The Young And The Restless.

In 1978, he landed the role that made him famous: General Hospital's Luke Spencer. While he eventually grew into an anti-hero, Spencer was “a complete bastard” early on, Geary told People in 1980. “He was a cheap little punk who managed a disco and was a dope runner for the Mafia.” To wit, the soap opera supercouple, Luke and Laura, one of television's most infamous pairings, began with Luke raping Laura. The relationship would come to define the soap opera “supercouple,” garnering controversy over the couple's violent beginnings and drawing millions of viewers, which made General Hospital the most popular soap of the era. More than 30 million people watched the couple's November 1981 wedding, still the highest-rated soap opera episode in history. The wedding guests included Elizabeth Taylor, who cameoed in the episode, and Princess Diana sent champagne.

“We came under a lot of fire from feminist groups and rightfully so from victim groups,” Geary said of the storyline in 2015. “If you look at the way it started, it was sort of fated to end badly. They had two children that they adore, but they grew apart. In a soap, you can't just have them go off into the sunset together unless you're going to have the characters leave the show. So, to stay on the show, there has to be conflict.”

After leaving General Hospital in 1984, Geary focused on film and theater. One of his most memorable roles was playing the in-house mad scientist, Philo, in “Weird Al” Yankovic's UHF. He also starred in Disorderlies opposite the Fat Boys, a 1987 Perry Mason case, and reprised the role of Luke Spencer in a 1994 episode of Rosanne.

As Luke Spencer, Geary won a record-breaking eight Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama. Before leaving the show in 1984, he had been nominated three times and won once. He returned to the series in 1991 as the Luke Spencer look-alike Bill Eckert, who would be killed off the following year, giving Spencer a chance to return. Geary continued to receive Daytime Emmy nominations throughout the rest of his tenure. In 1999, he won his second Emmy and would go on to win six more times. He retired from acting in 2015.

Geary is survived by his husband Claudio Gama, whom he married in 2019.

Life sure has a sick sense of humor, doesn't it?

A decade after Hollywood's last attempt at rebooting Kathryn Bigelow's surfer movie, Point Break, another one is standing up on its board. Deadline reports that AMC is currently developing a sequel series out of the 1991 blockbuster bromance set in the year of our lord 2026, 35 years after the original. Producer Dave Kalstein, a veteran of the NCIS-iverse and, more recently, Butterfly, is leading the campaign to find the ultimate rush, but it has yet to be given the green light.

The original 1991 film followed undercover cop Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) as he infiltrated a gang of surfers who were also president-themed bank robbers led by the philosophizing surfer Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Swayze died in 2009, so it's unclear how Kalstein will continue exploring the Ex-Presidents gang for the series. It seems unlikely that Reeves will make an appearance, and who knows if AMC wants to touch the third rail of Gary Busey, currently on probation for groping two women at a convention in 2022. But the film has a deep bench. Point Break also starred Lori Petty, who recently appeared on 12 episodes of NCIS: Origins, and John C. McGinley, who will appear in the upcoming Scrubs revival.

Following in the footsteps of such successful fairy-tale rebrands as Cruella, Wicked, and Malevolent, Disney is looking to reshape the public perception of Beauty And The Beast‘s resident bully. Per Deadline, Disney will finally tell the secret origins of Gaston, the villain of Beauty And The Beast, in an image-rehabilitating live-action movie. The latest draft of the screenplay comes from David Callaham, who, before becoming a regular writer on various superhero properties, including penning versions of Ant-Man, Wonder Woman 1984, Shang-Chi, and Across The Spider-Verse, was best known for introducing us to Sylvester Stallone's Expendables. Deadline didn't offer any plot details for the film. Still, we have a feeling it'll revolve around the untold tragedy of Gaston's life, retroactively making this despicable scallywag's behavior justified, like Cruella, whose puppy-killing ways we now understand because a dog pushed her mother off a cliff.

The outlet reports that Luke Evans, who played Gaston in the 2017 live-action remake, will not be returning to the role. We also expect Disney to drop the character's gay undertones that caused a minor controversy in 2017. Disney would hate to force Snoop Dogg into another instance of “talking to his grandkids.” Evans was expected to reprise the role for a TV series, Deadline continues, but a singing, French push broom swept those plans away. Still, fans annoyed by the recasting will soon be able to make their own Luke Evans-Gaston slop using the magic of AI.

James Cameron is a master of sequels, having made three of the best part-two movies of the blockbuster era. He's so good, in fact, that those second installments often feel complete without a third (and if someone else makes a third anyway, maybe even more so). This means that Avatar: Fire And Ash is actually the first threequel of his 40-year career. It's also his first follow-up to trail its predecessor within a normal sequel timeframe—and, for that matter, the quickest turnaround for any Cameron film since True Lies emerged almost exactly three years after Terminator 2. Maybe that's why Fire And Ash, despite some lingering momentousness in the relatively scarce Avatar series, carries the constant, looming threat that it will feel something like a normal sequel. Not a long-awaited event, not a radical expansion or re-envisioning of its predecessor, not even Cameron's first film of the decade. Just another spectacular, near-ceaselessly entertaining fantasy epic that shames 90% of its big-ticket competition. You know, one of those.

It's an appropriately rarified problem for a repeated engineer of the “most expensive movie ever made.” As frustrating as it may have been to wait a decade-plus between Cameron's fiction films, the earlier Avatar sequel The Way Of Water took advantage of that gap, catching up with human-turned-Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his Na'vi wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) years after the end of the first film. All of a sudden, with the addition of four Sully children, the movie was about a family of six—plus Pandora's favorite son-in-law Spider (Jack Champion), a human who aspires to roll with the Na'vi full-time. Fire And Ash, meanwhile, finds the family shortly after the death of eldest son Neteyam in Water's climactic battle. Neytiri is still in her ritual grieving period, and her vengeful anger strains her marriage to Jake, as well as her patience for Spider's continued presence.

Because Spider requires special oxygen masks to breathe the alien atmosphere, Jake and Neytiri insist that he return to the friendly human scientists maintaining a base on Pandora, over the protests of their kids Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Kiri (Sigourney Weaver, again playing a teenager through the magic of motion capture), and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss). The family decides to accompany Spider on his journey back, via airships that combine seafaring vessels and horsedrawn carriages with a veiny, organic-looking hot-air balloon technology. They're quickly attacked by another, more aggressive Na'vi tribe led by the literally fiery Varang (Oona Chaplin); the family is separated, pursued by both Varang and that pesky Quaritch (Stephen Lang), the ex-human colonel whose consciousness has been transferred to a Na'vi body, providing an ongoing dark mirror to Jake's metamorphosis. In classic '90s Batman-villain style, Varang and Quaritch decide they may be of use to each other. Varang holds no particular grudge against Jake and Neytiri, but she sure as hell isn't happy with their beloved goddess Eywa, and wants to get her hands on what other Na'vi will not permit: firearms.

There's more plot than that, too, some of which more closely rehashes material from the first two films—Water in particular, to the point where it's easy to wonder whether some sequel material was dragged and dropped from the second movie into the third during their lengthy gestation period. The large cast, multiple Na'vi tribes, and tripled bad guys (the regular “sky people”—the humans who still want to ravage Pandora for its various natural resources—are also still hanging around) deviate Fire And Ash from the counterintuitive but highly effective structure of the first two movies. In both of those, Cameron spends a surprising amount of time luxuriating in the exploration of new fantasy environments, just as he explores so much of the Titanic well before the ship his the iceberg. The new movie parcels out action sequences at a more typical epic-blockbuster clip. This oddly makes the expansive runtime feel longer than the other two, even though it only exceeds them by a matter of minutes and may be the most purely action-packed of the three.

Then again, it's hard to complain that Cameron serves up slam-bang set pieces at regular intervals. That early airship attack does the neat trick of introducing the fearsome, red-painted Varang through action so dynamic and excitingly choreographed that it should send the airship-fixated Kevin Feige into the fetal position. Even the most familiar of later sequences, a massive mash-up of the air battle from the first movie and the sea battle from the second, adds great new details: majestically murderous new sea creatures, or a smaller-scale fight scene that knocks its participants from floating rock to floating rock.

As is usually the case with Cameron, all of this potentially cacophonous action is easy to follow. It's a little trickier to track all of the major characters' emotional journeys, especially with the irrepressible Spider elbowing his way into the family. As Fire And Ash goes on, it feels increasingly unsure of just how much of a wrap-up this will be—or even what's on the table for story threads that can be wrapped up, versus what will be left as the kind of dangling (or are they frayed?) threads that, until the Avatar sequels, rarely had a place in Cameron's fantastical worlds. As a result, some of the most intriguing new wrinkles in this film, primarily involving Quaritch's unlikely and sometimes downright hallucinatory alliance with Varang, fail to develop into full-fledged subplots. Quaritch's Dark Sully act in particular feels like it could be excavated further, especially in a series that sometimes wants to have its colonialism and vanquish it, too.

In a sense, Cameron is a victim of his own success. The Avatar movies are so lushly overgrown with visual detail, and draw such surprisingly nuanced and sensitive motion-capture performances from its human cast, that any momentary storytelling hiccup can feel like a glitch in the machine. Fire And Ash is terrific entertainment that occasionally gives the impression of well-appointed vamping; it's almost enough to wonder if all the meticulous writer's-room blueprinting of two-to-four Avatar sequels might have done as much harm as good. Viewers who just long for more time in Pandora are in luck: Cameron may not see a way out himself.

Donnie Wahlberg has shared a heartfelt message after losing someone close to him, and fans are rallying around him in a show of support.

On Monday, December 15, the actor and New Kids on the Block (NKOTB) musician posted several photos on Instagram of himself and his concert tour manager, Victor Popovic. The post gives a glimpse into their professional and personal relationship, and they appeared to share a close bond. Photos show them posing together and smiling, taking a plane trip together, hanging out on tour, and at a sporting match. 

In other photos, the whole band poses together. In the caption, Wahlberg shared his thoughts. “Gonna miss you my guy. A lot. You were always a real friend and a true brother,” he began his message. “I know for certain that you're in a better place. I know that with all my heart. Doesn't make it any easier to know that you won't be here any longer, but it will ease the sorrow until I see you again. Love you Vic. Rest Peacefully.”

Wahlberg ended his post with a proverb, writing, “Matthew 11:28 Proverbs 17:17” and then wished his dear friend a “Happy Eternal Birthday!”

Fans flooded Wahlberg's post with messages of love and support. “My heart is so broken! Victor was always smiling and so kind when I saw him at meet and greet! Rest in Heaven Victor! We miss you!” a comment reads. 

“Such a beautiful tribute. Heaven gained one of the best. Love you, Donnie,” another person shared. 

Other reactions include, “Makes all the “happy birthdays” mean even more now. Sending so much love to you and all the rest of his family/friends,” and “Sending you so much love my friend. Vic will be missed by all of us. We were all so lucky to know him.” 

New Kids on the Block, in addition to Wahlberg, is made up of Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Danny Wood, and Jonathan Knight, who ventured into television with HGTV's “Farmhouse Fixer” before its cancellation this year.

“We are heartbroken by the unexpected loss of our dear friend Vic Popovic,” the band's tribute to Popovic on Instagram reads. ”Vic was more than a tour manager but a member of the family. We were lucky to have him by our side for many years and his humor, dedication and spirit brought so much joy to our days on the road and beyond. Our hearts and prayers are with his family and loved ones. We will miss him dearly.”



So sorry for your loss.  May he rest in Peace.

Sorry for your loss my brother and all of my family of nkotb

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Late Night' Host Gives Touching On-Air Tribute To Rob Reiner","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/seth-meyers-tribute-rob-reiner/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 03:12:31 GMT","

Ahead of tonight's episode, “Late Night with Seth Meyers” posted the host's moving tribute to the late Rob Reiner. Although Meyers is a renowned comedian, the YouTube video contains no jokes, only memories of a brilliant filmmaker.

Reiner and his wife, Michele, were tragically found dead in their home on December 14, 2025. Meyers, on his NBC late-night show, recounted one of his favorite memories of the “Stand by Me” director. In this story, Meyers described the 100th birthday party he attended for Norman Lear.

As Lear produced “All in the Family,” which Reiner starred in, Reiner was also at the party. When someone at the event asked Lear how his career started, Meyers said the producer “was sort of struggling to come up with a way to answer that question.”

Then, Meyers remembers Reiner stepping in to help Lear out. “Rob yelled out, from the back of the room, he said, ‘Norman, tell them the story about how you once hid in a birthday present.' And then Norman launched into this story that he'd clearly told a hundred times, if not more. And it was just the most wonderful story,” Meyers said.

According to Meyers, Reiner continued to prompt Lear with various stories throughout the night. “I know this sounds like a story about Norman,” Meyers then said. “But it's also a really great story about Rob, because Rob was known … for getting the best out of people. And if you watch his films, you know that is something he had this skill with. But to see him in person and know that's what he was like in his real life as well, it was just so truly special to see.”

After telling a lovely story about Reiner, Meyers described the man who had recently appeared on his show for the very first time. “He was just a person who was so full of love,” Meyers said of Reiner.

Later, Meyers described his feelings the first time he ever watched “This Is Spinal Tap,” which was Reiner's feature film directorial debut. “I just remember like, just my ears perking up at like, what comedy could be. Like … the kind of stories you could tell,” Meyers said. “I feel as though he'd almost like, reached out of the television to me and I'm sure so many other people like me and said like, ‘you should do this. You should try to do this with your life. It's as much fun as it looks,” Meyers continued about Reiner's influence on him.

“He was a man who set an example, and there's such a value in that,” Meyers said at the end of his tribute. He ended by sending his condolences to the Reiner family.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Angelina Jolie Bravely Shows Her Mastectomy Scars in Powerful Magazine Cover Shoot","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/angelina-jolie-mastectomy-scar-time-magazine-cover/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:06:57 GMT","

Angelina Jolie has nothing to hide. The star, whose personal life has often made headlines, is now opening up about a deeply personal chapter. More than a decade after undergoing a preventive double mastectomy, the Oscar-winning actress is now publicly sharing the results of the surgery and the meaning behind that choice.

Jolie, 50, appears in the first issue of TIME France, available December 18, where she shares photos of her scars and speaks honestly about why now feels like the right time to tell her story.

“I share these scars with many women I love,” Jolie told the magazine. “And I'm always moved when I see other women share theirs.”

For Jolie, the moment is about connection and community. “I wanted to join them, knowing that TIME France would be sharing information about breast health, prevention, and knowledge about breast cancer.”

To jog your memory a little, Jolie decided to undergo a double mastectomy in 2013 after her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, died from cancer at age 56 in 2007.

In a May 2013 New York Times op-ed titled “My Medical Choice,” Jolie revealed that tests indicated she carried the BRCA1 gene. This genetic mutation significantly raised her risk of developing breast cancer.

Jolie wrote in the op-ed: “I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me to breast cancer.”

CBS reported that two years later, in 2015, Jolie underwent further preventative surgery. She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to guard against ovarian cancer.

In the TIME France interview, Jolie emphasized the importance of making genetic testing widely available to women who need it.

“Every woman should always be able to determine her own healthcare journey and have the information she needs to make informed choices: genetic testing and screening should be accessible and affordable for women with clear risk factors or a significant family history,” Jolie said.

She added that access to care must be equitable. “Access to screening and care should not depend on financial resources or where someone lives.”

Sure wish I had someone like her around here, my mom had a double mastectomy and then she died from ovarian cancer the doctors told my sister and I that we would definitely have the ovarian cancer but my insurance won't cover genetic testing and I can't afford to pay for it now I get to worry if I'll be here for my kids while I try to raise money to get the genetic testing for my daughter.

Tomorrow would have been her 64th birthday

Night 1 of “The Voice” 2025 finale has kicked off on NBC tonight. It's a two-night event with lots of performances and ending with the winner of “The Voice” season 28 being announced. However, before we get to that, people are wondering: did anyone get eliminated on “The Voice” tonight? It's time for your “The Voice” spoilers with the Night 1 results from the Voice Finale tonight on NBC.

Voting finally opened up to fans during the Playoffs on “The Voice” season 28. Each coach got to select one artist from their team to win the Playoffs and represent them in the Live Finale. America then got to vote on the artists that didn't get selected by their coaches, and one of them each week will also make it to the Live Finale, so a total of six artists will perform in the two-night season 28 finale this week.

Since only two artists will make it into the Top 6 from the 10 artists not selected by their coaches, that means eight artists will be officially eliminated from the competition. Find out below with our “The Voice” 2025 results.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD: THIS LIVE POST WILL BE UPDATED THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE, SO DO NOT KEEP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS.

KEEP REFRESHING THE PAGE FOR THE LATEST “THE VOICE” LIVE RESULTS UPDATES.

We start the night with Carson Daly revealing the winners of the Wild Card (fan vote from Playoffs). The two artists making it through to the Voice Finale and joining the Top 6 artists tonight are:

To be completely honest, who didn't see this one coming? I was shocked when Michael didn't pick Max as his selection, but I figured he wanted to save Jazz, and he thought America would vote Max in. He was right.

The same thing could be said for Niall, as he picked Aiden over DEK of Hearts during the Playoffs. This shocked many, but he probably wanted Aiden in the Finale and figured America would vote for DEK of Hearts, which they did.

With that being said, we now know which other 10 artists have officially been eliminated from “The Voice” 2025. Those artists are:

What do you think of the results on “The Voice” season 28 tonight?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Rob Reiner's Daughter Opens Up About Seeing Him ‘One Last Time'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/rob-reiner-michele-reiner-tragedy-timeline/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:33:40 GMT","

Tracy Reiner is sharing rare and heartbreaking details after the deaths of her father, Rob Reiner, and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.  

In a brief yet emotional statement, Tracy shared her shock and reflected on her family as tributes and questions continue to surround the tragic loss.

Tracy, 61, spoke to NBC News as she processed the sudden loss of her father and stepmother. “I came from the greatest family ever,” she said. “I don't know what to say. I'm in shock.”

Rob adopted Tracy during his marriage to the late Penny Marshall. She also told the outlet that she had seen her father at a family gathering just one day before his death.

Tracy has, however, not made any public comment post her dad and stepmom's tragic deaths. 

Rob and Michele's son Nick Reiner, 32, is now in custody following questioning by the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division. He is being held on $4 million bail, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department records.

Multiple sources who spoke with family members told People that Nick killed Rob and Michele at their Los Angeles home. Sources also told the outlet that the couple was found by their daughter, Romy Reiner, on Sunday, December 14.

Nick has previously spoken openly about his struggles with addiction, which began in his teens and later led to a period of homelessness.

As per the LA Times, at about 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, December 14, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call for medical aid at the family's home, the department told People. 

First responders found a man and a woman dead upon arrival.

Nick was later identified as a suspect and arrested at about 9:15 p.m., more than five hours after the bodies were discovered. Authorities subsequently charged him with murder in connection with his parents' deaths.

Multiple sources told People magazine that Nick and his parents had attended a Christmas party at Conan O'Brien's home the night before the alleged killings. The sources said Nick and Rob argued during the gathering.

Rob and Michele married in 1989 after meeting while Rob was directing “When Harry Met Sally.” They shared three children: Jake, Nick, and Romy.

Rob was an acclaimed director and actor whose career spanned decades. His films included “This Is Spinal Tap,” “Stand By Me,” “The Princess Bride,” “Misery,” and “A Few Good Men.” He first rose to fame as Mike “Meathead” Stivic on the sitcom “All in the Family.” 

His father was legendary comedian Carl Reiner, who died in 2020.

In a statement obtained by Variety, the Reiner family said, “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”

As the investigation continues, tributes for Rob and Michele have poured in across the entertainment industry, honoring a family whose legacy spans generations of film, television, and comedy.

Steven Spielberg is returning to the aliens-among-us grandeur of his classic films like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “War of the Worlds” with his latest event film, “Disclosure Day.” The film's title was revealed in a teaser shared online by Universal Pictures on Tuesday; the movie is set for release on June 12, 2026, with the teaser rumored to play ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” this December.

The writing was on the walls (or in the skies!) about the film's first look when an ominous billboard appeared in Times Square this month showcasing a bird and the promise that “all will be disclosed.” Spielberg's latest film stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, and Colman Domingo, with a script by David Koepp. He wrote the scripts for Spielberg's “Jurassic Park,” “The Lost World,” “War of the Worlds,” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” — films that, combined, grossed more than $3 billion worldwide.

The story for “Disclosure Day” comes from Spielberg's own idea, and while the trailer showcases some apocalyptic imagery, particularly as Blunt delivers a weather forecast interrupted by disturbing extraterrestrial noises, the plot has been concealed until now. Here's Universal's written tease so far: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Spielberg shoots the film with his regular director of photography, Janusz Kamiński, whose widescreen images of flares and shadows are on full display here. Birds, crop circles, and car chases abound. Oh, and the birds appear to be trying to tell us something, beyond just being an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film.

“Disclosure Day” is produced by five-time Academy Award nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (“The Fabelmans,” “West Side Story”) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. Spielberg's last feature was Best Picture nominee “The Fabelmans.”

Watch the teaser for “Disclosure Day” below. “Disclosure Day” is set for theaters from Universal Pictures on June 12, 2026. What's a movie summer without an alien blockbuster to kick it off?

Even after all this time, the simple fact of it still boggles my mind: Every single film James Cameron has made over the last 40 years represents some kind of evolutionary paradigm shift for blockbuster cinema. 

“The Abyss” gave us the first “photorealistic” computer-generated character, while “Terminator 2” pioneered advanced morphing effects and the far more extensive use of CGI. “Titanic” seamlessly blended digital assets with large-scale practical sets in order to create what's still the most transportive disaster movie ever made, while “Avatar” and 2022's “The Way of Water” took performance-capture technology to such extraordinary new heights — and depths — that it feels like the rest of Hollywood is lagging several generations behind. Hell, even “True Lies” could be considered a game-changer for its innovative composite work and next-gen approach to cartoonishly virulent anti-Arab racism (9/11 was still almost a decade away, but Big Jim has always been ahead of the curve!). 

 








Related Stories ‘The Housemaid' Review: Amanda Seyfried Turns in Her Second Great Performance of 2025 in Thriller Too Timid to Go Full Camp ‘Disclosure Day' Teaser: Spielberg's UFO Thriller Reveals Title and Something Very Wrong with Emily Blunt 

Which is all to say how bizarre it is to watch a James Cameron new movie that feels like something you've already seen before. That notion seemed like a distinct possibility when it was first announced that he was going to be directing four “Avatar” sequels, but it didn't prepare me for the reality of watching one of cinema's greatest explorers walk in circles for three hours, even if Cameron — being Cameron — naturally finds a way to make that journey feel novel and invigorating at times. 

 










But “Avatar: Fire and Ash” isn't just more of the same, it's also a significant amount less. 

Not only does the third installment of the “Avatar” saga lack the unprecedented spectacle of its predecessors (the second of which was somehow even more jaw-dropping than the first), it also lacks the relative newness of their storytelling. Whereas the first movie effectively camouflaged its cliches amid the uncharted planet of Pandora, and the second extrapolated the franchise's settler-adoption space fantasy into a hyper-emotive aquatic fable about the destructive nature of humanity's survival instinct, “Fire and Ash” largely devotes itself to sifting through the ruins of a world that Cameron seems half-ready to leave behind and sitting with the fallout of the series' previous battles. That wouldn't be a weakness in and of itself, but his archetypical characters weren't built to carry a “Lawrence of Arabia”-sized epic that hinges on the nuances of their love, grief, and neuroses. Spider doesn't even have a shirt, let alone the layers required for us to care about his daddy issues. 

At heart, “Fire and Ash” is a story about how people, in the broadest sense of the word, reconstitute themselves in the aftermath of war and its attendant losses. In other words, the first “Avatar” film that fails to meaningfully iterate on the premise of its franchise's is ironically preoccupied with our power to change, a tension that Cameron struggles to resolve — and indeed makes a fair bit worse — by repeating so many of the same action beats from “The Way of Water.” 

 










As might be expected of a movie that was initially conceived as the second half of the previous one (and could easily have been marketed as “The Way of Water Part II” had it been finished in time for Christmas 2023), “Fire and Ash” picks up where the first “Avatar” sequel left off. Jake Sully's family — or what's left of it — continue to mourn the cost of their latest and most devastating skirmish with the colonist forces of the Resources Development Administration, in which Jake's son Neteyam was killed by the colonist “Sky People.”

Still embedded with the Metkayina Clan in the turquoise reefs of Pandora, the Sullys each embrace their own forms of grief. Jake (Sam Worthington), who was a Marine before his consciousness was transferred into the body of a giant blue alien, retreats into a mission-oriented state of mind, while his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) seethes at the dreadlocked white human child their family has raised as one of their own (Jack Champion), in no small part because Spider's father is the evil “recombinant” who murdered Neteyam (Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, both men having the time of their lives as a towering extra-terrestrial horndog). 

Now the eldest of the Sully kids, Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) sulks with survivor's guilt, while teenage adoptee Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) questions her seemingly immaculate conception while deepening her connection to the all-knowing nature goddess Eywa. Jake and Neytiri's biological daughter Tuktirey (Trinity Bliss) is also there, a fact that Cameron seems to be remembering in real-time whenever she finds her way into the frame. But it's Spider who's firmly at the center of the action here, as his inability to breathe the Pandoran air without a mask compels Jake and his family to escort him back to the safety of the High Camp, where all of our human scientist friends from the first “Avatar” are still going strong. 

 










While that decision effectively amounts to the Sully clan losing another son (Kiri is extra upset about it, as she empathizes with Spider's outsider status), Jake rationalizes it as a necessary sacrifice to heal the cracks in his family — a family that he's always likened to a fortress. Alas, as anyone who's ever played a JRPG might expect of a journey aboard a massive flying galleon, the Sullys' convoy is attacked in the sky, and their family is scattered into a small handful of different factions that spend the rest of the movie trying to reunite. The ambush is delivered courtesy of the Mangkwan Clan, a cult of kamikaze hedonists who rejected Eywa after a volcano reduced their corner of Pandora to ash, but the RDA is happy to seize on the chaos and launch their final attack on the Metkayina's oceanic stronghold. 

The plot thickens from there, especially once the RDA finds evidence that humans might be able to breathe on Pandora after all (a discovery which could make the planet a viable new home for our species), but Cameron would much rather move the franchise inward than forward. That's an admirable decision on its face, and while it's hard not to be severely disappointed by the pat and self-evident answers we're given to the franchise's most intriguing mysteries, I can't help but support Cameron's willingness to yada yada yada over pieces of lore as soon as they've fulfilled their character-driven function (Eywa is a conveniently unknowable scapegoat, and returning co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver are happy to take full advantage of that). 

 










The problem is that these characters are seldom as intriguing as the mythology that Cameron has used to contextualize them, and — like Spider without a mask on — they begin to suffocate the moment they're forced to survive on their own. Weird and wonderful as it will always be to watch Sigourney Weaver so believably inhabit the body of a teenage alien, “Fire and Ash” has nothing of substance to add to Kiri's vision quest. The same could be said about the strained relationship between Lo'ak and Jake, or the franchise's continued fixation on stress-testing the limitations of found family, to which it applies more pressure than ever when Quaritch issues a “give us Spider and we'll stop trying to kill all the Na'vi” ultimatum. 

And speaking of Spider, no other character so epitomizes how “Fire and Ash” spends most of its time belaboring the aspects from the previous movie that worked so well in small doses. As a glorified bargaining chip in “The Way of Water,” Jack Champion's interstellar army brat was a goofy manifestation of Cameron's most wooden instincts as a writer, his stunted manchild energy a harmless throwback to earlier kid heroes like Rebecca Jorden and John Connor. 

As a — or maybe even the — central figure in this new installment, Spider is basically a surfer-coded Jar Jar Binks. Even if you, like me, find Cameron's Reagan-era bro-speak to be more of a feature than a bug, and even if you, like me, are predisposed to laugh at the part in “Fire and Ash” where Spider guilelessly rocks up next to a 22nd century space whale and shouts, “You're the man, Payakan!,” you might struggle to lock into the later and more harrowing scene where Jake Sully threatens to sacrifice his adopted son to the gods. 

 










Also, it brings me no pleasure to report that Payakan is very much not the man anymore, as the exiled Tulkan, used with precision to unlock oceans of feeling in “The Way of Water,” is wasted here on an enervating “courtroom” subplot that entrusts far too much of this movie to the power of Papyrus subtitles. Like so much of “Fire and Ash,” Payakan's urgent plea for his species to abandon their pacifist ways and fight back against the Sky People keys into Cameron's all too relevant fascination with the various ways that communities reconfigure themselves in response to annihilation. Complicating his tendency to valorize Jake Sully's willingness to realign his allegiances in the face of lived experience, and to vilify Quaritch for continuing to other the Na'vi even after essentially becoming one of them himself, Cameron defines the Mangkwan Clan by how radically they altered their principles in response to the catastrophe that destroyed their home. The “Ash People” don't respect the balance that Eywa demands between ethos and elasticity, and so our heroes must fight them to the death. 

The Mangkwan Clan are one of the only new elements introduced in “Fire and Ash,” and are unsurprisingly responsible for all of the most exciting elements of the movie. Chief among those elements, and chief among the Mangkwan themselves, is a sky-scraping cosmic domme by the name of Varang (Oona Chaplin, going all out), who erupts into this movie with a head full of fire and a power kink that literally brings Quaritch to his knees. An embittered warrior shaman who dresses like an enraged Dilophosaurus and gets off on using her neural queue to force other Na'vi to serve her commands (the sexual imagery here will ripple across Tumblr for decades to come), Varang is both an interesting challenge to Jake's Eywa-loving family and an incredible foil for Quaritch's ongoing adventures in cross-species hybridization. 

 










Cameron might ignore the fact that Quaritch is basically an immortal being who wouldn't remember any of this stuff if he died again, but he sure has fun with the fact that Varang introduces the character to a degree of mutability that Quaritch never allowed before. There's more than a little whiff of Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw to how fast a fascist like Quaritch admits to fetishizing the same population he exists to destroy, and Lang — like Sean Penn — takes giddy advantage of the opportunity this movie gives him to play around with that. The extent to which getting freaky with Varang does, and does not, change who Quaritch is at heart represents the most gripping and detailed character work that “Fire and Ash” has to offer, even if those nuances feel like a distant memory by the time Cameron devotes the story's final act to a dull rerun of the big battle from “The Way of Water.”

Which unavoidably brings us to the ultimate sin of this movie, which is that “Fire and Ash,” as a blockbuster spectacle, fails to meet the unreasonably high standard that James Cameron has set for himself — the unreasonably high standard by which he demands to be judged. 

The action is clean, massive, and staged at a level several cuts above Hollywood's usual CGI slopfests, but only the “Mad Max”-like introduction of the Mangkwan raiders sparks the same visceral excitement that made the last acts of the previous two movies so indelible. There isn't a single beat here that hits with the same fist-pumping force of the Na'vi shooting giant arrows at the RDA forces in mid-air, or Payakan ripping the arm off one of the bad guys who's come to attack the reef. In fact, that same guy is back for seconds, and — in a failing that feels unprecedented in the history of Cameron's filmography — his inevitable demise lands with a half-hearted whimper. So too does everything else in the grand finale, which smacks of obligation where even the least ambitious setpieces in his previous films were drunk with opportunity. 

 










There are certainly things to see here (the Wind Traders' air ship is a majestic vision of floating tentacles, and the sight of Edie Falco operating an “Aliens”-like mechanical exoskeleton is… something), and even the worst “Avatar” movie makes for an undeniable argument on behalf of the theatrical experience (though my patience for high frame rates is at an all-time low). But this one shrugs its way to the finish line with a sense that it doesn't excite its creator in the same way that it used to — that Cameron needs the novelty this film is missing even more than we do. 

I know that Cameron has committed himself to another two sequels, and now I know why he's starting to hedge about whether or not he wants to direct them himself; even the most orgiastic moments in “Fire and Ash” left me feeling like he's ready to come back down to Earth. 

20th Century Studios will release “Avatar: Fire and Ash” in theaters on Friday, December 19.

Independent film has been declared dead often enough to qualify as a horror subgenre. Box office is synonymous with struggle, streamers retreated from discovery, and the festival-to-distribution pipeline feels like a straw. Everyone knows the drill: fewer buyers, slower deals, shrinking risk tolerance, and a talent pool stuck waiting for a system that isn't correcting itself.

 










At the same time, a growing cohort of filmmakers is opting out of the long march toward institutional validation. They're borrowing from the creator economy's playbook instead: start small, move fast, build community, own the means of production, and treat strategy as part of the creative process.

That's the backdrop for “Skit,” a $65,000 feature that began as an almost comically DIY proposition between a father-daughter duo — a veteran media executive-turned-media theorist and an early-career actor staring down a post-strike Hollywood. 

 










This isn't a miracle story. It's nepotism as apprenticeship, and a case study in what happens when filmmakers stop waiting for permission and start building.

What they made is less a microbudget success than a preview of where indie filmmaking may be headed next: creator brain meets indie grit, an eight-day sprint treated like a startup launch, a distribution plan engineered before anyone called “action,” and a path to a worldwide, day-and-date premiere on Tubi.

In another era, a straight-to-streaming film made for $65K would have been dismissed. Today, it looks like part of a larger power shift — one in which distribution, marketing, and even greenlights are no longer handed down, but designed from the ground up.

Evan Shapiro and Jamie Shapiro's candid, sometimes combative exchange is both blueprint and provocation for filmmakers still clinging to the old model. What follows is their unvarnished conversation about making Skit, navigating a creator-driven marketplace, and why the future of indie film may belong to those who greenlight themselves first. Let Hollywood catch up later.

EVAN SHAPIRO: I am really worried about indie movies — basically panic stricken over their future. I've worked in independent film for over 20 years: I was general manager of IFC and then president of both IFC and Sundance TV.

 










In 2006, I executive produced the Kirby Dick documentary “This Film Is Not Yet Rated,” which demonstrated the bias Hollywood and movie theater owners have against indie film, using the MPA as bag man.

Last year, I collaborated with Keri Putnam on her study of independent and documentary film which showed that, despite streamers, commissioners, and theaters all but abandoning independent cinema, there is still a huge demand among Americans for indies and documentaries — one that goes underserved as the general economics of Hollywood slip into systemic failure.

At that very moment, you, my daughter, pitched me on producing an indie movie called “Skit.”

JAMIE SHAPIRO: I moved to LA a year and a half earlier in the hopes of living out my dream as an actress, only to be met with the industry-wide strikes. Ever dramatic, I was mourning the death of my nonexistent career.

Post-strikes, Hollywood resembled one of those dinosaur dioramas right before the asteroids hit: actors scrambling for work, directors teaching workshops they don't believe in, writers pretending to “staff” on imaginary shows. Every creative I knew was stuck waiting for someone with a laminated badge to grant them permission to exist.

And that is when two of your longtime mentees, Des Lombardo and Badr Mastrouq, brought you their script — with me conveniently attached as producer and star.

 










You had been coaching me (aka screaming at me) to take control of my career now, or I'd be at risk of waiting tables at a hipster Silverlake restaurant for the rest of my life (or worse, living at home with you and Mom).

So when Des, Badr, and I brought you this project with a mid-five-figure budget, you agreed. And then you texted me budget spreadsheets, demanding we drive toward production far faster than any of us had originally planned.

EVAN: Simultaneously, I had been writing and speaking about the rise of the creator economy — how it was becoming the gravitational center of global culture, andhow, if they so choose, producers and publishers could and should become creators themselves.

Which is why I urged (aka forced) the creative team of “Skit” to keep the budget super low and lean, while still maintaining a premium, professional mindset in making the movie.

JAMIE: “Skit” became our collective crash course in what happens when you treat a film like a creator project.

We ran the entire production like a DIY startup: casting brilliant, up-and-coming actors and comedians who hadn't yet gotten the roles they deserve; utilizing a SAG micro-budget contract (which feels like the only part of Hollywood tethered to the current media reality); and embarking on a whirlwind eight-day shoot that took years off our lives.

 










It resulted in a finished feature less than four months after greenlight and a movie that actually feels alive. It was creator-brain-meets-indie-film-grit: make it small, make it sharp, and make it now, not in five years when the industry finally decides creativity is back in style.

EVAN: As we finished the film, we started collaborating with BBC Studios on content about their fandom-first business model and creator mindset.

I was speaking to Anjali Sud, CEO of Tubi, about their burgeoning creator strategy, and we started partnering with Alan D'Escragnolle, CEO of Filmhub, on a slate of thought-leadership initiatives. I also fell down the rabbit hole of #filmtok.

All of this helped me solidify a distribution strategy for Skit built entirely on the foundation of the creator economy.

JAMIE: The wild part is how quickly that creator theme boomeranged back at us in real time. I met Anjali Sud (on whom I have an insane career crush) at a Fordham Business School event where you were interviewing her, and I all but ambushed her with: “Hi, I love your whole thing, please continue reinventing streaming so people like me don't starve.”

Then at StreamTV in Denver I met Sam Harowitz, head of content acquisitions at Tubi, who spoke about the future of content like he was reading prophecy off a stone tablet. It felt like everyone outside the traditional film bubble was saying the same thing: “Creators are the new Hollywood.”

 










EVAN: So we built a fully fleshed-out meta marketing and community strategy. I took it to our friends at Filmhub over a sushi dinner.

We partnered with the amazing PR team at FerenComm. Then we went to Tubi, where Sam introduced us to Rich Bloom — who Anjali had just brought on board to build out their creator platform — and where Filmhub already had a strong content partnership.

While we already had a good relationship with Tubi, the partnership with Filmhub was crucial. It allowed Tubi to come on board without crafting a one-off deal for a single tiny indie film from smaller creators.

Instead, we were able to use existing infrastructure to move quickly and make a deal for an exclusive premiere on the platform.

JAMIE: I remember you calling me to break the good news — and you being annoyingly right about, “if you want to make stuff… blah blah blah.”

EVAN: I believe the end of that is this: First, you need to understand the market for your stuff.Then build a holistic plan that fits that market. Then go make your stuff, with a budget and timeline that lets you take advantage of the market — before the market changes again.

Unfortunately, making films or TV series isn't only about the art. It's not just camera angles and narrative structure. Filmmakers need to be strategists, marketers, press agents, and dealmakers. I know that sounds daunting, but when artists think beyond the art and focus on the business part of show business, they can make things happen.

 










What's more, there are people on the other side of the business waiting and willing to work with them.

JAMIE: That's been the most surprising part of this process. Filmhub and Tubi were incredibly chill — no labyrinthine contracts, no “maybe in Q4 of 2031” release windows. Just: yes, let's do it, and here's how.

EVAN: But that's because we came in with everything already figured out. We made it easy for them to say yes.

As Rich Bloom said on our podcast: Yes, it was a really good film; we had the right expectations; the project perfectly matched their strategy; we came to the table with an existing partner; and we arrived with a fully fleshed-out marketing plan. That's how we got a worldwide, day-and-date premiere for a $65,000 film shot in eight days, one year after we wrapped.

JAMIE: It almost made me suspicious, honestly. But the reality is that by understanding our audience — and the needs of potential buyers — we found genuinely good partners who believe indie doesn't mean insignificant.

EVAN: So what do you think this experiment has taught us?

JAMIE: “Skit” taught me that the old-school indie philosophy of “just start making stuff” isn't quaint nostalgia. It's more relevant now, in the creator economy, than at any other point in film history. It's not easy, but there are more tools and more information available than ever before.

 










I've learned that a young artist who wants to work needs to greenlight themself — make the thing in a way they can actually afford.

EVAN: So what's next?

JAMIE: First, we need to get everyone to watch “Skit.” Next, my collaborators and I are about to shoot “BFA,” a pilot based on our experiences in NYU's theater program.

We saved up, we're spending our own money, and we're calling in a lot of favors to shoot it ourselves in five days. Then we're releasing it on YouTube — an idea I would have rejected out of hand before this experience.

EVAN: It's ironic, yes: the boomer mentality is a real blocker to the transformation media needs. But Gen Z artists in film schools are often stuck in those same ruts.

Young filmmakers still cling to traditional distribution — festivals, theaters, gatekeepers — because of a romantic Hollywood fantasy we were all raised on. This is a learned delusion. Film schools still preach it, partly because the people teaching haven't made a movie since dial-up internet, and partly because it's easier to teach submission than subversion.

I loved making “Skit” with you because it's timely and fresh — but also because it's a real case study for the next generation of indie filmmakers.

JAMIE: I feel like you should have said “because you love me” or something. But that's fine.

 










Making “Skit” didn't just give me a film. It gave me a blueprint. Stop waiting. Stop hoping. Stop emailing the same manager for eight months. Develop your art. Then develop the plan to make it. Then develop the plan to get it seen.

“Skit” showed me that the future belongs to the artists who build the thing first — and let Hollywood catch up later.

EVAN: I do love you, you know.

JAMIE: Whatever. Too late now.

“Skit” is now available to stream for free on Tubi, Amazon, Apple TV, Relay, Roku, and YouTube Movies & TV.

5. What the WBD Deal Tells Us About Netflix, YouTube, Games, and Short-Run Series by Jen Topping

Filmmakers lamenting the increased consolidation of Hollywood often take solace in the idea that the old industry is dying and the real opportunity growth lies in short form videos and other new media. But what if traditional industry players start moving into those spaces too? This article makes the case that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery has as much to do with competing against YouTube as anything else — and explores what that means for creators.4. Doorways Into a Film by Tomas Leach

I have always enjoyed the Little Scraps of Filmmaking Substack for its literary reflections on the filmmaking process. This essay offers a detailed exploration of a seemingly mundane topic — figuring out how to format a document for sharing film ideas with collaborators — that's thoughtful and informative.3. The Hidden Potential in Streaming's Enshittification by Max Cea
 










Any silver linings that we can find in the current entertainment industry should be cherished. Here, newsletter favorite Max Cea makes the case that the declining quality of streaming services could end up being the factor that nudges audiences back towards paying for individual films in ways that benefit artists, whether that's in theaters or on boutique services.2. Stop Apologizing for Being Too Many Things at Once by Maris Lidaka

It used to be a widely accepted best practice that specializing early was a reliable path to forging a career in the film industry. But while young professionals with an interest in a variety of departments were told to pick a lane, this article makes the case that the once-maligned jack-of-all-trades mentality has now become an advantage.1. Mary Sloppins by Travis Clark

Disney's deal with OpenAI nauseated many film purists, but are the specifics of the licensing agreement really that bad? Once you get past the initial visceral reaction about some of pop culture's most iconic characters teaming up with the company behind ChatGPT, Clark argues that the notion of a controlled licensing agreement that doesn't use the likenesses or voices of real people and gives the copyright holder some degree of control might be a repeatable path forward.

Putting the adverb in his alias to good use, Fred again.. has spent the past decade becoming ubiquitous. Born Frederick John Philip Gibson, he's crafted chart-toppers for names like Ed Sheeran and BTS, kicked it with iconic rappers like Skepta, recorded an uncharacteristically subdued album with his former neighbor Brian Eno, and spun at some of the planet's most Instagrammable places. Now, after another blockbuster year, the DJ de jour lands with the second official instalment of his “infinite” album project, USB. Dropped incrementally over the course of a 10-week, 10-city tour, USB002 is a slick odyssey through contemporary dance music, with a typically bass-heavy thrust and names like Amyl and the Sniffers, Danny Brown, and Floating Points helping out. It makes for an energetic soundtrack to stadium raves, but it's not always easy to tell what, if anything, he's trying to say with it beneath the snarling low end.

Like its predecessor, USB002 is presented (at least in its digital form) less as a complete album and more like a track dump from Gibson's overheated hard drive and revolving-door studio sessions. As a concept, it purports to trade the typical album-release cycle for something sprawling, iterative, and hyper-shareable. It suits Gibson's prolific work rate and, more interestingly, might hint at a new release model for DJs: the USB as an album. (For most of us, the continually updated tracklist, now 34 tracks long on streaming platforms, mostly just looks like a playlist.) But with artists increasingly letting their albums trickle out piecemeal, it's debatable how novel the USB concept really is. Packaged as a never-ending release, USB002 lands more like a clever promotional gambit than a pioneering twist on the album format.

The music suggests a producer making decisive choices, even if he isn't quite evolving from the project's first installment. Gone are the maudlin pop and deep house that marked pre-USB hits like “adore u.” And while typical Fred again.. signatures do surface, like the slightly-too-saccharine gated chords on “solo,” or the smudged, low-attack synth breakdowns on “you're a star,” USB002 favors the club over the contemplative. UK garage and four-on-the-floor beats lurk under nearly every track, the melodies are insidiously catchy, and Gibson's production moves spotlessly, thanks to his past in pop music. Even on tunes like “..FEISTY,” where wobbling bass and chunky kicks might usually tip into mix-drowning excess, Gibson's precision reins everything in, letting BIA's strutting vocal lines propel the track.

Some of USB002's efficacy, like PinkPantheress' Fancy Some More? or Charli XCX's Brat remix project, can also be attributed to the sheer density of its guestlist. Not many producers have the ability to pull together such a wide-ranging crew, getting JPEGMAFIA, Floating Points, Australian techno producer Skin on Skin, Caribou, Twitch streamer PlaqueBoyMax, and UKG superstar Sammy Virji all rubbing shoulders in Fred's crowded virtual DJ booth alongside earlier collaborators like Skrillex, Romy, Lil Yachty, and Overmono.

Where PinkPantheress and Charli XCX's projects, although remix-based (and similarly clouted), felt like genuine interactions between peers and influences, USB002's link-ups often feel more functional than mutually illuminative. The album's beats are uniformly punchy, offering solid foundations for his guest vocalists; the euphoric chords of “solo” make for an effective contrast with Blanco's heartbroken rhymes, and BIA's rasp sounds fittingly menacing paired with the blown-out garage and hip-hop beats of “ICEY..” and “..FEISTY.” But if anything, his collabs sound too much like Fred again..—there's barely any trace of Floating Points inside the lumbering “Ambery,” save some brief flickers of synthesizer, and Caribou is similarly rendered anonymous beneath Brazilian singer Menor Teteu's lilting vocals on “Facilita.” And the album's most provocative feature, from Aussie punks Amyl and the Sniffers, is rendered unrecognizable amid the pro-forma drum'n'bass breaks of “you're a star.” There's no doubt that Fred again.. knows his way around a banger, and industrial-flavored techno of tracks like “I Luv U” makes a welcome return to the darkness of “Rumble.” But for a project touted as “infinite,” USB002 feels curiously constrained by the narrowness of its horizons.

Mavi buried an objective inside Let the Sun Talk: “Can't wait until my raps is more than stashes for my secrets.” The line poked at his Earl-indebted tendency to obfuscate in his rhymes and underscored the quest for lucidity that powers his racing, headlong flows. Even when the Charlotte rapper speaks in code, he wants to be felt. He's become less cryptic since that 2019 record, trading lo-fi grime and heady philosophy for vivid dispatches about fame, addiction, and depression over lucent beats. Secrets still abounded on 2022's sun-bleached Laughing so Hard, it Hurts and 2024's desolate Shadowbox, but Mavi began to bend them as often as he stashed them, incorporating myth, fiction, and folklore into his diaristic writing. Mavi's pain rap is as dreamy and playful as it is anguished.

He approaches legibility from a new angle on The Pilot. You can hear his voice more clearly as he swaggers across these uptempo, pristine songs. His flows stream rather than coil; his words are steadier, more clarion. The melancholic soot of his past music has been pressure-washed away, revealing a confident stylist. The project, a prelude to his upcoming album First in Flight that he says will explore Afrofuturism and invention, isn't as emotive as his past music, but it pursues the same goal of relentless truth-telling. For now, Mavi's truth is simply that being rich and sober feels fucking great.

Well, sorta. The flexes and taunts that populate The Pilot tend to be loaded. From the opening bar—“I'm the best-dressed nigga on my therapist couch”—Mavi's tongue is firmly in cheek. He spends very little time on The Pilot explicitly confessing, largely narrating a plush life of designer fragrances and fits, foreign travel, and trips to the bank. But the toasts constantly get qualified and complicated. “I'm in the sky all alone on a tightrope dancing,” he raps on “Heavy Hand,” briskly turning an image of freedom into one of precarity. “Picking out the lock like beady beads, I'm three degrees/From priesthood or the precinct,” he raps on “Mender,” again placing himself inches away from peril.

Lines that begin as toasts often spiral into laments then lurch into threats or prayers, a flux supercharged by Mavi's shifting flows. His frequent allegro cadence accents how deftly he changes direction within verses. “Silent Film,” set to mellow chords and a shuffling breakbeat, is casually breathless: “I roll the dough and cook it/Was juggin' cause in a world so cold, you just throw on a hoodie/I see the limit and push it, sneaking over the edge/Made a million off of my grief, none of my people rose from the dead,” Mavi raps, subtly pausing—and stretching and compressing words—to keep the meter. While the mood of the jet-setting tape is largely celebratory and easygoing, turbulence is constant. Mavi just makes it bounce.

The production is giddy. Flute trills (“Denise Murell”), soul samples (“Landgrab,” “Mender”), and horns (“Triple Nickel”) get looped into gnarled shapes then tousled with airy keys and drums that patter and snap. “G-ANNIS FREESTYLE,” produced by Reuben Vincent, is the most distinct, with thick bass kicks and lolled effects that sound like Peanuts adults speaking with mouthfuls of tahini. But the elegant multipart horn and string loop of “Typewriter” is the most thrilling. Producer lilchick makes use of every little instrument and texture in the sample, creating a bounty of pockets for MAVI and Kenny Mason to run through with their slick double-times. “I was bred in the violence of poverty/I would die ‘fore I feel it again,” Mason raps, distilling the tape's hardscrabble ethos.

The strongest songs embrace a sense of ambivalence. “31 Days” is all forward motion, Mavi relaying thoughts as they come even when they clash. “Don't ask me how I'm cleansin' my conscience,” he says at one point, more keen to vent than to process. And then there's the stunning “Landgrab,” Mavi's latest team-up with Earl. In 90 seconds, the pair slyly plots a kooky vision of Black revolt, referencing John Henry, Michael Olowokandi, and Rick Owens in a hazy back and forth that's silly, serious, and exquisitely precise. That's Mavi's mission throughout The Pilot: to be every version of himself all at once—the soothsayer, the spitter, the misanthrope, the YRN. None of these roles are new to his music, but here they're co-conspirators rather than distant selves.

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	A prominent public figure who was outspoken about his politics was brutally killed on Sunday, and Republicans would like you to know that they would never, under no circumstances, mock or minimize a tragedy to score political points.


	Unless the president does it first.


	The reaction to the death of famed director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer, who were allegedly murdered at their Los Angeles home by their son Nick, fell largely into national grief for the man behind films such as The Princess Bride, This Is Spinal Tap, and When Harry Met Sally. 


	The motive behind the murders has not been established, but some conservative s — many aware of Reiner's past criticism of President Donald Trump and his connections to prominent Democratic figures — were quick to assert that they would never dance on his grave  because they disagreed with his politics.


	“You won't see people on the right celebrating the horrific murder of Rob Reiner and his wife. Compare to the Left's reaction to Charlie Kirk's murder,” Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec wrote late Sunday night on social media. Several other conservatives made similar posts. “Liberals are desperately searching for a prominent conservative mocking Rob Reiner and his wife passing,” wrote MAGA commentator Gunter Eagleman.

	Is the president of the United States prominent enough?


	Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social that the reason Reiner had been killed was because of “the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”

	











	“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” Trump added. “May Rob and Michele rest in peace.”

	Trump doubled down on his comments later on Monday, telling reporters in the Oval Office that Reiner was “deranged” and that he was “very bad for our country.”


	Trump is, of course, the first person the conservative movement looks to to gauge how they should feel about something. The president's post about Reiner was so despicable, however, that the right wasn't sure how to proceed.


	Some, like Posobiec, began scrambling to craft a defense of Trump's post. “Rob Reiner called for Trump to be jailed over lies. Not surprised Trump said what he said,” Posobiec wrote, alongside several reposts of videos and content highlighting the director's past criticism of the president. Eagleman shared a screen grab of Trump's post but quoted only “May Rob and Michele rest in peace,” as if it were sincere, while ignoring the substance of the post.


	Conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter in the span of a few posts went from claiming that all he had seen were “conservatives being horrified,” to telling people to “CRY MORE” about Trump's statements.


	Laura Loomer, who has advised Trump since he retook office, wrote that Reiner was “a loser.”


	“Naturally, his son was also a loser, and he got addicted to drugs and allegedly murdered his parents,” she continued, attaching a fake, anti-Trump Reiner tweet for effect. “Looks like Rob should've spent more time parenting & less time spreading Russia conspiracy hoaxes about President Trump. I stand with President Trump.”

	In raising the specter of Kirk, conservatives also renewed attention on their  vengeful public crackdown against anyone who dared criticize Kirk in the aftermath of his assassination in September. Many Americans who spoke ill of Kirk after the shooting were fired from their jobs, with a Reuters investigation finding that at least 600 people were “fired, suspended, placed under investigation or disciplined by employers,” for comments about Kirk. 


	At least a few on the right realized that after conducting such an intense campaign of public pillorying of Kirk's critics, Trump's comments were — at a bare minimum — a terrible look. “We can't call out the Left for celebrating Charlie's assassination but laugh at this because it's a ‘mean tweet,' wrote MAGA influencer Brilyn Hollyhand. “Taking a victory lap when a critic is killed? That's how you lose Gen Z and independents. We can't sit on a pedestal and condemn the Left but normalize this.” 

	











	Congressional Republicans were largely silent. The few, the proud, the ones who already have bones to pick with Trump were the most outspoken.


	“This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a recently converted Trump critic, replied to the president's post on X. “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,” she added. Greene is correct, but that didn't stop her and virtually every Republican in the MAGA movement from leveraging the addiction issues of former President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a cudgel against the former president. Something to think about as Greene continues her attempted rebrand. 


	Longtime Trump critic Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) wrote in response to Trump's post: “Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.” 


	A few other Republicans found it in themselves to gently chide the president. “This statement is wrong,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) wrote on X. “Regardless of one's political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It's a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.” 


	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who announced this summer that he will not seek reelection in a district that is expected to flip Democratic in 2026, told Axios that the post was “not presidential. The couple were stabbed to death. Most Americans want more and better from our president.”


	Other influencers and commentators, including Piers Morgan, radio host Erick Erickson, and social media influencer Sage Steele criticized the president for being hypocritical and making Reiner's death about himself. Greg Gutfeld awkwardly tried to reckon with Trump's comments Monday night on Fox News. “He was asked to and he didn't,” the host said when a panelist said he hoped the president corrects himself. “You don't have to like the thing he says all the time. In my filter, Trump is always words versus deeds. I don't have to like what he says. In fact, I can hate what he says. But I can also think, in his brain, he's going, this guy compared me to Hitler, he put a target on my back, I don't like him.”

	











	“If it was me, I would go, like, but I'm sorry he's dead,” Gutfeld added. 


	Of course, there will always be those who flat-out defend the president's most vile acts even as they continue to brand themselves as spiritual leaders within the conservative movement.

	After testing the waters earlier this year at New York's Gramercy Theatre, Jesse Malin is relaunching his Silver Manhattan stage show in full force in February, setting up shop five nights a week at a brand-new venue. The 90-minute production, part-concert and part-play, will take up residency at the Bowery Palace, the Lower East Side club formerly known as Bowery Electric. After the rock room closes at the end of January, it'll be converted into a 100-seat theater and venue.


	“Silver Manhattan is the most personal thing I've ever done on stage,” Malin said in a statement. “I want to run it in a smaller theater, and look into the eyes of everyone in the room. I have so much history on the Bowery — I played CBGB's as a kid, and grew up in the neighborhood. My grandfather sold liquor to the bars up and down the Bowery. It's nice to go back to the scene of the crime. There are a lot of beautiful ghosts and spirits on this sacred ground.”


	Malin is a fixture of the New York rock, punk, and hardcore scene, as both a solo artist and with his former bands Heart Attack and D Generation. In 2023, the singer suffered a spinal stroke that paralyzed him from the waist down.

	He describes Silver Manhattan as “his love letter to New York,” as well as a tale of resilience. “Survival is a creative act,” Malin says.

Silver Manhattan is produced by Tony-nominated ArKtype / Tommy Kriegsmann and David Bason, and directed by Ellie Heyman. Justin Craig (Stereophonic) and Malin's longtime bandmate Derek Cruz are music directors.

	











	Malin will release his first book, Almost Grown: A New York Memoir, in April.

	After much speculation about his future and possible retirement, Howard Stern confirmed that he won't be leaving the airwaves anytime soon.


	On Tuesday, Dec. 16, the talk radio great revealed that he had inked a new deal with longtime broadcaster SiriusXM for three more years. “I'm happy to announce that I figured out a way to have it all,” Stern said on his show. “More free time and continuing to be on the radio. So, yes, we are coming back for three years.”


	Exact financial terms weren't disclosed, though Stern reportedly netted $100 million when he signed his last five-year contract in 2020. It's also not immediately clear what Stern's schedule will look like going forward if he is to have “more free time.” New episodes of The Howard Stern Show currently air Mondays through Wednesdays, with each broadcast lasting about three hours.  


	With his contract set to expire this year, Stern's future has been the subject of much speculation (and the host has characteristically worked to stoke curiosity on his own end). Rumors of his retirement first popped in August while Stern was in the middle of his summer hiatus, with President Donald Trump even chiming in.

	Stern then began to tease a big announcement on social media, saying he would address everything when his show returned in September. He wound up sparking even more uncertainty when that return date was pushed from Sept. 2 to Sept. 8 at the last minute.

	Capping it all off, Stern enlisted Andy Cohen to prank his listeners on his return show. Cohen opened the show by explaining to listeners that he was taking over Stern's time slot, deadpanning: “There's been a lot of talk about what's going to happen with Howard's deal,” Cohen said. “Is he fired? I don't know how much I'm allowed to say, except that he's not here and I am.”


	Stern, however, eventually took over about 20 minutes into the show. He revealed that his original return had been postponed due to illness, not contract negotiations, and joked about the rumors about his supposed retirement and firing. “What pisses me off is that now I can't leave,” he cracked. “I've been thinking about retiring. Now I can't.”

Jerry Seinfeld remembered Rob Reiner on Monday night, crediting the filmmaker with the success of his hit comedy Seinfeld. 


	“Next to Larry David and George Shapiro, Rob Reiner had the biggest influence on my career,” Seinfeld wrote on Instagram. “Our show would have never happened without him. He saw something no one else could. When nobody at the network liked the early episodes, he saved us from cancellation.”


	He continued, “That I was working with Carl Reiner's son, who happened to be one of the kindest people in show business, seemed unreal. I was naive at the time to how much his passion for us meant. Rob and Michele married right as our show was starting and they became an imprint for me of how it's supposed to work, each one broadening the other. Their death, together, is impossibly sad.” 


Seinfeld, which aired on NBC from 1989 until 1998, was produced by Reiner's company Castle Rock Entertainment. In 2016, Reiner discussed the inception of the series in an interview with Howard Stern and remembered helping to save the show from early cancellation. 

	











	He recalled Seinfeld and David coming in to pitch Seinfeld. “We knew they were two funny guys,” Reiner told Stern. “That wasn't the issue.” He added that the network was uncertain what the show was going to be.

	“We knew we had a great show and they wanted to take it off the air,” Reiner said. “They said, ‘We can't have this show. Because what is this show? It's just people sitting around talking.' Remember, they called it the ‘show about nothing.'”

	Reiner went into NBC and had a “screaming, crazy thing” with executive Brandon Tartikoff. “I begged him,” Reiner said. “I said, ‘Please, I promise you there'll be stories. You can't take this show off the air. It's going to be one of the great shows you've ever had.'” 


	Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner were found dead in their home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Shortly after, their son Nick Reiner was arrested for allegedly killing his parents. Much of Hollywood has paid tribute to the beloved filmmaker since.

Disclosure Day is coming, and it ain't like E.T.

At long last, we know what Steven Spielberg's next movie is. The director and studio Universal Pictures have kept the details on the 2026 project close to the vest, and all we really knew was it was a sci-fi film about UFOs. Now, we finally have a trailer for the film, titled Disclosure Day, which is attached to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. And it looks... strange.

The Disclosure Day teaser trailer sets the stage for what looks to be an alien invasion, though whether it's a peaceful one or not remains to be seen. This first look at the film looks less at the invaders themselves, who may be acting through Earth's fauna, but a world of seven billion people learning what's happening to their planet. The inciting incident, of all things, seems to be a newscast. A character played by Emily Blunt is about to give the weather report when she starts emitting a strange and intense set of gurgles and clicks. From there, the world slowly finds out what's happening as characters played by Josh O'Connor (Challengers), Colin Firth (the Kingsman movies), Colman Domingo (Sing Sing), and Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, daughter of Bono) come to grips with extraterrestrial intelligence.

A proper synopsis for the film hasn't been released. However, key dialogue in the trailer, which is also included in the trailer's description, reads, ""If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you?"" It appears to be yet another take on Spielberg's fascination with how alien life would interact with the people of Earth, which he's previously explored in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds.

Disclosure Day is directed by Spielberg with a script from longtime collaborator David Koepp (based on a story by Spielberg), who wrote scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Koepp's non-Spielberg writing work includes Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (writer), Stir of Echoes (writer/director), Mission: Impossible (co-writer), and 2025's critically acclaimed Black Bag (writer) from director Steven Soderbergh. Legendary composer John Williams is once again teaming up with Spielberg to score Disclosure Day.

Disclosure Day will arrive in movie theaters on June 12, 2026. It will be Spielberg's first film since the semi-autobiographical The Fabelmans, and his first dalliance in sci-fi since 2018's Ready Player One.

Exotic mystical beliefs have always been a mark of pagan culture. So what does it mean when these obsessions go mainstream in formerly Christian nations?

PUBLISHED ON

December 16, 2025

In 2017, I became fiercely interested in the subject of UFOs or UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). This began for me with a New York Times article revealing Pentagon videos of an encounter between U.S. Navy jets on a training exercise and an anomalous object off the coast of San Diego. Initially, my thought was that this represented a kind of novel propulsion breakthrough, the “phenomenon” being a cover story to shield black budget programs.  



Then, whistleblower and Air Force officer David Grusch testified to Congress that the government had actually recovered and was reverse-engineering craft of “unknown origin.” (It is also important to note that Grusch has since told members of Congress that he believes some of these “beings” are living among us.) As of this past month, other senior U.S. Government officials have reiterated the existence of nonhuman intelligence in a documentary titled The Age of Disclosure. Some notable appearances include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former DNI director James Clapper, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Sen. Mike Rounds. 



Flying saucers and alien bodies are admittedly a tall order, and while I am not a journalist, an interesting interaction with an aerospace contractor convinced me that enough was there to do some investigating of my own. Over several years, I attended scientific conferences and met with officials and journalists who all were seriously interested in the subject. I sourced FOIA documents and discovered—among other things—a slew of accounts pertaining to activity around sensitive U.S. military installations as early as the late 1940s. These were reports from employees at nuclear stockpile sites and power plants that described various objects of different shapes and sizes interfering with security systems and missile readiness.

Some of these scientists and officials I would later meet alleged retaliation for researching the topic: their clearances had been revoked, the brake lines of their cars mysteriously cut, and others told stories of individuals who had allegedly been killed or went missing for being “too loud.” Many of these attendees engaged with the subject quietly and professionally while maintaining high-level employment at universities and within the defense sector.  



My question to them over time gradually became: “What is it?” 



The kinds of responses I received were mixed—some said they had no idea, while others claimed to directly engage with the phenomenon on a regular basis. Over time, in these conversations, a kind of through line appeared: that these things, rather than being a kind of interplanetary visitor as the movies always describe, are actually an intelligence that has existed here, possibly long before us. 



Many Catholic commentators have suggested, some with very little examination, that this phenomenon is demonic, and to that end I believe there is some truth. Hauntings on ranches, orbs, shadowy figures repelled by prayer, these stories are hardly novel in Catholic tradition. But if it's true that there is physical, recovered, metal hardware that relies on a more advanced understanding of physics, to what extent do demonic entities play a role? 



This ambiguity has created a vacuum—one increasingly filled by what I perceive to be a modern Gnosticism. Among the credentialed scientists I met, mystical language was common. Dr. Travis Taylor, a lead researcher on The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, told me he believed the phenomenon had a psychic component, once hearing “something like Hebrew in his head” while studying the paranormal ranch. Others (like congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna) have referenced the Book of Enoch to suggest an Earthy, more biblical origin. Firsthand whistleblowers speak of Greek-like symbology on recovered metals, ancient intelligences dwelling in the oceans, or beings capable of manipulating consciousness directly. 



What is the Church's official position on this matter? Officially, there isn't one, largely because there isn't sufficient evidence. According to Catholic Answers, 




There is no Catholic position on the existence of aliens, as such. Whether life exists on other planets is a scientific, not a theological, question. If alien life on other planets is ever discovered, there are theological questions which can be considered.

Some in the Church have ventured further. The late Msgr. Corrado Balducci—an exorcist and theologian of the Roman Curia—reportedly told Dr. Steven Greer that extraterrestrials, if they exist, are not hostile, and that “God cannot be so foolish as to entrust all of His hopes for intelligent beings to this planet alone.” Greer's recounting may not be reliable, but Balducci made similar statements publicly during his lifetime. 



Whatever the case may be with regard to evidence, the idea of interfacing with nonhuman intelligence is growing increasingly popular. Jake Barber—a whistleblower himself—runs a company called Skywatcher.ai, which claims the ability to directly “call” the objects down range on a desert installation he operates with his team in California.  



I had the opportunity to speak with Jake at one of these conferences. When I asked him how often he encountered these anomalous objects, Jake replied, “every single day. We have had multiple landings…some have flown directly over us.” The call, as he describes it, utilizes both human “psionic” ability and proprietary electronic signaling. Many of these “psionic” individuals are Native American. Skywatcher's data collection has attracted the interest of serious researchers from Stanford and other universities, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office or AARO.  



After my last attendance, I made the decision not to delve further into the topic. The idea of engaging with mysterious nonhuman entities (especially involving highly influential people with access to serious funding) was deeply unsettling. I defer to whatever the Church decides this phenomenon—if it can ever be understood—to ultimately be, but there is absolutely a “there” there. The U.S. government has probably paid tens of millions of dollars to study it. 



My concern, as a Catholic, is about what happens next. There must additionally be a recognition that mystical experiences have grown more culturally popular in recent years, propped up by large celebrity podcasts and PR machines. Ufology represents one outgrowth of this, psychedelics another.

Professor Steve Kramp, formerly the chair of humanities at John Paul the Great Catholic University, is one of the more recent figures who has advocated further theological and ethical examination of the risks posed from a naive pursuit of mysticism and psychedelic use. He suggests that Catholics need to be cautiously aware of this sea change in the culture—that it causes real harm, not only to a person's health and state of mind but also to their soul: 




Whether we're talking about UFOs or psychedelics, it comes down to the same thing: these things are mysterious. And when things are mysterious and you don't have a spiritual framework in place that can handle the mystery, you naturally start to grant that mystery a spiritual power. And then when on top of that you're spiritually malnourished, you naturally gravitate toward those mysteries that you've invested with spiritual power. So even though UFOs and psychedelics are inadequate as replacements for actual religion, I don't blame the spiritually starving people who are drawn to them any more than I blame a starving person for eating grass or leather shoes. Given their situation their behavior makes sense. But it also makes sense for people who are feasting on everything that Christianity offers—especially the Eucharist—to refuse to join the ones who are eating grass. Because we have something a thousand times better.

The Church should proactively address the issue of UAP, provide what she may know already about the subject if appropriate (especially if there may be direct knowledge of an Italian crash retrieval), and address it beyond the customary silence or chuckle it has previously warranted. She must act as she always has to shepherd those who have come seeking answers about the nature of reality, offering them the fullness of the Faith. As artificial intelligence progresses, psychedelics grow increasingly ubiquitous, and Congress weighs additional budget appropriation toward UAP initiatives, the Catholic struggle will increasingly be less with atheism or textbook secularism and more with mysticism, transhumanism, and whatever the effects of this phenomenon are on the world.

This ambiguity has created a vacuum—one increasingly filled by what I perceive to be a modern Gnosticism. Among the credentialed scientists I met, mystical language was common. Dr. Travis Taylor, a lead researcher on The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, told me he believed the phenomenon had a psychic component, once hearing “something like Hebrew in his head” while studying the paranormal ranch. Others (like congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna) have referenced the Book of Enoch to suggest an Earthy, more biblical origin. Firsthand whistleblowers speak of Greek-like symbology on recovered metals, ancient intelligences dwelling in the oceans, or beings capable of manipulating consciousness directly. 



What is the Church's official position on this matter? Officially, there isn't one, largely because there isn't sufficient evidence. According to Catholic Answers, 




There is no Catholic position on the existence of aliens, as such. Whether life exists on other planets is a scientific, not a theological, question. If alien life on other planets is ever discovered, there are theological questions which can be considered.

Some in the Church have ventured further. The late Msgr. Corrado Balducci—an exorcist and theologian of the Roman Curia—reportedly told Dr. Steven Greer that extraterrestrials, if they exist, are not hostile, and that “God cannot be so foolish as to entrust all of His hopes for intelligent beings to this planet alone.” Greer's recounting may not be reliable, but Balducci made similar statements publicly during his lifetime. 



Whatever the case may be with regard to evidence, the idea of interfacing with nonhuman intelligence is growing increasingly popular. Jake Barber—a whistleblower himself—runs a company called Skywatcher.ai, which claims the ability to directly “call” the objects down range on a desert installation he operates with his team in California.  



I had the opportunity to speak with Jake at one of these conferences. When I asked him how often he encountered these anomalous objects, Jake replied, “every single day. We have had multiple landings…some have flown directly over us.” The call, as he describes it, utilizes both human “psionic” ability and proprietary electronic signaling. Many of these “psionic” individuals are Native American. Skywatcher's data collection has attracted the interest of serious researchers from Stanford and other universities, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office or AARO.  



After my last attendance, I made the decision not to delve further into the topic. The idea of engaging with mysterious nonhuman entities (especially involving highly influential people with access to serious funding) was deeply unsettling. I defer to whatever the Church decides this phenomenon—if it can ever be understood—to ultimately be, but there is absolutely a “there” there. The U.S. government has probably paid tens of millions of dollars to study it. 



My concern, as a Catholic, is about what happens next. There must additionally be a recognition that mystical experiences have grown more culturally popular in recent years, propped up by large celebrity podcasts and PR machines. Ufology represents one outgrowth of this, psychedelics another.

Professor Steve Kramp, formerly the chair of humanities at John Paul the Great Catholic University, is one of the more recent figures who has advocated further theological and ethical examination of the risks posed from a naive pursuit of mysticism and psychedelic use. He suggests that Catholics need to be cautiously aware of this sea change in the culture—that it causes real harm, not only to a person's health and state of mind but also to their soul: 




Whether we're talking about UFOs or psychedelics, it comes down to the same thing: these things are mysterious. And when things are mysterious and you don't have a spiritual framework in place that can handle the mystery, you naturally start to grant that mystery a spiritual power. And then when on top of that you're spiritually malnourished, you naturally gravitate toward those mysteries that you've invested with spiritual power. So even though UFOs and psychedelics are inadequate as replacements for actual religion, I don't blame the spiritually starving people who are drawn to them any more than I blame a starving person for eating grass or leather shoes. Given their situation their behavior makes sense. But it also makes sense for people who are feasting on everything that Christianity offers—especially the Eucharist—to refuse to join the ones who are eating grass. Because we have something a thousand times better.

The Church should proactively address the issue of UAP, provide what she may know already about the subject if appropriate (especially if there may be direct knowledge of an Italian crash retrieval), and address it beyond the customary silence or chuckle it has previously warranted. She must act as she always has to shepherd those who have come seeking answers about the nature of reality, offering them the fullness of the Faith. As artificial intelligence progresses, psychedelics grow increasingly ubiquitous, and Congress weighs additional budget appropriation toward UAP initiatives, the Catholic struggle will increasingly be less with atheism or textbook secularism and more with mysticism, transhumanism, and whatever the effects of this phenomenon are on the world.

Flying saucers and alien bodies are admittedly a tall order, and while I am not a journalist, an interesting interaction with an aerospace contractor convinced me that enough was there to do some investigating of my own. Over several years, I attended scientific conferences and met with officials and journalists who all were seriously interested in the subject. I sourced FOIA documents and discovered—among other things—a slew of accounts pertaining to activity around sensitive U.S. military installations as early as the late 1940s. These were reports from employees at nuclear stockpile sites and power plants that described various objects of different shapes and sizes interfering with security systems and missile readiness.

Some of these scientists and officials I would later meet alleged retaliation for researching the topic: their clearances had been revoked, the brake lines of their cars mysteriously cut, and others told stories of individuals who had allegedly been killed or went missing for being “too loud.” Many of these attendees engaged with the subject quietly and professionally while maintaining high-level employment at universities and within the defense sector.  



My question to them over time gradually became: “What is it?” 



The kinds of responses I received were mixed—some said they had no idea, while others claimed to directly engage with the phenomenon on a regular basis. Over time, in these conversations, a kind of through line appeared: that these things, rather than being a kind of interplanetary visitor as the movies always describe, are actually an intelligence that has existed here, possibly long before us. 



Many Catholic commentators have suggested, some with very little examination, that this phenomenon is demonic, and to that end I believe there is some truth. Hauntings on ranches, orbs, shadowy figures repelled by prayer, these stories are hardly novel in Catholic tradition. But if it's true that there is physical, recovered, metal hardware that relies on a more advanced understanding of physics, to what extent do demonic entities play a role?

Professor Steve Kramp, formerly the chair of humanities at John Paul the Great Catholic University, is one of the more recent figures who has advocated further theological and ethical examination of the risks posed from a naive pursuit of mysticism and psychedelic use. He suggests that Catholics need to be cautiously aware of this sea change in the culture—that it causes real harm, not only to a person's health and state of mind but also to their soul: 




Whether we're talking about UFOs or psychedelics, it comes down to the same thing: these things are mysterious. And when things are mysterious and you don't have a spiritual framework in place that can handle the mystery, you naturally start to grant that mystery a spiritual power. And then when on top of that you're spiritually malnourished, you naturally gravitate toward those mysteries that you've invested with spiritual power. So even though UFOs and psychedelics are inadequate as replacements for actual religion, I don't blame the spiritually starving people who are drawn to them any more than I blame a starving person for eating grass or leather shoes. Given their situation their behavior makes sense. But it also makes sense for people who are feasting on everything that Christianity offers—especially the Eucharist—to refuse to join the ones who are eating grass. Because we have something a thousand times better.

The Church should proactively address the issue of UAP, provide what she may know already about the subject if appropriate (especially if there may be direct knowledge of an Italian crash retrieval), and address it beyond the customary silence or chuckle it has previously warranted. She must act as she always has to shepherd those who have come seeking answers about the nature of reality, offering them the fullness of the Faith. As artificial intelligence progresses, psychedelics grow increasingly ubiquitous, and Congress weighs additional budget appropriation toward UAP initiatives, the Catholic struggle will increasingly be less with atheism or textbook secularism and more with mysticism, transhumanism, and whatever the effects of this phenomenon are on the world.

This ambiguity has created a vacuum—one increasingly filled by what I perceive to be a modern Gnosticism. Among the credentialed scientists I met, mystical language was common. Dr. Travis Taylor, a lead researcher on The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, told me he believed the phenomenon had a psychic component, once hearing “something like Hebrew in his head” while studying the paranormal ranch. Others (like congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna) have referenced the Book of Enoch to suggest an Earthy, more biblical origin. Firsthand whistleblowers speak of Greek-like symbology on recovered metals, ancient intelligences dwelling in the oceans, or beings capable of manipulating consciousness directly. 



What is the Church's official position on this matter? Officially, there isn't one, largely because there isn't sufficient evidence. According to Catholic Answers, 




There is no Catholic position on the existence of aliens, as such. Whether life exists on other planets is a scientific, not a theological, question. If alien life on other planets is ever discovered, there are theological questions which can be considered.

Some in the Church have ventured further. The late Msgr. Corrado Balducci—an exorcist and theologian of the Roman Curia—reportedly told Dr. Steven Greer that extraterrestrials, if they exist, are not hostile, and that “God cannot be so foolish as to entrust all of His hopes for intelligent beings to this planet alone.” Greer's recounting may not be reliable, but Balducci made similar statements publicly during his lifetime. 



Whatever the case may be with regard to evidence, the idea of interfacing with nonhuman intelligence is growing increasingly popular. Jake Barber—a whistleblower himself—runs a company called Skywatcher.ai, which claims the ability to directly “call” the objects down range on a desert installation he operates with his team in California.  



I had the opportunity to speak with Jake at one of these conferences. When I asked him how often he encountered these anomalous objects, Jake replied, “every single day. We have had multiple landings…some have flown directly over us.” The call, as he describes it, utilizes both human “psionic” ability and proprietary electronic signaling. Many of these “psionic” individuals are Native American.

Because we have something a thousand times better.


The Church should proactively address the issue of UAP, provide what she may know already about the subject if appropriate (especially if there may be direct knowledge of an Italian crash retrieval), and address it beyond the customary silence or chuckle it has previously warranted. She must act as she always has to shepherd those who have come seeking answers about the nature of reality, offering them the fullness of the Faith. As artificial intelligence progresses, psychedelics grow increasingly ubiquitous, and Congress weighs additional budget appropriation toward UAP initiatives, the Catholic struggle will increasingly be less with atheism or textbook secularism and more with mysticism, transhumanism, and whatever the effects of this phenomenon are on the world.

Ambassadors theatre, LondonWith expert direction and eye-catching stagecraft, the tension is ramped up in a play inspired by the film franchise

Darkness holds us long enough for the dread to seep into our bones. By treating horror as an art form rather than a cheap set of jump scares, this thrilling new show, which wears its connection to the world of the Paranormal Activity film franchise lightly, proves how jaw-clenchingly, arm-clutchingly frightening horror on stage can be. Under the direction of Punchdrunk's Felix Barrett, the in-the-moment fear is acute. But what is remarkable, thanks to Chris Fisher's eye-popping illusions, is how that terror is accompanied by a giddy, awe-filled delight at the devilry we just witnessed – and how the hell they made it work.

In Oren Peli's original movie, a young couple set up home video cameras to capture night hauntings. The brilliance of Barrett's production is in the ditching of screens, too often relied on to scare on stage. Levi Holloway's script follows Jimmy (Patrick Heusinger) and Lou (Melissa James), who have moved from Chicago to London to escape the “spells” Lou has been experiencing. But places are not haunted, we're told. People are. So the “spells” follow. Rather than setting up cameras, Jimmy tries to reason his way out of the chaos by bringing in an expert (Jackie Morrison).

The only screens we see are their TV, used for video calls from Jimmy's mum (a glorious, grinning Pippa Winslow) and a few at the back of the audience, giving a monochrome CCTV-camera view of Fly Davis's glorious sliced-open two-storey set, the home's every nook and cranny full of potential for fear. Onstage, Anna Watson's quicksilver lighting smartly directs our attention around the house, with some rooms shrouded in murky grey darkness at night and others sunk into a sinister blackout.

The script may be perfunctory, and some of it is deeply hammy, but its flaws are forgivable for such a dexterous production, with every technical element ramping up tension and toying with expectations. Every jump scare is earned, every trick embedded in the twisted narrative of this poor, doomed couple. And the fear lingers. When I wake at 3am to a strange light in my bedroom, I pull the duvet tight around my head, refusing to reopen my eyes and repeating to myself that it was just a play.

In a major year for blockbusters, from Christopher Nolan to Denis Villeneuve, there's none we are anticipating more than Steven Spielberg returning to the realm of extraterrestrial sci-fi. After Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds, the legendary director is back to exploring alien life with Disclosure Day, which opens in theaters on June 12. Ahead of that summer release, the first trailer has now arrived.

With a cast featuring Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, and Wyatt Russell, much of Disclosure has been kept under tight wraps. Last week, mysterious billboards started popping up around the country for the film written by David Koepp and featuring a score by John Williams. Now this trailer finally grants our first peek.

Here's the synopsis: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.”

Watch below:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Steven Spielberg is headed back to space in new UFO movie trailer","https://www.polygon.com/disclosure-day-steven-spielberg-ufo-movie-trailer/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:50:00 GMT","

Disclosure Day is coming, and it ain't like E.T.

At long last, we know what Steven Spielberg's next movie is. The director and studio Universal Pictures have kept the details on the 2026 project close to the vest, and all we really knew was it was a sci-fi film about UFOs. Now, we finally have a trailer for the film, titled Disclosure Day, which is attached to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. And it looks... strange.

The Disclosure Day teaser trailer sets the stage for what looks to be an alien invasion, though whether it's a peaceful one or not remains to be seen. This first look at the film looks less at the invaders themselves, who may be acting through Earth's fauna, but a world of seven billion people learning what's happening to their planet. The inciting incident, of all things, seems to be a newscast. A character played by Emily Blunt is about to give the weather report when she starts emitting a strange and intense set of gurgles and clicks. From there, the world slowly finds out what's happening as characters played by Josh O'Connor (Challengers), Colin Firth (the Kingsman movies), Colman Domingo (Sing Sing), and Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, daughter of Bono) come to grips with extraterrestrial intelligence.

A proper synopsis for the film hasn't been released. However, key dialogue in the trailer, which is also included in the trailer's description, reads, ""If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you?"" It appears to be yet another take on Spielberg's fascination with how alien life would interact with the people of Earth, which he's previously explored in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds.

Disclosure Day is directed by Spielberg with a script from longtime collaborator David Koepp (based on a story by Spielberg), who wrote scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Koepp's non-Spielberg writing work includes Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (writer), Stir of Echoes (writer/director), Mission: Impossible (co-writer), and 2025's critically acclaimed Black Bag (writer) from director Steven Soderbergh. Legendary composer John Williams is once again teaming up with Spielberg to score Disclosure Day.

Disclosure Day will arrive in movie theaters on June 12, 2026. It will be Spielberg's first film since the semi-autobiographical The Fabelmans, and his first dalliance in sci-fi since 2018's Ready Player One.

The plant world is full of wonders that often seem too strange to be real. Some species have evolved unique shapes, colours, and behaviours that challenge our expectations of what a plant should look like. From ghost-white blooms to giant flowers with eerie scents, these plants blur the lines between fantasy and reality, showcasing nature's most astonishing creativity.

The corpse flower (Titan arum) boasts the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, towering over 10 feet with a reddish-brown spadix emitting a rotting flesh odour to lure flies. It grows from a massive underground corm, with huge leaves dominating its cycle, blooming rarely after years of storage; not parasitic.

Also known as Indian pipe, this ""ghost plant"" does not have chlorophyll in it, so it doesn't undergo photosynthesis, unlike other green plants. But instead, it gets nutrients from a symbiotic relationship with fungi. Because of this, this plant appears otherworldly with its pale white, nodding stems and urn-shaped flowers that turn black when mature.

This plant takes its name from a pair of bright white berries contrasted with dark purple spots to create a resemblance of hanging eyeballs. Such a plant grows in the woodlands of North America, and this eerie sight especially stands out in contrast with red stalks. However, it is important to note these berries are poisonous to human consumption.





Image Credit: Wikipedia

The cobra lily closely resembles a hooded serpent, with curved leaves that look like a cobra poised to strike. This carnivorous plant uses its twisted, tubular leaves to trap insects, which are gradually broken down with the help of bacteria inside the pitcher, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients and survive in nutrient-poor soils.





Image Credit: iStock

The bat flower with dark purple to black flowers and ""whiskers"" indeed has a gothic fairy tale appearance, as if it were a creature in a dark fairy tale. Native to Southeast Asia, this unusual flower has bracts and whiskers evoking bat wings poised on its stem.

This ornamental grass looks like streaks of crimson fire rising from the earth, with vibrant red-tipped blades that evoke an almost mystical aura. Though more common in gardens, its bold colour gives it a surreal, otherworldly look that seems pulled from a dreamscape.The garden cultivar 'Rubra' is sterile and non-invasive.





Image Credit: Wikipedia

As indicated by its name, because of flowers with a heart-shaped appearance which seem to have drops of ‘bleeding' petal flesh, the bleeding heart plant provides a dramatic and enchanting visual effect. The bleeding heart plants flowers in a way that gives a delicate magic to flower planters.



Nature always has a way of growing things that appear more fantasy than reality. Of course, these seven plants, ranging from the pale ghost plant to the giant corpse flower and bat flower, push our very definition of a plant in a way that reminds us of the wonders of biodiversity on earth, where nature holds magic in a way characteristic of fiction.

Supernatural, the long-running CW horror series about brothers Sam and Dean Winchester hunting monsters and solving mysteries, is officially leaving Netflix on December 18. Supernatural first aired in 2005, and at the time, few could have guessed that it would go on to be one of the longest-running live-action shows in history. The show's popularity has endured since the series finale aired five years ago, consistently one of the most popular series on Netflix and streaming at large.

Supernatural has been a part of the Netflix package for a staggering 13 years, and so many subscribers are used to having it and all 327 of its episodes at their fingertips. Unfortunately, Supernatural's time on Netflix is coming to an end. Supernatural is leaving Netflix on December 18. From that point forward, the 15 seasons of Supernatural will no longer be available on the platform.

Fans of Supernatural can also enjoy shows like Grimm and The X-Files, which feature similar adventures with paranormal creatures in the modern world.

Supernatural is leaving Netflix due to an expiring deal with the streamer, and it's definitely going to mark a sad end of an era for fans of the show and Netflix subscribers in general. But while it's sad to see Supernatural leave Netflix after spending such a long time on the platform, the good news is that the show is still going to be readily available to stream on other platforms. Supernatural is coming to Peacock and Amazon Prime Video on December 22. So there will be a few days when Supernatural isn't available to stream on any of the major platforms (without buying the episodes on Prime), but at least it won't take long for it to end up somewhere else.

When Supernatural joins Peacock and Prime Video, it will do so with all 15 seasons intact and all the classic episodes that they entail. Watching all of Supernatural is quite the task, but the show is full of memorable moments, engaging drama, and exciting action. There are definitely long stretches of Supernatural where it dips in quality, but the overall package is a fun time and definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it before.

Considering Supernatural's longevity, some may be wondering if we will ever see the franchise expanded in a serious way, whether through a revival or new spin-off series. There were multiple attempts at a Supernatural spin-off while the show was still on the air, with multiple backdoor pilots filmed, but nothing took off. After Supernatural was over, The Winchesters spin-off series aired, but wasn't popular enough to get more than one season.

The g

, but there's always the chance that the show could make a comeback somehow, especially with how many people still love it to this day. With Supernatural creator Eric Kripke's time on The Boys coming to an end, perhaps the time for a Supernatural reunion will come sooner rather than later. For now, Supernatural fans need to prepare themselves for the show's departure from Netflix, and may want to consider signing up for Peacock or Amazon Prime if they haven't done so already.

Follow the Winchester brothers as they hunt demons, ghosts, and otherworldly creatures in this iconic and long-running TV series. The Blu-ray version of the Supernatural complete series only enhances the atmospheric storytelling and creature-feature thrills, immersing fans in the Winchester legacy with unparalleled clarity and depth. Relive the epic battles between good and evil in Supernatural with this stellar deal.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","How to Unlock Double Jump in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond","https://hardcoregamer.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-double-jump/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 08:06:00 GMT","

Throughout your adventures in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Samus will constantly be upgrading her kit to better suit the upcoming challenges. This has been a long-standing tradition for Metroid and Castlevania games, thus creating the sub-genre of metroidvanias, and it has worked spectacularly for years. The latest addition to the Metroid franchise continues this tradition with various new abilities our favorite heroine is able to unlock, but one iconic ability that can be found in the early parts of the campaign and would not be a space shooter without, is the double jump skill.

The psychic boots generally go by a different name: double jump. As the name implies, double jump is a function that many games incorporate in order for faster and easy traversal. This essentially allows a character to hop twice, allowing the player to reach greater heights.

Metroid Prime games have always had their version of double jump, mostly coming in the form of the Jump Boots. Metroid Prime 4 is no different, as you will need to find and obtain the now dubbed Psychic Boots to progress the story.

Fortunately, these boots can be obtained very early on. Sadly, you won't be able to get them earlier than expected.

The double jump feature can be found near the end of the first area in Metroid Prime 4. After leaving the Fury Green area, Samus will be sent across the great desert and find the Volt Forge.

You will need to restart three of the towers in the Volt Forge by giving them a bit of a jump start, and do this while fending off against ancient robotic sentries.

This requires obtaining the Vi-O-La motorcycle along with participating in the various tutorials it has assigned to it. After finishing the tutorial section for the Vi-O-La, you will come out in a new area.

Maneuver your way down the small platforms until you come across a small open area and the main boss for the Volt Forge: Xelios. This can be a challenging fight as it will throw numerous projectiles at you, along with beams of energy at random. You will need to utilize the quick dash feature along with the morph ball.

Regardless, after killing the Xelios boss, you will get the Psychic Boots that will now allow you to double jump. These will be useful in a couple of spots in the Volt Forge and crucial moving forward, but there are a couple of places in even the initial Fury Green area where these boots can be utilized.

The spinning ball of horror, take down this frigid creature in the newest Metroid Prime.

For Gregg Phillips, Monday marked his first day as the new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of Response and Recovery. For the agency, it marked the beginning of a new era: one in which a genuine conspiracy theorist holds its second-most-powerful position.

Phillips, to be clear, is no mere hobbyist when it comes to dangerous conspiracy theories. He was a major figure behind the organization True the Vote, one of the most influential sources of election-fraud misinformation during the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Phillips and True the Vote claimed to have evidence of millions of fraudulent votes, as well as of Chinese efforts to steal the election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but Phillips was reckless in his campaign, in terms of both his methods and his friends. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, Phillips developed numerous ties to the QAnon world as he sought allies in his efforts.

On Truth Social, he repeatedly shared posts from accounts with Q-related logos or names and screen grabs from Q drops, the messages left behind by the purported “Q” figure. He also posted directly to praise known QAnon influencers as friends and clever investigators. He appeared as a guest on several QAnon podcasts and even participated in QAnon's “Flannel Fridays,” a symbol of solidarity with the movement. He made at least a dozen appearances on the Matrixxx Grooove Show, a livestream hosted by two QAnon supporters. He and the founder of True the Vote put on an event in Arizona that courted QAnon influencers, allowing over a dozen such influencers to network in person. He praised them all as patriots ready to expose the ways in which the “enemy” had stolen millions of votes from Donald Trump. Phillips, in other words, peddles in MAGA fantasies.

This appointment would have been a worrying one for any governmental department—the position, which oversee's the agency's largest division, does not require congressional approval—but it's especially concerning when paired with FEMA. That's because FEMA, more than just about any other agency, is a central entity in some of the oldest right-wing conspiracy theories about ambitiously menacing government schemes, which include everything from secret prison camps to human-caused hurricanes.

Beyond being ridiculous, experts say, having a conspiracy theorist leading the core work of a conspiracy theory–targeted entity could be dangerous. There are real reasons to worry that a person dismissive of mainstream expertise could derail the work of nonpartisan bureaucrats trying to protect the public. He could sideline technical experts, delay action during time-sensitive emergencies, and undermine important communication from the agency. And he could find innovative new ways to disrupt the agency's work.

We have seen this play out already, in other personnel decisions from the Trump administration. Kash Patel runs the FBI, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees the Health and Human Services Department. Both were chosen because they were convinced that evil had taken root in their respective agencies. During this second Trump administration, Kennedy's pursuit of his convictions has been catastrophic: The administration has already rolled back vaccine mandates and helped cause deadly epidemics. Patel has inflicted less direct harm on the public, but he purged the bureau's ranks and replaced them with loyalists, seriously compromising the trustworthiness of federal law enforcement.

So the question is what a similarly minded person could do in a place of such power in the country's disaster-response agency. This will depend in part on what the administration decides to do with FEMA, as it is considering a major reorganization. But if FEMA remains the nation's primary emergency-response infrastructure, and if it remains the central source of intel and coordination as climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, the presence of a conspiracy theorist in its top ranks could do very real harm. If a crusader with a paranoid mindset manages to remake FEMA's disaster recovery into an arena for his grievances, it will mark the end of one of the most urgently nonpartisan roles of the federal government, a historic place of bipartisan agreement on the need to help suffering Americans, no matter who they are.

It makes some intuitive sense that FEMA would attract conspiracy theories, given that it's the entity that's most activated in times of crisis and confusion.

Ever since the 1980s and '90s, people have theorized that FEMA was building secret prison camps to hold U.S. citizens upon the imposition of martial law; that it was planning to create major natural disasters in order to sow chaos nationwide and seize power; that it was setting up a surveillance state by inserting chips or other devices at agency “processing centers”; that it was testing out mind-control technologies or other sinister efforts when running emergency-alert-system tests; or that it would, in some other way, act as the supervillainy arm of whatever dark forces run the government or are plotting to take it over.

But these particular conspiracy theories, long fodder for the paranoid Alex Jones types, have moved toward the mainstream in recent years. They were boosted by QAnon during the general growth of American paranoia during the pandemic. Social media created incentives for content creators to spout engagement-baiting nonsense. And A.I. has obliterated our ability, as a general public, to distinguish reality from computer-generated fiction. As a result, the fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters that are becoming more frequent and more severe have reliably been followed by a flood of theories of FEMA's malfeasance. Sometimes the old theories are regurgitated, with grainy videos of purported FEMA prison camps; other times, new pieces of information become the kernels at the core of new panicked rumors.

This is obviously not ideal. If people don't trust the agency, they may not seek out its aid. They may heed warnings related to certain hazards in their environment. They may not listen when they are told to evacuate. In some cases, they may become desperate and turn to violence: One armed man was arrested last year for threatening agency employees in North Carolina, having been convinced by social media misinformation that FEMA was withholding supplies from storm victims.

“When you have this anti-science sentiment, which is intertwined with conspiracy theories, it worsens disaster outcomes across the board,” said Njoki Mwarumba, a professor of emergency management at Empire State University.

Having an anti-science figure in charge of disaster response will almost certainly make this situation worse, experts say. But this is not because Phillips will necessarily spread such conspiracy theories himself: Although it's not out of the realm of possibility that Phillips would do so, there's no evidence he believes in FEMA conspiracy theories. He has in the past expressed his opposition to FEMA's existence, arguing that disaster response should instead be handled by local and state governments, but nothing has surfaced indicating he believes that the agency is pursuing a new world order. And because FEMA theories are so out there, they are presumably impossible to maintain once you're inside the institution. A plot to take over the federal government or depopulate the country with a supervirus should be easy to sniff out from the top.

Instead, Phillips' danger is in eroding public trust in the agency, leaving more room for conspiracy theories to flourish. Phillips has no experience in federal emergency management. He has also been accused of ethical misconduct multiple times in his professional career, including in his handling of government contracts in Mississippi and Texas; his financial management of True the Vote's funds; and fundraising for a mobile hospital in Ukraine that never materialized. And given his pattern of acting purely on partisan motivation, it seems very possible that he will run his office on political priorities rather than data-driven analysis. That could mean that his version of FEMA's response and recovery efforts will be inherently less trustworthy.

Putting a skeptic in charge of the agency, in other words, will make it less effective—and therefore legitimately more worthy of skepticism.

“When you can't rely on the government or don't trust the government, it further fuels conspiracy theories,” said Alice Marwick, the director of research at the nonprofit Data & Society. “It's this horrible ouroboros.”

It's reasonable to wonder if there's a silver lining here. If a QAnon guy is tasked with overseeing a QAnon-suspected agency, wouldn't that be reassuring to his fellow truthers?

This was a question that came up when Patel was placed in charge of the FBI. It seemed reasonable to assume that once Patel realized that there was no cabal running the bureau, he would be able to calm everyone down.

That's not what happened.

Instead, Patel, bumping up against the reality of bureaucracy, was forced into some awkward contortions, trying to convince people he was doing their work by firing Trump critics inside the agency, but ultimately unable to make good on any promises to dig up proof of treachery within the agency or release the promised Epstein files. Instead of deflating the conspiracy theories, this caused people to turn on Patel.

This reality is the same with the FEMA theories, Marwick said. “Where conspiracies don't match the daily reality, you can have an immediate breakdown,” she said. “Conspiracy theorists will never be satisfied until someone shows them it's controlled by the illuminati or a cabal or the Freemasons. So there's no satisfactory resolution to this situation.”

And once the leader is unable to expose the corruption and reform the agency in the way the theorists want, that failure further proves the deep corruption of the system, she said. It reinforces public cynicism more than anything else.

Having an extremely partisan person in the position might instead encourage conspiracy theories from residents of blue states. Already, the Trump administration has weaponized grant funding for its own means. It is threatening to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits from Democratic-led states over their refusal to share recipients' immigration status. It slashed $8 billion in funding for green projects in Democratic states. And a judge blocked the administration's effort to reallocate $233 million in FEMA disaster-relief funds away from a dozen blue states without explanation. The states accused the administration of targeting them for not backing Trump in the election.

And if draft proposals for “Fema 2.0” are any indication, the administration hopes to shift some of its funding toward block grants, in which pots of money are distributed by some to-be-determined metrics to individual states. Under that scenario, says Jeffrey Pellegrino, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at the University of Akron, the size of those pots could certainly be politically driven. That would inherently give blue-state residents reason to raise questions.

It's unlikely these residents would jump from being suspicious of Trump's FEMA to believing that the agency is about to round them all up in prison camps, turning into some kind of liberal version of Alex Jones. But this kind of politicization does shorten the distance between reality and conspiracy theory. It's something we've never seen before, Pellegrino says. FEMA has historically fluctuated in efficacy depending on the president's own sense of its urgency, he says, but it has never been all that tainted by partisan politics—as past administrators have always believed that natural disasters are not a partisan issue.

“But that seems to have gone by the wayside with the current administration,” he said.

Phillips will likely not be the RFK Jr. of FEMA. The far-out FEMA conspiracy theories, unlike “Vaccines Cause Autism,” are not particularly actionable. You can ban vaccines, but you cannot halt the building of prison camps that don't actually exist or dismantle fictional offices that run mind-control programs. Nor will he be its Kash Patel, as he won't be able to find as many exciting ways to weaponize the agency or root out politically charged projects; disaster management is simply more bureaucratic and less controversial.

The most important questions about FEMA currently concern its scope and, frankly, its survival while under assault from the administration. But having a committed conspiracy theorist in one of the most important positions in an organization long plagued by conspiracy-theory accusations only proves how little the administration cares about public trust. As climate change continues to make natural disasters worse, as the administration refuses to grapple with the dangers of A.I., and as severe cuts to nonpartisan agencies debilitate their relief and prevention work, conspiracy theories about FEMA will continue to proliferate. Disasters are frightening and destabilizing. They're the kinds of events that naturally breed misinformation and confusion. In that scenario, you need an agency led by people who respond to crises with reason and levelheadedness in order to mitigate conspiratorial thinking. A responsible administrator might be counted on to stem that paranoia, to—at a critical moment—pull people back from their worst impulses. But Phillips has spent years preying on those impulses, and there's little reason to hope he'll stop now.

LAWRENCE — When Superman became popular in the 1940s, he originally fought more conventional villains of the era such as gangsters, pirates and Nazis. But one of his foes led to a legendary encounter that may provide strategies for dealing with troubling concerns affecting the society of today.

Colin McRoberts, associate teaching professor of business at the University of Kansas, has written a chapter detailing the 1946 radio serial “The Adventures of Superman” in which the Man of Steel challenged a group known as “The Clan of the Fiery Cross” … aka the Ku Klux Klan.

His chapter titled “A Symbol for Hope: Superman's Battle with the KKK as a Model for Effective Cultural Engagement with Conspiracy Theories” appears in “The Lizard People Don't Want You to Read This: Essays on Conspiracy Theory in Popular Culture.” The new book is published by McFarland & Company.

“In this serial, Superman revealed what motivated the Klan: the xenophobia, the hate, the know-nothingism. My chapter is trying to convince the writers of modern mass media to consider doing the same thing and use their stories to tell what conspiracy theories actually do in the real world,” McRoberts said.

“Here, I'm not talking about the rare ones that turn out to be true, but the ones that are much more dangerous, like anti-vaccine, antisemitic, January 6 types of things. Instead of lionizing and valorizing the conspiracy theorists because they're interesting characters, focus on the victims and the damage those conspiracy theories do — just as the writers of Superman did, because they understood the power their stories had to change public opinion.”

Interestingly, the serial itself generated its own conspiracy. For years, the apocryphal story was repeated that Superman had given away the Klan's secret passwords on the air.

“That just wasn't true. What the show did instead was reveal the business model of the Klan and the hypocrisy and shallowness of the Klan,” McRoberts said.

The chapter noted, “If these episodes lacked genuine secret passwords, they revealed something just as real and even more devastating: The Klan wasn't just hateful and un-American, it was a scam. Despite its pomp and circumstance, it wasn't an ancient and impressive organization — it was just a club that milked its thuggish members to make money.”

McRoberts added, “They made the Klan look silly, and the silliness of the Klan was what undermined its image.”

The professor emphasized conspiracy theories may often seem silly, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less threatening.

“What's usually at the heart of a conspiracy theory is a powerful group we can't see and access that is out to get us,” McRoberts said.

Muddying the concept even further, he said, is that people are often confused by how to apply the term conspiracy theory.

“I don't think of things like the Tuskegee Airmen as a conspiracy theory; I think of it as a conspiracy fact. The classic example is 9/11. Yes, it was a conspiracy. It was a conspiracy of hijackers and terrorists. But it wasn't a conspiracy of Jews. And that's the difference between the conspiracy theory as we normally use the term and a real-world conspiracy,” he said.

The “Lizard People” book of which his chapter is a part of delivers a collection of essays examining topics ranging from clandestine societies to dog whistles to pop culture media such as “The X-Files” and “The Da Vinci Code.”

McRoberts said, “It's a fantastic analysis of how conspiracy theories ripple through mass media and what mass media can do about it. I appreciate how they picked a bunch of different experts in different fields to reflect their facet problem, which is really difficult for the world to get its head around.”

As for his focus on Superman, McRoberts said he was more of an X-Men fan growing up.

“And when I became a lawyer, Daredevil became more my thing,” he said.

A faculty member at KU since 2019, McRoberts was a litigator and a consultant with his own firm, Vasher McRoberts, and with the SAB Group prior to his career in academia.

McRoberts said he hopes the tactic used by Superman's bygone show might work against other groups whose lives revolve around harmful conspiracy theories. 

Unfortunately, the cultural landscape has changed quite a bit in the ensuing decades, he said.

“The biggest problem now is the fragmentation of the media market, which I generally think is a good thing. I love the fact that you've got comic book fans and Jane Austen fans and documentary fans, and everybody's got a healthy media market for whatever floats their boat,” he said.

“But such fragmentation is not great for the power of fiction to actually change public opinion. That is a power Superman had. I don't know if mass media now has one singular show that makes the same impact.”

Some of Europe's biggest military contractors urged investors not to cash out of the sector on Tuesday, as stocks sold off on hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner joined peace talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin over the weekend. Zelenskyy said during the talks that Kyiv was willing to give up its NATO membership ambitions in order to secure a deal to end the war.

American officials then told reporters a peace deal was close to completion, while U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiators were ""closer now than we have been ever"" to stopping the conflict. Talks are expected to continue into the weekend. 

European defense stocks sold off on Tuesday as investors weighed the news, with some big names extending losses from the previous day. The regional Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index lost 1.8%, with Swedish fighter jet maker Saab leading losses on a 4.8% fall. Italy's Leonardo, finishing down 3.9%, and Germany's Rheinmetall, ending 4.5% lower, were also among those seeing the biggest declines. 

A spokesperson for German defense prime Hensoldt said the company hopes for ""a just and lasting peace for Ukraine,"" but added that, even if this is achieved, Europe remains under threat of attack. 

""A cessation of hostilities would give Russia the opportunity to reconstitute its military capabilities. From a European security perspective, the underlying threat remains and could even intensify,"" they said.

""Against this backdrop, defense readiness continues to be a structural necessity for Europe,"" they added.

Hensoldt's representative said the company's business exposure to Ukraine is limited, accounting for a single-digit percentage of revenues. The company's stock, which has more than doubled in value this year, finished 3.6% lower on Tuesday.

""Our growth trajectory is primarily driven by large, long-term programs in Germany and across Europe,"" the spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday morning, pointing to a three-digit-million-euro contract to equip the German armed forces' reconnaissance vehicles with software and advanced sensors, and projects under the European Sky Shield Initiative.

Many of the firm's contracts will continue ""in 2026 and beyond,"" they added. 

A representative for German vehicle systems manufacturer Renk – a contractor to more than 70 armies across the globe – acknowledged ""an elevated level of volatility"" in European defense stocks ""anytime there is news surrounding a potential peace deal or ceasefire in Ukraine."" 

They added: ""While we would very much welcome peace in Ukraine for the Ukrainian people, we see the threat scenario in Europe and globally unchanged and highest since the end of the Cold War.""

Renk's share price, which has gained around 194% year-to-date, ended the day 4.3% lower. 

""Downward movements of the share prices are strongly driven by market sentiment rather than by clear impacts on the business outlook of Renk and other defense peers,"" the company's spokesperson added on Tuesday morning.

""European NATO members have committed to the 3.5% [spending] target until 2035, leading to a structural long-term growth environment in military budgets,"" they said.

Europe's defense sector has seen a meteoric rise this year, amid the Ukraine war and commitments from regional governments and the NATO military alliance to ramp up defense spending. 

The pledges are widely expected to boost European firms' bottom lines, with regionally headquartered companies already reporting record order backlogs and huge upswings in income. 

Since the start of the year, the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index has surged more than 50%, with some regional defense players more than doubling in value.

Hensoldt and Renk's view that Russia will continue to pose a threat to the continent is shared by regional officials.

""We are Russia's next target, and we are already in harm's way,"" NATO Chief Mark Rutte said in a speech last week, while Blaise Metreweli – the head of the U.K.'s Secret Intelligence Service – warned in a speech on Monday that the region is facing ""the menace of an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia.""

Christopher Granville, managing director of TS Lombard, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Tuesday that, while the ""end game phase"" of the war appears to be underway, money markets may be mispricing this.

""The markets are pricing that in the form of a peace dividend,"" he added. ""That can be seen in the retracement of the share prices of European defense companies, which have handily outperformed for the last two to three years and have pulled back – in our view, that looks like a buying opportunity, because there will be no peace dividend.""

Granville argued that this is because Russia's relationship with Europe has shifted. 

""The outcome of the war will be that Russian military power has secured an unreversed territorial change in Europe, and that will be a huge incentive to improve European defense industrial capacity, and continue arms procurement,"" he added.

He added that a ""non-peace dividend"" would be reflected in lower risk premiums, because, even with the war over, ""you still get the spending on defense industrial capacity.""

Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, called the market reaction to a potential peace deal ""overdone.""

""The Ukraine war has been a significant driver of the European defense sector, but what the market is overlooking now is that the Ukraine war set about a series of structural drivers to the sector, drivers that remain in place even if a peace agreement is reached,"" he told CNBC. 

""An increase in NATO spending targets has been agreed by participating members and will not be unwound. Similarly the restocking story remains intact. It will likely take nations like Germany a decade at least to restock weaponry supplied to Ukraine. Both of these conditions will be highly supportive of the European defense sector for the medium term, into the longer term, supporting share price valuations,"" he added.

Claire Titmarsh, a defense equity analyst at U.K. wealth management firm Rathbones, told CNBC: ""It seems unlikely the risk of aggression will be fully eliminated.""

""What's more is that predicted increases in European defense spending are not solely driven by the Ukraine war. Deep-rooted structural factors persist: long-standing underinvestment, the ongoing strategic challenge from Russia – even after a Ukraine settlement – and the imperative for European strategic autonomy amid signals that the U.S. will reduce its role in underwriting European defense,"" she said by email on Tuesday.

She also questioned how stable any peace settlement would actually be. 

""Whether Russia will honor any peace agreement remains highly uncertain,"" Titmarsh added. ""History suggests caution and President Putin's behavior is notoriously unpredictable.""

Staff at the Ashland animal shelter sold merch of raccoon they cared for after he was found passed out in a liquor store

Merchandise commemorating the raccoon that gained international fame by barging into a Virginia liquor store, smashing bottled spirits and passing out drunk in a bathroom on Black Friday has raised more than a quarter-million dollars for the local animal shelter where he slept off his bender.

The Hanover county animal protection shelter raised the charitable amount after caring for the inebriated raccoon in question and teaming up with custom apparel maker Bonfire to create and sell items seizing on the internet virality achieved by the creature.

Emblazoned with the words “Trashed Panda”, the shirts, sweatshirts, cups and stickers contain an image of a raccoon spread-eagle next to a spilled booze bottle – unmistakably evoking the compromising position the animal that burgled the Ashland ABC store on 29 November was found and photographed in.

Proceeds from the campaign anchored by those limited edition items “directly support shelter animal care and enrichment”, according to Bonfire's website.

Figures posted by the company based in Richmond, Virginia, indicated the campaign had raised more than $254,000 as of Tuesday morning. At the time, the campaign was also within 250 sales of its goal of selling 19,000 items.

“While this raccoon gave us all a much-needed laugh, our officers handle hundreds of calls each year involving wildlife, stray animals, and emergencies requiring specialized training and equipment,” said a message from the shelter on Bonfire's website. “Your support helps us continue providing compassionate, professional service to both animals and residents of Hanover county.”

An ABC store employee found what Bonfire's website referred to as “our unexpected raccoon celebrity” next to a toilet the day after Thanksgiving. Shattered whiskey bottles littered the path to the bathroom, and the raccoon was evidently inebriated when it was photographed for posterity's sake.

The animal was uninjured beyond possibly grappling with hangover symptoms and regret over “poor life choices”, said officials at the shelter where the raccoon was brought to proverbially dry out.

Hanover county animal protection officer Samantha Martin more recently told the local government's official podcast that the raccoon had at least two other break-ins on his rap sheet.

Martin told Hear in Hanover that the raccoon had previously broken into a karate studio and a department of motor vehicles office, all on the same block of businesses. She made it a point to say that the raccoon had eaten some of the DMV's snacks, calling him “a smart little critter”.

After the raccoon sobered up from the drunken liquor store break-in, officials released him in the vicinity of that business, the karate studio and the DMV office. Martin said on the podcast that to relocate the raccoon from his familiar environs would be “a death sentence”.

“I think he's living his best life,” Martin joked on the podcast. “And why not? Have a drink or two, especially on Black Friday.”

News of the raccoon's liquor store banditry spread worldwide after a study recently concluded that his brethren had adapted to living in urban areas so well that they had been developing certain physical signs of domestication, including shorter snouts and smaller teeth.

Experts say raccoons have been able to successfully live alongside people because of their ability to survive on human refuse.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announce an agreement between the two countries during a state visit in Aylesbury, Britain, on Sept. 18.Leon Neal/Reuters

The United States is stalling the implementation of a US$40-billion technology agreement with Britain, officials said, following concerns in Washington over London's approach to digital regulation and food standards.

The “Tech Prosperity Deal,” covering artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy, was agreed during President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain in September, in a celebration of the countries' close ties and ability to work together on trade and technology.

Britain became the first country to agree in principle to lower some U.S. tariffs in May, but implementation has been slow. Talks on sectors such as steel stalled, though the two sides agreed a framework pharmaceutical deal earlier this month.

British officials confirmed on Tuesday that the U.S. has paused implementation of the tech deal. The New York Times, which first reported the move, said U.S. officials were frustrated by Britain's online safety rules, digital services tax, and food safety restrictions.

U.S. and Britain to announce tech, nuclear energy deals during Trump visit

British ministers say the May tariff deal allowed higher U.S. beef exports without compromising U.K. standards and insist digital regulations and tax will not be negotiated away.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment in detail on what he said were “live negotiations,” adding that the relationship with Washington was still strong.

“Negotiations of this kind are never straightforward. Both parties obviously want what's best for their countries, but ... we remain in active conversations,” he told reporters, adding it was “natural and normal” for countries to prioritize their own interests.

“These talks are not simple. They are complex, and they take time to secure.”

Under the Tech Prosperity Deal, Britain and the United States agreed to work together on quantum computers and artificial intelligence, while the likes of Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and OpenAI pledged to invest tens of billions of dollars in Britain.

The White House did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

The U.S. is Britain's largest trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their U.K. operations.

British Trade Secretary Peter Kyle visited the United States last week for talks with trade officials and tech firms, and “raised the importance of keeping up momentum on implementing all aspects of the U.K.-U.S. deal,” his office said.

“Both sides agreed to continue further negotiations in January.”

NEW YORK (AP) — An on-duty Customs and Border Protection officer fired his gun several times during a confrontation with another motorist Tuesday on an access road for New York's Kennedy Airport, police said.

The CBP officer told authorities that he pulled his weapon after the other driver attacked him over a minor traffic crash, Port Authority police said. 

It wasn't clear if the shots hit anything. The other driver fled the scene after the shooting, according to the CBP officer, who was unhurt.

The two-vehicle crash happened shortly before 5 a.m. near the airport's main car rental facilities on the tangle of roads and ramps that lead to the airport's terminals, administration buildings and cargo areas.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports a Customs and Border Protection officer fires a gun in dispute with a driver.

JFK's roadways are currently undergoing a major construction overhaul and navigating the thicket of detours and traffic changes has been a source of frustration and confusion for many drivers. 

The Port Authority didn't say if the officer was driving an official vehicle. His name has not been released.

The investigation led to traffic delays in the area during the morning commute, but those issues lessened as the morning progressed.

'Outkick Hot Mic' podcast host Jonathan Hutton joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the United States' placement in the 2026 World Cup, his predictions for the upcoming college football playoffs and more.

Former U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe mocked the U.S. men's national soccer team World Cup campaign in a recent podcast episode last week.

The U.S. team unveiled ""Never Chase Reality"" as its campaign heading into the 2026 World Cup. The 90-second film featured narration by Marcello Hernandez. The squad said in a release that ""'Never Chase Reality' reflects the journey to 26 for the Men's National Team.""

Rapinoe touched on it during the latest episode of ""A Touch More"" with her partner Sue Bird and sportscaster Katie Nolan.

""The team's slogan going into the World Cup, this was like their drop, and their slogan is ‘Never chase reality.' I was like, guys, I don't think it's saying what you think it's saying,"" Rapinoe said. ""I'm kinda like, why didn't we just stick with, ‘Dream big?'

""To me, it said like you already think you're not good. So, I didn't like that.""

Hernandez lays out what the campaign means to him.

""This campaign isn't just about soccer; it's about the American dream. Never chasing reality means ignoring the odds and daring to dream,"" he said in the release. ""I played soccer since I was four years old until college and have been a fan of the Men's and Women's U.S. National Team since I was a kid, so it's an honor to bring my passion and enthusiasm for the game to U.S. soccer.""

The reality is the U.S. men's soccer team has not had very much success on the world stage despite the squad being considered the ""golden generation.""

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks discusses the strengths he has seen in North Carolina as he continues walking across America.

As I continue my Walk Across America through the great state of North Carolina, I have heard from folks up north that ""the South is America's problem."" These friends of mine, who are not so familiar with this region, often think of it as the nation's hotbed of backwardness, where the lingering echoes of slavery, segregation and Confederate nostalgia fuel divisive debates over race, guns and social progress. They believe this region is mired in poverty and prejudice and forever locked into battles over old monuments. But they're outsiders who've never walked the backroads I have.

I have met farmers, factory hands, professors, business people, churchgoers, chefs and veterans, and I am calling it like I see it: These outsiders are flat-out wrong.

MY WALK ACROSS AMERICA IS A LESSON IN GRATITUDE AND GIVING THANKS

The truth is that the South — and North Carolina especially — is the backbone of what makes America strong. People forget that I spent the first 12 years of my life in the South, in Kenton, Tennessee. We all grew up with a deep faith in God and in America. We believed in rock-solid families, a work ethic that doesn't quit, and a resilience that sees us through adversities of all kinds. I see all that today as I walk, and I have been thanking the Lord for these sights, for they strengthen me.

When Hurricane Helene slammed into the North Carolina mountains last year, flooding out small towns, the feds were worse than the Keystone Kops. But the churches? They moved into action. Volunteers from all around saved what could be saved, tarped the roofs and cleared debris.

AT LANCASTER MARKET, I WITNESSED AN AMERICA THAT STILL WORKS — NO POLITICS REQUIRED

I met a retired couple, and they told me that their home sat under nine feet of mud and water. A team of church folks they had never met came and prayed over the ruins. Then they built it back, wall by wall. The wife told me, ""Pastor, we lost our home but never our faith, and it is because of that that God's people showed up.""

I have seen a hardcore work ethic everywhere I go. I've walked through factory towns where folks don't chase viral fame — they chase the ability to provide for their families.

I've also seen great family values in this state. One morning in a diner, I read in the local paper that the North Carolina House of Representatives created Opportunity Scholarships for every family, using a sliding scale based on income. The aim of this program is to free kids from failing schools. As the state's website explains, ""The Opportunity Scholarship helps North Carolina families pay for tuition and other required fees to attend registered private schools.""

FROM A CHICAGO ROOFTOP TO 3,000-MILE JOURNEY, HERE'S HOW I'M FIGHTING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL 

When I talked about this with a family that I met, they informed me that there were also programs like All Pro Dads & Responsible Fatherhood that teach men to step up for their families.

On the cultural front, the legislature has kept girls' sports for biological girls only, yanked explicit books from elementary shelves, and cut taxes so hardworking moms and dads keep more of their paycheck — personal income tax is down to 4.25% this year, with triggers for further cuts if revenues hold.

I have long hated the government for the dependency it created in communities like mine on the South Side of Chicago, but this feels different. It's our money being used to create agency, responsibility and accountability. That, in the long run, saves the state money. And, in the end, it is up to the individual to take advantage — or not.

Speaking of the individual, I have seen a hardcore work ethic everywhere I go. I've walked through factory towns where folks don't chase viral fame — they chase the ability to provide for their families. North Carolina's manufacturing jobs hit 473,000 last year, and they say there will be 3.5% growth through 2032, adding more than 16,000 jobs.

But it's the stories that stick. Over 20,000 veterans are transitioning out of the armed forces this year, and they bring that military discipline straight to the shop floor. And the numbers back it up. 

This is a record year for jobs — 33,745 new ones announced, with $23 billion invested. JetZero is dropping $4.7 billion on an airplane plant in Guilford County for 14,500 jobs; Vulcan Elements, $918 million in Benson for 1,000 magnet factory spots; Novartis, $771 million in Durham for 700 pharma roles.

The South has its sins and struggles like anywhere. But the claim that it is a drag on America is false. The South is the lift — the faith that rebuilds, the family that fights for what's right, the work that provides and the patriotism that unites. 

As 2 Chronicles 7:14 says, if my people humble themselves and pray, God heals the land. North Carolina is living that out, and it's a model for the nation. This is where America's heart still beats strong.

The long-overlooked activist Audley Moore knew that achieving radical goals sometimes required cooperation and dexterity.

Midway through William Greaves's documentary Nationtime, which follows the 1972 National Black Political Convention, a woman named Audley Moore stands in a busy hallway preaching to people's backs. She is clad in a burgundy-and-navy-floral kaftan and matching headwrap. Her voice rings out amid the bustling crowd of convention-goers: “Now let me tell you: Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Those who seek temporary security rather than basic liberty deserve neither.' I'm demanding reparations. That's all I can see now. That's the answer for our people.” She is paraphrasing Franklin's quote, one whose meaning is frequently misconstrued, but the invocation of the Founding Father lends both heft and irony to her calls for redress from the American government. Moore catches a few passersby and jokes with them, shoving a typewritten paper in their hands as they walk away. A few stay to listen. This scene aptly encapsulates the life of Audley “Queen Mother” Moore, an often-overlooked Black-nationalist organizer who fought vociferously for Black self-determination until her death in 1997.

A laudable new biography, Queen Mother: Black Nationalism, Reparations, and the Untold Story of Audley Moore, by the historian Ashley D. Farmer, uses Moore's story to chart a trajectory of Black-nationalist activism in the United States, from Garveyism in the 1920s (Moore belonged to the New Orleans chapter of Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, or UNIA) to the 1995 Million Man March for Black-male unity and self-empowerment. Moore's radical ideas—including her desire for a separate Black nation in the South—earned her ridicule at times, but her sharp critiques of American white supremacy also found purchase, influencing activists such as Malcolm X, Muhammad Ahmad, and Charles J. Ogletree Jr.

Despite her prolific political organizing and wide reach during her lifetime, Moore has largely been omitted from the history of civil-rights activism. Her exclusion from traditional archives is a familiar story to scholars of Black American life, especially those who study the contributions of women. Farmer writes that her book, which she spent a decade researching and writing, required painstaking effort to locate traces of Moore in personal papers, land deeds, files from the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee, oral-history tapes, and lingering memories (much of Moore's ephemera were lost in a house fire). The resulting work, which examines her involvement in a strikingly diverse roster of organizations, is a portrait of a woman with uncanny savvy and flexibility.

Moore worked with nationalists, Communists, and moderate liberals, white and Black alike—whatever it took to pursue goals such as fair housing regulations, just labor laws, and equitable resource distribution. She was sometimes self-contradicting as an activist, which isn't to say she wasn't singularly dedicated to her cause. She seems to have simply understood that achieving her objectives—in all their multiplicity—required maximal fluidity. Activists with unchanging missions might be easier to pin down (and thus less likely to be forgotten). But Moore's story shows that the Black-nationalist movement also encompassed people who were willing to find areas of compromise in order to get the job done.

Moore was born in 1898 in New Iberia, Louisiana, to a well-off family that descended from both enslaved and free Black communities. But both her parents died before she reached adulthood, and she was forced to turn to domestic work in white households, one of the few economic avenues available to her at the time. In the violent, segregated South during World War I, Moore “looked on as America made its grand debut on the world stage as a great emancipator—a masterful public performance as liberty's beacon shining from the West, all while extending white supremacy's tendrils across the globe,” Farmer writes. Having noticed that the Army didn't offer as much support for Black soldiers as it did for white ones, Moore and her two sisters provided meals and recreation space to these troops in Anniston, Alabama. Losing the protection of Black elite society that her parents had afforded her, and witnessing the contradiction between America's actions abroad and at home, helped shape Moore's lifelong advocacy for civil rights and for working-class concerns.

It is difficult to overstate the influence on Moore's development of Marcus Garvey, the foremost Black nationalist of the 20th century. Garvey sought to revitalize “Africa for the Africans,” and to repatriate people of African descent to their motherland. He also championed Black pride, self-reliance, and racial separatism on the basis that white people would never recognize Black people's human rights. His teachings showed the fledgling activist how to analyze Black people's social conditions and gave her the desire to unify Black people everywhere. In 1922, Moore joined the UNIA in New Orleans, attending meetings and studying the history of the global African diaspora. She and her then-husband once even packed up all of their possessions, planning to expatriate to Liberia as part of one of Garvey's “Back to Africa” initiatives, before ultimately deciding to stay in the United States.

After Garvey was deported in 1927 following a mail-fraud conviction, Moore was forced to channel her activism into vehicles beyond the declining UNIA. A move to Harlem brought her into the orbit of the Communist Party. A card-carrying member by 1936, Moore cut her teeth protesting racist and sexist discrimination across New York City, forming tenants' rights organizations, and sending aid to Ethiopia after a 1935 invasion by Italy. In response to Black Communists' demands that the party address both class and race oppression, Communist leaders had come to believe that Black people constituted an oppressed nation, and that it was within the party's interest to fight for their rights. But Moore's association with the Communists was less of an ideological commitment, Farmer writes, than a practical way to work toward Garvey's “anti-imperialist, pro-Black” goals. Collaborating with the moderate NAACP, Moore advocated for the freedom of five of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teens falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama.

Moore also worked on many causes tangential to Black nationalism, including lowering the price of milk for children and boycotting goods from Nazi Germany. Among her other “strange bedfellows,” Farmer mentions Mary McLeod Bethune's respectable, middle-class National Council of Negro Women, “an unlikely place for a Black Nationalist and Communist” who was primarily self-educated. But Moore's success in organizing with Communists had taught her that, as Farmer writes, “an organization need not be explicitly Black Nationalist in its mission to advance the cause.”

“The cause” itself, for Moore—and, truthfully, for many Black nationalists—couldn't be distilled into a clear, unified goal. As James Edward Smethurst, a scholar of 20th-century Black radical movements, writes in his book The Black Arts Movement, the actual definitions and tactics of Black nationalism were secondary to the belief that, without self-determination, Black people would be “oppressed and exploited second-class (or non-) citizens in the United States.” Moore's activism exemplifies how, as Smethurst writes, “old Left and old Nationalist spaces often intersected with each other and with those of the New Left, the Civil Rights Movement, and the new nationalists,” particularly Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, “in surprising ways.”

In 1950, Moore fell out with the Communist Party because of its shifting focus away from Black equality. Over the next two decades, her politics would harden; she mentored many young nationalists, including Malcolm X and Ahmad, a founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement. But as Farmer writes, guiding all of Moore's work was a single overarching dream, rooted in her early days with the UNIA: gaining reparations. In 1962, Moore launched a campaign to persuade the U.S. government to pay reparations to descendants of enslaved Africans, which she timed for the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation the following year. She and her fellow activists charged that the country owed Black Americans $500 trillion, to be paid in land and cash distributed to individuals annually. She even sought the formation of a separatist Black nation in the U.S.—what she called a “national territory in a country developed by our blood and tears and unrequited slave labor.” This was groundbreaking at a time when the zeitgeist prioritized inclusion in the American body politic rather than separation and redress.

In the 1960s, Moore would become known by the honorific “Queen Mother Moore,” in recognition of her role as an elder stateswoman to Black organizers across the political spectrum. During a trip to Ghana in 1972, she was crowned with the title in an Asante ceremony. In the '70s, she reached the height of her influence in the Black Power Movement, becoming a mentor figure to a Detroit-based separatist group, the Republic of New Afrika, that advocated for five Black Belt states to be given to Black Americans as a nation-state. In spite of the group's unrealized dreams—as well as struggles with surveillance and violent disruption from the FBI's Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO—Farmer writes that Moore still affirmed, at the end of the '70s, “I'm a hard nationalist.”

Read: A book that puts the life back into biography

In Queen Mother, Farmer takes a clear-eyed look at Moore's foibles, noting her absenteeism during her son's formative years, her embrace of patriarchal hierarchy in Black communities, and her exhortations for Black women to embrace polygyny to facilitate nation building. Farmer acknowledges that Black nationalists sometimes took violent action, claiming the “right to govern themselves and to defend themselves.” But she also seeks to correct a common misunderstanding of the ideology, arguing that it's not the “violent, incoherent, and nihilistic inverse of the Civil Rights Movement,” but a campaign with the very same goals, sought through different means (separation from white society, rather than integration). Still, many of Moore's ideas “were on the fringe then,” Farmer writes, “as they are now.” The historian doesn't explain away Moore's infatuation and personal association with the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who in 1975 invited her to attend a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Kampala. As Farmer writes, Moore was “thrilled” by him and seemed to ignore the fact that his rule had become known for its corruption and human-rights abuses.

But Farmer doesn't need to justify all of Moore's beliefs and goals to make a case for her influence. Her meticulous study of the many figures, movements, and organizations Moore worked with shows that her contributions were pivotal, rather than peripheral. Moore was a Garveyite through line—what Farmer calls a midwife—to many 20th-century Black-nationalist activists, a lot of them men, who remain more famous than her. Queen Mother establishes her as a titan in her own right, a central influence in nearly a century of global Black-liberation struggles, and a reminder for modern activists of a persistent truth: that cooperation does not have to mean compromising one's values, and that those who dream of freedom have more than one way of achieving it.

Confessional outbursts after a failed relationship have a long history—and some people do them better than others.

Hooray for Lily Allen. I can't get her messy, bracing new album, which crisply dissects her failed marriage, out of my head. I'm all for processing romantic wounds in private: consuming large tubs of ice cream, drawing the window shades, crying hot tears into the depths of a down pillow. Breakups can be agonizing, even immobilizing; sometimes, wallowing is the ideal way forward. Eventually, you get sick of yourself and move on, though this can take a while—sometimes a long while. That's also okay. (I was single for 10 years after my divorce, which was maybe a little too long of a while.)

But there's something to be said for processing heartbreak by spilling secrets or otherwise setting things ablaze. Allen's West End Girl is a prime example of this tactic. In October, the British performer lit the internet on fire with a 14-track, 45-minute-long effort that tracks the dissolution of her marriage to the actor David Harbour (Stranger Things) after he supposedly violated the terms of their open marriage. (Harbour has not commented directly on Allen's album, but in an interview published last month, he made vague reference to “the slipups and the mistakes” he's made.)

Mistakes, perhaps, like the one Allen sings about on “Madeline,” a frenetic, sarcastic number addressed to the “other woman”: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don't be blatant.” Later, on the much softer, sadder “Sleepwalking,” she laments that there's “been no romance since we wed”—that “you let me think it was me in my head / And nothing to do with them girls in your bed.” Ouch.

Allen definitely has a way with words. But her album is hitting such a nerve, I think, not just because of its clever lyrics but also because it can be thought of as an extremely public breakup letter of sorts: sweet-revenge lemonade made from bitter lemons. Very bitter. (Paging Beyoncé.) West End Girl invites listeners to follow Allen's relationship as it unravels, and the album sorts through all kinds of rubbish along the way. Allen's reference to a Duane Reade bag full of sex toys is especially cheeky.

West End Girl is raw and over-the-top at times, but that's part of the point. Breakups preceded by infidelity can be particularly gross and mean, as is the way we talk about them, to ourselves and to a salivating public. Allen's approach is light-years away from, say, the concept of “conscious uncoupling,” which a self-satisfied Gwyneth Paltrow popularized a little over a decade ago. Sometimes, the only way past the hurt is not around the muck, but through it.

Aggrieved truth-telling as romantic warfare, especially among women, is a narrative tactic that goes back to at least the days of Shakespeare. In The Taming of the Shrew, written in the late 16th century, the “shrew” in question, Kate, tells her new husband, Petruchio, who has embarked on a project to “tame” her willfulness, “My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or else my heart, concealing it, will break.” Kate is rebelling against Petruchio's efforts to control her, but her words also help explain confessional outbursts from women who've spent too long in relationships suppressing anger.

I love this kind of dirty laundry. In 2002, I edited an anthology, a cultural history of women's breakup letters, when my then-boyfriend disappeared on me after a pregnancy test I took came back positive. What I discovered in researching the book was that, often, women's most powerful and wince-inducing responses are written not while a relationship is ending but after the fact, when things start falling into place—when realizations dawn and connections are drawn—and they get really and truly pissed off.

These “autopsy” letters, as I called them, are what they sound like: postmortems in which correspondents pore over and explicate the collapse of a relationship, bit by bit, point by point. They're not diaristic entries, in which the writer is addressing herself; rather—as with Allen's album, which uses the second-person singular in the present tense—they are typically directed at the individual she feels has wronged her. They can be both charming and ugly, semi-controlled demolitions that are fascinating to behold and deeply relatable to anyone who's ever been mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.

Read: In defense of marital secrets

Take Catherine Texier's Breakup: The End of a Love Story, which is not a letter but a memoir. (I published an excerpt from it in my book.) In the late 1990s, Texier, who at that point had been married to her writer husband for nearly two decades and had two children with him, discovered that he was having an affair with his editor. How? She found the receipts. Literally. “I didn't want to tell you about the receipts, about the page torn off your book,” Texier writes. “It seemed cheap to me, another cliché, the wife rummaging through her husband's papers looking for evidence. I didn't want to admit that I had played the part.” Later, she has a violent fantasy in which she smashes her husband's head against a hard surface until it's “pissing blood, teeth flying, your hair matted with the innards of your cortex.”

Texier's and Allen's autopsies unfold similarly. Both women struggle through stage after stage of emotion: shock, resentment, self-pity, anger, bargaining, self-loathing, more anger—and eventually, with luck, a little bit of acceptance, and personal responsibility too. Part of the art of airing dirty laundry lies in sullying oneself in the process. Without an admission of faults of one's own, an outburst reads as sour grapes. In Breakup, for example, Texier doesn't recuse herself for her part in her marriage's dissolution or for the ugliness of her reaction to it. Neither does Allen: We see how desperate she is at times, how in denial and defensive she can be. She can also come across as pathetic, rash, immature. In one of the album's later tracks, she admits: “I feel embarrassed, I feel ashamed / You're so indifferent and that's insane,” followed by “Why won't you beg, won't you beg for me?”

Unlike an artist such as Taylor Swift, whose breakup ballads can seem a little pat and distant, often positioning the narrator as a sort of heroine, Allen's songs tend to make her seem, well, spiteful. Which is a good thing. As she puts it, her objective is to “lay my truth on the table.” (In fairness to Swift, the 2024 song “How Did It End,” from her album The Tortured Poets Department, is a self-described postmortem, though the target of the narrator's ire isn't her onetime beloved but “interlopers' glances.”)

Listening to Allen's lyrics, so full of dismay and bewilderment, I thought of a multidisciplinary artwork by the French photographer and writer Sophie Calle, which showed at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Inspired by a breakup letter from one of Calle's lovers that told her to “take care of yourself”—this was also the title of the piece itself—Calle's riposte was spirited, and a little sardonic. She asked 107 women to interpret her former lover's letter in an effort to help her process it; those she enlisted included a psychiatrist, a singer, and a sharpshooter, who shot bullets through the letter from a distance.

A far less successful example of a public postmortem has preoccupied much of the media world in recent weeks: that of the journalist Ryan Lizza, who, through his Substack newsletter, began lobbing written grenades at his onetime fiancée, Olivia Nuzzi, just as she released a memoir that touches obliquely on her engagement-ending involvement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom she'd profiled as a writer for New York magazine. I don't know about Lizza's salacious allegations, but I do know that he does the dirty-laundry thing all wrong: His serialized revelations read as a calculated, self-serving endeavor; he doesn't interrogate himself much. Burning it all down to settle a score only really works—engenders sympathy or understanding, for example—if you're also dousing yourself with a little accelerant before lighting the match. (Nuzzi's memoir, her version of a postmortem, has been interpreted as a failed attempt to turn scandal into literature. It doesn't reveal much at all, except that she has a strange way with the English language.)

Read: A divorce memoir with no lessons

Allen's album is much closer to Calle's lucidly distilled autopsy—pain transmuted into rat-a-tat art—than to the written by-products of the Lizza-Nuzzi affair. West End Girl, in its captivating urgency, succeeds as art; perhaps time would have honed Allen's insights, but I suspect that the album wouldn't have packed the punch it did, both creatively and professionally, if she'd waited a few years to write and release it. (Allen, who recently performed songs from the album on Saturday Night Live, has confirmed reports that she is in talks to turn the album into a stage production.) And seeing a mess of real emotion—the self-doubt, the fury, the anguish—can feel like a relief these days amid the filtered idealism of our feeds: the perfect meal, the perfect vacation, the perfect marriage. There's also something to be said for the satisfaction of holding someone, anyone, accountable at a time when accountability is in short shrift—even if it's within the context of a lower-stakes, mildly out-of-the-ordinary story of infidelity.

As Esther Perel writes in her 2017 book, The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, “The dagger of romantic betrayal is sharp at both ends. We can use it to slash ourselves, to pinpoint our shortcomings, to underscore our self-loathing. Or we can use it to hurt back, to have the slayer experience the same excruciating pain they inflicted on us. Some people turn the dagger inward; others direct the blade toward the culprits, in real life or in fantasy. We swing from depression to indignation, from lifelessness to roaring rage, from collapse to counterattack.” You gotta start somewhere.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Big-Tobacco Playbook Comes for Your Oreos","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/is-big-food-like-big-tobacco/685271/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

A new lawsuit likens food companies to the tobacco industry. But it's much harder to do something about junk food than cigarettes.

Without fail, any corporation accused of conspiring against public health will be compared to Big Tobacco. When oil companies downplayed the threat of climate change, they were allegedly following in the footsteps of cigarette manufacturers. The NFL's strategy for disputing the link between football and concussions has similarly been likened to the tobacco industry's actions. The online-gambling industry has supposedly acted like Big Tobacco, as have the tech industry and the plastic industry.



Earlier this month, one such comparison ended up in a lawsuit. In the first such case of its kind, San Francisco sued several of the nation's largest food companies—including Kraft Heinz, Nestle USA, and PepsiCo—alleging that they had copied the tobacco industry's playbook by deliberately engineering processed food to be irresistible and then concealing the risks. “They used Big Tobacco tactics to research, design, and sell addictive products,” David Chiu, the city attorney, said at a press conference.



What is this comparison really saying? An executive focused on selling more Oreos or cans of Mountain Dew might have an interest in encouraging unhealthy dietary habits, but that is not self-evidently the same as the misdeeds of the tobacco industry, which for decades covered up the evidence that cigarettes cause cancer while continuing to sell what's been called the most dangerous consumer product ever.



I ran the analogy by several nutrition experts. “Of course, food is more complicated than tobacco,” Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor at New York University, told me. The risks of cigarettes are well established, but researchers still struggle to define what even counts as an ultra-processed food, let alone pinpoint the exact reason these foods prompt people to overeat. However, there are notable similarities between the two industries and the products they sell, she said. Researchers do know that ultra-processed foods such as Coca-Cola and Pringles are among the biggest contributors to obesity and other diet-related diseases, which are linked to an estimated 1 million deaths in the United States each year.

The two industries also use similar strategies to cast doubt on the dangers of their products. Junk-food companies “know the harm they're doing, and they do it anyway,” Robert Lustig, an emeritus professor of pediatrics at UC San Francisco, told me. Consider Coca-Cola: Roughly a decade ago, the food giant funded a think tank that reportedly attempted to shift the focus of obesity away from poor diets and instead highlight the role that exercise can play in weight management. Like Big Tobacco, food companies have also attempted to convince consumers that some of their unhealthy products might actually be good for them. In 2016, Coca-Cola settled a lawsuit filed by consumer advocates alleging that the company falsely advertised Vitaminwater as containing just vitamins and water; as part of the settlement, the company agreed to change its marketing and note on its bottles that the drink contains sweeteners.



For decades, Big Tobacco and Big Food were in many cases one and the same. In 1985, the tobacco giant R. J. Reynolds bought Nabisco; three years later, Philip Morris, the company responsible for the Marlboro Man, acquired Kraft Foods. Philip Morris later purchased Nabisco and absorbed it into Kraft, before relinquishing control of the company in 2007. It was during this time period that junk food became so irresistible. A recent study found that from 1988 to 2001, foods developed by tobacco-owned companies versus other companies were far more likely to be “hyperpalatable,” meaning they contained large quantities of carbs, fat, and salt.



Food companies deny comparisons to Big Tobacco. A spokesperson for the Consumer Brands Association, a lobbying group that represents packaged-food companies, told me that “attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities.” I reached out to the 11 food companies named in the San Francisco lawsuit and heard back from only Coca-Cola. A company spokesperson told me in an email that comparisons between Big Food and Big Tobacco are flawed, and pointed out that Coca-Cola also sells a variety of “low‑ and no‑sugar options.” In response to the claims that Coca-Cola has downplayed the effects of its products on obesity, the spokesperson said that the company has since strengthened its “transparency standards” and allows the researchers it funds to “control the design, data and publication to ensure objectivity.”



Comparing Big Food and Big Tobacco is certainly an evocative rhetorical device. It underscores the severity of America's obesity problem, and it points out that the way food is manufactured can itself be part of the problem. Villainizing food companies has become a popular message—one that has galvanized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Food giants “are literally poisoning our children systematically for profit,” Kennedy said last year. As HHS secretary, Kennedy has cracked down on ultra-processed food, pushing states to ban the purchase of soda with food stamps and pressuring companies to phase out synthetic food dyes.

And yet, Americans still love Big Food. Hershey's, Heinz Ketchup, and M&M's are among America's most trusted brands, according to a recent Morning Consult report. As a result, drastic measures that would improve diet-related disease in this country—the kinds that were used against the tobacco industry—are still quite unpopular. Cigarette taxes have proved to reduce smoking rates, but attempts to levy even a small tax on soda have failed in cities across the country. Other ideas, such as creating a minimum age to buy junk food, aren't even discussed by lawmakers. I asked Chiu, the San Francisco city attorney, if he would support such a policy, and he punted. “My office is employing our tools as we can to address this crisis in front of us,” he told me, “but we welcome other actors and stakeholders to be involved.”



In some ways, comparing Big Food to Big Tobacco undersells just how difficult it will be to remedy the problems with the American diet. To push Americans away from cigarettes, public-health advocates had a simple message: Don't smoke. There is no equivalent slogan for food. Although roughly 40 percent of American adults smoked in the 1960s, when cigarettes were at their most popular, ultra-processed foods are everywhere in 2025. They make up more than 50 percent of what adults eat at home. They're not just Kit Kat bars and Twinkies but also Campbell's soup, Wonder Bread, and Hot Pockets. The world can live without cigarettes, but the same cannot be said of food.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shari Williams, a 41-year-old social media strategist based in Chicago. It's been edited for length and clarity.

In 2017, my four-month contract at an advertising agency was wrapping up with no word of a job offer or extension. I thought to myself, ""I have to do something crazy to catch their attention.""

My husband and friends were skeptical when I told them of my plan to create a dating-app style website to pitch myself as ""the perfect match"" for the company, but something told me it was going to work.

A few weeks later, I posted my website on LinkedIn and even passed out custom candy hearts with the URL to my coworkers. My post gained traction, even catching the attention of the company's creative director, and I was extended a full-time offer.

I learned it's always worth a shot to be bold.

Business Insider wants to hear from people who've cracked the job market with a bold or unconventional approach: sending personalized slide decks in place of cover letters, venmoing your boss to get their attention , or a step-by-step process, etc. If you've snagged a job semi-recently (last few weeks, months, or years), we'd love to hear how you did it!

I had been working as a web developer for several years when I ended up pregnant and realized it wasn't the career path for me. I transitioned into social media and later went the freelance route, landing the four-month contract job at Burrell Communications to help with a campaign.

The office location was convenient, the people were cool, and the work was fun. I really liked working there and didn't want it to end.

I figured if I created my own website as a way to pitch myself to the company, it could be easily shared online to garner attention and get noticed by the company. My original inspiration was Nina Mulfeh, who was actually featured in Business Insider, for creating a website to land a job at AirBnB. Since I was working in advertising, I wanted to do something creative and attention-grabbing, so I decided to make mine have a dating-app look and feel.

It probably took a few weeks to build ShariLovesBurrell.com, but most of that time was spent gathering information and planning out how I wanted it to look. The site had a pink background with hearts — it was one of those sites where content floats as you scroll.

I created a dating ""profile"" for Burrell and one for me, and wrote things like ""I've never felt this way about a company before"" and ""I think we have something special.""

Then I added a few sections including a portfolio of everything I had done at Burrell during my contract period, testimonials from coworkers, and an ""about me"" section for anyone who just happened to stumble onto the website.

At the end of the page, it said something like ""I think we're a perfect match"" and there was a Tinder-like graphic of Burrell and me ""matching.""

I shared my website on LinkedIn and created custom conversation heart candies with my website's URL to pass around the office. If the company didn't come across the website online, they'd see the URL printed on this little package. I'm pretty sure I put those conversation hearts on everyone's desk.

People seemed to think it was super cute and creative, but they also were like, ""Why are you doing all this for a job?""

Getting an advertising job is not easy, and there's a lot of competition. I knew it was a place I liked working, so I wanted to give it a shot. I just felt like I didn't have anything to lose. Even if they didn't hire me, my hope was that people would see it, share it, and something could come of it.

The creative director at Burrell shared my LinkedIn post about my website with the caption ""Shari, we hear you loud and clear,"" and Burrell later ended up extending me a full-time offer as a social content manager.

I took the job but ultimately didn't stay at the company for much longer. However, having a full-time role on my résumé helped me to land other jobs and escape the ""contractor only"" trap. Now I work at Northwestern Medicine as a lead social media strategist, and I learned a lot that I use now from my role at Burrell.

My experience taught me that there are ways to stand out in the job market and compensate for a lack of experience, awards, or big company names on your résumé.

Jobseekers don't need to take my exact approach, but if there's a role you really want, it's worth a shot to be bold and put yourself out there to get noticed. If you're good at something, find a way to let people know.

Instagram users will now be able to watch Reels short-form videos on bigger screens. 

Meta said Tuesday that the company will begin testing its Instagram for TV app in the U.S. via Amazon Fire TV streaming devices, underscoring the photo-sharing app's effort to become a major video platform beyond smartphones, taking on TikTok and YouTube. 

The Instagram for TV app features the company's TikTok-like Reels videos that are often produced by individual creators to be viewed, shared and algorithmically recommended to users on the platform.

Tessa Lyons, Instagram vice president of product, told CNBC in an interview that Meta plans to expand the new TV app to other device makers, though she didn't name them. She said the company is currently prioritizing ""a great experience"" rather than the immediate expansion of its giant ad business on TV.

""We think we probably have a lot more work to do to really make sure that we're bringing people the content they love on mobile in a way that really makes sense for them and feels designed for TV,"" Lyons said. ""That's where we're going to be focused in 2026 as well as bringing it to more people and more devices, and, down the line, we'll certainly think more about monetization.""

The Reels displayed on the TV app ""will still continue to be vertical videos"" instead of being reformatted to accommodate a television's more horizontal design, Lyons said.

Lyons said the new Instagram TV app will stick with short form, showing Reels videos ""that are three minutes or less."" Meta previously debuted a separate, video-specific variant of Instagram, dubbed IGTV, in 2018 that let people upload long-form videos. The company shut the mobile app down in 2022, when it began heavily pushing Reels as TikTok's popularity soared.

""Down the line, we'll think about if we want to move into slightly longer content,"" Lyons said.

App users will be able to see a selection of Reels that have been collected into channels that are based on specific interests like sports, music, travel and other topics.

Customers can add five individual Instagram accounts to a single, shared TV-specific Instagram account, but the company said it would ""apply content standards suitable for a broad audience,"" which would likely keep teenagers from being recommended Reels containing videos related to drugs, alcohol and sexualized content.

WATCH: There's no way to relate Meta to interest rates, says Jim Cramer.

Andre Lewis said he's ""anxious 364 days of the year."" Yet the rideshare and delivery driver wants to make it a special holiday season for his 7-year-old daughter.

""I told myself I'd keep it modest,"" said the 31-year-old, who lives in New York City. But he said his daughter wants a pink keyboard that lights up, and he'll buy it for her — ""even if it's a little over budget.""

""Christmas is the one day I let myself stop worrying,"" he said. 

For many U.S. consumers like Lewis, economic worries have cast a cloud over an otherwise cheery season. Consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than three years in early November, close to its all-time low, according to University of Michigan's monthly survey. The metric posted a slight uptick in December.

Yet so far, that downbeat backdrop hasn't stopped shopping this year or dragged down the typical kickoff of the holiday season. That apparent contrast has left investors and economists wondering whether — and when — jitters over high costs of living, increased tariffs and a tepid job market will start to emerge more in spending data. 

Across the country, nearly 203 million U.S. shoppers hit retailers' stores and websites during the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday — the highest turnout in at least nine years, according to the National Retail Federation, which surveys shoppers to calculate the annual estimate.

Big-box and club retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy and Costco, topped Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations, and executives said they saw an encouraging start to the crucial shopping season. Meanwhile, discretionary retailers like Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle also exceeded quarterly estimates, and company leaders said consumer demand has been steady. 

""I know everybody's looking for cracks in consumer health,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC in late November. ""It feels pretty consistent to us.""

Some executives also said lower-income consumers, who have felt economic pressures most acutely over the last year, have kept spending.

""The headline is that we feel very good about the lower-income customer,"" Burlington Stores CEO Michael O'Sullivan said when the company quarterly results last month. ""This customer has been very resilient. When we look at our stores in lower-income trade areas, they continue to outperform the chain.""

Some key dynamics have supported U.S. consumer spending, even as concerns about an AI investment bubble and layoffs by companies including Verizon and Target cloud the 2026 economic outlook. Unemployment numbers are still relatively low, though the labor market has slowed. While the U.S. added more jobs than expected in November, the unemployment rate hit the highest level in four years, according to delayed government data released Tuesday. Separate ADP figures showed the private sector unexpectedly lost jobs in November. 

Higher-income consumers, in particular, have propped up retail sales as they benefit from rising home values and stock market gains. And holiday spending, in particular, tends to be insulated since families across incomes prioritize the season, even if that means sacrificing other kinds of spending or racking up the credit card bill. 

Marcus Feldman, a biotech project manager from Cambridge, Mass., said he will spend about 15% more this year on the holidays. He and his wife plan to take their 9- and 12-year-old sons on a skiing trip, and splurge on nicer gifts.

""It's partly because we can and partly because life's short and the boys are only little once,"" he said.

And, he added, he's noticed others spending freely.

""Every headline says people are scared to spend,"" he said. ""Then I walk down [one of Boston's major shopping streets] Newbury Street on a Saturday and it's shoulder-to-shoulder.""

On a call with reporters in early December, National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay said ""there's a bit of a moat"" around holiday spending, a time when emotions fuel demand.

""One of the key drivers here is that for many Americans and many families, holiday spending and holiday shopping is an essential part of the budget,"" he said on the call.

Plus, as interest rates remain high, consumers have put off some of the priciest purchases they typically make, such as new houses and cars. That's freed up money for spending on goods, said Naveen Jaggi, who leads retail transaction and advisory services at commercial real estate services firm JLL.

Still, warning signs loom over the economy. Nearly every retailer has said consumers continue to be selective about spending and are looking for deals to stretch dollars. Shoppers' hunt for deep discounts fueled strong turnout and growth during the sales days known for promotions, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. 

Some of the retail spending growth has come from price hikes, which have persisted even as the rate of inflation eases.

After being hit by higher prices for groceries, electricity and housing, consumers are seizing upon sales to get ahead of further price increases.

Eugenio Aleman, chief economist for equity research firm Raymond James, attributes lower consumer sentiment to price hikes. He said that's accelerated some purchases because shoppers worry prices will keep going up.

""Even though they feel bad, they say, 'Okay, I have to do whatever it takes to buy now,'"" he said. 

The contrast between spending data and consumer sentiment captures a head-scratching gap between what consumers are saying and what they are doing.

That divergence dates back to 2021, soon after the Covid pandemic, when surveys of consumer spending intentions became less predictive of their behavior, said Ali Furman, the U.S. consumer markets industry leader for consulting firm PwC.

In particular, she said PwC has seen higher-income households and those on the East and West Coasts more likely to keep spending, even as they report a low sentiment.

That gap influenced PwC's own holiday forecast. Its consumer survey during late June and early July indicated that holiday shoppers planned to pull back on purchases from last year, with Gen Z consumers especially slashing their budgets.

Based on that survey, PwC projected that consumers' average spending on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment would decline 5% from the year-ago period.

Yet in late October, it surveyed consumers again and reversed its projections. PwC now expects consumers across age groups will spend 3% to 4% more on the holidays year over year. 

Furman said consumers may have felt a little better in the fall, as some worries about higher tariffs faded and they saw retailers' holiday merchandise start to hit the shelves. 

The durability of consumer spending has even surprised the National Retail Federation, the industry's major trade group. For the vast majority of months this year, retail sales have climbed nearly or more than 4% year over year, according to U.S. Census Bureau retail figures. 

That's higher than the 2.7% to 3.7% annual year-over-year growth that the trade group predicted.

It's not just consumers: Businesses have shown caution about their spending. Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to be the lowest in at least 15 years, according to the NRF, as companies try to manage higher costs from tariffs.

Retailers have also stressed the unpredictability of consumer behavior, even when posting otherwise strong results.

Macy's, for example, earlier this month reported its strongest growth in more than three years as it made progress on its turnaround strategy. Still, it disappointed Wall Street with a cautious forecast for the holiday quarter. CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the ""customer is hanging in there,"" but is still spending selectively. 

Costco CFO Gary Millerchip said the warehouse club, which has benefitted from consumers seeking value, has seen ""bumpy"" trends that have muddied a consistent pattern of consumers spending more and seeking value, quality and new items.

""When you look at month by month, there's definitely been some lumpiness in the individual monthly sales results that we've posted,"" he said on an earnings call on Thursday.  

The buzzwords retail executives have used in public comments underscore how confusing the consumer backdrop has become. CEOs in recent years have repeatedly called shoppers ""choiceful"" about their spending.

Yet retailers have also started to describe consumers as ""resilient."" In the most recent round of earnings calls, leaders from Macy's, Burlington Stores, Tapestry, Abercrombie & Fitch and Ralph Lauren all used the word to describe their customers.

At some companies, it's unclear if healthy results have come from individual execution or a strong economy. The retail industry has been more starkly divided between winners and losers over the last year, and those that are executing well have won the dollars of selective shoppers.

For example, Gap's Old Navy, which primarily caters to low- and middle-income shoppers, had an ""incredibly strong"" third quarter, CEO Richard Dickson said. The apparel brand's comparable sales rose 6%, far better than the 3.8% increase analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

Dickson said shoppers responded to value across all income groups, as the brand saw ""consistency and strength in our customer behavior."" Still, Gap has been in the midst of a major turnaround and only started posting stronger results after Dickson took over. 

Even as U.S. consumers have shown resilience, there have also been clues that they're making tradeoffs and trying to get more for their money. 

Value-oriented retailers including Walmart and Dollar General have attracted more high-income shoppers. Off-price chains like TJX-owned T.J. Maxx and mall names like Gap have also drawn in wealthier shoppers who are looking for home decor and clothing. 

Luc Wathieu, a professor of marketing at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, said the disconnect between sentiment and spending is a ""paradox,"" but added shoppers and retailers have left behind a trail of breadcrumbs to explain it. He said holiday season has gotten off to a strong start because people are shopping early around events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday to save money. 

Retailers have been able to meet that demand and keep offering deals because of the extra inventory they bought earlier this year to avoid tariffs. Many experts expect companies to sell through those items by the end of the year. 

For those reasons, ""we should see a very good beginning of the season"" but ""a pretty bad end of the season,"" said Wathieu, the research director of the NRF Business of Retail Initiative at Georgetown.

Consumers also feel like they don't have control over what's happening around them during an indulgent season, which is fueling spending despite their negative outlook, Wathieu said.

""It's a little bit like dancing on the Titanic before it collapses, right?"" he said. ""We don't know what's going to happen. We might as well live our life in the meantime.""

Plus, industry growth so far this season may be more related to inflation than actual strong demand, said Omair Tariq, the founder and CEO of Cart.com, which provides logistics, fulfillment and other services for retailers including Eddie Bauer, Adidas and Guess. 

Tariq told CNBC more than half of Cart's customers confirmed they were raising prices this year, and those companies' volumes fell after the hikes took effect.

""Conversion dropped, order volume dropped,"" Tariq said. ""What we saw was that even during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, while there was obviously some growth, it was in in the low single digits.""

In Salesforce's Cyber Week results, the company found the average selling price over the Thanksgiving selling weekend was up 6% compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, volumes only grew 2% globally and 1% in the U.S. 

Lewis, the rideshare and delivery driver, shopped at Brookfield Place in downtown Manhattan last week. Income is up and down with his job, he said, but a wave of holiday visitors to New York has boosted business for now. He bought a pair of Nike shoes for his daughter while at the mall.

Yet to make sure he has enough for her, he's trimmed back in other ways. He's put off shoe purchases for himself, postponed a phone upgrade and hasn't taken a trip in over a year.

""I want her to feel like the world is full of possibility,"" he said.

Ethereum's price action has weakened further over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency falling below $3,000 and shedding about 6.8% in the last 24 hours alone. 

The immediate price action points to reclaiming this $3,000 support, but a longer-term technical view suggests the current decline may be part of a much larger and more defined price framework. A macro analysis shared by crypto analyst Dona examines Ethereum's behavior over the past two years with a structured range that suggests that the cryptocurrency might bottom at $2,187.

Ethereum's Two-Year Range Still Defines The Bigger Picture

According to the analysis, Ethereum has largely traded within a broad horizontal range for close to two years, aside from two notable fakeouts: one below resistance in the first half of 2025 and one above resistance in the second half of the year, which led to a new price high of $4,946 in August. On the weekly timeframe, price has repeatedly respected an upper boundary around $4,000 to $4,100, while finding consistent demand near the lower range support just above $2,100.

This price action has resulted in a structure that resembles an inverse head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale. Instead of signaling immediate upside, however, the formation shows how price has oscillated between these defined trendlines, with mid-range reactions often determining whether Ethereum pushes to resistance or slips back toward support. 

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading within the mid-range of the two-year range. Based on this context, the recent bearish move can be viewed less as a breakdown and more as a rotation towards the lower trendline within the same long-standing range.

Why $2,187 Stands Out As A Critical Downside Target

The chart accompanying the analysis places particular emphasis on the lower boundary of the range near $2,187. This level has repeatedly acted as a bounce floor during prior downtrends in 2024 and another one in July 2025.

If Ethereum continues to trade below the mid-range support currently around $3,000, then the price could follow a familiar range rotation path toward this lower boundary. This move will see Ethereum fall to as low as $2,187. 

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,928, and is still a 25% decline away from $2,187. Although this would be tragic for bullish traders, such a move would not necessarily invalidate the broader structure. Instead, it will complete another cycle within the range, similar to previous declines that eventually transitioned into a bounce for a rally phase.

One of the more notable aspects of the outlook from Dona is the expectation for subdued activity in the near term. Aside from range-bound trades, taking directional positions may be less attractive as liquidity thins into the end of the year. From this perspective, the next major move is more likely to arrive in January 2026.

Imagine checking the ETH to USD price because you're about to take a walk through a museum that doesn't exist in the real world. It sounds like something off a Holodeck in a science fiction TV show, but it's actually possible to do.

Ethereum has become a key player in the expanding digital economy, especially with the rise of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Many experts note how NFTs are changing how people view digital art and ownership.

Because of Ethereum's smart contracts, artists, collectors, and platforms now have a secure, globally-accessible way to share and sell digital creations. This new system is changing up the traditional art world and offering both opportunities and challenges. 

NFTs have opened up a whole new world for artists. You can now take your digital art and “mint” it onto the Ethereum blockchain, which means turning it into a unique, verifiable, and permanent asset that retains your proof of ownership. It's allowing artists to skip traditional gatekeepers and connect directly with art dealers and buyers worldwide in a market with no borders, giving artists who might otherwise struggle a chance to be noticed.

One of the more interesting aspects of NFTs on Ethereum is their ability to embed royalties directly into smart contracts. Basically, this means the artist gets a percentage of future sales every time their NFT is resold. A steady source of income is a big selling point for artists in a market where they often only benefit from the initial sale. It's helping to create a more level playing field for artists to make a living and keep them creating new work.

Ethereum's position in the NFT world comes down to its technology. It created and adopted important token standards for creating unique NFTs and guaranteeing each digital artwork is one of a kind. These guidelines work across all major NFT platforms, keeping everything running smoothly.

Ethereum's decentralized setup is also important for keeping ownership records and transaction histories secure. The public blockchain keeps track of every transaction, change of ownership, and minting. This means that there is no need for a middleman. No single person or group controls Ethereum, so it cannot be censored or changed, and the asset's integrity is also protected.

The NFT world is buzzing with marketplaces and other platforms built on the Ethereum network. Big names like OpenSea, Foundation, and Rarible are popular hubs for buying, selling, and discovering NFTs. These sites make it easier for newcomers to get into NFT trading without needing to wade into more complex blockchain technology. They are essentially digital art galleries and auction houses, handling millions of transactions by connecting artists with collectors.

Many people know about NFTs due to high-profile sales, often supported by celebrity endorsements. These sales have also showcased the technology that makes NFTs possible and sparked conversations about digital ownership. This attention has brought in more artists, collectors, and developers, and it is also starting a cycle of growth, discussion, and ongoing development in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Still, it's important to keep in mind that the NFT world is not perfect. 

Cryptocurrency can be volatile. Changes in Ethereum's price can affect how artists price their work and how collectors perceive the value of an asset. If the price of ETH drops suddenly, an artist might adjust their prices, or a collector might start to doubt the asset's value. Everyone in the NFT space needs to stay informed and make wise decisions because the market is always changing.

Then there are the environmental concerns. While the NFT ecosystem continues to grow, the Ethereum community has been working to address this problem. Ethereum's big switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake has dramatically cut its energy consumption by over 99 percent. The upgrade, called “the merge,” has gone a long way toward resolving many environmental concerns associated with the network, though those involved have yet to measure its overall impact.

However, Layer-2 solutions, such as Polygon and Arbitrum, are also making a big difference in improving NFTs' minting and trading. They handle transactions off the main Ethereum chain, group them, and settle them on the main Ethereum network. This lets them process more transactions at a lower cost than if they did it all on the blockchain. It's making NFTs both more accessible and affordable to more users. 

Ethereum has played a major role in changing the digital world for everyone who creates and collects art. NFTs and the powerful technology that powers them have ushered in a new era of real digital ownership, offering artists new ways to make money and connect with people around the world. With continuous improvements in how it manages environmental impact and growth, Ethereum serves as the foundation of a vibrant digital economy.

Discussion about the digital euro has been constantly growing since it was first announced back in 2021, with conflicting narratives and even conspiracies about the currency cropping up online as the months go by. 

The European Central Bank (ECB) describes it as an ""answer in a world of change"", with features such as enhanced privacy, universal acceptance and free basic use, while certain consumers claim it's a tool for the EU to control people's money.

A petition, which has gathered more than 388,000 signatures, was published online in November, calling on MEPs and national governments to reject the digital euro.

But how true are the claims that the digital euro will block citizens from effectively controlling their own money? Euronews' fact-checking team, The Cube, took a look at the evidence.

Last week, the ECB announced plans to ""prepare for a possible rollout of the digital euro by 2029"". 

Initial trials of the digital currency could begin as early as mid-2027 — but only if MEPs approve the necessary regulation in 2026.

The digital euro would be a new form of central bank money — in other words, real money issued by the European Central Bank, but in digital form. 

As things stand, the only way for the public to hold central bank money is in cash. The digital euro would make it possible to hold this same sovereign money in a digital wallet, accessible, for example, via a smartphone.

In practical terms, payments could be made in shops using a phone, much like with a bank card today. However, paying with a digital card and paying with a digital euro are not the same.

Card payments, whether physical or digital, are processed through private banks or payment service providers. The digital euro, by contrast, would be issued directly by the ECB — like banknotes — without intermediaries.

This payment method will be complementary to cash and is not intended to replace it, serving as an additional choice for consumers and businesses.

The project, presented by ECB President Christine Lagarde, is receiving growing political backing. 

At a eurozone summit in October, European leaders called for faster progress to strengthen Europe's monetary sovereignty, economic security and competitiveness in the payments sector.

However, concerns remain over the protection of users' data, particularly when looking through the lens of China, which has been testing its digital yuan on a large scale since 2020. 

In 2024, Chinese authorities continued rolling out the state-issued digital yuan, using it as a tool to monitor and restrict financial activity linked to illegal sectors such as gambling, with transactions subject to oversight through a centrally controlled digital payment system.

The ECB, for its part, says it's committed to striking a balance between traceability and privacy. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also expected to provide safeguards for users of the digital euro, so it's not right to say that the currency will lead to the EU having total control over consumers' wallets.

Belgian economist Bruno Colmant, who has previously warned about the potential risks of control associated with the digital euro, also raised concerns about hacking. 

He told The Cube that ""the entry point for the digital euro is a commercial bank — those dealing with individuals, businesses and public authorities"". This means that ""even without their knowledge, these banks could be used to trace digital euro transactions,"" he added.

That said, he stressed the need for a nuanced debate on the issue. 

The maximum amount an individual would be allowed to hold in digital euros with the ECB is commonly said to be around €3,000. The cap would apply only to digital euro balances and has not yet been finalised in legislation, and it doesn't limit a person's overall assets or bank account holdings. Even so, Colmant said that the risk of some control ""is not zero"".

""There is potentially a loss of privacy protection, because this digital euro could be traced, and it would be possible to know exactly what it is being used for,"" he said.

It should also be noted that no precise legal framework for the digital euro has yet been adopted. MEPs are expected to adopt the relevant regulation by 2026, a prerequisite before any implementation of the project can take place.

Some bankers have voiced concerns and scepticism about the creation of the digital euro. 

The chief executive of the French bank Crédit Mutuel, Daniel Baal, wrote on LinkedIn that the digital euro ""does not meet any clear need for citizens"" and offers ""no substantial advantage over existing payment methods"".

Michael Anseeuw, the chief executive of BNP Paribas Fortis Belgium, told Belgian news outlet L'Echo that the ECB's digital currency project was a ""false good idea"", describing it as ""superfluous"", while pointing to the development of new European payment alternatives such as Wero.

Nevertheless, the ECB says one of the objectives of this complementary currency is to ""reduce dependence on non-European providers"".

The US giants Visa and Mastercard account for around 70% of the card payment market in Europe. Colmant pointed out that Europe's commercial banks ""use Visa and Mastercard, even though the licence is American"".

Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for the Economy and Productivity, has stressed the importance of ensuring Europe's strategic autonomy and avoiding reliance on foreign payment systems, particularly as online commerce continues to grow.

New Flu Variant May Be Triggering Spike in Severe Disease

A novel influenza variant called subclade K appears to be driving an uptick in cases and hospitalizations throughout the U.S. and other countries

There's a new flu variant in town, and it ain't pretty.

A mutated form of the influenza A strain H3N2 known as subclade K is causing a severe flu season in multiple countries across the world, including the U.K., Canada and Japan, and propelled a bad flu season in Australia. Now U.S. officials say it is driving up cases and hospitalizations here, too.

“Right now we're seeing clade K everywhere we are seeing influenza” in the U.S., said Andrew Pekosz, a professor and vice chair of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a press conference today.

Worryingly, the mutations in the subclade K variant may make this year's flu vaccine less effective. But experts say the shot, which was developed months before the new variant was identified, should still provide some protection against severe disease and death. The mutations “may allow it to evade some but not all of the influenza-vaccine-induced protection,” Pekosz explained.

“We're still in the middle of trying to figure out whether it's producing worse illness or whether what we're seeing is a large number of cases that are increasing, and then there's a correspondingly similar increase in terms of the severe illness,” he said.

Flu viruses are constantly evolving, but often these changes are relatively minor—a process known as antigenic drift. But sometimes a virus undergoes an evolutionary leap, or antigenic shift—and that can trigger a pandemic. Subclade K, while a significant change, is still considered to have undergone antigenic drift.

“The emergence of the new H3N2 influenza [subclade K] is concerning, as this variant emerged following development of the current-year influenza vaccine,” says physician Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “But influenza is difficult to predict.”

The most recent update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending on December 6 noted that flu infections are picking up across the country. Right now just four states are seeing high or very high influenzalike illness activity, but it's still early in the flu season, which, in the U.S., typically starts in October and may not peak until February. Recent data indicates that 89 percent of flu viruses sampled since September 28 belonged to subclade K.

Cumulative hospitalization rates, at nearly seven cases per 100,000, are currently in line with previous years. But that's starting to change in some places. Texas has seen an uptick in hospitalizations—potentially driven by the new variant—especially in those aged 65 and older.

The 2024–2025 flu season was one of the most severe in recent decades. While it's rare to have back-to-back bad flu seasons, it's not unheard of. And while this year's flu shot may not be a perfect match for subclade K, the vaccine should still provide protection—even in those who are infected with the new variant, Hopkins says.

“It is not too late to get a flu shot,” Pekosz said at the press conference.

Editor's Note (12/16/25): This article was edited after posting to correct the number of states that are seeing high or very high influenzalike illness activity and to better clarify the descriptions of the subclass K variant and the U.S.'s cumulative influenza hospitalization rates for the week ending on December 6.

The discovery doesn't have any practical applications right now, but so what? It's still cool.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

As Homer Simpson once famously phrased, “in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics,” but a new and completely unexpected discovery by a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst runs afoul of Homer's rule. 

The Laws of Thermodynamics describe the relationship of temperature, energy, and entropy in a system as well as how components of a system interact. Take emulsification for instance. This process describes how two otherwise unmixable (or immiscible) substances can combine into a homogeneous mixture. The oil in peanut butter, for example, naturally separates, forming a top layer that needs to be mixed in. However, some companies add substances known as “emulsifiers” to keep this separation from occurring. The interaction of these components in a system can all be described by the Laws of Thermodynamics. 

“Imagine your favorite Italian salad dressing,” UMass Amherst's Thomas Russell, senior author of a new paper published in the journal Nature Physics, said in a press statement. “It's made up of oil, water and spices, and before you pour it onto your salad, you shake it up so that all the ingredients mix.” 

This is emulsification in action. That very same process got strange, though, when in a Amherst laboratory, Anthony Raykh, a graduate student, mixed a batch of immiscible liquids along with magnetized nickel particles. Instead of mixing together as expected (shown below), the mixture formed what the authors of a new paper in the journal Nature Physics describe as a Grecian urn shape. 

After turning to professors for answers as well as collaborating with scientists at nearby Syracuse University and Tufts University, Raykh discovered thanks to detailed simulations that when magnetism influencing the two liquids is strong, it can bend the boundary of the liquids into a curve and disrupt the emulsification as described by the laws of thermodynamics. No matter how hard you shook the magnetized mixture, the liquids eventually formed this same shape.

“When you look very closely at the individual nanoparticles of magnetized nickel that form the boundary between the water and oil,” says Hoagland, “you can get extremely detailed information on how different forms assemble. In this case, the particles are magnetized strongly enough that their assembly interferes with the process of emulsification, which the laws of thermodynamics describe.”

Raykh admits that this discovery doesn't immediately have any practical applications, but it is a never-before-seen state that could expand the field of soft-matter physics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Pried Open a Living Room Floor—and Found 40,000 Ancient Roman Coins","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69680777/40000-ancient-roman-coins/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Vessels brimming with coins suggest a convenient method of hiding savings underground.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There was (obviously) no such thing as online banking 1,700 years ago. While the ancient Romans did adopt early banking systems from ancient Greece, the most convenient way to put aside cash that would have simply been transfered into a savings account over a thousand years later was remained stashing it in a vessel that was later buried.

Wherever the Roman Empire spread, its customs came with it. The empire and all its wealth extended through France, and archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) have now unearthed three clay amphorae overflowing with coins. Found at a site in Senon, northeastern France, makeshift piggy banks were buried in a pit beneath the lime concrete floor of what was likely someone's living room. The research team found more than 40,000 coins, weighing about 183 pounds in total. Some had been deposited in the necks of the jugs even after the containers were buried.

“Contrary to what one might think at first glance, it is not certain that these are ‘treasures' that were hidden during a period of insecurity,” numismatist Vincent Geneviève, who studies ancient currency, said in a statement from INRAP. “Many other explanations are possible, and these deposits should be seen instead as a snapshot of complex monetary management, planned over the medium to long term, within a household or administration, capable of making deposits and withdrawals at various intervals.”

At the time, Senon was populated by the Mediomatrici tribe, whose name translates to “middle mother,” and is probably a reference to the middle goddess of the three mothers worshipped in northwest Europe during the Roman era. These Celtic people, or Gauls, lived in the region during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar's forces conquered parts of Belgium, France, and Switzerland between 57 and 50 B.C.E. Caesar fought the Gauls when a subgroup known as the Helveti (from what is now Switzerland) began to migrate and clash with Roman allies. According to Caesar's own account of the Gallic Wars, Celts near the Rhine (probably including the Mediomatrici) clashed with German tribes. 

The vessels and coin hoards found by the reasearcher date from much later, around the late 3rd to early 4th century C.E. Geneviève found some 23,000 to 24,000 coins in the first amphora (weighing a total of 83 pounds), and 18,000 to 19,000 in the second amphora (weighing a total of 110 pounds). Only three coins remained in the third vessel.

Researchers who found coins stuck to the outer face of one vessel realized that they had been added to the hoard before the pit was filled with sediment. The Mediomatrici settlement in which the vessels were found had been burned to the ground in the 4th century and rebuilt, only to be reduced to ashes again, and these artifacts were there before the fires. That can only mean that they had been there before the Romans conquered.

Because the reserves of coins were buried between 280 and 310 C.E., it is thought that they may be associated with the Roman military occupation at Senon—whether they belonged to Roman warriors or Mediomatrici, however, is unclear. The artifacts were buried at a time when urban growth began to trigger a shift in building practices and materials, and the living space, as a result, was made of limestone bricks (limestone was a plentiful resource in this part of France at the time). Rooms are separated by brick walls, with multiple pits that may have been latrines or spaces for storage. What they were actually used for will be determined by lab analysis.

It seems that Senon was heavily influenced by its Roman conquerors. Impressions on the coins appear stylistically Roman, and the ruins at the site reflect an affluent city with a public square, courtyards, temples, baths, and even a theater. Its inhabitants may have been artists or merchants. INRAP officials, therefore, do not think that there was a rush to bury these coins because of impending disaster. The fact that the tops of the amphorae were almost at ground level indicates that they were supposed to be easily accessible for deposits or withdrawals.

“Their exceptional nature lies less in the discovery of a large quantity of coins (some thirty coin hoards are known in the Meuse department alone) than in the possibility of documenting their depositional context so precisely,” Geneviève said, “which is rare.”

The African Early Pleistocene is a time of evolutionary change and techno-behavioral innovation in human prehistory that sees the advent of our own genus, Homo, from earlier australopithecine ancestors by 2.8-2.3 million years ago. This was followed by the origin and dispersal of Homo erectus sensu lato across Africa and Eurasia between ~ 2.0 and 1.1 Ma and the emergence of both large-brained (e.g., Bodo, Kabwe) and small-brained (e.g., H. naledi) lineages in the Middle Pleistocene of Africa. Here we present a newly reconstructed face of the DAN5/P1 cranium from Gona, Ethiopia (1.6-1.5 Ma) that, in conjunction with the cranial vault, is a mostly complete Early Pleistocene Homo cranium from the Horn of Africa. Morphometric analyses demonstrate a combination of H. erectus-like cranial traits and basal Homo-like facial and dental features combined with a small brain size in DAN5/P1. The presence of such a morphological mosaic contemporaneous with or postdating the emergence of the indisputable H. erectus craniodental complex around 1.6 Ma implies an intricate evolutionary transition from early Homo to H. erectus. This finding also supports a long persistence of small-brained, plesiomorphic Homo group(s) alongside other Homo groups that experienced continued encephalization through the Early to Middle Pleistocene of Africa.

The oldest fossils assigned to our genus are ~2.8 million years old (Myr) from Ethiopia and signal a long history of Homo evolution in the Rift Valley1,2,3. There is evidence of multiple Homo lineages in Africa by 2.0–1.9 million years ago (Ma) and an archaeological and paleontological record of expansion to more temperate habitats in the Caucasus and Asia between 2.0 and 1.8 Ma4 (Fig. 1). The last appearance datum for the more archaic Homo habilis species (or “1813 group”) is ~1.67 (OH 13) or ~1.44 Ma, if KNM-ER 42703 is correctly attributed to H. habilis5, which is uncertain6. The archetypal early African Homo erectus fossils from Kenya (i.e., KNM-ER 3733, 3883; and the adolescent KNM-WT 15000) already present a suite of traits that distinguish them from early Homo taxa by 1.6–1.5 Ma, including larger brains and bodies, smaller postcanine dentition, more pronounced cranial superstructures (e.g., projecting and tall brow ridges), a relatively wide midface and nasal aperture, deep palate, and projecting nasal bridge1,6,7,8,9,10,11. The only evidence for H. erectus sensu lato in Africa before 1.8 Ma are fragmentary or juvenile fossils12,13,14, while fossils expressing both ancestral H. habilis and more derived H. erectus s.l. morphological traits are only known from Dmanisi, Georgia at 1.77 Ma15,16. Thus, H. erectus emerged from basal Homo between 2.0 and 1.6 million years ago, but when, where (Africa or Eurasia), and how it occurred remain unclear. An expanded fossil record also documents significant variation in endocranial volume17,18 and craniofacial6,8 and dentognathic morphology19,20 throughout the Early Pleistocene, which extends to the Middle Pleistocene with the addition of small-brained Homo lineages to the human tree.

The solid bars of the timeline indicate well-established first and last appearance data; the horizontal stripes indicate possible extensions of the time range based on fragmentary or juvenile fossils. Diagonal lines signal earlier archaeological presence in those regions. The question mark indicates a possible date of <1.49 Ma for the Mojokerto, Indonesia site cf.22,23,24,25. The horizontal gray bar represents the time range associated with DAN5/P1. Colors on the map indicate presence of fossils matching taxa or geographic groups of H. erectus as indicated in the timeline.

All surface renderings visualized at FOV 0° (parallel). Map was generated in “rnaturalearth” package68 for R.

The initial announcement of DAN5/P1 assigned it to H. erectus on the basis of derived neurocranial traits21. Subsequent analyses of neurocranial shape and endocranial morphology confirmed affinity with H. erectus but also noted similarities to early (pre-erectus) Homo fossils such as KNM-ER 181317,18. Only limited information about the partial maxilla and dentition was presented in the original description21. Yet, facial and dental traits are increasingly important in early Homo systematics, given overlap in brain size among closely related hominins6,8,22. The DAN5/P1 fossil is a rare opportunity to evaluate neurocranial, facial, and dental anatomy in a single Early Pleistocene Homo fossil and thus has significant implications for this discussion.

Here we present a new cranial reconstruction of the 1.6–1.5 Myr DAN5/P1 fossil from Gona, Ethiopia. This study demonstrates that the small-brained adult DAN5/P1 fossil (598 cm3 21) presents a previously undocumented combination of early Homo and H. erectus features in an African fossil.

Physical and virtual reconstructions of the DAN5/P1 neurocranium were presented previously17,21. The face reconstruction, which is new, involves 3D surface models generated from micro-computerized tomographic (µ-CT) scans of the left and right maxillae (hemi-palates), left infraorbital fragment of the maxilla, left zygomatic fragment containing the frontal process, right P3, and left P4-M3 (the left P3 was recovered, but not µ-CT scanned) (Fig. 2a, b). The right P3 was originally misidentified as a right P4 21 (Supplementary Note 1). The preserved fragments of the face were joined together along sutures (e.g., left infraorbital and zygomatic) or postmortem breaks (e.g., left infraorbital and hemi-palate) and the teeth were positioned with reference to dental alveoli and interdental wear facets (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1). The reconstruction applied standard virtual reconstruction techniques (e.g., repositioning and reflection of elements and landmark-based superimposition23) to fit together the five bony fragments and five postcanine teeth. There were many anatomical constraints which limited the way in which these fragments could be assembled. For example, the frontal process of the infraorbital fragment must be oriented to articulate with the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture, but the fragment must also align with the contours implied by the maxilla (including the zygomatic root) with which it was originally continuous. Its final position must also accommodate the zygomatic bone along the zygomaxillary suture. Such considerations applied to each element. The face was then hafted onto the neurocranium to produce a largely complete cranium (Fig. 2e, f); an alternative reconstruction with a more posteriorly positioned face was also generated (Supplementary Fig. 2).

In lateral view, the face is gently sloping anteriorly from below the projecting supraorbital torus, with a concave “nasocanine contour” (sensu24) (Fig. 2f). Many face dimensions in DAN5/P1 overlap with early Homo and early H. erectus from Africa and Eurasia (Table 1), but the superior facial and nasal heights of DAN5/P1 are absolutely short compared to African H. erectus and similar to, e.g., OH 24 (H. habilis) and D4500 (Dmanisi H. erectus).

The supraorbital torus is vertically thick and projecting with a continuous post-toral sulcus; this morphology is typical of H. erectus. The height of the torus at mid-orbit is within the range of other small African fossils assigned to H. erectus (Supplementary Table 9). The strong arching of the torus contributes to the circular orbit. An arched torus is variably expressed in small-brained Homo fossils (e.g., KNM-ER 1813 and KNM-OL 45500; Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). The inferior orbital margin is sharp and the frontal process of the zygomatic faces more anteriorly than antero-laterally. The ratio of cheek height to facial length in DAN5/P1 is similar to both H. habilis and early H. erectus (Table 1). Its nearly vertical midface with weakly everted nasal margins resembles early Homo and D2700 more so than other H. erectus25 and differs from the more rounded form in KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-ER 3883 (Supplementary Fig. 3). The well-developed maxillary sulcus seen in DAN5/P1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a) is more common in H. erectus than early Homo. The position of the anterior border of the maxillary zygomatic process at the P3/P4 level in DAN5/P1 is more anterior than in adult H. erectus, but was described similarly for H. naledi26. The nasal aperture does not show the widening typical of African H. erectus (Table 1). Nasal breadth is similar in DAN5/P1 and the early Homo KNM-ER 1805 fossil, but DAN5/P1 has a shorter nasal height and taller alveolar clivus than KNM-ER 1805. The subnasal clivus transitions smoothly to the nasal floor with no spinal or lateral crests; cresting is common for most early Homo / H. erectus fossils as well as H. naledi, but low topography of the nasal sill is documented in the adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and the Dmanisi sample27,28. There is a blunt anterior nasal spine, with no indication of anterior projection as in H. naledi28, although this region could be damaged.

The palate is large relative to endocranial volume, which aligns DAN5/P1 with early Homo and basal H. erectus from Eurasia, rather than East African H. erectus (Table 1). The DAN5/P1 palate has parallel molar rows and the preserved anterior alveoli suggested vertically oriented incisor roots (Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, it does not resemble the long, narrow dental arcade implied by the reconstruction of the OH 7 H. habilis specimen6. Its palate depth is in the range of H. erectus and at the high end of variation for early Homo. The incisive canal opens well behind the central incisors, which is primitive for the genus Homo16.

The nasoalveolar clivus is moderately prognathic and the squared-off anterior maxilla has a stout, rounded canine jugum that forms the “corner” of the palate. The canine alveolus housed a short, conical canine root. While short canine roots are said to be a H. erectus feature8, root length is variable and not fully characterized in Pleistocene Homo. For example, both OH 65 (early Homo)29 and D2700 (early H. erectus) fossils have longer canine roots. The canine jugum does not contribute to the lateral nasal aperture as it does in the Dmanisi sample, H. floresiensis, some early Homo (e.g., OH 24), and some African H. erectus (KNM-ER 3733). The DAN5/P1 clivus projects slightly beyond the level of the canine jugum in lateral view, which is typical for early Homo and early H. erectus1. The maxillary flexion, maxillary sulcus, canine jugum, moderately prognathic subnasal clivus, and more anterior origin of the maxillary zygomatic process in DAN5/P1 differ from the condition described for ATE7-1, a Spanish fossil recently assigned to H. aff. erectus30. A thin crest extends superiorly from the jugum toward the zygomatic root and demarcates a deep, round fossa between the lateral body of the maxilla and the anterior zygomatic process (Supplementary Fig. 5b). A similar morphology was described for the early Homo fossil A.L. 666-11 and the fossa is also seen in some Dmanisi fossils. The maxillary sinus extends into the zygomatic process laterally and the frontal process of the maxilla superiorly and septa partition the sinus anteriorly. More detailed discussion of the maxillary sulcus and its relationship to surrounding features can be found in Supplementary Note 2 and comparisons of DAN5/P1 to less complete hominins are detailed in Supplementary Note 3.

Some description of the teeth was provided in the original announcement21. We also present additional description (Supplementary Note 1), photographs (Supplementary Fig. 6) and crown dimensions (Supplementary Table 8).

Analysis of cranial (face and vault) shape using 3D landmarks demonstrates a broadly archaic-to-modern trajectory of shape differences along Principal Component (PC) 1. Low-scoring early Homo have a relatively smaller vault and longer, more prognathic face and clivus and a transversely flatter cheek compared to more derived Homo species on PC 1 (Fig. 3). There is separation of H. erectus and H. floresiensis from other Homo species, particularly Middle Pleistocene Homo and H. habilis, on PC 2. The second PC reflects the characteristic long, low vault that is wide inferiorly in H. erectus (and H. floresiensis), combined with relatively tall orbits, vertically shorter face below the orbits, and a long palate with moderate alveolar prognathism. The third PC mostly reflects unique anatomy of Neanderthals. DAN5/P1 is within the H. erectus range of variation and plots close to the adolescent (KNM-WT 15000) and subadult (D2700) H. erectus fossils in the subspace of PCs 1 and 2 and close to D2700 on PC 3 as well. As a group, these three fossils score lower than other H. erectus fossils and overlap H. habilis on PC 1, implying a higher face to neurocranium ratio compared to KNM-ER 3733. DAN5/P1 is the nearest neighbor for several H. erectus fossils in full shape space and is itself most similar to the subadult H. erectus fossil KNM-WT 15000. Of the adult fossils, DAN5/P1 is closest to KNM-ER 1813 in full shape space. The DAN5/P1 alternative reconstruction yields substantially similar results, while our reconstruction of the less complete LES1 H. naledi fossil is aligned with early Homo (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8).

We observe good taxonomic resolution based on a separate analysis of the midface, with the strongest contrasts between “early Homo“ (e.g., H. habilis) and Neanderthals on PC 1 (Fig. 4). The majority of the early Homo and H. erectus fossils separate from each other along PC 1 and DAN5/P1 is within the early Homo range on this component. The one Indonesian and two Kenyan fossils assigned to H. erectus have higher PC 1 scores, while the D2700 fossil from Dmanisi is close to both H. habilis and geologically younger members of H. erectus. Low-scoring individuals like DAN5/P1 have transversely flat midfaces, an anterior origin of the zygomatic process, a more sloped subnasal clivus and a narrower, non-projecting nasal region. The face is shallower antero-posteriorly and the anterior palate is wider and more squared off. PC 2 serves to highlight unique aspects of the early modern human face, particularly compared to H. naledi. H. habilis, H. erectus, and DAN5/P1 have more intermediate scores. This third PC contrasts the more sloping face and shorter subnasal clivus of H. naledi compared to the taller and more upright face with a projecting nasal bridge of H. erectus, H. floresiensis and KNM-ER 1805 (an early Homo fossil of uncertain species attribution). DAN5 scores lower than all H. erectus on PC 3 and near to OH 24 and KNM-ER 1813 (both H. habilis). DAN5/P1 is closest in full shape space to KNM-ER 1813 (H. habilis), but also quite similar to OH 24, the subadult D2700, and the adolescent KNM-WT 15000. Further development of the face in the adolescent KNM-WT 15000 fossil would have made it more like KNM-ER 3733, placing it further from DAN5/P1 on PC 2 as an adult (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Fig. 8).

Morphological descriptions of individual teeth are provided in Supplementary Note 2. In this section, we report results of the following metric analyses: crown size analyses based on computed crown area, tooth size apportionment analyses (TSA) that examine the relative mesiodistal (MD) and buccolingual (BL) diameters within each tooth row and normalized Elliptic Fourier Analyses (EFA) of the crown contour of each postcanine tooth. The computed crown areas (MD × BL: Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 8) for the DAN5/P1 molars fit comfortably in the range of H. habilis. Both computed and measured crown base areas reveal that M3 is largest, followed by M1 in DAN5/P1 (Supplementary Table 8). DAN5/P1 does not display the M1 < M2 size sequence typical of H. habilis, but this morphology is shared with L894-1 and is not unique among our H. habilis sample. The molars, particularly the M1 and M3 are at the high end of variation for both African and Dmanisi early H. erectus (5). There is a clear trend for premolar size reduction from early Homo to H. erectus, but the premolars of DAN5/P1 are small even in comparison with early African, Georgian, and Indonesian H. erectus.

The TSA analysis for size-corrected MD and BL crown dimensions of P3‒M3 (Fig. 6a) and P4‒M3 (Supplementary Fig. 9) mostly discriminates between H. habilis and H. erectus, reflecting the proportionally small P3, relatively MD elongated and narrow P4, MD short M1, and large M3 in the former. DAN5/P1 and D4500 have the highest PC 1 scores, but also the most extreme PC 2 scores in the sample. DAN5/P1 differs from D4500 along PC 2 in having particularly narrow premolars bucco-lingually, whereas the M1 is proportionally smaller in D4500 (Fig. 6b). Overall, DAN5/P1, D4500, and H. naledi group with H. habilis, whereas one early Homo specimen, OH 65, and D2700 group with African and Indonesian H. erectus. A previous study also suggested that OH 65 shows affinities with H. erectus in dental arcade shape6, which may reflect large intra-specific variation.

Premolar crown contours differ between early Homo and Early Pleistocene H. erectus from East Africa and Indonesia. Namely, early Homo is characterized by MD long premolars, whereas H. erectus has MD short premolar crowns (PC 1), and DAN5/P1 clusters with the former in this respect (Fig. 7a, b). Molar crown contours tend to separate African and Indonesian samples, but do not effectively distinguish H. habilis from H. erectus in East Africa (Fig. 7c–e). Specifically, MD long (Africa) versus short (Indonesia) crown of M1 and M3 (PC 1), and rectangular (Indonesia) versus rhomboid (Africa) crown of M2 (PC 2) characterize the two regional samples, and DAN5/P1 always clusters with the African sample. The shape of the M3 in DAN5/P1 is most comparable to early Homo rather than H. erectus fossils from Africa. Taken together, DAN5/P1 shows affinities with early Homo, including H. habilis, in premolar and M3 crown shape; its M1 and M2 crown contours are not taxonomically informative.

The DAN5/P1 reconstruction from Gona, Ethiopia, is a complete Early Pleistocene Homo cranium from northeast Africa (only the sixth from Africa; Fig. 1) and provides a high level of detail regarding midface morphology. DAN5/P1 is, to our knowledge, the first African fossil to exhibit a mixture of H. erectus and early Homo features. Some facial and possibly dental traits in DAN5/P1 appear to be derived for H. erectus sensu lato (e.g., deep palate, maxillary sulcus, projecting brow ridge, canine jugum, small premolars), corroborating previous work from the neurocranium (see also refs. 17,21) (Supplementary Table 10). Yet, the DAN5/P1 fossil, like the Dmanisi sample, blurs the boundaries between early Homo taxa (particularly “classic” H. habilis) and H. erectus. DAN5/P1 overlaps H. habilis and early Georgian H. erectus with regard to endocranial volume17,18, relative palate size, and dental dimensions (Figs. 2–4). For example, the M1 and M3 areas of DAN5/P1 are within the range of early Homo and early H. erectus from the Eurasian site of Dmanisi, but among the largest or exceed the values in African H. erectus (Fig. 5). Aspects of facial architecture, including the transversely flat infraorbital region, non-projecting nasal region, and anterior origin of the zygomatic process, are plesiomorphic in DAN5/P1 compared to contemporaneous H. erectus fossils from Kenya, confirmed by direct superimposition of the DAN5/P1 and KNM-ER 3733 faces (Supplementary Fig. 10). Altogether, this suggests that DAN5/P1 better reflects the basal African H. erectus morphology than the archetypal and roughly contemporaneous Kenyan H. erectus fossils (Supplementary Table 11), such as KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-WT 15000.

The evolutionary contrasts in brain size and face morphology embodied by the broadly contemporaneous DAN5/P1 and Kenyan fossils, KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-WT 15000 (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11) imply complex population structure rather than simple coexistence of two different lineages in the African Early Pleistocene. It is likely that the contrasts documented here signal between-population variation (assuming a single H. erectus species) in eastern Africa at 1.6–1.5 Ma. This view is consistent with previous depictions of H. erectus as a polytypic species across its temporo-spatial range9,31,32. The unique rift basin landscape of the East African Rift System, alongside the potential low population density of early Pleistocene hominins, could lead to population separation between the Horn of Africa and Lake Turkana lineages33,34. In this scenario, the Horn of Africa group retained the more archaic morphology of the population dispersing from Africa ~1.9 Ma, whereas the Kenyan group underwent greater in situ evolution. The more fragmentary Ethiopian H. erectus record may support this north-south division, but the larger-brained BSN/P1 H. erectus fossils from younger deposits at Gona (1.26 Ma) implies subsequent population replacement or in situ evolution (Supplementary Discussion). Other interpretations are, of course, possible. For example, an expanded fossil record could reveal high within-population variation (but see ref. 35 or interbreeding could result in the mosaic of ancestral and more derived features (Supplementary Discussion).

Assuming that the ages for DAN5/P1 (1.6–1.5 Ma), KNM-ER 3733 (~1.6 Ma), and OH 13 (H. habilis; ~1.67 Ma) are correct, the nearly complete adult cranium of DAN5/P1 not only supports the late survival of basal Homo facial and dental morphologies but also highlights the piecemeal nature of H. erectus craniodental evolution. Limitations on dating precision do not entirely preclude a chronology where DAN5/P1 is geologically older than KNM-ER 3733 (Supplementary Discussion). While this can be accommodated within the evolutionary scenario described above, it could also signal rapid anagenetic evolution between the Gona and Koobi Fora populations. DAN5/P1 also presents similarities to the Middle Pleistocene H. naledi species, including a small brain, flat nasal region, anterior origin of the zygomatic process and distinct occipital protuberance (Figs. 3 and S4f) despite its larger cheek teeth (Fig. 5a). These resemblances are interesting, but insufficient to support a specific evolutionary connection between these geographically and temporally distant groups. Nevertheless, DAN5/P1 confirms the presence of small-brained Homo fossils in Africa during the Early to Middle Pleistocene14,32,36,37,38, and future research should clarify the evolutionary importance of the resemblances between DAN5/P1 and H. naledi.

The Gona evidence, along with that from Dmanisi, hints that key behavioral/technological innovations may precede major morphological transformations. Diverse lines of evidence point to a broadened dietary range and access to animal resources at both Gona21 and Dmanisi39,40. Moreover, both Mode 1 (simple cores and flakes) and Mode 2 (Acheulean) stone tools are documented at DAN521. Yet, the endocranial volume of DAN5/P1 and the Dmanisi fossils show minimal expansion over early Homo18 and both DAN5/P1 and D4500 have large molars, including unreduced M3s41 (Fig. 6), and similar scaling of face to neurocranium as in early Homo (Fig. 2). While acknowledging high error associated with body mass estimates from cranial variables42, the relationship between orbital dimensions and body mass in hominoids suggests that DAN5/P1 was smaller than well-known contemporaries from Kenya—KNM-ER 3733 and 3883 and KNM-WT 15000—and more similar to adults from Dmanisi (Supplementary Fig. S11). The fossil pelvis BSN49/P27 also confirms the presence of a small-bodied hominin at Gona 400-700 thousand years after DAN5/P143,44. Although speculative, this pattern implies a dissociation between some morphological changes traditionally associated with H. erectus, and the shift to higher quality foods in the diet and initial appearance of Acheulean technology.

The DAN5/P1 fossil confirms that the emergence of H. erectus was not a simple story. The DAN5 site documents hominins with a combination of ancestral and more derived craniofacial/dental features who made both Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools21. The current study also adds data to the ongoing debate about the birthplace of H. erectus. Although some researchers suggest a Eurasian origin because of the earlier occurrence of H. erectus-like cranial features in Georgia45, the basal H. erectus morphology in DAN5/P1 is compatible with local evolution of H. erectus in East Africa.

Data were collected from the DAN5/P1 specimen (from the original micro-CT scans and two virtual reconstructions built from the surface renderings based on the same scan data). The cranial fragments and teeth of DAN5/P1 were µCT-scanned by T. Sasaki (Kyoto University Museum) at the National Museum of Ethiopia in 2015 on a SkyScan 1173 benchtop scanner at 100 kV and 31–63 mA with a rotation step of 0.4–0.6. The final resolution was 140 μm/pixel. Surface renderings of the cranial pieces and individual teeth were generated from the µCT scans in Avizo 3D 2021.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; hereafter “Avizo”). In addition to the virtual reconstruction of DAN5/P1 described here, the hominin sample for the comparative analyses included fossils assigned to early Homo, H. erectus sensu lato from Africa and Eurasia (including a virtual reconstruction of KNM-ER 3733, Supplementary Fig. 12), Middle Pleistocene species (including a virtual reconstruction of the small-brained H. naledi LES1, Supplementary Fig. 12, and H. floresiensis), and early H. sapiens (modern humans) (Supplementary Tables 1–3). The comparative sample of Pleistocene hominins included original fossils, virtual reconstructions and research quality casts (Supplementary Tables 1–3; Supplementary Fig. 2), including scan data from the Georgian National Museum, Kenya National Museums, American Museum of Natural History and Ethiopian National Museum.

All individuals were adult with the exception of two subadult specimens—the early adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and the older adolescent D270016—included to expand the small early H. erectus sample. The Indonesian H. erectus sample is from Sangiran, Java, which we divide into two chronological subsamples, “Sangiran Lower” and “Sangiran Upper,” given the demonstrated differences in their tooth crown size and cranio-dental morphology22,46. We exclude KNM-ER 42703 from the East African dental sample because of the severe tooth wear as well as taxonomic uncertainty of this specimen6. Taxonomic status for OH 65 is uncertain6, but we include it in H. habilis as originally proposed29. The late Middle Pleistocene H. naledi from South Africa and H. floresiensis from Indonesia are included because of their small brain size and suggested affinities with both H. habilis and H. erectus47,48.

Standard virtual reconstruction techniques were applied to the DAN5/P1 face and cranial reconstruction as reviewed by ref. 23. This involved reflecting missing elements from one side to the other, superimposition of mirrored elements, and repositioning of elements. The following Geomagic Wrap 2024.3.1 (Oqton; hereafter “Geomagic”) tools were utilized: “Duplicate,” “Mirror,” “Manual Registration” for initial superimposition with additional refinement using ‘Global Registration' or manual repositioning using “Object Mover.”

The matrix cementing the left zygomatic root fragment to the palate on that side21 was manually segmented and removed in Avizo, isolating the two pieces, but also revealing a small fragment that was displaced medially and anteriorly. This was also segmented out separately. Subsequent steps were performed in Geomagic. The right hemipalate was duplicated, mirrored, and aligned with the left palate based on the hard palate contours and dental alveoli (I1, I2, P3, and P4) (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Next, the left zygomatic root was superimposed onto the mirrored right side using local anatomical features (e.g., the vertical crest extended from the canine alveolus, the depression immediately posterior to this crest, the P3 buccal alveolus, and the anterior root of the zygomatic process; Supplementary Fig. 5). The alveolar bone that intervenes between neighboring teeth from the canine to M1 is preserved on the neighboring regions of the palate and zygomatic root, respectively, further confirming the anatomical validity of this repositioning (Supplementary Fig. 1). The small fragment of displaced bone was re-positioned by sliding it posteriorly and laterally to align with the broken edge of the zygomatic root fragment (green in Supplementary Fig. 1).

The right and left hemi-palates were then aligned along the median plane to produce a smooth contour of the subnasal clivus and roof of the palate. Both hemi-palates were duplicated and reflected across the midline to produce a more complete palate, into which the left P4 and M1 were positioned based on congruence of the roots and dental alveoli (Fig. 2). The P3 crown and complete M2 and M3 were added to the model based on alignment of corresponding interproximal wear facets and root orientation. The left infraorbital fragment of the maxilla was aligned with the superior border of the left zygomatic process, and the zygomatic fragment was further joined to this piece along the zygomaxillary suture (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). The left infraorbital and zygomatic pieces and all teeth were duplicated and reflected across the midline to create a maximally complete surface (Supplementary Fig. 2a–f).

The face was hafted to the cranial vault by aligning the preserved lateral orbital wall across the frontozygomatic suture (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) on the left and refined by maintaining continuity between the frontal process of the maxilla and the root of the nose and ensuring a reasonable orientation of the occlusal plane. The position of the face is broadly consistent with the expected orthogonal relationship of the posterior maxillary plane and neutral horizontal axis of the orbit (based on the estimated position of the junction of anterior and middle cranial fossae). The final reconstruction yields a mostly complete nasal aperture, orbital margin, infraorbital region, anterior palate, and dental arcade.

Anatomical features constrained many aspects of the reconstruction. While some virtual reconstructions produce multiple reconstructions to account for uncertainty, the complex topography of the fossil fragments constrains their positioning along multiple axes, limiting alternative arrangements that can satisfy well-established anatomical relationships. For example, the incisive canal is preserved on the medial surface of both hemipalates. This confirms good preservation of the median plane on both sides. The intermaxillary suture on the subnasal clivus is also clearly visible on the right and left fragments, where the bone rises to a gentle ridge on either side, further constraining the position of the right and left sides of the palate. As noted above, the left maxillary zygomatic root fragment was initially aligned using the mirrored right side as a guide, but the correct alignment of the canine and premolar alveoli, which are preserved on both the hemipalate and zygomatic root fragment, provides further validation (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c).

Similar considerations were used in the final positioning of the infraorbital fragment (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The medial border preserves the lateral nasal aperture, which should align in the same sagittal plane as the inferior lateral nasal wall preserved more posteriorly on the left hemipalate. The small fragment of the lateral nasal aperture preserved on the right maxilla further dictated the medio-lateral position of the infraorbital fragment. The angulation of this piece in the sagittal plane was determined by the requirement that it meet the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture superiorly and be superimposed with the mirrored right inferior nasal aperture inferiorly. There is a narrow projection of bone on the inferior border of the infraorbital fragment that appears to fit between the left hemipalate and zygomatic root fragment. We propose that this confirms that there is a natural join between the infraorbital fragment and the hemipalate/zygomatic root inferiorly. The current reconstruction produces a smooth contour from the infraorbital fragment to the subnasal contour, whereas other alignments would require flexion from the infraorbital plane to the subnasal clivus inferiorly.

Finally, the lateral positioning of the zygomatic fragment was limited by the presence of the orbital portion of the frontal bone, which articulates with the zygomatic bone on the lateral orbit wall. Simultaneously, its medial positioning was limited by the presence of the maxilla with which it also forms an articulation (zygomaxillary suture). This latter articulation also proscribes how anterior or lateral facing the zygomatic fragment can be as it must align with this suture. Moreover, the zygomatic bone preserves the orbital surface, which must be at the same vertical level as the orbital surface of the maxilla more medially. Additionally, the degree to which the zygomatic fragment is ‘hinged' along the relatively straight zygomaxillary suture is constrained by the requirements that the frontal process aligns with the course of the lateral supraorbital torus, while the frontal process of the maxilla must be oriented to intersect with the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture.

The biggest source of uncertainty in the current reconstruction is the hafting of the face on the vault, which we addressed with an alternative reconstruction (see next section). Smaller uncertainties are associated with the relative orientation of the left and right palate and the placement of M2 and M3, which are less constrained than the P3-M1 positions (limitations are also addressed in Supplementary Discussion).

We present an alternative reconstruction for DAN5/P1 that positions the face more posteriorly with respect to the neurocranium (Supplementary Fig. 2i). In order to match the corresponding surfaces of the lateral orbit wall on the face and vault, the face was also shifted slightly inferiorly. The overall impression is not very different, but the vertical face height is greater and less prognathic overall, with a taller orbit and deeper nasal root, and the supraorbital torus projects farther forward ahead of the inferior orbit. Further posterior shifting of the face requires additional downward movement to prevent the frontal and zygomatic bones from overlapping in the lateral orbit, which produces a disproportionately tall orbit that seems unlikely. Even in the original reconstruction, the orbital index (height/breadth) of 0.92 is equal to the highest values reported for H. erectus and early Homo, and a further inferior shift of the face would increase orbit height and create an unusual orbit shape. We re-ran the cranial principal component analysis (PCA) using the alternative reconstruction. The alternative reconstruction did not change the part of the face included in the midface topography analysis.

Taphonomic distortion in the KNM-ER 3733 fossil was corrected by first performing a retrodeformation via the procedure described by ref. 49 in the R statistical environment v. 4.5.050 and then manually repositioning the left zygomatic bone to reduce the gap between the zygomatic and frontal bones at the fronto-zygomatic suture in Geomagic (Supplementary Fig. 12a–f). The surface renderings were generated from CT scans provided by the Department of Earth Sciences, National Museums of Kenya. We used a virtual reconstruction of KNM-WT 1500051 that corrected previously described asymmetry of the face and misalignment of the face and vault. The LES1 (H. naledi) cranium is not fully reconstructed physically, but scans of the calvaria, left temporal/occipital piece, maxilla, and nasals provided by J. Martin, and a small piece of the anterior left temporal bone from the Morphosource calvaria scan (Morphosource ID: 000084599; ark:/87602/m4/M84599) were articulated and mirrored across the midline. The nasals were articulated with the frontal and then duplicated and mirrored across the midline. The maxilla articulated with the nasal bones after a small superolateral rotation of the infraorbital piece. The right inferior nasal border and infraorbital region were then duplicated and mirrored to the right side, completing the reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 12g–l).

Early Homo fossils are rare and poorly preserved, including the original KNM-ER 1470 and OH 24 fossils from Koobi Fora, Kenya, and Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, respectively. Right posterior vault and cranial base landmarks (e.g., asterion and postglenoid process) were reflected from the better-preserved left side in KNM-ER 1470 to avoid the more distorted right side. We used thin-plate spline (TPS) to estimate the position of landmarks in the regions affected by crushing of the superior vault in OH 24 (bregma, coronale, and opisthion). These “solutions” to the problem of taphonomic damage are imperfect, but the benefits of including rare African early Pleistocene fossils outweigh the disadvantages.

Linear dimensions were acquired from the 3D model of the DAN5/P1 cranial reconstruction in Geomagic and used to generate shape ratios scaled by endocranial volume or superior face length (Table 1).

Three-dimensional (3D) landmarks for the cranial analysis (Supplementary Table 4) and both landmarks and semilandmarks for the midface topography analysis (Supplementary Table 5) were collected from original fossils or casts of Pleistocene Homo fossils (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Data 1). The cranial landmarks were primarily acquired using a Microscribe 3D or Microscribe MX 3D digitizer and from surface renderings generated from CT, µCT, or surface scan data in a smaller number of cases, including the 3D model of the DAN5/P1 cranial reconstruction, using Avizo. All data for the midface analysis were collected from surface renderings in Landmark Editor52. After imputing missing landmark data (see below), the curve and surface semilandmarks were slid by minimizing the bending energy of a TPS deformation between each specimen and the sample mean shape (separately for the cranial and mid-face datasets). After sliding, all landmarks and semilandmarks were symmetrized and converted to shape variables using generalized Procrustes analysis for each dataset independently.

This was followed by principal components analysis of the superimposed cranial landmarks (41 total) or midface landmark/semlandmarks (12 and 81 total, respectively). We present PC ordinations overlaid with nearest neighbor connections calculated in full shape space. For the midface analysis, the KNM-ER 1805 fossil was projected onto the PC axes calculated from the remainder of the sample, as it suffered some taphonomic damage. Loadings on PCs were used to “warp” the surface of the DAN5/P1 surface rendering to visualize shape change in the cranium and midface analyses. Landmark and semilandmark data were processed and analyzed in RStudio v. 1.4.171753 primarily using “Morpho” v. 2.1254 and “geomorph” v. 4.0.1055,56 packages for R ordinations were produced with “ggplot2” v. 4.0.057.

Landmark estimation was considered on a case-by-case basis and tailored solutions were used in some cases (discussed below). Otherwise, landmarks were estimated using standard protocols58. Missing bilateral landmarks and semilandmarks were estimated by mirroring the preserved side (reflected relabeling) in the “Morpho” package for R. Missing landmarks and semilandmarks lacking a bilateral counterpart were estimated by deforming the sample average onto the deficient configuration using TPS interpolation in the “geomorph” package for R (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). In the cranial analysis, the TPS procedure was performed for the H. sapiens and non-H. sapiens (i.e., archaic) samples separately. In addition, four landmarks were included in the cranial TPS procedure to improve these estimates (frontomalaretemporale, parietal notch, canine-P3 interdental, M1–M2 interdental) but dropped before GPA and subsequent cranial shape analyses. Five or fewer unique landmarks were estimated for any one fossil in the cranial analyses. The average percentage of missing data was 6.9% (s.d. 2.8%) for the cranial analysis and 8.2% (s.d. 10.1%) for the midface analysis (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Some minimal landmark estimation was deemed necessary to fully capture the face shape of DAN5/P1 in the cranial analysis. The nasoalveolar clivus and anterior palate of DAN5/P1 was superimposed with a surface model of the A.L. 666-1 maxilla, which was better preserved anteriorly, to establish the likely position of alveolare (Supplementary Fig. 2f). A small segment of well-preserved buccal alveolar bone between the P4 and M1 was isolated and repositioned between M2 and M3 to acquire the M2-M3 inter-dental landmark (Supplementary Fig. 2h). A second paired landmark, zygomaxillare inferior, captures the transverse orientation of the cheek in this fossil. The landmark was imputed using the TPS method based on reference to the rest of the non-H. sapiens cranial sample and its reasonableness was validated by comparison to the surface model of the face reconstruction. A similar approach of reconstructing alveolar bone for recording inter-dental landmarks was applied to the KNM-ER 3733 virtual reconstruction described previously. Likewise, a local alignment of the naseoalveolar clivus and anterior palate of OH 24 and A.L. 666-1 was used to establish the position of prosthion for the former.

With regard to the cranial analysis, LES1 is the most complete cranium available for H. naledi, which is of special interest given its similarly small endocranial volume and previously noted similarity to early Homo and H. erectus. However, the LES1 reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 12g–l) would require TPS estimation of six unique landmarks, including all midline landmarks from the posterior neurocranium (opisthion, inion and lambda), which does not meet the criterion for inclusion in Fig. 2. The DH1 (H. naledi) vault, which was similar in morphology to LES1, was used to estimate the position of these midline points (Fig. S12k, l) in LES1 and the landmark configuration was projected onto the previously calculated axes from Fig. 3 and presented below.

For the midface analysis, two fossils require special mention. KNM-ER 3733 is the sole adult African H. erectus with a reasonably complete facial skeleton and LES1 is the only H. naledi with a preserved face. However, the face is damaged and requires estimation of a number of landmarks and semilandmarks in both cases (Supplementary Table 7). The nature of damage in KNM-ER 3733 allows for primarily interpolation among existing regions, but it remains the case that some error is introduced during the missing data estimation. For LES1, most missing data was located on the lateral maxilla and frontal process of the zygomatic. However, the FMT and FMO landmarks were present on the frontal bone and helped to anchor the height and breadth of the upper face. We performed a direct comparison of the DAN5/P1 and KNM-ER 3733 surfaces after scaling the latter to 86% of its original size (based on centroid size from the mid-face analysis) to validate topographic differences.

The young adolescent KNM-WT 15000 would have undergone additional facial development given its un-erupted third molars, based on analogy with extant hominoids59. We computed linear regressions of the Procrustes shape coordinates on the natural logarithm of centroid size in ontogenetic samples of Pan troglodytes (n = 12) and recent H. sapiens (n = 81) using the “RRPP” package v. 2.1.060,61 for R. We then used these two regressions to predict the adult shape of KNM-WT15000 by “growing” the fossil along each trajectory to the mean size of an adult chimp and human, respectively (developmental simulation62). This assumes a similar pattern of face development in H. erectus and either P. troglodytes or H. sapiens. The midface topography analysis was re-run with the estimated adult face shape of KNM-WT 15000.

Body mass was estimated in DAN5/P1, LB1, KNM-WT 15000, D4500, D3444, and D2700 based on the published least square regression equations based on hominoid data for orbital height and orbital area (height × breadth) as outlined in ref. 63. These were among the most reliable predictors among the cranial dimensions evaluated in that study. This was combined with estimates for other fossil hominins from the same ref. 63 and plotted alongside body mass estimates from supero-inferior femoral head diameter (or the equivalent acetabular diameter) presented in ref. 64 for additional context.

Dental measurements of DAN5/P1 were based on 3D surface models produced from the CT scan (Supplementary Data 1). Prior to measurement, slight distortion of the glued connections in the right P3 crown had been virtually restored using Avizo 3D 2021.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MD and BL diameters of the teeth of DAN5/P1 were obtained using MeshLab 2022.02, while the same measurements for the comparative specimens were collected using a digital caliper (Mitsutoyo Inc.) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. PCA of size-adjusted MD and BL diameters of the P3‒M3 or P4‒M3 crowns was used to investigate the “TSA” in the tooth row. The size-adjustment of the variables was done by dividing each measurement by the geometric mean of all the dimensions considered (MDs and BLs for P3‒M3 or P4‒M3). This method follows the previous study65 but differs from that study in that, for PCA, we use variance-covariance matrix rather than correlation matrix for the already size-adjusted variables. Visualization of TSA for DAN5/P1 and D4500 in the subspace of PCs 1 and 2 was calculated by first scaling the PC 1 and 2 eigenvectors by the PC 1 and 2 scores for DAN5/P1 and D4500, respectively; line thickness in Fig. 6b is then proportional to the sum of the scaled eigenvectors for each fossil.

Occlusal crown contours of maxillary premolars and molars were analyzed by normalized (i.e., size-standardized) EFA. Crown contours of DAN5/P1 were extracted from their 3D surface models as viewed from infinite distance, using Avizo and Geomagic. Those for the comparative specimens were taken from standardized photographs of high-quality plaster casts. A 100 mm macro lens was used for the photography to minimize parallax effect as detailed elsewhere66. In cases where interproximal wear on a tooth was minimal and the original occlusal contour could be assessed confidently with reference to the surrounding unworn enamel, we manually reconstructed the contour. The contours were taken from the better-preserved side. Comparisons were made on the images from the right teeth or horizontally flipped images of the left teeth. The crown contour of each tooth was captured with a tooth placed so that its cervical line is horizontal (whenever a marked enamel extension was present, it was not taken into account to orientate the cervical reference plane). To compute normalized elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs), each premolar crown was aligned along the long axis of its first ellipse, and each molar crown was aligned along its MD axis. EFDs and PCAs of the normalized EFDs were conducted using the software SHAPE v. 1.367.

The DAN5/P1 fossils are curated at the National Museum of Ethiopia (accession code: DAN5/P1). The original surface renderings and 3D reconstruction of DAN5/P1 generated for this study are available under restricted access because additional permission must be obtained from the National Museum of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Heritage Authority (EHA, formerly ARRCH); data requests should be addressed to K.L.B., S.S., and M.J.R. (emails in Supplementary Note 5). Likewise, virtual reconstructions of KNM-ER 3733 generated for the current study and KNM-WT 15000 (published previously) are available by request from K.L.B. after receiving a data user agreement from the National Museums of Kenya. The virtual reconstruction of LES1 generated for the current study is available by request to K.L.B. after receiving permission from University of Witwatersrand. Scan data for other fossil hominins typically requires a data sharing agreement with the institution curating the original (or cast) of that fossil (listed in Supplementary Tables 1–3).

Survey results suggest that peer reviewers are increasingly turning to AI.Credit: Panther Media Global/Alamy

More than 50% of researchers have used artificial intelligence while peer reviewing manuscripts, according to a survey of some 1,600 academics across 111 countries by the publishing company Frontiers.

Nearly one-quarter of respondents said that they had increased their use of AI for peer review over the past year. The findings, posted on 11 December by the publisher, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, confirm what many researchers have long suspected, given the ubiquity of tools powered by large-language models such as ChatGPT.

“It's good to confront the reality that people are using AI in peer-review tasks,” says Elena Vicario, Frontiers' director of research integrity. But the poll suggests that researchers are using AI in peer review “in contrast with a lot of external recommendations of not uploading manuscripts to third-party tools”, she adds.

Source: Unlocking AI's untapped potential, Frontiers

Some publishers, including Frontiers, allow limited use of AI in peer review, but require reviewers to disclose it. Like most other publishers, Frontiers forbids reviewers from uploading unpublished manuscripts to chatbot websites because of concerns about confidentiality, sensitive data and compromising authors' intellectual property. 

The survey report calls on publishers to respond to the growing use of AI across scientific publishing and implement policies that are better suited to the ‘new reality'. Frontiers itself has launched an in-house AI platform for peer reviewers across all of its journals. “AI should be used in peer review responsibly, with very clear guides, with human accountability and with the right training,” says Vicario.

“We agree that publishers can and should proactively and robustly communicate best practices, particularly disclosure requirements that reinforce transparency to support responsible AI use,” says a spokesperson for the publisher Wiley, which is based in Hoboken, New Jersey. In a similar survey published earlier this year, Wiley found that “researchers have relatively low interest and confidence in AI use cases for peer review,” they add. “We are not seeing anything in our portfolio that contradicts this.”

The Frontiers' survey found that, among the respondents who use AI in peer review, 59% use it to help write their peer-review reports. Twenty-nine per cent said they use it to summarize the manuscript, identify gaps or check references. And 28% use AI to flag potential signs of misconduct, such as plagiarism and image duplication (see ‘AI assistance').

Mohammad Hosseini, who studies research ethics and integrity at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, says the survey is “a good attempt to gauge the acceptability of the use of AI in peer review and the prevalence of its use in different contexts”.

AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried

AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried

Some researchers are running their own tests to determine how well AI models support peer review. Last month, engineering scientist Mim Rahimi at the University of Houston in Texas designed an experiment to test whether the large language model (LLM) GPT-5 could review a Nature Communications paper1 he co-authored.

He used four different set-ups, from entering basic prompts asking the LLM to review the paper without additional context to providing it with research articles from the literature to help it to evaluate his paper's novelty and rigour. Rahimi then compared the AI-generated output with the actual peer-review reports that he had received from the journal, and discussed his findings in a YouTube video.

His experiment showed that GPT-5 could mimic the structure of a peer-review report and use polished language, but that it failed to produce constructive feedback and made factual errors. Even advanced prompts did not improve the AI's performance — in fact, the most complex set-up generated the weakest peer review. Another study found that AI-generated reviews of 20 manuscripts tended to match human ones but fell short on providing detailed critique.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","New Head of Trump's Cancer Panel Speculated About Links Between Vaccines and Cancer","https://www.wired.com/story/risch-trump-panel-vaccines-turbo-cancer-ivermectin-hcq/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:17:00 GMT","

An epidemiologist who has speculated about whether there is a connection between Covid-19 vaccines and “turbo cancer” in young people, and works as chief epidemiologist at a company that sells ivermectin alongside reviews that claim it has efficacy as a cancer treatment, has been appointed by president Donald Trump to a key position overseeing the National Cancer Program.

Harvey Risch, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, announced his appointment as chair of the President's Cancer Panel on X earlier this month. Risch's profile page on the Yale website has also been updated to read, “In November 2025, President Trump appointed Dr. Risch to Chair the President's Cancer panel.”

No formal announcement was made by the president or the White House, and the Cancer Panel website's list of current members does not include Risch. The White House, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Cancer Panel, and Risch did not respond to requests for comment.

In his new position, Risch will oversee a group which is assigned to monitor “the development and execution of the activities of the National Cancer Program and report to the President on progress, efficacy, and opportunities for improvement,” according to the Cancer Panel's website.

As well as lending credibility to unproven treatments for Covid-19 like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin—he promoted the former in congressional testimony—Risch has more recently wondered whether the Covid-19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer” in some people. Now experts are worried that he could derail critical research into the causes and treatments for cancer.

“Having him on the panel charged with monitoring the progress of efforts to improve cancer treatment and providing recommendations to the president is a disaster for cancer patients, as he will inject conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and false claims about cancer into the panel's reports,” alleges David Gorski, a surgical oncologist.

Another expert, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they're afraid of retribution for speaking out about a Trump appointee, warned that they are concerned his conspiracy-adjacent beliefs might bleed into the National Cancer Program, a longstanding effort to coordinate the funding of critical cancer research and training.

“I am genuinely concerned that we are going to see ivermectin for cancer promoted at the federal level,” the doctor, who closely tracks the spread of medical disinformation, tells WIRED.

Risch is just the latest in a litany of controversial or unqualified figures who have been appointed to key public health positions in the federal government in Trump's second term in office, including the appointments of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and former daytime talk show host Dr. Memhet Oz being appointed to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Trump has also nominated Casey Means to be surgeon general despite the fact she does not currently have a licence to practice medicine. Kennedy, meanwhile, has filled his vaccine advisory committee with doctors who have promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.

Risch was among a cohort of medical professionals who embraced the use of alternative treatments for Covid-19 during the global pandemic in 2020. He was an early proponent of hydroxychloroquine, relying on questionable data to back up his claims.

At the time, his Yale colleagues publicly criticized his efforts. “As his colleagues, we defend the right of Dr. Risch, a respected cancer epidemiologist, to voice his opinions,” they wrote in a public letter. “But he is not an expert in infectious disease epidemiology and he has not been swayed by the body of scientific evidence from rigorously conducted clinical trials, which refute the plausibility of his belief and arguments.”

Despite—or perhaps because of—this, Risch became a fixture on right-wing media outlets during the pandemic, including appearances on Fox News and Steve Bannon's War Room podcast. A 2022 House Select Committee report also revealed that Risch was in direct contact with people adjacent to the Trump administration about the use of hydroxychloroquine.

Aside from his position at Yale, Risch is also the chief epidemiologist for The Wellness Company, a MAGA-aligned alternative health organization that sells supplements as well as hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and a treatment that has been advocated for as a Covid vaccine “detox.” While the website does not advertise ivermectin as a cancer treatment, the reviews of the products clearly show that customers are using it as a way to treat their cancer. The Wellness Company did not respond to requests for comments.

In 2023, Risch speculated about whether there is a link between the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine and so-called “turbo cancers.” This echoed claims that anti-vaccine activists online had been promoting for years, suggesting without evidence that the vaccines could cause more aggressive forms of cancer.

“The most serious errors in his beliefs are in regards to ‘turbo cancer,'” says Frank Han, a pediatric subspecialist at the Heart Center at Connecticut Children's Medical Center. “This is so fundamentally against basic principles of oncology and epidemiology that it is hard to believe someone professionally trained in epidemiology would make this mistake.”

Risch's speculation is in direct opposition to the advice dispensed by the National Cancer Institute. “There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” the NCI website reads. “Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines do not change your DNA.”

In fact, the NCI says that cancer patients tend to be older, have weakened immune systems, and other comorbidities, which “are all reasons for them to get vaccinated.”

Risch, if his appointment is confirmed, will replace Elizabeth Jaffee, a pancreatic cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University whose term as the panel's chair ended in March. “There typically is turnover with a new administration,“ Jaffee, who has been critical of the Trump administration's cuts to funding for cancer research, tells WIRED. “My term was toward the end at that point.”

The panel currently has two other members, Mitchel Berger, a neurosurgeon, and Carol Brown, gynecologic cancer surgeon. Neither responded to requests for comment.

Three U.S. senators have launched an investigation into whether tech giants, driven by soaring AI energy demands, are raising residential power bills. Separately, Amazon released a white paper Tuesday stating that its data centers are not the problem, and that in some regions it actually pays more than required for energy use.

The Democratic senators sent letters to Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and three data center firms, according to the New York Times. The lawmakers raised concerns that energy demand driven by artificial intelligence was forcing utilities to deploy new power plants and upgrade the grid — with local ratepayers helping foot the bill.  

“We write in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. data centers' energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities,” the senators said, according to the Times.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut issued the letters. 

Amazon offered a much different take in an analysis that examined the potential benefits, costs and risks that large energy loads created by data centers have on electric utilities.

The Amazon-funded study found that in some locations, the power bills currently being paid by the company more than cover the utility impacts. A typical 100 megawatt data center was estimated to pay an additional $3.4 million beyond the costs associated with its electricity use, which also include a utility's infrastructure upgrades, deployment of new energy generation, operations and maintenance.

Utilities can use that surplus “to reduce rates for other ratepayers, but how this potential benefit is realized will differ across jurisdictions,” the study stated. 

The assessment examined Amazon data center campuses in Oregon, California and Mississippi and was performed by E3, an independent economic consulting firm.

The white paper said the benefit to the utilities and other customers should continue into 2030, but noted that utilities will need to adjust their rates in the future to ensure that ratepayers are not subsidizing tech operations.

“To continue to prevent cross-subsidization, utilities must keep pace and leverage the full range of tools available to them to mitigate these risks…” the document states. 

The rapid growth of the sector is central to the debate. A Department of Energy report projected that data center energy use, which was more than 4% of U.S. electricity consumption in 2023, could triple by 2028. This forecast is fueled by tech giants' expanding investment: Microsoft and Amazon each reported nearly $35 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter, much of it on data center infrastructure.

The tech giants are also investing globally in new wind and solar power and energy storage, while pursuing more costly power sources including nuclear.

In October, a group of U.S. representatives raised similar concerns to the senators', asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Edison Electric Institute and the Data Center Coalition for information regarding data center impacts on residential power bills “to help ensure everyday Americans and small businesses aren't bearing the brunt of data center energy costs.”

Washington representatives Kim Schrier and Adam Smith as well as Oregon Rep. Andrea Salinas were among the 20 lawmakers who made the request.

The investigations come amid a general rise in household expenses, making the allocation of utility costs particularly contentious. Residential electricity costs nationwide are on the rise, according to federal data. Power bills rose more than 7% on average when comparing September rates to a year earlier.

But the causes of the increase are complicated. A study this month in a peer-reviewed journal concluded that multiple factors impact electricity prices, including inflation, fluctuating gas prices and natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms and wildfires.

Productivity is one space where companies keep wanting to experiment with AI assistants in the hope that they will save time for users, and as a result, they will want to use those assistants more. Google today launched one such experimental email-based assistant called CC through a Google Labs experiment.

CC, which is powered by Gemini, can connect with your account, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and provide you with a daily brief via email. This “Your Day Ahead” email makes users aware of their tasks, summarizes their calendar, and provides key updates for the day from these accounts.

You can also reply to or email CC at any time with requests such as adding to-dos, teaching it to your preferences, remembering notes, or searching for information. 

At the moment, CC is available to AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S. and Canada who are 18 or above. The company said that the assistant is only available to consumer Google accounts at the moment and not Workspace accounts.

There are several examples of AI-powered email-based briefs and assistants. Sequoia-backed Mindy, which now works in the creator and marketing space, started as an email assistant. Other meeting notetakers like Read AI and Fireflies also send users a daily brief, but they might not have context from email and Drive. Huxe, an audio app created by former Google NotebookLM makers, creates a daily brief in the form of a podcast with data from your email, calendar, and news preferences.

Caroline Merin, who spent nearly a decade developing on-demand services as the first Latin American general manager for Uber Eats and later the COO of Rappi, recognized how badly healthcare tech lagged behind. While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication.

“I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they'll respond,” she told TechCrunch.

But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said.

Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors' communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched Leona Health, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors' WhatsApp accounts.

On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst; Accel; Maven Clinic CEO Kate Ryder; Nubank CEO David Vélez; and Rappi CEO Simón Borrero. The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties.

With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup's mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor's behalf.

The startup will also soon launch a fully autonomous agent that will handle conversational scheduling and simple intake.

Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel.

“These poor doctors, they're receiving requests for very serious medical consults to, ‘I need a letter for my kids' school,' or, ‘I want a receipt for my appointment last week,'” Merin said.

Since these messages can arrive in the evenings and on weekends, physicians are often forced to monitor their WhatsApp around the clock. Leona solves this by immediately alerting doctors only to the most serious health requests and allowing them to deprioritize more routine or administrative questions.

“The idea is to help the doctor regain time,” Merin said. “We're hearing from our users that they're saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.”

While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company's long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the U.S., patients also demand and are permitted to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic.

Leona's team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located.

When you've got many 100s of services managing these in actions yaml itself is no bueno. As you mentioned having the option to actually be able to run the CI/CD yourself is a must. Having to wait 5 minutes plus many commits just to test an action drains you very fast.Granted we did end up making the CI so fast (~ 1 minute with dependency cache, ~4 minutes without), that we saw devs running their setup less and less on their personal workstations for development. Except when github actions went down... ;) We used Jenkins self-hosted before and it was far more stable, but a pain to maintain and understand.

I'm definitely sure it's saving me more than $140 a month to have CI/CD running and I'm also sure I'd never break even on the opportunity cost of having someone write or set one up internally if someone else's works - and this is the key - just as well.But investment in CI/CD is investing in future velocity. The hours invested  are paid for by hours saved. So if the outcome is brittle and requires oversight that savings drops or disappears.

Actions let you test things in multiple environments, to test them with credentials against resources devs don't have access to, to do additional things like deploys, managing version numbers, on and onWith CI, especially pull requests, you can leave longer running tests for github to take care of verifying.  You can run periodic tests once a day like an hour long smoke test.CI is guard rails against common failure modes which turn requiring everyone to follow an evolving script into something automatic nobody needs to think about much

We currently self-host on kubernets/aws. The thing that really got to me isn't the new charge per se. It's the fact that GHA has a ton of problems. I can hold my nose and deal with them when it's free. But now that you're squeezing me, at least you could have created something like GHA 2.0 and added a charge for that. Instead, there are vague roadmap promises which don't even include things that I care about. Specifically:- Jenkins had better kubernetes integration years ago. It's crazy that GHA can't beat that.- ""Reintroducing multi-label functionality"" - yeah, so they first broke it. They did supply ""reasons"", which looked like they never talked to a customer. [1]- Still no SDK of any kind.- ""Actions Data Stream"" - or you can just fix your logging.There are dozens more complains, which are easy enough to find. This kind of an approach just makes me want to make sure that I don't use GHA again. Even if I end up paying another vendor, at least I'll be treated as a customer.[1] - https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/160682#discuss...

ZIRP ended, its remaining monopoly money has been burnt through, and the projected economy is looking bleak. We're now in the phase where everything that can be monetized is being monetized in every way that can be managed.Free tiers evaporate. Fees appear everywhere. Ads appear everywhere, even where it was implied they wouldn't. The lemons must be squeezed.And because everybody of relevance is in that mode, there's little competitive pressure to provide a specific rationale for a specific scheme. For the next few years, that's all the justification that there needs to be.

For the next few years, that's all the justification that there needs to be.

Given that GitHub runners are still slow as ever, it actually is a point in our favor even compared to self-hosting on aws etc. However, it makes the value harder to communicate <shrug>.

8h job is definitely more expensive to them than a 1 minute one, but I'd guess that the actual reason is that this way they earn more money, and dissuade users from using a third party service instead of their own runners.

I'm sure we'll feel it too at https://sprinters.sh, but probably a bit less than others as our flat $0.01 per job fee for runners on your own AWS account will still work out to about 80% average savings in practice, compared to ~90% now when using spot instances.

1. Self-hosting runners is still cheaper than not
Despite the $0.002/minute self-hosted runner tax, self-hosting runners on your cloud (aws/gcp/azure/...) remains the cheaper option.2. Prefer larger runners
If your workflow scales with the number of vCPUs, prefer larger runners. That ensures you spend fewer minutes on the runner, which reduces the GitHub self-hosted runner tax.For example, using actions-runner-controller with heavy jobs running on 1 vcpu runners is not a good idea. Instead, prefer a 2vcpu runner (say) if it runs the job ~2x faster.3. Prefer faster runners
All else being equal, prefer faster runners. That ensures you spend fewer minutes on the runner, which reduces the GitHub self-hosted runner tax.For example, if you're self-hosting on aws and using a t3g.medium runner, it's better to use a t4g.medium runner since the newer generation is faster, but not much more expensive.4. Prefer fewer shards
If you have a lot of shards for your jobs (example: tests on ~50 shards), consider reducing the number of shards and parallelizing the tests on fewer but larger runners.5. Improve job performance
This is not new advice, but it's now more important than ever because of the additional GitHub self-hosted runner tax.6. Use GitHub hosted runners for very short jobs
For linters and other very short jobs, it's better to use GitHub hosted runners.Note: I make WarpBuild, where we provide github actions runner compute. Our compute is still cheaper than using github hosted runners (even with the $0.002/min tax) and our runners are optimized for high performance to minimize the number of mins consumed.
I'm generally biased, but I think the points 1-6 apply irrespective of WarpBuild.

Part of this is fair since there is a cost to operating the control plane.One way around this is to go back to using check runs.

It was a night and day difference.Now... this move by GitHub is almost unbelievable. Charging folks to use their own machines

On my larger organization, we have on average 20 to 30 *active* runners during business hours. Assuming 5 on the off-hours, my napkin math says it comes down to about 10 fully-utilized-runners per month, so about 864$/mo. For the size of my organization that is honestly totally acceptable.This is assuming 0.002$ per minute of job being actively executed. If it turns out to be 0.002$ per minute of *runner being registered* on the control plane, it would increase quite a bit. We are still using the old HorizontalRunnerAutoscaler with actions-runner-controller, with quite a pool of prewarmed runners idling to pick up a job. It would be a strong reason to use the new RunnerScaleSet (to take advantage of the reactive webhook-based scaling) and keep a very lean pool of prewarmed runners.

Any ""large companies"" don't give a shit about things at this cost level. They spend more on the time it takes you to open the door. The number of CI minutes could be astronomical and it still wouldn't rate above the threshold of caring. The time people in this thread have spent wringing their hands is way more expensive.

Annie  Lennon

 December 16, 2025  

On paper, most countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region have committed to tackling violence against women. Almost 90% of them have “multisectoral strategies” to address the issue and 75% have committed to train health workers. The reality on the ground, however, is different.

A recent WHO report found that less than a third of countries in the region offer basic care like clinical enquiry to identify intimate partner violence, emergency contraception, and HIV post-exposure prophylaxis to survivors of violence against women. Referrals to services in other sectors only exist in 47% of country policies while abortion is only included in 13%.

This comes while 30% of women aged 15-49 years in the WHO Europe region have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from intimate partners, and 10% have experienced nonpartner sexual violence.

Multisectoral plans and frameworks alone aren't enough, Melanie Hyde, LLM, gender equality, health equity, and human rights technical officer at WHO, Europe and report author, told Medscape News Europe. To transition political commitment into action, she said, these plans need to be integrated into health sector-specific policies.

But it isn't just policies that need to change. Structural changes spanning education to provision of care — and funding across the board — need to be in place for meaningful progress, health authorities and researchers told Medscape News Europe.

“We've made significant progress in medical education in terms of the social determinants of health. But we have not made the same progress in understanding that violence, just like water and sanitation, is a critical public health issue,” Nata Duvvury, established professor and director of the Centre for Global Women's Studies at the University of Galway, Galway, Ireland, told Medscape News Europe.

Duvvury noted that while education on violence against women is being introduced in Ireland, it is not yet at the level where general practitioners (GPs) can fully respond to all the potential dangers that women may face. While basic training, often conducted online, is mandatory, more advanced training is optional, she added.

“Training is reduced to a checklist with five modules you must take. You check them off and then it's done, and it's never really repeated. There's no checking,” she said, adding that current methods don't test whether clinicians have truly absorbed information or whether they can apply it in a given situation.

These issues, she said, could be improved by making advanced and refresher training mandatory, and conducting training in person to ensure formative dialogue takes place. Another important thing, she stressed, is that curricula are codesigned with survivors.

Systematic screening among pregnant women and new parents is another area with the potential to improve survivor care, Ditte Søndergaard Linde, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Clinical Research at the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, told Medscape News Europe.

In a recent study, Linde and colleagues investigated the use of intimate partner violence screening among pregnant women in Denmark and Spain. Altogether, 8.5% of women in Denmark and 17% in Spain reported exposure to violence or severe conflicts.

In Denmark, screening involved an online questionnaire asking about physical, emotional, and sexual violence as well as relationship conflicts that pregnant women filled in before their first appointment with a midwife, said Linde. The midwife then followed up on the screening result and offered supportive interventions.

Marieke Liem, PhD, professor of security and interventions at Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands, told Medscape News Europe that healthcare professionals should also look for more subtle signs of coercive control that may fall outside traditional clinical checklists.

Focusing on physical injury means that coercive patterns, such as multiple pregnancies in quick succession, a partner always accompanying the patient, or subtle restrictions on mobility or work, go unnoticed, she said.

“A simple opening question can help: ‘Are you ever afraid of your partner?' If the answer is yes, it is important to follow up with concrete questions that address known high-risk indicators, such as whether the patient has ever been choked, forced into sex, or threatened with harm,” said Liem.

“Asking about these issues directly can be lifesaving as nonfatal strangulation in particular is one of the strongest predictors of femicide,” she said, adding that similar questions and pattern-spotting should be embedded into routine risk assessment and care pathways.

Another area that receives relatively little attention but could make a big impact, said Linde, is support for persons who use violence but would like to stop.

“Persons who use violence are often very stigmatized. Many do not wish to use violence but do not have the strategies to control anger or behave in heated situations,” she said.

Linde is part of an ongoing EU project that has mapped screening tools and guidelines for persons who use violence in Europe. While the group has found screening tools, they have yet to find guidelines.

“My overall opinion is that this is definitely an area that needs more attention,” she said, noting that some level of support already exists for such people in Denmark and Verona, Italy.

Lack of communication between services is another key bottleneck for addressing violence against women, according to Liem.

“Different parts of the system see different pieces of a survivor's situation: the GP sees fatigue and unexplained pain, mental health services may treat trauma or a partner's psychiatric problems, and debt counselors address financial stress — but rarely is this information integrated. Without a coherent, shared approach and shared definitions, crucial signals get lost,” she said.

To solve this problem, she recommended the creation of “genuine cross-agency coordination” among health providers, police, social services, and justice systems. This, she said, would mean the use of compatible registration systems, shared definitions, and consistent risk indicators.

“When each service uses its own terminology or data structure, patterns of escalating danger get lost,” she said.

While Netherlands does not yet have such an integrative system, Filomena, a domestic violence organization in Rotterdam, Netherlands, is an example where an integrative approach gives women access to psychologists, forensic examiners, lawyers, social workers, and more. This, said Liem, allows women, as opposed to institutions, to be the central point of gravity.

Compared with placebo, secukinumab — an interleukin-17A inhibitor — did not show greater clinical efficacy in treating moderate-to-severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO); however, the drug was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were reported.

""[Our study] findings indicate that blocking a single cytokine does not sufficiently limit the complex, multifactorial inflammatory processes involved in GO,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Jan Wolf, Department of Medicine I, Johannes Gutenberg-University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany. It was published online on December 9, 2025, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

The small sample size limited the study's statistical power and its ability to detect the effect of the intervention. Variables influencing outcome parameters could not be evaluated in detail due to the small sample size. The study's open-label extension phase may have introduced expectation bias, particularly influencing quality of life.

The study was supported by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland. Five authors declared being employees of and/or holding stock options in Novartis. Additionally, some authors declared receiving investigator fees, consulting fees, honoraria, support for attending meetings and/or travel, compensation for participation on data safety monitoring or advisory boards, or research funding, or having other ties with several sources, including Novartis.

In professional women's football, injuries sustained during menstrual bleeding led to three times the amount of lost time on the field compared with injuries that occurred during non-bleeding phases. 

“These findings highlight the importance of individualized menstrual tracking for injury prevention and athlete health management,” the study authors wrote. “Further research with precise hormonal monitoring is needed to confirm these observations and to inform training, recovery, and health strategies in female athletes.”

This study was led by Eva Ferrer, of the FC Barcelona Medical Department in Barcelona, Spain. It was published online on December 16 in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living.

There were less injuries that occurred during menstrual bleeding than non-bleeding phases, which may limit the study's statistical strength. Factors like sleep, nutrition, and symptom severity were not measured. 

Two of the study authors reported employment with FC Barcelona Medical Department. No other financial disclosures were reported.

Exercise continues to prove beneficial in managing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Some research has shown that consistent exercise — at least 2.5 h/wk — can slow symptom progression and improve overall quality of life.

Dancing is among the most popular forms of exercise in this patient population, along with boxing, balance classes, tai chi, walking, and yoga.

I n a small Canadian study published this month in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 75-minute weekly dance classes were associated with significantly improved cognitive scores in patients with Parkinson's disease over 6 years compared with not taking the classes. Each class began with a seated warm-up, followed by barre stretches, then floor-work dances. The group also learned specific choreography for a performance.

Activities that involve rhythm, such as dancing, biking, boxing, or singing, seem to help with Parkinson's disease, neurologist Abdul Qayyum Rana, MD, director of the Parkinson's Clinic of Eastern Toronto and Movement Disorders Centre in Toronto, told Medscape News Canada. “We really don't know why it works, but somehow it does work for Parkinson's.”

E xercise should be grouped into three general categories for patients with Parkinson's disease, said Rana, who also founded the World Parkinson's Program charitable organization.

For mild, early-stage Parkinson's disease, when patients are most mobile, high-intensity exercises, such as jogging, running, Zumba, boxing, dancing, and biking are helpful, he said.

For moderate Parkinson's disease, when patients have bilateral disease but good balance and have had the disease for about 5-7 years, walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike is appropriate.

As the disease progresses, falls become a large risk, so patients “should exercise in the company of someone,” Rana said, adding that stretching, yoga, walking with a walking aid, and tai chi are good choices.

Dancing has been known to help with Parkinson's disease for a long time, he said. “Any repetitive high-to-moderate amplitude exercises are good for Parkinson's patients.”

Rana's team has developed a 45-minute daily exercise regimen for patients with Parkinson's disease with a downloadable diary. The free program “is used in about 50 countries and translated into 25-30 languages,” Rana said.

“Exercise helps every stage of Parkinson's disease,” Rana said. “Exercise is as important as medication.” He added, however, that his most challenging task as a Parkinson's disease specialist is getting patients to exercise regularly.

“I tell patients that every Parkison's patient should have a treadmill. I also tell them the treadmill should not be in the basement. Do it in a bright place,” Rana said.

Some other earlier studies have shown the benefits of tango dancing, Alfonso Fasano, MD, PhD, chair in neuromodulation and multidisciplinary care at the University of Toronto and University Health Network, both in Toronto, told Medscape News Canada. The social engagement or cultural relevance of the dance might provide the benefit, he said. “As doctors, we always underestimate the role of happiness,” he said. “When you are happy, you do something better, you feel better, you move better.

“From what we know, [the benefit] is not specific to dancing,” he said. For patients in Ireland with Parkinson's disease, Irish dancing might be helpful, Fasano explained. Elsewhere, the social distance between people may be greater, patients may not engage as actively in that type of dancing, and the benefits “would not be as visible,” he said.

To improve patients' adherence to exercise, researchers are “gamifying” it (that is, enhancing the exercise with gaming components), Fasano said. “The issue, though, is the quality of studies. I'm sure these studies will come.” He mentioned that, like the recent dance study, most studies on exercise and Parkinson's disease lack a true control group and randomization.

He pointed to a study in Lancet Neurology of aerobic exercises that incorporated video games. The exercises were performed at home and supervised remotely and showed promise for patients with mild Parkinson's disease.

What's most promising in exercise therapy is that it is now an established treatment, Fasano said. When he was a trainee, it “was all about drugs.” There was little talk about exercise, and it wasn't mentioned in guidelines, he noted.

“It's not debatable anymore that exercise is an important part of treating Parkinson's disease,” said David Grimes, MD, associate professor of neurology at the University of Ottawa and d irector of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Clinic at Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa. “There's no question that exercise makes Parkinson's patients feel better and function better. Pretty much any program that's been looked at shows benefit,” he said. “But there's not a lot of head-to-head comparison.”

Exercise intensity and frequency matter, however, Grimes said. Exercising enough to raise your heart rate and to sweat is important, as is exercising a minimum of three times per week, and “preferably four or five times per week.”

“The main message is to find what you like to do and do it,” he said.

What the long-term effects of exercise are and whether exercise affects disease progression remain unanswered questions. Meanwhile, the push to find activities that can help patients manage Parkinson's symptoms is strong as the disease's prevalence grows. A recent analysis found that cases of Parkinson's disease in Canada are likely to rise sharply in the coming decades. “In 2021, the estimated number of Parkinson's cases in Canada was approximately 153,000. This figure is projected to rise by 69%, reaching 259,000 by 2050,” the report stated.

Rana, Fasano, and Grimes reported having no relevant financial relationships.

The Walt Chyzowych Fund announced on Tuesday that Tony Meola and Cindy Parlow Cone will be honored at the Walt Chyzowych Fund Annual Award.

A celebration and reception will be held during the United Soccer Coaches Convention in Philadelphia on Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026, in the Philadelphia Convention CenterMarriott Grand Ballroom L at 4 p.m.

The WCF is a charitable fund of the United Soccer Coaches Foundation.

The Walt Chyzowych Fund (www.waltslegacy.com) was founded after the Philadelphia soccer Legend's passing in 1994 to honor his life and legacy as the U.S. national team coach and director of coaching in the modern formative years of U.S. Soccer. The fund provides coaching education scholarships and grants to aspiring young coaches through its fund-raising efforts in partnership with the United Soccer Coaches (formerly NSCAA) Foundation.

Meola, one of the most recognizable names, face and voices in American Soccer, has a career playing record that includes three World Cups, twice being named a collegiate All-American, a Hermann Trophy as a freshman at the University of Virginia and a MAC Hermann Award as a sophomore. Meola was named League MVP of Major League Soccer, goalkeeper of the Year and MLS Cup MVP when in 2000 he led Kansas City to the championship.

After his playing career Meola remained in the game as a coach and mentor prior to a broadcasting career which includes commentary during the 2018 World Cup, a Copa America, and MLS Broadcasts which continue to this day. Meola also serves as a host of Sirius XM FC.

“I am honored and humbled to be recognized by the Walt Chyzowych Fund and United Soccer Coaches Foundation with this Lifetime Achievement Award,” Meola said in a statement. “Walt Chyzowych was part of my soccer journey during one of the proudest periods of my career when a group of young men, and great teammates, embarked on making history in 1990. Representing the USMNT in our first World Cup in 40 years was a dream come true for me personally and helped spark a new generation of players and fans of this beautiful game. I accept this award in remembrance of Walt, and on behalf of every teammate and coach I had throughout my career.”

Parlow Cone was a twice Olympic Gold Medalist, a 1999 Women's World Cup winner and a three-time NCAA Division I Champion at the University of North Carolina. She served as assistant coach to head coach Anson Dorrance at UNC from 2007-2012, before moving to the National Women's Soccer League Portland Thorns FC, where as head coach she won the championship in 2013.

Parlow Cone, the current president of U.S. Soccer, served on multiple U.S. Soccer committees, including the Athletes' Council. In February of 2019 she was elected interim vice president of U.S. Soccer and a year later was elected to a four-year term. She assumed the presidency in 2022 and was elected to a four-year term the following year.

As President, Parlow Cone was instrumental in the women's national team litigation settlement, bringing commercial rights back to the Federation, and partnered withcorporate, philanthropic and local/state governments to build U.S. Soccer's first National Training Center. This year, Parlow Cone was named to Forbes'America's Most Powerful Women in Sports list.

“I've been fortunate to spend my life in soccer, and that only happens because of leaders like Walt Chyzowych who came before me and helped build the foundation of the sport in the United States,” Parlow Cone said in a statement. This honor is really a reflection of all the teammates, coaches, staff and mentors who shaped me along the way. They challenged me, believed in me, and made me better, and this award belongs just as much to them. I'm deeply grateful for this recognition and excited to keep driving the game forward for future generations.”

Mark Ogden explains why Colombia vs. Portugal could be Cristiano Ronaldo's chance to ""steal the stage"" over Lionel Messi in Miami. (0:57)

FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final. instead of being asked to pay $4,185.

FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.

Fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.

The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group stage games that did not involve co-hosts the United States, Canada and Mexico.

FIFA has faced fierce criticism, especially in Europe, for its World Cup ticket pricing strategy that includes so-called ""dynamic pricing"" and acting as its own resale platform.

The third phase of ticket sales began last Friday, with fans able to request tickets for specific matchups for the first time following the Dec. 5 tournament draw.

A list published by the German Football Association revealed prices ranged from $180 to $700 for varying group stage games. The English Football Association shared pricing information with the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC), which showed that if a fan bought a ticket for every game through to the final it would cost just over $7,000.

Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) described the prices as ""extortionate"" and called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales via national associations ""until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.""

The target from United States soccer officials when bidding for the tournament seven years ago was to offer hundreds of thousands of $21 seats across the opening phase of games. However, FIFA has implemented dynamic pricing at a World Cup for the first time following its use at this summer's Club World Cup, with prices set to fluctuate based on demand.

The last time the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994, prices ranged from $25 to $475. In Qatar in 2022, prices ranged from around $70 to $1,600 when ticket details were announced.

FIFA said Tuesday it had received more than 20 million ticket requests during what it calls the ""random selection draw"" phase.

The third phase of sales runs through Jan. 13, 2026, with successful applicants set to be notified by email in February and charged automatically.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","FIFA World Cup visas: Challenges and opportunities","https://stacker.com/stories/sports/fifa-world-cup-visas-challenges-and-opportunities","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:00:09 GMT","

The U.S. expects to welcome more than 5 million international visitors in 2026 for the FIFA World Cup.

The Trump administration has taken steps to accommodate those visitors, but it's also taken further initiatives on immigration enforcement that may create challenges as the tournament approaches.

In this article, Manifest Law examines the visa challenges and policy changes affecting international visitors to the 2026 World Cup.

On one hand, the U.S. is making moves to make sure stadiums are full by taking measures to expedite short-term travel.

FIFA PassThe administration announced the FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System (PASS) in November, saying it would give fans who buy a match ticket the chance to get a faster visa interview for traveling to the U.S. FIFA plans to share more information on the program in early 2026.

Reduced visa wait timesAndrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, said Wednesday that the administration aims to ensure fans in 80% of the world can secure a visa appointment in less than 60 days. The U.S. Department of State is deploying more than 450 extra staffers in consulates to decrease appointment times.

A series of diplomatic cables obtained by the Associated Press revealed the Trump administration is prioritizing visas for people attending the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics, also being hosted in the U.S.

While the U.S. seems set to welcome World Cup visitors next year, the administration has also planned to increase scrutiny on other types of travel to the U.S.

In its latest cables, the State Department announced a significant expansion of vetting for individuals seeking H-1B visas. Consular officers are now instructed to review whether an applicant has been involved in activities that could be interpreted as censoring U.S. citizens online, particularly considering new content-moderation regulations coming out of the European Union. If an officer finds evidence suggesting that an applicant participated in or contributed to this type of online censorship, that could become a basis for denying the H-1B visa.

While some countries sending teams to the World Cup are seeing decreased visa appointment times, others are facing full or partial travel bans. An executive order issued in June 2025 placed travel bans on 19 countries, including Haiti and Iran, which both qualified for the World Cup. While there are exceptions for players, coaches, and support staff heading to the tournament, fans from those countries can't attend.

Twelve countries are subject to a full travel ban, which restricts all immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, while a partial travel ban, which restricts all immigrant and some nonimmigrant visas (including travel, student, and exchange visitor visas), applies to seven countries.

Countries under a full travel banAfghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen

Countries under a partial travel banBurundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela

In recent days, Kristi Noem, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, has suggested that 30 countries or more may be added to the full or partial travel ban list, following the Nov. 26 shooting of two National Guard members deployed to D.C. that left one dead and another seriously injured. An Afghan national granted asylum this year has been named as the suspect.

Although Noem has yet to name the countries, it's expected that any additions to the travel ban will be announced well ahead of the first matches. Reuters and The New York Times have reported on potential additional countries, and they include World Cup participants Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Ghana, Senegal, and Uzbekistan.

“If your country is added to a travel ban, the most important thing you can do is speak with an immigration attorney before making any travel plans,” said Ana Gabriela Urizar, immigration attorney at Manifest Law. “Every ban is different; some block only certain visa categories, others restrict all entries, and each one includes specific exceptions and waiver options. Understanding how the policy applies to your immigration status is critical so you don't risk being stranded outside the United States.”

The Trump administration plans to continue its increased enforcement of immigration law even at World Cup games. “The President does not rule out anything that will help make American citizens safer,” Giuliani said.

Attendees should be cautious not to overstay their visas and ensure they remain in lawful status. That means complying with the terms of their visa; for example, people on B-1/B-2 tourist visas aren't legally allowed to work in the U.S., and doing so could put them at risk for removal.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a new “visa integrity” fee of at least $250 for anyone issued a nonimmigrant visa. This can include B-1/B-2 tourist visas (if staying for more than 90 days), temporary worker visas like the H-1B and O-1, and student visas like the F-1.

The Department of State is also piloting a visa bond program. It would require tourists and business travelers from certain countries to post a bond of up to $15,000 to receive a visa. The bond program targets countries with a high rate of visa overstays, including The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, São Tomé and Principe, Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia (none of whom are playing in the World Cup).

In addition, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) increased the fee for Form I-94 (arrival/departure record) from $6 to $24.

“For anyone planning to travel during the World Cup, especially if you're from a country that may be added to the travel-ban list, it's essential to get legal guidance before you leave the United States,” Urizar said. “Make sure your documents are valid, understand how a ban could affect your return, and have a clear plan in place in case policies shift while you're abroad.”

Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso has thrown his full weight behind Florentino Perez in the ongoing war over the Negreira case, insisting that the lack of punishment for Barcelona is viewed with total shock across the rest of Europe. The Madrid president described the controversy as the biggest scandal in football history as he criticised Spanish football's authorities over a lack of action.

The cold war between Spanish football's biggest institutions has heated up once again, with Madrid presenting a completely united front in their condemnation of the 'Negreira Case'. Just a day after club president Perez delivered a blistering speech at the club's General Assembly, labelling the scandal the ""biggest in the history of world football"", manager Alonso has echoed those sentiments, claiming the situation is inexplicable to those looking in from outside Spain.

Speaking ahead of Real Madrid's Copa del Rey fixture, the Basque tactician was asked to address the president's ""scorched earth"" comments, which targeted Barcelona, La Liga, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), and the media. Alonso doubled down, insisting that the integrity of the sport relies on a full and transparent resolution to the investigation.

""We share the position of the club and the president,"" Alonso stated firmly, aligning himself directly with the boardroom's aggressive legal and public relations strategy. ""The most important thing is that, for the good of football, the truth of what actually happened is known.""

Alonso's comments serve to reinforce the narrative Perez constructed during his recent address to the club members. The Madrid president had claimed that the payments made by Barcelona to Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, the former vice-president of the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA), constituted an attempt to control the outcome of matches. Perez argued that the lack of sporting sanctions for such actions was a stain on the Spanish game, a sentiment Alonso believes is shared by the wider European football community.

Having spent a significant portion of his career and his recent management tenure outside of Spain in the Bundesliga and Premier League, Alonso offered a perspective on how refereeing issues in La Liga are viewed internationally. He suggested that the ""normalization"" of the scandal in Spain is an anomaly compared to how such a case would be handled in Germany or England.

""There is a bit of everything in all leagues,"" Alonso admitted regarding refereeing mistakes. ""As humans, everyone makes mistakes. But here, there has been a case that must be investigated. What has happened here... abroad, it surprises people very much that there have been no consequences or accountability. That is why it is very important that what happened is known. It is not normal; it cannot be treated as natural.""

The tension at Valdebebas is not just directed at Barcelona, but also at the current refereeing establishment. The CTA recently issued a statement condemning the videos produced by Real Madrid TV, which highlight alleged errors made by match officials before games. When asked about the referees' complaints, Alonso defended the club's right to highlight perceived injustices.

""It is legitimate for everyone to defend their interests,"" the former midfielder said. ""Whoever feels aggrieved should raise their voice. We are doing exactly that.""

Despite his firm backing of the investigation, Alonso was careful not to cross a specific line. When pressed by reporters on whether he believes the titles Barcelona won during the period of the payments (2001-2018) are ""tainted"" or illegitimate, the Real Madrid boss opted for a diplomatic sidestep.

""No, no. I won't go into that,"" he replied.

Alonso's intervention ensures the Negreira case remains front and centre of the Spanish news cycle. The scandal involves payments totalling over €7 million made by Barcelona to companies owned by Negreira over a period of 17 years. Barcelona have consistently denied any wrongdoing, claiming the payments were for technical reports and scouting advice, but the lack of physical evidence for many of these reports has fuelled suspicion.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

USWNT star Alyssa Thompson justifying status as Chelsea's record signing with exciting start to life in the WSL","https://www.goal.com/en-ng/lists/uswnt-alyssa-thompson-chelsea-wsl/blt5dde2e1cc4791c61","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:04:43 GMT","

Alyssa Thompson's transfer to Chelsea featured all the hallmarks of a marquee signing. First reported to be in the works over a week before it was done, allowing the hype and excitement to build, it was given a dramatic conclusion by being completed right at the Women's Super League's transfer deadline, and for a bumper fee surpassing £1 million ($1.4m) which set a new world record for the women's game at the time. Brought out to greet the fans of her new club at Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea opened their WSL title defence with a statement win over Manchester City, Thompson was given the stage of a true star. But would she be?

Only 20 years old, the Blues were signing a player who was still more of a work-in-progress than an established talent. Thompson spent the first three years of her senior career with an Angel City side often at the wrong end of the NWSL table, making her return of 15 goals and 11 assists in 62 league games more impressive, but still with room for improvement. She was clearly gifted, but how would she adapt to the challenge of playing for a world-class side like Chelsea, while also juggling the difficulties that moving to a new city and new country, some 5,000 miles from home, at such a young age, brings?

Most of the women's game's most expensive signings have been guaranteed performers and that is often the sort of profile Chelsea have often gone for when it has come to big spending, with the likes of Naomi Girma, Keira Walsh and Pernille Harder all joining the Blues for big fees after they had already established themselves as world-class players. The deal for Thompson, then, was a little bit different. However, through the first few months of her Chelsea career, she has shown what the club and many others already believed: that she is certainly capable of hitting those heights, and is well on track to do so.

When it happened, it was fair to question aspects of this move for both Chelsea and Thompson. Would the 20-year-old get the game time she needed in order to keep developing at the impressive rate she did at Angel City? Or would a smaller-sized step have been better for her, to maintain that trajectory?

On the other side, when Chelsea were handily beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals last season, one of the main takeaways was that the Blues needed more world-class match-winners in order to close the gap to the Catalans, who have ended their European dream in four of the last five seasons. Given her age and limited experience, Thompson didn't feel like she was that just yet. But would she be expected to be from the get-go? Or could she reach that point quickly?

It wasn't just that Thompson had a new environment, on and off the pitch, to adapt to, either. She was also joining a Chelsea side that is extremely adaptable when it comes to formation and, as such, requires its players to be able to change position frequently.

At Angel City, Thompson almost always played as a left winger. There were a couple of times where she lined up on the right, even fewer occasions where she might find herself in central areas, and occasions when she would be asked to be a little bit deeper or more advanced than usual. But, generally speaking, the young forward consistently played the same position in her two and a half years in Los Angeles and that no doubt helped her settle into the NWSL nicely, to become a very productive outlet. By contrast, in her three months at Chelsea to date, Thompson has already played as a winger on the right and the left and, most differently, as a wing-back.

Speaking about her United States, and now Chelsea, team-mate on the We Are Chelsea podcast, Girma described Thompson as someone who is ""used to being uncomfortable in those environments,"" after her experiences coming into the NWSL and the international game. Still, this was a move that was going to present more challenges than ever before for her, and all at once.

It's to Thompson's immense credit, then, that she is passing these tests with flying colours and showing she can be exactly what Chelsea need. As the Blues' season prepares to hit its halfway stage, with Wednesday's Champions League clash with Wolfsburg and Sunday's League Cup quarter-final against Liverpool all that is left before the winter break, the 20-year-old has nailed down a starting spot in head coach Sonia Bompastor's team, featuring in the XI for each of the last nine matches and repaying that faith with four goals and two assists.

Last month, her sublime strike against Arsenal was named WSL Goal of the Month, while her goal-and-assist display against Brighton on Sunday was right up there with that performance against the Gunners as a contender for her best to date in Chelsea blue, helping her side sign off in the WSL in 2025 with a vital win.

It's clear that having such a settled run in the Chelsea team is helping Thompson find that consistency and she deserves further praise for managing to nail one down, because the Blues have one of the best and most competitive squads in Europe. She's not wasting those opportunities, either, learning as much as possible from every outing in order to keep taking steps forward.

Asked about the biggest differences between the WSL and the NWSL she noticed when moving to England, Girma explained on the We Are Chelsea podcast: ""Having different styles of games in the league is different. For different teams, you have to prepare different game plans and sometimes a team, especially against a team like Chelsea, will sit in or high press. I think the tactics change a lot. I think that has been different and the preparation for each game.""

That's something Thompson herself has noted in these last few months, too. ""I feel like every game is different,"" she said last month. ""All of these teams are coming from different leagues so even the fact that we play different styles has helped me a lot in terms of viewing the game tactically. I can see what I need to work on against different teams' blocks and it helps me show more versatility in my game. Having that every week in the Champions League is really cool.""

Having a manager who really believes in her talent must help, too. As well as trusting her as a regular starter, Bompastor has repeatedly praised Thompson since her arrival in London and said she believes there is even more to come from her, the kind of comments which must make any young player, never mind one 5,000 miles from home in a totally new environment, feel extremely confident.

""She brings a lot of speed up front,"" Bompastor said after Thompson's goal-and-assist display against Paris FC in October, in some of her most glowing comments about the 20-year-old to date. ""She's really comfortable on the ball and she takes risks. She attacks the defender, one-on-one, and she's able to come inside or outside, so it's really difficult to defend against her.

""She's able to provide a lot of crosses when she goes outside but also, she's able to finish when the ball is on the opposite side. She has the engine and she also has the desire to help the team in and out of possession. When we are attacking, we are high up on the pitch, and if she has to run to recover some space, to help the team defend, she's able to do that. She's still a young player but she has a lot of talent.

""We haven't seen the best of her yet but hopefully we'll see that soon. She's come from abroad, she speaks the language, which helps, but it's a new environment, a new club, and she's still learning to connect with her team-mates on the pitch.""

As 2025 nears its end, it feels like we have got much closer to the best of Thompson in the six games since that high praise from Bompastor. The upcoming winter break is likely to do her the world of good, too, given she arrived in the WSL off the back of five months of action in the NWSL, which runs from March to November. A little bit of time off should help her reset before a big end to the season.

In the New Year, Chelsea have a lot on their plate. The Blues will be aiming to become the first team in WSL history to overturn a six-point deficit at the halfway point to win the title, as they bid to take down league leaders Manchester City to win a seventh successive crown. There are also title defences in the League Cup and FA Cup to come, and the challenge of the Champions League. Chelsea have still never triumphed in Europe and will be more determined than ever to change that.

To be successful on multiple fronts, the Blues need several things and one of the big ones is match-winners, the kind of which can make the difference at the elite level. In her first half-season at the club, Thompson has taken real strides and shown that she can be exactly that, making all the hype and excitement surrounding her arrival absolutely worthwhile.

A furious blur of shotmaking and nerve, Carlos Alcaraz's quarter-final victory over Arthur Fils at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters has been voted by fans as the ATP Tour's Match of the Year for 2025.

The two young stars produced a blistering spectacle in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, one that felt like the birth of a long-term rivalry. Fils unloaded explosive, heavy groundstrokes from the baseline to grab the opening set before Alcaraz mounted the kind of miraculous escape that would become a theme of his title run, prevailing 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 after two hours, 23 minutes.

In the fan vote, the Alcaraz-Fils thriller fended off strong competition, including Jannik Sinner's marquee championship-match triumph in Vienna over Alexander Zverev and a gruelling, three-hour Athens final between Novak Djokovic and Lorenzo Musetti.

It was, however, Alcaraz's mix of quality, courage and chaos in Monte-Carlo that made his triumph the match that supporters deemed the year's unforgettable standout.

Watch Alcaraz vs. Fils Highlights:

Saving three break points at 5-5, 0/40 in the second set and later overturning a 1-3 deficit in the third, Alcaraz repeatedly absorbed Fils' pace and power before counterpunching with trademark flair. The Spaniard's nerve under pressure not only cracked Fils' resistance but also marked one of three victories from a set down on his way to a maiden triumph in the Principality.

""I think his level is high right now and he puts a lot of pressure on his opponents,” Alcaraz said of Fils. “Today I could feel it but in some moments he just made a few mistakes. I tried to make the most of those points and wait for my chances.”



It marked one of eight tour-level trophies across the season for Alcaraz, who also clinched Roland Garros and US Open crowns en route to reclaiming ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the first time since 2022. The Spaniard also produced a clay-court thriller in the Roland Garros final, delivering an epic comeback to stun rival Sinner for the crown. That match topped the list of Best Grand Slam matches from 2025.

Roger Federer will return to the Australian Open in January, taking the court in an exhibition match featuring three other ATP No. 1 Club members: Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt.

 
The season's first major will launch a new tradition of having an Opening Ceremony the night before main-draw action begins. The Opening Ceremony will take place on Saturday, January 17 at Rod Laver Arena.

“It feels like a lifetime ago that I coined the phrase the ‘Happy Slam' for the Australian Open, and it still makes me smile when I think about all the moments I've had here,” said Federer, a six-time Australian Open champion, in a press release.


“I've experienced so many emotions on Rod Laver Arena… The joy of lifting ‘Norman' [the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup] six times, the honour of playing in front of Rod Laver himself, the challenge of competing against my biggest rivals, and always the overwhelming love and support of the Australian fans.


“Coming back to win the AO in 2017 is one of my most treasured Grand Slam memories and backing it up to win in 2018 was another dream come true in Melbourne. I can't wait to come down under again to the AO and create more fantastic moments with all the Aussie fans.”

A post shared by Roger Federer (@rogerfederer)

Tournament director Craig Tiley added: ""I'm thrilled we're introducing this very special AO Opening Ceremony. While the AO has a reputation for innovation and is renowned for pushing the boundaries, we are also the custodians of a proud 120-year history filled with some of the sport's greatest champions.


“This inaugural Opening Ceremony will mark the start of a new tennis season in spectacular fashion. I can't wait to see Roger back on Rod Laver Arena, along with other greats of the game, Andre, Pat and Lleyton. And I know fans across Australia will be just as excited to share this moment with him.""


The 2026 Australian Open runs from 18 January-1 February. Italian Jannik Sinner is the two-time defending champion while Carlos Alcaraz, World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will be seeking his maiden Melbourne title in pursuit of completing the Career Grand Slam.

Police tape blocks off the road at both ends while TV news vans post up on the curbs and swarms of podcasters jostle each other as the mansion becomes part of the town's topography of tragedy.


							By 

	Benjamin Svetkey


Articles Editor


	If you were to stick a pin into a map of Los Angeles at the precise location where one might least expect a heinous act of murderous violence, it would likely land right here, on South Chadbourne Avenue. This narrow lane in Brentwood, tucked discreetly a few blocks south of Sunset, lined with palm trees and gated multimillion-dollar mansions, is usually as calm and idyllic as a David Hockney landscape.


	But not right now. On this day, Dec. 14, it looks like something out of a James Ellroy fever dream. Police tape blocks off the road at both ends while TV news vans crowd the curbs and swarms of podcasters and online influencers jostle each other with their vlogging sticks for better views of the grisly scene up the street.

	At one point, a resident wanders out of her home, glances at the mob milling in front of her driveway, breaks into sobs, then rushes back inside.


	Police hadn't yet officially confirmed it, but everybody here knows what's just happened. Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, have been brutally murdered. The sickening details will trickle out over the coming hours: how earlier in the day one of the Reiners' daughters discovered her parents dead in their home, their throats viciously slashed; that the LA Fire Department arrived first, followed by LAPD homicide detectives; that the prime suspect in the slayings, now in custody, was another of the Reiners' children, Nick, 32, who has suffered a long history of drug and mental health challenges.

	There have been some hard Hollywood deaths this past year — Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Diane Keaton — but it's fair to say this one hit the town particularly hard, and not just because of the shocking circumstances. Reiner, 78, had been a fixture in the industry his whole life, starting when his father, Carl Reiner, a legendary Hollywood figure in his own right, would bring him to the set of The Dick Van Dyke Show, the classic sitcom he was creating for CBS. 


	As a teenager, Reiner occasionally popped up elsewhere on the dial — there was a non-speaking part in Wagon Train — and when he was 20 his dad gave him a role in 1967's Enter Laughing, his semiautobiographical movie about growing up in Depression-era New York. But, of course, it was the part Reiner landed just a few years later, at the age of 23, that would set the course for a career that would one day rival and even surpass his father's.

	











	For a generation of TV viewers, Reiner will always be “Meathead,” Archie Bunker's long-suffering liberal son-in-law on Norman Lear's seminal 1970s sitcom All in the Family. The show, which gleefully pushed political and social hot button issues — racism, sexism, homophobia, they all were treated as punchlines — was such a cultural phenomenon it could easily have defined Reiner's legacy on its own. That was a danger Reiner was all too aware of. “I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write, ‘Meathead wins the Nobel Prize,'” he lamented more than once.


	Turns out he was wrong about that — he ended up growing out of Michael Stivic remarkably quickly. In fact, through his 30s and 40s, Reiner would evolve into one of the most successful filmmakers of his generation, shooting an astonishing string of what can reasonably be called instant classics. For starters, there was This Is Spinal Tap, his 1984 directorial debut that pretty much invented the mockumentary (poignantly, last September, it was bookended by its long-in-the-works sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, Reiner's final film). 


	Over the next incredibly productive eight years, he'd make Stand by Me (River Phoenix's breakout film); The Princess Bride (still a cable-TV holiday staple); When Harry Met Sally (the Nora Ephron-scripted rom-com that made Meg Ryan a star — and also the film on which Reiner met his wife, who was a photographer on the set); Misery (which won Kathy Bates an Oscar); and A Few Good Men (noms for best picture and best supporting actor for Jack Nicholson).


	Offscreen, Reiner was just as active, an outspoken champion of civil rights and an unapologetically progressive activist. He was a founding board member of AFER, the organization that, in 2013, helped overturn California's ban on same-sex marriage. His opinions sometimes drew fire from the right — especially recently, with President Trump not even letting Reiner's death get in the way of attacking him for being “deranged” and “very bad for our country” — but most reasonable people, even when they disagreed with him, could find something to respect in his humanity and dignity.


	Of course, no career is without its low points, and Reiner certainly had his share of dips. His 1994 high-concept family comedy North — with future-Frodo Elijah Wood playing a hyper-articulate 11-year-old who sues his parents for not being appreciative enough — was the flop that finally cracked his winning streak, not only tanking at the box office but also famously earning zero stars from Roger Ebert. Still, despite such later-career setbacks, Reiner's track record at his peak, in the 1980s and early 1990s, puts him right up there with Ron Howard, Robert Zemeckis and maybe even Steven Spielberg, planting him squarely in the A-list echelon of late 20th century auteurs, part of Hollywood's most elite cadre.

	











	Except for one other — the one Reiner and his 67-year-old wife of 35 years joined this past weekend, after the horrific events at their Brentwood home; it's a much sadder pantheon, but equally famous and even more enduring — the icons of Hollywood's most infamous crimes and catastrophes.


	That house on Chadbourne Avenue? The Reiners lived there for more than 30 years — since buying the 10,000-square-foot estate from Lear in 1991. It's not too far from another famous Brentwood address: 875 Bundy Drive, where Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered. And that house, it turns out, is only a short distance from Fifth Helena Drive, where Marilyn Monroe overdosed. There are scores of other equally grim landmarks strewn all over the city. Sharon Tate's Benedict Canyon estate, Phil Hartman's suburban home in Encino, Sal Mineo's apartment in West Hollywood — they have all become landmarks in this town's topography of tragedy.


	It will likely be the same with the Reiners' Brentwood mansion, once the news vans and influencers eventually clear out. Hollywood is a town built on storytelling and myth-building. Regrettably, Rob Reiner's story, however huge its imprint on the culture, is now part of that mournful, terrible tradition.

Scott will play the Scottish actor and Colman his doctor in the movie written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Simon Stone for the studio, LD Entertainment, Lucky Red, and Magnolia Mae Films.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Andrew Scott (All of Us Strangers, Ripley, Pressure) and Olivia Colman (The Favourite, The Crown, The Lost Daughter) will star in Elsinore, a film based on the life of Ian Charleson, the Scottish star of the 1981 movie Chariots of Fire, whose final role was Hamlet in a celebrated London theater production. The movie comes from Canal+'s StudioCanal, LD Entertainment, Lucky Red, and Magnolia Mae Films.


Anna Marsh, CEO of StudioCanal, home of such film franchises as Paddington and such one-off hits as I Swear, and chief content officer and deputy CEO of Canal+ Group, shared the news that the studio has come on board to fully finance and distribute the film during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of her appearance during a Tuesday evening Canal+ 2026 content lineup event in Paris.

	Simon Stone (The Dig) is directing the film, produced by Andrea Occhipinti (Il Divo, Everybody Knows) of Lucky Red and Gaby Tana (Philomena, The Dig) of Magnolia Mae, along with Pete Shilaimon and Mickey Liddell of LD Entertainment, Stefano Massenzi and Carolyn Marks Blackwood. Scott is also serving as a producer. 


	The film is written by  Stephen Beresford  (Pride), who is also executive producing the project, along with Ethan Silverman, who originated it. Mike Eley (The Dig) will serve as cinematographer, Helen Scott (Living) as production designer, Mel Page (The Dig) as costume designer, with Valerio Bonelli (Darkest Hour) as editor, and Jessica Ronane (Emma) handling casting. 

	











Elsinore will start shooting in the U.K. on Jan. 5. It will also feature an ensemble of British actors to be announced closer to the start of production. 


	A synopsis describes the movie as a “powerful, deeply moving and inspiring true story of the actor Ian Charleson who faced incredible odds while preparing to give the performance of his life in Hamlet at the National Theatre in London.”


	Scott will portray Charleson, while Colman will play his doctor. Charleson is best known for his starring role as Olympic athlete and missionary Eric Liddell in Chariots of Fire, which won four Oscars, including the best film honor. He also portrayed Rev. Charlie Andrews in the 1982 eight-time Oscar winner Gandhi.


	Charleson was diagnosed with HIV in 1986 and died of AIDS-related causes in January 1990 at the age of 40. In October and November 1989, he performed Hamlet at the National Theatre. When Ian McKellen was honored with the Evening Standard Award for Best Actor for playing Iago in Othello, the actor lauded Charleson as the “perfect Hamlet.”


	“Elsinore” refers to Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, Denmark, the setting for Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. It is therefore also often called “Hamlet's Castle.”


Elsinore reunites StudioCanal with Scott following the production of Anthony Maras' Pressure, set to be released in 2026, this year. The film, produced and developed with Working Title, sees Scott star as Royal Air Force meteorologist James Stagg, who must deliver a weather report to the Allied high command, determining the feasibility of the planned D-Day. Colman most recently starred in and produced StudioCanal's Wicked Little Letters and also starred in Paddington in Peru for the studio.

	











	“This is one of the most exciting projects I've ever been involved in,” said Stone. “Stephen Beresford's screenplay is both heartbreaking and hilarious, a beautiful ode to the power of community in times of crisis. Andrew Scott is one of the greatest actors of his generation, as Ian Charleson was: it's momentous casting.”


	Marsh told THR about Elsinore that it looks at Charleson, who falls ill, but in the months leading up to his death, is given the opportunity to play “the role of his life” when he is offered the part of Hamlet at the National Theatre in London. “It is a film about ambition, art, and the quest for excellence, both on the stage and off.

	StudioCanal is financing Elsinore, with LD pre-buying North America. Ron Halpern, executive vp, global production, and Joe Naftalin, snior vp, global production, will oversee the project for the company. StudioCanal will release it theatrically in its territories of the U.K., France, Germany, Poland, Benelux, Australia and New Zealand, with distribution in Italy handled by Lucky Red.

Executive Editor, Television


	Less than a month after Billy The Kid ended after three seasons, MGM+ has ordered a new western series.


	The streamer and linear network has greenlit a series adaptation of The Magnificent Seven from Heroes creator Tim Kring.


The Magnificent Seven, the 1960 film from director John Sturges, was one of a number of MGM/United Artists movie titles that Jeff Bezos' company had targeted for development after Amazon acquired the James Bond studio.


	It is, however, a different take on the title than the one that was previously in the works from True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto.












	The eight-part drama series will be written by Kring, who also created Fox's Touch. He exec produces with Billy The Kid exec producer Donald De Line, Lawrence Mirisch and Bruce Kaufman. It will be produced by MGM+ Studios and MGM Television Studios and is set to start production in June.




			Watch on Deadline		







The Magnificent Seven will air on MGM+ in the U.S., UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile.


	The reboot is set in the tumultuous 1880s American frontier. After a peaceful Quaker village is massacred by mercenaries working for a greedy and ruthless land baron trying to force them off the land he covets, seven gifted but flawed mercenaries are hired by the community to protect them from the land baron's hired guns. But as the team embeds itself in the community, preparing to defend them against overwhelming odds, they are all forced to grapple with an essential question: is the use of violence acceptable to defend a people whose faith is based on non-violence? The series takes a deep dive into the stories behind each of the Seven; what's at stake for them, and why they choose to take on this mission.


	“Tim Kring is a master storyteller,” said Michael Wright, head of MGM+. “Tim, Donald De Line, Larry Mirisch, and Bruce Kaufman have crafted a series that delivers the energy of a classic western, honors the legacy of the original film, and reasserts its timeless themes of the power of unity against oppression and flawed heroes finding redemption by helping those who can't help themselves.”

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo are re-teaming for the feature film Heist of Benin. 


	Set against the backdrop of contemporary London, Heist of Benin is described as a “thriller that intertwines art, love and restitution.” Oyelowo will star.


	It has just been announced on stage at the Studiocanal Paris showcase, which is taking place as this story publishes.


	The film marks the latest collaboration between DuVernay and Oyelowo, who also worked together on Academy Award-winning movie Selma, which earned acclaim for its portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 1965 Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery. For that movie, Oyelowo played King. More recently, Oyelowo starred in DuVernay's A Wrinkle in Time.












	DuVernay said: “Reuniting with David in this way feels full circle. This film speaks to history, identity and love, all through the lens of a high-stakes, modern adventure. I'm thrilled to bring it to life with him and Studiocanal.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Ava and I have been looking for the right story to tell together again,” Oyelowo added. “Heist is that story. It's thrilling and high-powered with deeply resonant themes that matter to us both.”


	The film is produced by Endurance Media's Steve Richards and Jake Katofsky alongside Yoruba Saxon's Lisa Bruce and Oyelowo, from an original idea and spec script from screenwriter Jesse Quiñones, who will executive produce. Studiocanal will finance, distribute and handle international sales. Ron Halpern, Shana Eddy and Sam Shipp will oversee for the studio. 

	











	Meanwhile, Studiocanal revealed on stage Elsinore, a Simon Stone and Stephen Beresford movie starring Andrew Scott and Olivia Colman about the life of actor Ian Charleson.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The original 2009 Avatar sits on top of the box office heap having made $2.9 billion, nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture and winning three. It took 13 years to get the second edition, 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water, but that gap was barely felt, the sequel taking in $2.3 billion and also nominated for Best Picture while again winning for its spectacular visual effects. Avatar is the highest-grossing movie of all time, The Way of Water is the third-highest grosser. Cameron's Titanic is up there too, now in fourth place. Of course, it would be hard to do a sequel to that movie which won a record-tying 11 Oscars — the ship sank. But with the endlessly fertile and fascinating world of Pandora, the landscape and scope seems right for follow-ups and so now we have the third Avatar entry, Avatar: Fire And Ash, and it turns out to be nothing less than an intense 3-hour and 17-minute kickass epic that may be the bluest war film ever made.

	











	This edition ratchets up the action to new heights picking up the story just a few beats after Way of Water's aquatic battle ended with the defeat of Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and the human-led Resources Development Administration which are now regrouping for its eventual goal of making Pandora habitable for the people of Earth, who have destroyed through sheer neglect their own planet and seek to take over this one if they can capture the right elements for human survival. The storyline sees the Na'vi tribe known as Omatikaya but now turned Metkayina, where the Sully family are temporarily hanging with that mellow reef clan. They are also grieving the loss of brave son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), who died in that final battle.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Our main principal warrior Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), who was once a human Marine but now firmly with the Na'vi, is basically readying to go to war. It is what he knows. Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) is at an emotional breaking point, the loss of their son tugging at her heart, and her hatred for all humans making life difficult for their adopted human boy Spider (Jack Champion), freely living with them and at one with them, but still conflicted over his previous life which happens to be as the son of Quaritch. He of course is Pandora Enemy No. 1 and about to have a second act after being eliminated in his human version and now is a Recom or Recombinarts, which makes him a blend of Na'vi and human in order to regenerate and fight another day in the anti-human environment. That time is now and it becomes complex for Spider.


	Jake is leading the clan to High Camp where the RDA is in order to turn Spider in, the arrangement no longer working for them, especially Neytiri, but he is tight with the younger members, notably Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), who you might recall is the 14-year-old Na'vi version of the avatar of Grace Augustine, who ran the Avatar division of RDA. Also key to the gut-wrenching events taking place in this edition is Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), who is feeling tremendous guilt over the death of Neteyam. Back from the Metkayina clan is leader Tonowari (Cliff Curtis), plus his wife Ronal (Kate Winslet) still in personality conflicts and jealousies with Neytiri. New to the storyline, and perhaps the best scene stealer of all, is Varang, the self-made “queen” of the Ash People, a clan that formerly was peaceful but turned angry and vengeful after a volcano wiped out their homeland, now strewn with ash, as are all its inhabitants. Spanish actress Oona Chaplin plays her to the hilt, with grace of movement and purpose as she and her tribe become major threats to the Na'vi which sees Jake fighting on multiple fronts with the Ash and the RDA, and ultimate villain Quaritch.


	Cameron knows how to do spectacle better than anyone, and this Avatar builds out its worlds to such a high degree I would dare to say you could put the first two films together and it still wouldn't add up to the fierce levels and magnitude of the fight in this one. Compared to The Way of Water, this version has far more land action although rest assured, the fan-favorite Tolkuns seafaring whales are back in action when you need them most.


	This is what they used to call in Hollywood a true epic, taking place in the sky, water and land in a visual knockout like you rarely see on this level these days. Its secret sauce however is our emotional connection through the Sully family. They are again the hook, and Cameron and co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver know you have to deliver a compelling family story to keep this all from drowning in too much fire and water. It is a credit to the actors, most having to do performance capture and somehow making us feel for them throughout. Led by exceptional turns again from Worthington and Saldaña, along with standouts Dalton and Champion, plus of course Weaver (convincing even as a 14 year old), there is also room for greater character development than before from Lang, who masters the villainry of Colonel Quaritch in his new guise, but also manages a three-dimensional relationship with Spider that feels authentic. Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement and Giovanni Ribisi also get their moments on the human side of things.

	











	With truly dazzling production elements all around this is a movie hard to resist, even if you think you have already seen what wonders Cameron has in store for this franchise. He isn't committing firmly to the hoped for and scripted fourth and fifth films in the Avatar universe until he sees how this one performs, but my guess is people are gonna go more than once.


	Producers are Cameron and the late Jon Landau, to whom the film is rightly dedicated.

Dionne Warwick is being sued by a rights firm that claims she has backed out of a deal that entitles them to “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars” for work recovering her royalties, court records show. The company, Artists Rights Enforcement Corporation, cites its negotiation of terms and payment for the “Walk on By” sample in Doja Cat's “Paint the Town Red” as a key payday for which it is owed an ongoing cut of royalties. Warwick's team did not immediately respond to Pitchfork's request for comment.

In the lawsuit, filed in New York on Monday (December 15), Artists Rights claims that, since its 2002 deal with Warwick, the company has waived upfront fees in exchange for half of any royalties and settlements it negotiates and collects on her behalf, in perpetuity. That work includes managing the royalty agreement that resulted from Warwick's 2002 lawsuit against Atlantic—over her ownership of her Scepter Masters and classic single “Then Came You”—as well as a deal involving royalties owed to Warwick by Sony, which were being funneled to the state of California to pay off Warwick's tax bill. Artist Rights claims it has already agreed to reduce or waive its fees for various work done for Warwick over the years, and that the sum of its efforts is more than $2.5 million in revenue—including that recent boon from “Paint the Town Red.”

This September, however, Warwick allegedly sought to end the deal and to directly receive royalties from Sony, Rhino, and the British copyright collective PPL. Artists Rights argues that this violates their contract. The company says it is entitled to ongoing income for deals it negotiated—a structure designed to offset the risk it took on by waiving upfront fees. This type of agreement is not unheard of, according to Billboard, mirroring the no-win-no-fee model employed by some legal firms. Artists Rights is seeking the reinstatement of its cut from Warwick's royalty deals as well as compensation and interest for missed payments since her attempted termination of the contract.

	Michelle and Barack Obama were supposed to see Rob Reiner and Michele Singer the day they were killed, the former First Lady revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live Monday night.


	Reiner was a longtime activist, supporter of progressive causes, and booster of the Democratic Party, and as Obama noted, she and her husband had known the Reiners for “many, many years.” She added, “We were supposed to be seeing them that night, last night. And we got the news. Let me just say this, unlike some people, Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know.” (That seemed to be a not-so-subtle nod to President Donald Trump, who mocked Reiner after hearing the news.) 


	The Reiners were killed at their home on Sunday, Dec. 14. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, was arrested later that night and eventually booked for murder. He remains in custody without bail, and a court hearing is expected to happen today.


	Along with all his peers, friends, and admirers in the entertainment world, Reiner was also mourned by many in politics, especially those on the left. Though best known for his comedy, Reiner's work often had a sharp political edge, especially his two career-defining films with Aaron Sorkin, A Few Good Men and The American President. 

	











	“What they have always been are passionate people in a time when there's not a lot of courage going on,” Obama said on Kimmel. “They were the kind of people who were ready to put their actions behind what they cared about. And they cared about their family, and they cared about this country, and they cared about fairness and equity.”

	In his own statement, Barack Obama said that all of Reiner's stories were imbued with “a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.” He added, “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”


	Other tributes were also shared by Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Bill and Hillary Clinton.

							By 

	Emily Zemler



Donald Trump has sued the BBC for up to $10 billion in damages, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation and of violating a trade practices law. The lawsuit is based on an edit of a speech given by Trump on Jan. 6, 2021 in a documentary that aired ahead of the 2024 presidential election. 


	According to a complaint filed in Florida on Monday night, Trump alleges that the broadcaster “intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively” edited his speech, which was used in an episode of the BBC‘s Panorama. The president is seeking $5 billion in damages each on two counts. The first count is defamation, while the second count says the BBC violated Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act by allegedly licensing the program outside of the U.K. 


	The lawsuit suggests that viewers in Florida may have watched the Panorama episode by using a VPN or via streaming service BritBox. “The Panorama Documentary's publicity, coupled with significant increases in VPN usage in Florida since its debut, establishes the immense likelihood that citizens of Florida accessed the Documentary before the BBC had it removed,” the filing says. According to The Guardian, the episode never aired in the U.S. 

	











	The Panorama edit was comprised of two different sections of Trump's speech, taken from almost an hour apart. The series suggested Trump said, “We're going to walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”


	The lawsuit claims that the network made “a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump, which was published in a BBC Panorama documentary, that was fabricated and aired by the defendants one week before the 2024 presidential election in a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the election's outcome to President Trump's detriment.”

	











	It also notes, “The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses. Accordingly, President Trump brings this action for compensatory and punitive damages for the extensive reputational harm inflicted upon him by the defendants.”

	Trump initially threatened to sue the BBC last month. He teased the impending lawsuit yesterday, telling reporters at the White House, “In a little while, you'll be seeing I'm suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth. Literally, they put words in my mouth. They had me saying things that I never said coming out.”


	In November, the BBC apologized for the edit and acknowledged the editing was an “error of judgment” after a leaked internal BBC memo criticized how the speech was edited. BBC's director general, Tim Davie, and its head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned. The BBC has not addressed the lawsuit, but has covered it as news.

	A spokesperson for Trump told The Guardian, “The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda. President Trump's powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing.”


	Trump has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit since its filing.

	Universal Pictures has released the first trailer for Steven Spielberg‘s next film, “Disclosure Day.”


	The movie stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Spielberg developed the science fiction story with screenwriter David Koepp, who previously collaborated with the director as a writer on “Jurassic Park,” “Jurassic Park: The Lost World,” “War of the Worlds” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”

	Here's the logline: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … ‘Disclosure Day.'”




			Popular on Variety		







	The trailer shows Blunt playing a meteorologist who is suddenly overcome by a mysterious, extraterrestrial force while delivering a weather report live on air. O'Connor stars as a man who wants to reveal the truth of alien life to the rest of the world. The rest of the trailer is filled with crop circles, car chases, creepy animals and hints that there is life outside of the humans on Earth.


	“Disclosure Day” is the 37th film that Spielberg has directed since his (partially lost) debut in 1964 — coincidentally, that initial feature, “Firelight,” was also a science fiction film. He has returned to the genre in several films over the years including the two “Jurassic Park” movies and “War of the Worlds” as well as “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” “Minority Report,” “A.I. Artificial Intelligence” and “Ready Player One.”

	











	The cumulative box office gross of Spielberg's directing filmography is over $10 billion worldwide. As a director and producer, he has been nominated for over 23 Academy Awards, taking home three including best director wins for “Schindler's List” and “Saving Private Ryan” in 1993 and 1998, respectively. His most recent film, 2023's semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans” grossed $45 million and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture. 


	Universal will release “Disclosure Day” in theaters on June 12. It is produced by Spielberg alongside Kristie Macosko Krieger at Amblin Entertainment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Misha Collins' First Supernatural Scene Was So Bad, He Had To Reshoot It The Next Day","https://www.slashfilm.com/2014761/misha-collins-first-supernatural-scene-bad-reshot/","Tue, 16 Dec 2025 01:00:00 GMT","

Misha Collins originally auditioned to play a demon on ""Supernatural,"" so he can be forgiven for needing some time to get acquainted with Castiel, the angelic character he ended up playing in Eric Kripke's horror drama. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins and his co-stars, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, looked back at his ""Supernatural"" debut, with Collins sharing an interesting detail about having to reshoot his first scene.

Castiel first appears in season 4's ""Lazarus Rising"" episode, which is often regarded as one of the best installments of ""Supernatural."" The character's grand entrance sees him storm into a building where Dean and Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) are holding up, absorbing a hail of bullets as he walks toward them, looking completely unfazed. It's a great scene, but the creators weren't happy with Collins' early takes. As he told it:

""My debut performance on 'Supernatural' was so substandard that we did a reshoot the next day, because they got the dailies back of my creepy performance and they were like...""

Despite being heavily involved in the scene, Ackles didn't recall being summoned back for reshoots, suggesting that Collins was the only actor who didn't live up to expectations at the time. That said, the Castiel star went on to become a major part of the show until ""Supernatural"" season 15, proving that the creators must have been happy with his overall performance. However, reshoots pale in comparison to Collins' worst experiences on ""Supernatural,"" as playing Castiel caused permanent damage to his health.

Misha Collins' first outing as Castiel didn't please the creators of ""Supernatural,"" but he got better, and he took the role very seriously from that moment on. In fact, Collins was so dedicated to playing the character that he developed a sore throat through the voice he put on for the show — and the actor has carried that pain around with him since the series ended. As Collins told TVInsider:

""So I went to the doctor and was like, 'I don't know what's going on, but I have a sore throat that's not going away.' I got checked for strep, and it's not strep. I was literally causing damage to my vocal cords. So, that's something that I carried with me from Castiel. Actual physical trauma.""

Collins noted that he never expected to become a ""Supernatural"" mainstay following his debut, so he might have taken precautions to protect his vocal cords if he knew how long his tenure would last. Still, at least he got to be part of a hit series for a very long time, which is as good a reason as any to suffer.","{'href': 'https://www.slashfilm.com', 'title': 'SlashFilm'}","other"

​PSYOP has signed Studio Showoff for US representation, bringing the Melbourne-based animation shop's irreverent sense of humour and standout character design into its award-winning global collective.

Founded by directors Ivan Dixon and Sean Zwan, Studio Showoff has been delighting (and occasionally melting) minds with animation that is as visually inventive as it is laugh-out-loud funny. From original series and festival-favourite shorts to music videos and brand work, the studio channels a rare blend of razor-sharp humour and conceptual chaos. The studio's comedic sensibility and cultural fluency have earned them high-profile collaborations, including work with ‘Saturday Night Live', where they animated comedy sketches featuring the likes of Jack Black and Timothée Chalamet.

Their ability to handle the entire animation pipeline—writing through post—allows them to shape timing, performance, and humour at every step. This has led to a portfolio which spans iconic music videos for Childish Gambino and Elton John; ad campaigns for HBO, Disney, Hulu, and Adult Swim; and distinctive contributions to major pop-culture titles including 'The Simpsons', 'Rick & Morty', 'Adventure Time', and AAA game franchises like ‘Fallout' and ‘Wolfenstein'.

“Studio Showoff's comedic storytelling chops are second to none,” said Andrew Linsk, PSYOP EP, head of global partnerships. “The guys are also true animation nerds in the best sense, and can work across many different styles including anime, rubberhose, 8-bit, and more. We've been fans for years and are very excited to welcome them to the PSYOP constellation of talent.”

Recent achievements include Ivan's acclaimed short ‘Plumpin', which screened at Pictoplasma and Animafest and won Best Australian Film at the 2025 Melbourne International Animation Festival; and ‘American Sikh', led by Sean, which screened at Tribeca and earned the 2025 Webby Award for Best Animation amongst others. “Comedy is our compass,” said Ivan and Sean. “We love making work that feels alive—carried out by visuals that are as wild as the ideas behind them. Joining PSYOP gives us the perfect playground to keep pushing with that goal in mind alongside partners who want to laugh, experiment, and try ridiculous things at the highest creative level.”

This pairing further strengthens PSYOP's ability to deliver animated comedy. By tapping Studio Showoff's unique approach and comedic precision, the partnership positions both teams at the forefront of entertainment.","{'href': 'https://lbbonline.com', 'title': 'Little Black Book | LBBOnline'}","other"

Erika Kirk and Candace Owens met on Monday, days after Charlie Kirk's widow joined a CBS town hall and said she wanted Owens to stop peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband's assassination.

Both Kirk and Owens confirmed Monday evening that they had spoken, referring to the conversation as ""productive"" in separate posts on X. They did not share details from the meeting, but Owens said it lasted four and a half hours, and they ""agreed much more than I had anticipated.""

Kirk previously said on X Sunday that she and Owens would have a ""private, in-person meeting"" Monday. She added that they ""agreed that public discussions, livestreams, and tweets are on hold until after this meeting"" and that she's looking forward to a ""productive discussion.""

Owens wrote on X that she's ""very much looking forward to this discussion.""

Erika Kirk sat down with CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss last week for a town hall that aired Saturday on CBS. Weiss asked Erika Kirk what she would want to say to Owens, who has been amplifying conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination.

""Stop,"" Erika Kirk said. ""That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.""

Owens, a onetime friend of Charlie Kirk's and a former employee of his conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA, previously compared their relationship to that of a ""brother and sister.""

The day after his assassination, she posted a lengthy video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. In the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.

The Treasury Department has since confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk oversees are under investigation by the IRS.

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Moscow will under no circumstances agree to the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine in any form, including within the NATO framework, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with ABC News.

""We are open-minded in terms of what decisions might be made. We definitely will not at any time subscribe to, agree to, or even be content with, any presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,"" the senior diplomat said.

When asked further whether Russia would be prepared to agree to the deployment of European forces in Ukraine outside the NATO framework, Ryabkov replied: ""No, no, no. The coalition of the willing is just the same. May be even worse, because it may be arranged without usual NATO procedures that are more or less stable. Nothing is stable in the Western world these days.

District attorney's office has until Wednesday to file charges against Nick Reiner following deaths of his parents

Los Angeles investigators are expected on Tuesday to lay out their case against Nick Reiner, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering his parents, the actor-director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.

Detectives from the Los Angeles police department's (LAPD) homicide division took Nick, 32, into custody on Sunday night, hours after his parents were found dead in their Brentwood home, the department announced on Monday.

The police said that on 14 December, around 3.40pm local time, LAPD officers responded to a call of a death investigation in the 200 block of South Chadbourne Avenue.

They said that once inside the residence, officers discovered two victims, who were later identified as Rob and Michele.

Authorities said that as a result of the initial investigation, it was determined that the Reiners were the victims of homicide and they said that the investigation “further revealed” that their son, Nick, “was responsible for their deaths”. Authorities did not provide any additional details.

Nick was located and arrested at around 9.15pm local time, police said, and was booked for murder. He was being held without bail.

The police said the case would be presented to the Los Angeles county attorney's Office on Tuesday for filing consideration.

Alan Jackson, Nick Reiner's defense attorney, told reporters that his client had not received medical clearance to appear in court and would not do so before Wednesday.

It will be up to the DA's office to charge Reiner with specific counts, per CNN.

The Los Angeles district attorney's office has until Wednesday to formally file the charges.

On Monday, the Los Angeles police chief, Jim McDonnell, confirmed that Nick had been “booked for murder” in connection with his parents' killings and called the deaths “very tragic”.

Nick Reiner had previously struggled with addiction and mental health, and co-wrote a screenplay based on his experiences that was made into a 2015 film directed by his father. A family friend told the Los Angeles Times that Nick was living at the family property in Brentwood and that Michele Reiner was recently worried about his mental health.

The evening before the killings, Rob and Nick Reiner were heard arguing at a Christmas party at comedian Conan O'Brien's home, media outlets reported.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The House speaker still has Trump's backing, but a growing number of his female colleagues have had enough.

Frustrations are mounting in the Republican conference despite the GOP controlling the House, the Senate, and the White House. There is a growing feeling — from women specifically — that they just can't get anything done.

The target of members' ire? House Speaker Mike Johnson. Multiple high-profile congresswomen have spoken out publicly about their dissatisfaction, accusing him of “undercutting” the women of the House. Some have even chosen to retire and seek other opportunities.

So why are these women mad, and can Johnson right the ship? Today, Explained co-host Noel King talked to NBC News reporter Melanie Zanona to find out.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Who is speaking out against Mike Johnson and why?

Starting with [Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene, her complaints with Johnson are similar to what she's been saying when it comes to Donald Trump. She's extremely frustrated that they haven't been putting more bills on the floor that are actually related to some of the things they campaigned on, particularly the affordability issue.

Then there's [Rep.] Elise Stefanik, who really raised some eyebrows when she went on the record with her criticisms in a Wall Street Journal interview. Her criticisms of Johnson were about his political acumen. She says he's not a good strategist. She said that if a vote were held today, she doesn't think he would be elected speaker again, which is a pretty bold statement coming from someone on Johnson's own leadership team.

[Rep.] Anna Paulina Luna is a little bit of a different case. She's been advocating for specific pieces of legislation that she wants to get to the floor. She believes that Mike Johnson has made promises behind closed doors and then not kept those promises when it comes to actually putting those bills on the floor. The prime example of this is a stock trading ban that she's been advocating for. She does not want members of Congress to be able to trade stocks. There is huge bipartisan support for that bill. Johnson initially suggested that he would be willing to put a bill like that on the floor, but in Anna Paulina Luna's view, she believes that it's being slow-walked.

What are Mike Johnson's views on women, and are they mainstream?

He recently did a podcast with Katie Miller. That is Stephen Miller's wife — Stephen Miller, of course, is a White House aide. It was a much more casual setting. He was with his wife, Kelly, during the interview. He made an offhanded comment about how he would want [Rep.] Lisa McClain — that's the conference chair, the one woman in leadership — to be the one to cook his Thanksgiving dinner.

Now, in his defense, Lisa McClain does talk a lot about cooking, and she kind of presents that sort of persona herself. But for some Republican women, that really rubbed them the wrong way. And you combine that with the fact that women feel frustrated about not being elevated and having this bottleneck in terms of leadership, and I think that is why you're seeing this explosion of frustration right now.

One of the less sympathetic responses I've seen to the Republican women who have been complaining is that the Republican Party is very sexist: “How did you guys not know that?” Is there a measure of truth to the idea that the Republican Party traditionally sidelines women?

Traditionally, the Republican Party did not put an emphasis on trying to elect women. They always said, “We don't want to play identity politics; we just want the best candidate to win.”

But at some point, Republicans realized, hey, sometimes the best candidate is a woman, and they're not getting the same opportunities as men, particularly in primaries. This is where it's a huge issue, because women do have young kids and families, and they face bigger challenges when it comes to running. It's very difficult to run a campaign. They need resources. They need fundraising. They need party structural tools and resources behind them in order to succeed in a primary and get over that finish line. And Republicans, for a long time, were not placing an emphasis on that.

But in recent years, there was a recognition — and Elise Stefanik actually played a huge part in this — that they need to elect more Republican women and that women can actually flip key vulnerable seats, which they did after 2018. We saw historic lows in the number of Republican women represented in Congress, and the party made a huge effort to recruit more women. A lot of them ended up winning. A lot of them were responsible for flipping key seats in subsequent cycles.

But I think, traditionally, Republicans have been so scared of saying, “We're purposely trying to elect women. We don't play identity politics; that's what Democrats do.” And that's why, even though there are more Republican women than there have been in the past, they are still way behind where Democratic women are.

How is Speaker Mike Johnson responding to all of this?

He's pretty frustrated. I've heard behind the scenes that he's been complaining about some of the reports, and he's gone on to defend himself.

He's been asked directly by reporters — including some of my colleagues after I wrote the story — about his posture toward women. And he's vehemently denying that he's marginalizing women, that he looks at or treats them any differently.

But we have not seen him take any actual steps to try to alleviate some of their concerns.

Johnson has a really narrow majority on Capitol Hill. It would seem to me that he can't afford to make enemies.

He absolutely can't afford any enemies in this conference, and he already has one in Marjorie Taylor Greene, who votes against everything. And another in Republican Rep. Thomas Massie. He pretty much votes no on almost everything that comes to the floor, including voting against Mike Johnson's speakership. When you do the math, you can't really afford any other Republicans voting no.

That being said, Johnson has a degree of confidence because no one expected him to get the job in the first place. He defied expectations there. He has been able to usher some really big bills through the House, including — as Trump calls it — the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the big tax law they passed that also included Medicaid cuts. And the primary reason he feels confident is that he still has Donald Trump's backing.

Because of that, I do believe Johnson feels like he's okay for now. But he knows better than anyone that every single vote counts. Getting that majority next year is going to be critical — not just winning the majority, but making sure they have a bigger margin than they have now.
