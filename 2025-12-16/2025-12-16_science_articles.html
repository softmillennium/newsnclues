                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vessels brimming with coins suggest a convenient method of hiding savings underground. There was (obviously) no such thing as online banking 1,700 years ago. While the ancient Romans did adopt early banking systems from ancient Greece, the most convenient way to put aside cash that would have simply been transfered into a savings account over a thousand years later was remained stashing it in a vessel that was later buried. Wherever the Roman Empire spread, its customs came with it. The empire and all its wealth extended through France, and archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) have now unearthed three clay amphorae overflowing with coins. Found at a site in Senon, northeastern France, makeshift piggy banks were buried in a pit beneath the lime concrete floor of what was likely someone's living room. The research team found more than 40,000 coins, weighing about 183 pounds in total. “Contrary to what one might think at first glance, it is not certain that these are ‘treasures' that were hidden during a period of insecurity,” numismatist Vincent Geneviève, who studies ancient currency, said in a statement from INRAP. “Many other explanations are possible, and these deposits should be seen instead as a snapshot of complex monetary management, planned over the medium to long term, within a household or administration, capable of making deposits and withdrawals at various intervals.” These Celtic people, or Gauls, lived in the region during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar's forces conquered parts of Belgium, France, and Switzerland between 57 and 50 B.C.E. Geneviève found some 23,000 to 24,000 coins in the first amphora (weighing a total of 83 pounds), and 18,000 to 19,000 in the second amphora (weighing a total of 110 pounds). Because the reserves of coins were buried between 280 and 310 C.E., it is thought that they may be associated with the Roman military occupation at Senon—whether they belonged to Roman warriors or Mediomatrici, however, is unclear. Rooms are separated by brick walls, with multiple pits that may have been latrines or spaces for storage. What they were actually used for will be determined by lab analysis. It seems that Senon was heavily influenced by its Roman conquerors. INRAP officials, therefore, do not think that there was a rush to bury these coins because of impending disaster. “Their exceptional nature lies less in the discovery of a large quantity of coins (some thirty coin hoards are known in the Meuse department alone) than in the possibility of documenting their depositional context so precisely,” Geneviève said, “which is rare.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All living organisms adapt in order to survive, and bacteria are no exception. Over many decades, some bacteria have gradually become resistant to widely used antibiotics and disinfectants, creating serious challenges for medicine and public health. Inside the human mouth, roughly 700 different bacterial species constantly exchange information through a process called quorum sensing. This chemical communication allows bacteria to coordinate their actions as a group. Many oral bacteria rely on signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to send and receive these messages. Their goal was to determine if interfering with these signals could help prevent plaque buildup and support a healthier oral microbiome. The researchers discovered several important patterns in how oral bacteria communicate and organize themselves: "Dental plaque develops in a sequence, much like a forest ecosystem," said Mikael Elias, associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences and senior author of the study. Increasingly diverse late colonizers include the 'red complex' bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are strongly linked to periodontal disease. "What's particularly striking is how oxygen availability changes everything," said lead author Rakesh Sikdar. Quorum sensing may play very different roles above and below the gumline, which has major implications for how we approach treatment of periodontal diseases." The researchers plan to next examine how bacterial signaling differs across various regions of the mouth and among patients at different stages of periodontal disease. "Understanding how bacterial communities communicate and organize themselves may ultimately give us new tools to prevent periodontal disease -- not by waging war on all oral bacteria, but by strategically maintaining a healthy microbial balance," said Elias.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorectal cancer has long been viewed as a condition that primarily affects older adults. That assumption is changing as more cases are now being diagnosed in younger people, a shift that is raising concern among health experts around the world. Public awareness increased sharply after the death of actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 at age 43, which highlighted the growing number of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases occurring in people under 50 and challenged long-standing ideas about who is most at risk. At the same time, advances in genetic testing are opening new possibilities for prevention and earlier detection. Researchers believe this global pattern reflects broad changes in daily life, including shifts in diet, reduced physical activity, urban living, and environmental exposures. Specialists emphasize that earlier screening, healthier eating habits, and stronger public education are essential to slow this trend. Without effective intervention, experts warn that early-onset CRC cases are likely to continue rising over the coming decades. One example comes from Kazakhstan, where a population study found that average meat consumption was almost double the World Cancer Research Fund's recommended limit of 500 grams per week. The same study showed that only 8.6% of participants consumed fish at recommended levels, a pattern that may contribute to nutritional imbalances linked to higher cancer risk. Excess body fat can drive chronic inflammation and interfere with normal metabolic processes. However, researchers note that obesity's role may be more complex than it appears. An analysis of 18 studies revealed that many CRC patients experience unintended weight loss before diagnosis, suggesting that standard measures used to assess obesity-related risk may not fully capture its impact. Genetics also plays a significant role in early-onset colorectal cancer. According to Dr. Alexei Tsukanov, head of the Laboratory of Genetics at the National Medical Research Center for Radiology, many younger CRC cases are linked to inherited cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. These disorders are caused by mutations in tumor-suppressor genes, which sharply increase the likelihood of developing CRC at a younger age. Despite the importance of early diagnosis, warning signs are often overlooked. "Identifying a hereditary mutation allows us to implement lifelong clinical monitoring and early intervention, significantly improving survival rates," he explains. Tools such as BGI Genomics' COLOTECT® Stool DNA Methylation Test identifies CRC-related genetic markers (SDC2, ADHFE1, and PPP2R5C) through stool DNA analysis, providing a non-invasive approach to identifying cancer-related changes at an earlier stage. In parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, screening programs remain uneven. Countries including Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Latvia, and Georgia have established national screening efforts, while others depend on opportunistic testing. Education is seen as a critical step toward improving outcomes. Younger adults are increasingly affected, with unhealthy lifestyle patterns playing a major role. Addressing this growing challenge will require coordinated action from governments, healthcare systems, and individuals to raise awareness, support healthier choices, and expand access to early screening.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Humans have been modifying their skull shapes since prehistory, but the discovery of a cube-shaped skull has researchers scratching their (round-shaped) heads. Most of these examples—both historical and contemporary—form pointed skulls by binding an infant's head while the skull bones fuse (typically up until the age of two). It's not incredibly common to see a cube-shaped skull, but the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) recently reported one such discovery in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas near the Balcón de Montezuma—an archaeological site occupied by various ethnic groups between 650 B.C.E and 1200 C.E. As the archaeologists sifted through these finds, they discovered what appeared to be a parallelepiped, or cube-shaped, skull. Artificial skull deformation was a common practice among the Maya, but hasn't been documented in this particular site. “Not only was intentional cranial deformation identified for the first time for this type of site, but also a variant with respect to the models recognized in Mesoamerica, not reported, until now, in the area,” biological anthropologist Jesús Ernesto Velasco González said in a translated press statement. Velasco González noted that similar deformations occurred at the El Zapotal archaeological site in Veracruz, located further south along the Gulf of Mexico, so scientists tried to piece together potential migration leaks. “Stable oxygen isotope studies in collagen and bioapatite samples from bone and teeth, a technique used to infer the geographic origin of the second individual's skeletal remains, indicate that he was born, lived, and died in this part of the mountains,” Velasco González said in a press statement. “Therefore, the results rule out a direct mobility relationship with the groups of El Zapotal or those further south.” Although the health effects are debated, it's largely believed that this practice doesn't decrease the size of the skull, and as such, health impacts are mostly negligible (though some research has asserted that the practice could impact cognitive or memory function). ➡ Inside the Secret Island Where Death Is Optional ➡ This Tech Rebel Threw Away $900 Million in a Municipal Dump. ➡ Sex Workers, LSD, and Mind Control: What Happened in the CIA's Lab of Nightmares at 225 Chestnut Street ➡ NASA Has a Plan to Save Earth from Planet-Destroying Asteroids. ➡ A Naval Officer Says Underwater UFOs Are Legitimate Threats. ➡ This Undersea Explorer Found America's Greatest Sunken Treasure. ➡ Is Bigfoot Hiding in the Swamps of Florida? ➡ Scientists May Have Gotten the Global-Warming Timeline Seriously Wrong. ➡ Scientists Successfully Revive a Dead Brain, Redefining the Boundary Between Life and Death ➡ For 80 Years, the North Sea Held a Deadly Killer.

Anil Shanker is a senior vice-president for research and innovation at Meharry Medical College and a cancer immunologist at its School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. This is welcome news — but doesn't redress their chronic underfunding. Data reported in 2024 show combined HBCU endowment assets around $100,000 per student. As a scientist and administrator at Meharry Medical College — a 150-year-old private historically Black health-sciences institution in Nashville, Tennessee, with some 1,500 students — I've seen how hard it can be to manage on scant budgets. In the meantime, HBCUs and TCUs can target their investments, as Meharry has done with some success. We also expanded our number of sponsors and monitored how funds were used. First, we established transdisciplinary pilot grants of $50,000–$75,000 per faculty member lasting for 12–18 months — funded by federal research endowments or private foundations — to seed ideas and support core staff and infrastructure.

(2025)Cite this article Here we present the ambiphilic reactivity of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in the stereoselective synthesis of diverse cyclopropanes from olefins, under palladium(II) catalysis. The sulfonyl fluoride functionality serves as both an acidifying group and an internal oxidant within the ambiphile, enabling successive carbopalladation and oxidative addition steps in the catalytic cycle, respectively. The transformation grants access to cis-substituted cyclopropanes and exhibits broad compatibility with various alkyl sulfonyl fluorides, including those bearing –CN, –CO2R, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl and aryl groups. With internal alkene substrates, 1,2,3-trisubstituted cyclopropanes that are otherwise challenging to synthesize are formed in good-to-moderate yields and predictable diastereoselectivity. Detailed mechanistic insights from reaction progress kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the SN2-type C–SO2F oxidative addition is the turnover-limiting and diastereoselectivity-determining step. Organosulfonyl fluorides have emerged as central players in organic synthesis1,2,3, owing to the rise of sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEX) chemistry, which enables rapid and reliable diversification through nucleophilic displacement of fluoride with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles4,5,6. The utility of organosulfonyl fluorides in this context has motivated the development of a growing number of methods to synthesize structurally diverse sulfonyl fluorides in an efficient, selective and modular manner7,8,9,10,11 (Fig. a, Modern synthetic usages of sulfonyl fluoride reagents. b, C–C bond formation with alkyl sulfonyl fluorides. ESF, ethenesulfonyl fluoride; SASF, 2-substituted-alkynyl-1-sulfonyl fluoride. In contrast to widely studied aryl-12,13,14,15,16,17, alkenyl-18,19,20,21 and alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides11, alkyl sulfonyl fluorides have been less thoroughly investigated despite offering unique opportunities as synthetic building blocks owing to the acidifying effect of the sulfonyl group on the α-protons5. In recent work, Bull developed an elegant series of desulfonative couplings of azetidine and oxetane sulfonyl fluorides for C–heteroatom bond formation22,23. Prior work has demonstrated the utility of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in C–C bond formation through reaction with classical electrophiles, such as alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds, in the presence of base16,17,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 (Fig. We surmised that alkyl sulfonyl fluorides could exhibit unique ambiphilic reactivity in transition metal catalysis, capitalizing on the ability of the sulfonyl fluoride group to serve the dual role as a pronucleophile activator and electrophilic reactive group (internal oxidant). Our laboratory previously developed a palladium-catalysed anti-cyclopropanation of olefins with various carbon pronucleophiles and I2 as the bystanding oxidant, where the hypothesized mechanism involves initial α-iodination of the nucleophile, directed carbopalladation, PdII/PdIV oxidative addition of the newly formed C(sp3)–I bond and, finally, C(sp3)–C(sp3) reductive elimination from the palladacyclobutane intermediate31. The need for doubly activated carbon pronucleophiles in all cases but nitromethane limits the scope of substituted cyclopropanes that can be accessed with this method, leading us to search for alternative nucleophilic coupling partners in which a leaving group and an acidifying group could be merged into the same entity. Here, we demonstrate alkyl sulfonyl fluorides acting as ambiphilic coupling partners in the stereoselective cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins through the PdII/PdIV redox couple. The catalytic cycle leverages a novel mode of reactivity, C(sp3)–SO2F bonds oxidatively adding to organopalladium(II) intermediates, to deliver stereochemical outcomes that are inaccessible using conventional leaving groups32,33,34,35 (Fig. While this paper was in revision, Mane and Baidya reported a directed cyclopropanation reaction involving ketone-derived sulfoxonium ylides to access related cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclopropane products36. In this context, alkenyl amide 1a, featuring the 8-aminoquinoline directing auxiliary required for reactivity31, and alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a were selected as model substrates. After extensive screening, we identified optimal reaction conditions using a combination of Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%) and Na2CO3 (1.0 equiv.) in dimethylacetamide (DMA) (0.33 M) under a nitrogen atmosphere to afford cyclopropane 3aa in 94% yield with 98:2 diastereomeric ratio (d.r. ); the unusual cis-configuration of the major product was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction37,38,39,40,41,42 (Table 1). Key findings from our optimization campaign include the important role of Na2CO3 as the base, as other carbonate salts, such as K2CO3 and Cs2CO3, led to substantially lower yields (entries 2 and 3), as did bases with other counteranions (entries 4 and 5). Other commonly used PdII sources, such as PdCl2 and Pd(TFA)2 (where TFA is trifluoroacetate), gave slightly lower yields and comparable diastereoselectivity (entries 6 and 7). Increasing the concentration of the reaction mixture decreased the yield (entry 8). The use of a polar aprotic solvent was crucial, and dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were reasonably effective alternatives to DMA (entries 9–13). We were also pleased to find that the reaction gave 92% yield even when set up and run under air with anhydrous DMA (entry 14). In control experiments, we found that changing the leaving group to sulfonyl chloride (LG2), phenyl sulfonyl (LG3) or methyl sulfonyl (LG4) groups led to no reaction or trace product formation (entry 15), indicating that the sulfonyl fluoride is key for the observed reaction. A representative sulfonium bromide sulfur ylide precursor (LG5) gave moderate yields but poor d.r. Beyond sulfur-based leaving groups, halides were also tested but found to be ineffective. An additional control experiment revealed that 2a furnished a different product, a tri-substituted cyclopropane with the –SO2F group intact, when subjected to previously reported conditions for PdII-catalysed cyclopropanation31 (see ‘Pd(0) salt screening and control experiments' section in Supplementary Information). In seeking to rationalize the optimization data, we considered previous reports that found alkyl sulfonyl fluorides, such as phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), to be highly unstable in aqueous solutions43. We questioned whether yield differences could be partially attributed to the competitive decomposition of the nucleophile under different conditions (in different solvents and in the presence or absence of adventitious water). To this end, we examined the stability of alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a in DMA, DMF and DMSO (see Table 2 and ‘Stability tests' section in Supplementary Information for details). Surprisingly, alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a was fully decomposed in anhydrous DMSO after 2 h but proved to be relatively stable in anhydrous DMF. Similarly, we found no decomposition of alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a in anhydrous DMA under an inert atmosphere. However, under air, moderate levels of decomposition in DMA could be detected, and complete decomposition was observed in wet DMA. Under aerobic conditions, oxidation and subsequent decomposition of DMA into N-methylacetamide and formaldehyde has been previously documented and could be a contributing factor to these observations44. These results indicate that the rate of decomposition of 2a is dependent on the solvent identity and amount of adventitious water in the solution. Having optimized the conditions, we began investigating the scope with respect to the alkyl sulfonyl fluoride, many of which are commercially available or readily accessible using routine procedures (see ‘General procedures for starting material preparation' section in Supplementary Information) (Fig. The reaction proceeded in moderate-to-excellent yields with various ester nucleophiles, including ethyl ester (3ab), tert-butyl ester (3ac), benzyl ester (3ad), allyl ester (3ae) and phenyl ester (3af), providing the corresponding cis-cyclopropanes as the major products with high diastereoselectivity and without appreciable base-mediated epimerization45. Amide or nitrile-based coupling partners (3ag–3ah) led to diminished yield but maintained excellent cis-diastereoselectivity (>20:1). We found that the reaction could tolerate weaker electron-withdrawing groups, including a 2-bromopropenyl group (3ai) and various heterocycles, including isoxazole (3aj) and 1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (3ak), which gave 32%, 43% and 20% yield, respectively. An α-aryl alkyl sulfonyl fluoride nucleophile participated in the reaction to form a fully substituted carbon centre within the cyclopropane, albeit with moderate yield and d.r. Aryl-substituted methylene sulfonyl fluorides were also investigated. Interestingly, the reaction did not proceed with unsubstituted, electron-neutral benzylsulfonyl fluoride, but proceeded with substituted benzylsulfonyl fluoride substrates bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position (3am–3ap). Stronger electron-withdrawing groups led to improved yields and diastereoselectivity. A meta-nitro substrate was also tolerated (3aq). Reactions performed on 0.1 mmol scale. Percentages represent isolated yields. was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of crude or purified reaction mixture. The diastereomeric centre is highlighted with a blue circle. aReactions performed under 20 mol% catalyst loading. bReactions performed under 5 equiv. alkyl fluoride loading. cReactions performed under 24 h. dReactions performed under 36 h. Next, the scope of alkenes was investigated. Internal alkenes afforded good-to-moderate yields (4aa–4ae). Notably, (Z)-alkenes reacted with excellent diastereoselectivity (>20:1), affording a single diastereomer. To our delight, under the standard condition, the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable all-cis cyclopropane could be synthesized from an (E)-configured internal alkene in one step in moderate yield (4ad) with 1.1:1 d.r. In addition, α-substituted β,γ-unsaturated amide substrates are well tolerated, giving the desired products in moderate-to-excellent yields (4af–4ai). Specifically, a diene substrate (4ag) could be chemoselectively cyclopropanated at the β,γ-alkene, while leaving the δ,ε-alkene unperturbed. When the tether length between the alkene and directing group was extended and a γ,δ-unsaturated amide was tested, the cyclopropane product was furnished in moderate yield with excellent diastereoselectivity (4ak). The methodology could be easily scaled up and performed on 1.0-mmol scale under the standard reaction conditions, giving cis-cyclopropane 3aa in 86% yield (Fig. Performing the reaction on 100 mmol scale resulted in 81% yield with 9:1 d.r. Removal of the directing auxiliary was possible through a two-step sequence46. Initial introduction of an N-Boc activating group proceeded in 83% yield (5aa). Then, hydrolysis with LiOOH/water gave carboxylic acid 6aa in 86% yield on multigram-scale, which has been commercialized by Enamine (Fig. Alternatively, a representative amine could be used in the second step in a net transamidation (58% yield, 6ab). If desired by the practitioner, the loading of nucleophile 2a can be lowered to 1.5 equiv. while maintaining comparable yield and diastereoselectivity with a dual base system (0.75 equiv. NaF and 0.25 equiv. 3c; see ‘Base screening at lower nucleophile loading' section in Supplementary Information for details). a, Large-scale synthesis. b, Directing auxiliary removal. c, Lower nucleophile loading. DMAP, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine; Boc, tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Bn, benzyl. The distinctive reactivity of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in this cyclopropanation, along with the observed stereochemical outcomes, prompted us to examine the mechanism through experimental and computational techniques. We performed reaction progress kinetic analysis to determine key mechanistic features of the reaction from a minimal number of experiments47. First, we compared the standard reaction profile with a ‘same excess' experiment that simulated 25% conversion (Fig. Time-shifting reveals that the two curves overlap as the reaction proceeds to approximately 50% conversion; beyond this point, a slight deviation emerges—an indication of either mild product inhibition or partial catalyst deactivation. To distinguish between the two possibilities, a third experiment was performed with product 3aa (83 mM) as an additive, and overlay with the same excess experiment confirmed mild catalyst deactivation. The lack of product inhibition is notable given the capacity of the product to bind to the catalyst in a polydentate fashion. To explore potential coordination between the product and catalyst further, 3aa was treated with Pd(OAc)2 (1 equiv. ), resulting in the formation of N,N,C-palladacycle Pd–3aa in which the 3 °C (cyclopropyl)–H bond was cleaved (Fig. 4b) as characterized by X-ray crystallography48. Complex Pd–3aa proved to be catalytically competent under the standard reaction conditions, showing the reversibility of C–H activation, consistent with the lack of product inhibition. Next, to estimate the order of the reaction components, we performed a series of ‘different excess' experiments (Fig. Considering that catalyst deactivation becomes more pronounced at higher conversion, we focused on the early stages of the reaction (<50% conversion). The variable time normalization analysis49 plot showed both alkene (1a) and nucleophile (2a) to be close to zero-order and Pd(OAc)2 to be close to first-order. Overall, the kinetic data are consistent with either oxidative addition or reductive elimination as the rate-determining step. To gain further insights into the rate-determining step, we conducted an Eyring analysis to obtain activation parameters (Fig. At temperatures close to standard conditions (70–100 °C), the experimental ΔS‡ was determined to be −25.8 e.u. and ΔH‡ to be 16.1 kcal mol−1 (ΔG‡80°C = 25.2 kcal mol−1). Given that large negative ΔS‡ values are commonly observed with bimolecular associative reactions50, and oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the current system are unimolecular steps, the data suggest potential desolvation and coordination of a ligand to the metal centre in traversing from the catalyst resting state to the rate-limiting transition state along the potential energy surface, which informed subsequent density functional theory (DFT) calculations. a, Reaction progress kinetic analysis: same excess. b, Product binding experiments. c, Variable time normalization analysis. d, Eyring analysis. Source data DFT calculations with alkene 1a and alkyl sulfonyl fluoride nucleophile 2a as model substrates were performed to gain insights into various facets of the catalytic cycle, including the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining steps (Fig. A particular focus was placed on the oxidative addition mechanisms and the origin of diastereoselectivity favouring the cis-cyclopropane product 3aa. Ligand exchange of the precatalyst Pd(OAc)2 with 1a forms π-alkene PdII complex Pd-1 with the 8-aminoquinoline directing group binding to the Pd in a bidentate fashion. Two competing anti-nucleopalladation transition states with the deprotonated nucleophile 2aʹ were considered (TS1 and TS1ʹ), which lead to two different diastereomers of the palladacycle intermediate (A and Aʹ, respectively). The deprotonation of 2a to form 2aʹ is expected to be facile based on its predicted aqueous pKa value of 7.75 for 2a and the experimental pKa of 6.83 for the analogous trifluoromethanesulfonyl51,52,53 (see Supplementary Fig. 10 for details). In the more stable transition state TS1, the largest substituent on the nucleophile, SO2F, is placed anti-periplanar with the alkene C=C bond, which could minimize steric strain, whereas in the less stable diastereomeric transition state TS1ʹ, the ester group is anti-periplanar with the C=C bond (Supplementary Fig. This steric effect probably leads to the 3.4 kcal mol−1 higher energy of TS1ʹ than that of TS1. Although the formation of palladacycle A is kinetically favoured in the anti-nucleopalladation, diastereomers A and Aʹ rapidly epimerize via deprotonation of the acidic α-C–H. The Na2CO3-mediated deprotonation of A to form enolate Aʹʹ is predicted to be exergonic by 8.4 kcal mol−1 (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for details). This deprotonation process is in part entropy-driven as the enolate oxygen replaces the acetate ligand in A to form a six-membered chelation with the Pd centre. a, DFT-computed reaction energy profile of the formation of cyclopropane 3aa. The DFT calculations were performed at the ωB97X-D/def2-TZVP/SMD(DMA)//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G(d)–SDD(Pd) level of theory. The reaction energy profile was calculated at the experimental reaction temperature (80 °C). See the ‘Density functional theory (DFT) calculations' section in Supplementary Information for computational details. All Gibbs free energies and enthalpies are with respect to Pd-1. b, Oxidative addition transition states. All activation barriers are with respect to the enolate resting state Aʹʹ. Due to the ablation of the new α-stereocentre formed after nucleopalladation, under the Curtin–Hammett conditions, the product diastereoselectivity is determined in the subsequent steps. Our calculations indicate that the oxidative addition proceeds via an SN2-type stereoinvertive mechanism (TS2 and TS2ʹ). Other oxidative addition pathways, including the four- and three-centred C–S oxidative addition (TS4–TS6; Fig. 5b) and the S–F oxidative addition16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 6), were found to be less favourable. Subsequent reductive elimination from the PdIV intermediate B (TS3) is kinetically facile with a low barrier of 1.7 kcal mol−1 with respect to B, consistent with our recent computational study on the strain-release-promoted reductive elimination from PdIV to form cyclopropane rings31. The liberated SO2F− anion then decomposes to SO2 gas and F− anion, similar to previous reports by Bull and coworkers22,23. In situ 19F NMR spectroscopy monitoring indicates that F− is ultimately converted to bifluoride (FHF−) (see ‘Fluorine tracking experiments' section in Supplementary Information for details). The computed reaction energy profile indicates that the irreversible intramolecular SN2-type oxidative addition (TS2) is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step. The computed overall barrier from the Pd–enolate resting state Aʹʹ to TS2 (ΔG‡ = 28.7 kcal mol−1, ΔH‡ = 17.5 kcal mol−1) is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally determined activation parameters. The large negative activation entropy (ΔS‡ = − 31.7 e.u. compared with the experimental value of −25.8 e.u.) is primarily attributed to entropy loss during the association of an OAc− ligand upon reprotonation of the enolate resting state Aʹʹ. The computed diastereoselectivity indicates that the SN2-type oxidative addition via TS2 leading to the cis-cyclopropane product is 3.0 kcal mol−1 more favourable than the minor pathway via TS2ʹ leading to the trans product, which is consistent with the experimentally observed diastereoselectivity (>20:1 d.r.). TS2ʹ is probably destabilized by steric interactions between the acetate ligand and the ester group. The SN2-type oxidative addition with a phenyl ester (2f) had an increased barrier (ΔG‡ = 30.9 kcal mol−1) and lower computed diastereoselectivity (ΔΔG‡ = 1.2 kcal mol−1), attributed to steric repulsions between the directing group and the ester that stabilize the transition state leading to the cis-cyclopropane product (Supplementary Fig. A highly diastereoselective PdII/PdIV-catalysed cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with alkyl sulfonyl fluorides has been developed. The synthetic versatility of this method stems from the diverse array of pronucleophiles that are compatible. With internal alkenes, all cis-substituted cyclopropanes that are otherwise difficult to access can be prepared in one step. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the SN2-type oxidative addition is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step. Outside of the glovebox, the appropriate alkene substrate (0.1 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.01 mmol, 10mol%) and Na2CO3 (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) were added to an oven-dried 1-dram (4 ml) vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The vial was then introduced into a nitrogen-filled glovebox antechamber. Once transferred inside the glovebox, alkyl sulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) was added to the vial, followed by anhydrous DMA (0.3 ml, 0.33 M). The vial was sealed with a screw-top septum cap, removed from the glovebox and placed in a heating block that was preheated to 80 °C for 14 h. After this time period, the resulting mixture was filtered through a pad of celite. Saturated NaHCO3 solution (10 ml) was added to the filtrate, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 2 ml). The combined organic layers were concentrated and purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexanes as the eluent.

Daniel Björkegren is an assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today's jobs by 20452. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today — steering young people's career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres. Why evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now Why evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now Given the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning. Yet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI's effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools3. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022–23 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools4. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT's release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before5. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects. Second, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers3 and software developers4 found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. Carefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence. Social science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field. One approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction7 — speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces. For example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse8. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the ‘externality'. Another illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI's disruptive potential. Studies9,10 suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated — such as creative direction or vetting final outputs — will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. More thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader. One common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking — testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance. If AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption11,12. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies. AI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it AI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme — whether in business, education or public health — will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer — for example, a government agency — rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots13–15. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments. One important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive. Yao, S., Shinn, N., Razavi, P. & Narasimhan, K.

The African Early Pleistocene is a time of evolutionary change and techno-behavioral innovation in human prehistory that sees the advent of our own genus, Homo, from earlier australopithecine ancestors by 2.8-2.3 million years ago. This was followed by the origin and dispersal of Homo erectus sensu lato across Africa and Eurasia between ~ 2.0 and 1.1 Ma and the emergence of both large-brained (e.g., Bodo, Kabwe) and small-brained (e.g., H. naledi) lineages in the Middle Pleistocene of Africa. Here we present a newly reconstructed face of the DAN5/P1 cranium from Gona, Ethiopia (1.6-1.5 Ma) that, in conjunction with the cranial vault, is a mostly complete Early Pleistocene Homo cranium from the Horn of Africa. Morphometric analyses demonstrate a combination of H. erectus-like cranial traits and basal Homo-like facial and dental features combined with a small brain size in DAN5/P1. The presence of such a morphological mosaic contemporaneous with or postdating the emergence of the indisputable H. erectus craniodental complex around 1.6 Ma implies an intricate evolutionary transition from early Homo to H. erectus. This finding also supports a long persistence of small-brained, plesiomorphic Homo group(s) alongside other Homo groups that experienced continued encephalization through the Early to Middle Pleistocene of Africa. The oldest fossils assigned to our genus are ~2.8 million years old (Myr) from Ethiopia and signal a long history of Homo evolution in the Rift Valley1,2,3. There is evidence of multiple Homo lineages in Africa by 2.0–1.9 million years ago (Ma) and an archaeological and paleontological record of expansion to more temperate habitats in the Caucasus and Asia between 2.0 and 1.8 Ma4 (Fig. The last appearance datum for the more archaic Homo habilis species (or “1813 group”) is ~1.67 (OH 13) or ~1.44 Ma, if KNM-ER 42703 is correctly attributed to H. habilis5, which is uncertain6. The archetypal early African Homo erectus fossils from Kenya (i.e., KNM-ER 3733, 3883; and the adolescent KNM-WT 15000) already present a suite of traits that distinguish them from early Homo taxa by 1.6–1.5 Ma, including larger brains and bodies, smaller postcanine dentition, more pronounced cranial superstructures (e.g., projecting and tall brow ridges), a relatively wide midface and nasal aperture, deep palate, and projecting nasal bridge1,6,7,8,9,10,11. The only evidence for H. erectus sensu lato in Africa before 1.8 Ma are fragmentary or juvenile fossils12,13,14, while fossils expressing both ancestral H. habilis and more derived H. erectus s.l. morphological traits are only known from Dmanisi, Georgia at 1.77 Ma15,16. Thus, H. erectus emerged from basal Homo between 2.0 and 1.6 million years ago, but when, where (Africa or Eurasia), and how it occurred remain unclear. An expanded fossil record also documents significant variation in endocranial volume17,18 and craniofacial6,8 and dentognathic morphology19,20 throughout the Early Pleistocene, which extends to the Middle Pleistocene with the addition of small-brained Homo lineages to the human tree. The solid bars of the timeline indicate well-established first and last appearance data; the horizontal stripes indicate possible extensions of the time range based on fragmentary or juvenile fossils. Diagonal lines signal earlier archaeological presence in those regions. The question mark indicates a possible date of <1.49 Ma for the Mojokerto, Indonesia site cf.22,23,24,25. The horizontal gray bar represents the time range associated with DAN5/P1. Colors on the map indicate presence of fossils matching taxa or geographic groups of H. erectus as indicated in the timeline. Surface renderings of the best-preserved regional representatives of archaic or small-brained Homo fossils (beginning at top and continuing clockwise): D2700, KNM-ER 1813, KNM-ER 1470, KNM-ER 3733, SK 847, OH 24, KNM-WT 15000, and DAN5/P1. All surface renderings visualized at FOV 0° (parallel). Map was generated in “rnaturalearth” package68 for R. The initial announcement of DAN5/P1 assigned it to H. erectus on the basis of derived neurocranial traits21. Subsequent analyses of neurocranial shape and endocranial morphology confirmed affinity with H. erectus but also noted similarities to early (pre-erectus) Homo fossils such as KNM-ER 181317,18. Only limited information about the partial maxilla and dentition was presented in the original description21. Yet, facial and dental traits are increasingly important in early Homo systematics, given overlap in brain size among closely related hominins6,8,22. The DAN5/P1 fossil is a rare opportunity to evaluate neurocranial, facial, and dental anatomy in a single Early Pleistocene Homo fossil and thus has significant implications for this discussion. Here we present a new cranial reconstruction of the 1.6–1.5 Myr DAN5/P1 fossil from Gona, Ethiopia. This study demonstrates that the small-brained adult DAN5/P1 fossil (598 cm3 21) presents a previously undocumented combination of early Homo and H. erectus features in an African fossil. Physical and virtual reconstructions of the DAN5/P1 neurocranium were presented previously17,21. The face reconstruction, which is new, involves 3D surface models generated from micro-computerized tomographic (µ-CT) scans of the left and right maxillae (hemi-palates), left infraorbital fragment of the maxilla, left zygomatic fragment containing the frontal process, right P3, and left P4-M3 (the left P3 was recovered, but not µ-CT scanned) (Fig. The right P3 was originally misidentified as a right P4 21 (Supplementary Note 1). The preserved fragments of the face were joined together along sutures (e.g., left infraorbital and zygomatic) or postmortem breaks (e.g., left infraorbital and hemi-palate) and the teeth were positioned with reference to dental alveoli and interdental wear facets (Fig. The reconstruction applied standard virtual reconstruction techniques (e.g., repositioning and reflection of elements and landmark-based superimposition23) to fit together the five bony fragments and five postcanine teeth. There were many anatomical constraints which limited the way in which these fragments could be assembled. Its final position must also accommodate the zygomatic bone along the zygomaxillary suture. Such considerations applied to each element. The face was then hafted onto the neurocranium to produce a largely complete cranium (Fig. 2e, f); an alternative reconstruction with a more posteriorly positioned face was also generated (Supplementary Fig. Original fossil fragments of face: a right and left hemimaxillae, b left infraorbital region and left frontal process of the zygomatic bone. c Inferior and d anterior-oblique views showing surface renderings of original pieces in anatomical position after removal of matrix via segmentation and virtual reconstruction of face. Colors serve to highlight individual fragments manipulated in the reconstruction process. Arrow indicates the left zygomatic root, which was displaced during the fossilization process (seen in a) and re-positioned with reference to the corresponding morphology on the right during the virtual reconstruction (seen in (d); Supplementary Fig. e Anterior and f lateral views of cranial reconstruction in Frankfort Horizontal after duplicating and reflecting pieces across the midline and positioning face on cranial vault. All surface renderings visualized at FOV 0° (parallel). In lateral view, the face is gently sloping anteriorly from below the projecting supraorbital torus, with a concave “nasocanine contour” (sensu24) (Fig. Many face dimensions in DAN5/P1 overlap with early Homo and early H. erectus from Africa and Eurasia (Table 1), but the superior facial and nasal heights of DAN5/P1 are absolutely short compared to African H. erectus and similar to, e.g., OH 24 (H. habilis) and D4500 (Dmanisi H. erectus). The supraorbital torus is vertically thick and projecting with a continuous post-toral sulcus; this morphology is typical of H. erectus. The height of the torus at mid-orbit is within the range of other small African fossils assigned to H. erectus (Supplementary Table 9). An arched torus is variably expressed in small-brained Homo fossils (e.g., KNM-ER 1813 and KNM-OL 45500; Supplementary Figs. The inferior orbital margin is sharp and the frontal process of the zygomatic faces more anteriorly than antero-laterally. The ratio of cheek height to facial length in DAN5/P1 is similar to both H. habilis and early H. erectus (Table 1). Its nearly vertical midface with weakly everted nasal margins resembles early Homo and D2700 more so than other H. erectus25 and differs from the more rounded form in KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-ER 3883 (Supplementary Fig. The well-developed maxillary sulcus seen in DAN5/P1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a) is more common in H. erectus than early Homo. The position of the anterior border of the maxillary zygomatic process at the P3/P4 level in DAN5/P1 is more anterior than in adult H. erectus, but was described similarly for H. naledi26. The nasal aperture does not show the widening typical of African H. erectus (Table 1). Nasal breadth is similar in DAN5/P1 and the early Homo KNM-ER 1805 fossil, but DAN5/P1 has a shorter nasal height and taller alveolar clivus than KNM-ER 1805. The subnasal clivus transitions smoothly to the nasal floor with no spinal or lateral crests; cresting is common for most early Homo / H. erectus fossils as well as H. naledi, but low topography of the nasal sill is documented in the adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and the Dmanisi sample27,28. There is a blunt anterior nasal spine, with no indication of anterior projection as in H. naledi28, although this region could be damaged. The palate is large relative to endocranial volume, which aligns DAN5/P1 with early Homo and basal H. erectus from Eurasia, rather than East African H. erectus (Table 1). The DAN5/P1 palate has parallel molar rows and the preserved anterior alveoli suggested vertically oriented incisor roots (Supplementary Fig. However, it does not resemble the long, narrow dental arcade implied by the reconstruction of the OH 7 H. habilis specimen6. Its palate depth is in the range of H. erectus and at the high end of variation for early Homo. The nasoalveolar clivus is moderately prognathic and the squared-off anterior maxilla has a stout, rounded canine jugum that forms the “corner” of the palate. While short canine roots are said to be a H. erectus feature8, root length is variable and not fully characterized in Pleistocene Homo. For example, both OH 65 (early Homo)29 and D2700 (early H. erectus) fossils have longer canine roots. The canine jugum does not contribute to the lateral nasal aperture as it does in the Dmanisi sample, H. floresiensis, some early Homo (e.g., OH 24), and some African H. erectus (KNM-ER 3733). The DAN5/P1 clivus projects slightly beyond the level of the canine jugum in lateral view, which is typical for early Homo and early H. erectus1. The maxillary flexion, maxillary sulcus, canine jugum, moderately prognathic subnasal clivus, and more anterior origin of the maxillary zygomatic process in DAN5/P1 differ from the condition described for ATE7-1, a Spanish fossil recently assigned to H. aff. A thin crest extends superiorly from the jugum toward the zygomatic root and demarcates a deep, round fossa between the lateral body of the maxilla and the anterior zygomatic process (Supplementary Fig. A similar morphology was described for the early Homo fossil A.L. 666-11 and the fossa is also seen in some Dmanisi fossils. More detailed discussion of the maxillary sulcus and its relationship to surrounding features can be found in Supplementary Note 2 and comparisons of DAN5/P1 to less complete hominins are detailed in Supplementary Note 3. Some description of the teeth was provided in the original announcement21. We also present additional description (Supplementary Note 1), photographs (Supplementary Fig. 6) and crown dimensions (Supplementary Table 8). Analysis of cranial (face and vault) shape using 3D landmarks demonstrates a broadly archaic-to-modern trajectory of shape differences along Principal Component (PC) 1. Low-scoring early Homo have a relatively smaller vault and longer, more prognathic face and clivus and a transversely flatter cheek compared to more derived Homo species on PC 1 (Fig. There is separation of H. erectus and H. floresiensis from other Homo species, particularly Middle Pleistocene Homo and H. habilis, on PC 2. The second PC reflects the characteristic long, low vault that is wide inferiorly in H. erectus (and H. floresiensis), combined with relatively tall orbits, vertically shorter face below the orbits, and a long palate with moderate alveolar prognathism. The third PC mostly reflects unique anatomy of Neanderthals. DAN5/P1 is within the H. erectus range of variation and plots close to the adolescent (KNM-WT 15000) and subadult (D2700) H. erectus fossils in the subspace of PCs 1 and 2 and close to D2700 on PC 3 as well. As a group, these three fossils score lower than other H. erectus fossils and overlap H. habilis on PC 1, implying a higher face to neurocranium ratio compared to KNM-ER 3733. DAN5/P1 is the nearest neighbor for several H. erectus fossils in full shape space and is itself most similar to the subadult H. erectus fossil KNM-WT 15000. Of the adult fossils, DAN5/P1 is closest to KNM-ER 1813 in full shape space. The DAN5/P1 alternative reconstruction yields substantially similar results, while our reconstruction of the less complete LES1 H. naledi fossil is aligned with early Homo (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Figs.

We observe good taxonomic resolution based on a separate analysis of the midface, with the strongest contrasts between “early Homo“ (e.g., H. habilis) and Neanderthals on PC 1 (Fig. The majority of the early Homo and H. erectus fossils separate from each other along PC 1 and DAN5/P1 is within the early Homo range on this component. The one Indonesian and two Kenyan fossils assigned to H. erectus have higher PC 1 scores, while the D2700 fossil from Dmanisi is close to both H. habilis and geologically younger members of H. erectus. Low-scoring individuals like DAN5/P1 have transversely flat midfaces, an anterior origin of the zygomatic process, a more sloped subnasal clivus and a narrower, non-projecting nasal region. The face is shallower antero-posteriorly and the anterior palate is wider and more squared off. PC 2 serves to highlight unique aspects of the early modern human face, particularly compared to H. naledi. H. habilis, H. erectus, and DAN5/P1 have more intermediate scores. This third PC contrasts the more sloping face and shorter subnasal clivus of H. naledi compared to the taller and more upright face with a projecting nasal bridge of H. erectus, H. floresiensis and KNM-ER 1805 (an early Homo fossil of uncertain species attribution). DAN5 scores lower than all H. erectus on PC 3 and near to OH 24 and KNM-ER 1813 (both H. habilis). DAN5/P1 is closest in full shape space to KNM-ER 1813 (H. habilis), but also quite similar to OH 24, the subadult D2700, and the adolescent KNM-WT 15000. Further development of the face in the adolescent KNM-WT 15000 fossil would have made it more like KNM-ER 3733, placing it further from DAN5/P1 on PC 2 as an adult (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Fig. Convex hulls indicate group membership.

Morphological descriptions of individual teeth are provided in Supplementary Note 2. In this section, we report results of the following metric analyses: crown size analyses based on computed crown area, tooth size apportionment analyses (TSA) that examine the relative mesiodistal (MD) and buccolingual (BL) diameters within each tooth row and normalized Elliptic Fourier Analyses (EFA) of the crown contour of each postcanine tooth. The computed crown areas (MD × BL: Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 8) for the DAN5/P1 molars fit comfortably in the range of H. habilis. Both computed and measured crown base areas reveal that M3 is largest, followed by M1 in DAN5/P1 (Supplementary Table 8). DAN5/P1 does not display the M1 < M2 size sequence typical of H. habilis, but this morphology is shared with L894-1 and is not unique among our H. habilis sample. The molars, particularly the M1 and M3 are at the high end of variation for both African and Dmanisi early H. erectus (5). There is a clear trend for premolar size reduction from early Homo to H. erectus, but the premolars of DAN5/P1 are small even in comparison with early African, Georgian, and Indonesian H. erectus. DAN5/P1 compared to a Pleistocene Homo taxa and individual specimens of b early Homo (n = 22), c Georgian H. erectus (n = 4), and d African H. erectus (n = 9).

The TSA analysis for size-corrected MD and BL crown dimensions of P3‒M3 (Fig. 9) mostly discriminates between H. habilis and H. erectus, reflecting the proportionally small P3, relatively MD elongated and narrow P4, MD short M1, and large M3 in the former. DAN5/P1 and D4500 have the highest PC 1 scores, but also the most extreme PC 2 scores in the sample. DAN5/P1 differs from D4500 along PC 2 in having particularly narrow premolars bucco-lingually, whereas the M1 is proportionally smaller in D4500 (Fig. Overall, DAN5/P1, D4500, and H. naledi group with H. habilis, whereas one early Homo specimen, OH 65, and D2700 group with African and Indonesian H. erectus. A previous study also suggested that OH 65 shows affinities with H. erectus in dental arcade shape6, which may reflect large intra-specific variation. a Ordination of PC 1 and PC 2 of size corrected MD and BL dimensions for P3‒M3 (TSA).

Large symbols are group averages for early African H. erectus (EAf_erec), “Sangiran Upper” H. erectus (USang_erec), and H. naledi (H_nal) (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Data 1). Premolar crown contours differ between early Homo and Early Pleistocene H. erectus from East Africa and Indonesia. Namely, early Homo is characterized by MD long premolars, whereas H. erectus has MD short premolar crowns (PC 1), and DAN5/P1 clusters with the former in this respect (Fig. Molar crown contours tend to separate African and Indonesian samples, but do not effectively distinguish H. habilis from H. erectus in East Africa (Fig. Specifically, MD long (Africa) versus short (Indonesia) crown of M1 and M3 (PC 1), and rectangular (Indonesia) versus rhomboid (Africa) crown of M2 (PC 2) characterize the two regional samples, and DAN5/P1 always clusters with the African sample. The shape of the M3 in DAN5/P1 is most comparable to early Homo rather than H. erectus fossils from Africa. Taken together, DAN5/P1 shows affinities with early Homo, including H. habilis, in premolar and M3 crown shape; its M1 and M2 crown contours are not taxonomically informative.

The DAN5/P1 reconstruction from Gona, Ethiopia, is a complete Early Pleistocene Homo cranium from northeast Africa (only the sixth from Africa; Fig. 1) and provides a high level of detail regarding midface morphology. DAN5/P1 is, to our knowledge, the first African fossil to exhibit a mixture of H. erectus and early Homo features. Some facial and possibly dental traits in DAN5/P1 appear to be derived for H. erectus sensu lato (e.g., deep palate, maxillary sulcus, projecting brow ridge, canine jugum, small premolars), corroborating previous work from the neurocranium (see also refs. Yet, the DAN5/P1 fossil, like the Dmanisi sample, blurs the boundaries between early Homo taxa (particularly “classic” H. habilis) and H. erectus. DAN5/P1 overlaps H. habilis and early Georgian H. erectus with regard to endocranial volume17,18, relative palate size, and dental dimensions (Figs. For example, the M1 and M3 areas of DAN5/P1 are within the range of early Homo and early H. erectus from the Eurasian site of Dmanisi, but among the largest or exceed the values in African H. erectus (Fig. Aspects of facial architecture, including the transversely flat infraorbital region, non-projecting nasal region, and anterior origin of the zygomatic process, are plesiomorphic in DAN5/P1 compared to contemporaneous H. erectus fossils from Kenya, confirmed by direct superimposition of the DAN5/P1 and KNM-ER 3733 faces (Supplementary Fig. Altogether, this suggests that DAN5/P1 better reflects the basal African H. erectus morphology than the archetypal and roughly contemporaneous Kenyan H. erectus fossils (Supplementary Table 11), such as KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-WT 15000. The evolutionary contrasts in brain size and face morphology embodied by the broadly contemporaneous DAN5/P1 and Kenyan fossils, KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-WT 15000 (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11) imply complex population structure rather than simple coexistence of two different lineages in the African Early Pleistocene. It is likely that the contrasts documented here signal between-population variation (assuming a single H. erectus species) in eastern Africa at 1.6–1.5 Ma. This view is consistent with previous depictions of H. erectus as a polytypic species across its temporo-spatial range9,31,32. The unique rift basin landscape of the East African Rift System, alongside the potential low population density of early Pleistocene hominins, could lead to population separation between the Horn of Africa and Lake Turkana lineages33,34. In this scenario, the Horn of Africa group retained the more archaic morphology of the population dispersing from Africa ~1.9 Ma, whereas the Kenyan group underwent greater in situ evolution. The more fragmentary Ethiopian H. erectus record may support this north-south division, but the larger-brained BSN/P1 H. erectus fossils from younger deposits at Gona (1.26 Ma) implies subsequent population replacement or in situ evolution (Supplementary Discussion). Other interpretations are, of course, possible. For example, an expanded fossil record could reveal high within-population variation (but see ref. 35 or interbreeding could result in the mosaic of ancestral and more derived features (Supplementary Discussion). Assuming that the ages for DAN5/P1 (1.6–1.5 Ma), KNM-ER 3733 (~1.6 Ma), and OH 13 (H. habilis; ~1.67 Ma) are correct, the nearly complete adult cranium of DAN5/P1 not only supports the late survival of basal Homo facial and dental morphologies but also highlights the piecemeal nature of H. erectus craniodental evolution. Limitations on dating precision do not entirely preclude a chronology where DAN5/P1 is geologically older than KNM-ER 3733 (Supplementary Discussion). While this can be accommodated within the evolutionary scenario described above, it could also signal rapid anagenetic evolution between the Gona and Koobi Fora populations. DAN5/P1 also presents similarities to the Middle Pleistocene H. naledi species, including a small brain, flat nasal region, anterior origin of the zygomatic process and distinct occipital protuberance (Figs. 3 and S4f) despite its larger cheek teeth (Fig. These resemblances are interesting, but insufficient to support a specific evolutionary connection between these geographically and temporally distant groups. Nevertheless, DAN5/P1 confirms the presence of small-brained Homo fossils in Africa during the Early to Middle Pleistocene14,32,36,37,38, and future research should clarify the evolutionary importance of the resemblances between DAN5/P1 and H. naledi. The Gona evidence, along with that from Dmanisi, hints that key behavioral/technological innovations may precede major morphological transformations. Diverse lines of evidence point to a broadened dietary range and access to animal resources at both Gona21 and Dmanisi39,40. Moreover, both Mode 1 (simple cores and flakes) and Mode 2 (Acheulean) stone tools are documented at DAN521. Yet, the endocranial volume of DAN5/P1 and the Dmanisi fossils show minimal expansion over early Homo18 and both DAN5/P1 and D4500 have large molars, including unreduced M3s41 (Fig. 6), and similar scaling of face to neurocranium as in early Homo (Fig. While acknowledging high error associated with body mass estimates from cranial variables42, the relationship between orbital dimensions and body mass in hominoids suggests that DAN5/P1 was smaller than well-known contemporaries from Kenya—KNM-ER 3733 and 3883 and KNM-WT 15000—and more similar to adults from Dmanisi (Supplementary Fig. The fossil pelvis BSN49/P27 also confirms the presence of a small-bodied hominin at Gona 400-700 thousand years after DAN5/P143,44. Although speculative, this pattern implies a dissociation between some morphological changes traditionally associated with H. erectus, and the shift to higher quality foods in the diet and initial appearance of Acheulean technology. The DAN5/P1 fossil confirms that the emergence of H. erectus was not a simple story. The DAN5 site documents hominins with a combination of ancestral and more derived craniofacial/dental features who made both Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools21. Although some researchers suggest a Eurasian origin because of the earlier occurrence of H. erectus-like cranial features in Georgia45, the basal H. erectus morphology in DAN5/P1 is compatible with local evolution of H. erectus in East Africa. Data were collected from the DAN5/P1 specimen (from the original micro-CT scans and two virtual reconstructions built from the surface renderings based on the same scan data). The cranial fragments and teeth of DAN5/P1 were µCT-scanned by T. Sasaki (Kyoto University Museum) at the National Museum of Ethiopia in 2015 on a SkyScan 1173 benchtop scanner at 100 kV and 31–63 mA with a rotation step of 0.4–0.6. Surface renderings of the cranial pieces and individual teeth were generated from the µCT scans in Avizo 3D 2021.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; hereafter “Avizo”). In addition to the virtual reconstruction of DAN5/P1 described here, the hominin sample for the comparative analyses included fossils assigned to early Homo, H. erectus sensu lato from Africa and Eurasia (including a virtual reconstruction of KNM-ER 3733, Supplementary Fig. 12), Middle Pleistocene species (including a virtual reconstruction of the small-brained H. naledi LES1, Supplementary Fig. The comparative sample of Pleistocene hominins included original fossils, virtual reconstructions and research quality casts (Supplementary Tables 1–3; Supplementary Fig. 2), including scan data from the Georgian National Museum, Kenya National Museums, American Museum of Natural History and Ethiopian National Museum. All individuals were adult with the exception of two subadult specimens—the early adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and the older adolescent D270016—included to expand the small early H. erectus sample. The Indonesian H. erectus sample is from Sangiran, Java, which we divide into two chronological subsamples, “Sangiran Lower” and “Sangiran Upper,” given the demonstrated differences in their tooth crown size and cranio-dental morphology22,46. We exclude KNM-ER 42703 from the East African dental sample because of the severe tooth wear as well as taxonomic uncertainty of this specimen6. Taxonomic status for OH 65 is uncertain6, but we include it in H. habilis as originally proposed29. The late Middle Pleistocene H. naledi from South Africa and H. floresiensis from Indonesia are included because of their small brain size and suggested affinities with both H. habilis and H. erectus47,48. Standard virtual reconstruction techniques were applied to the DAN5/P1 face and cranial reconstruction as reviewed by ref. This involved reflecting missing elements from one side to the other, superimposition of mirrored elements, and repositioning of elements. The following Geomagic Wrap 2024.3.1 (Oqton; hereafter “Geomagic”) tools were utilized: “Duplicate,” “Mirror,” “Manual Registration” for initial superimposition with additional refinement using ‘Global Registration' or manual repositioning using “Object Mover.” The matrix cementing the left zygomatic root fragment to the palate on that side21 was manually segmented and removed in Avizo, isolating the two pieces, but also revealing a small fragment that was displaced medially and anteriorly. This was also segmented out separately. Subsequent steps were performed in Geomagic. The right hemipalate was duplicated, mirrored, and aligned with the left palate based on the hard palate contours and dental alveoli (I1, I2, P3, and P4) (Supplementary Fig. The alveolar bone that intervenes between neighboring teeth from the canine to M1 is preserved on the neighboring regions of the palate and zygomatic root, respectively, further confirming the anatomical validity of this repositioning (Supplementary Fig. The small fragment of displaced bone was re-positioned by sliding it posteriorly and laterally to align with the broken edge of the zygomatic root fragment (green in Supplementary Fig. The right and left hemi-palates were then aligned along the median plane to produce a smooth contour of the subnasal clivus and roof of the palate. Both hemi-palates were duplicated and reflected across the midline to produce a more complete palate, into which the left P4 and M1 were positioned based on congruence of the roots and dental alveoli (Fig. The P3 crown and complete M2 and M3 were added to the model based on alignment of corresponding interproximal wear facets and root orientation. The left infraorbital fragment of the maxilla was aligned with the superior border of the left zygomatic process, and the zygomatic fragment was further joined to this piece along the zygomaxillary suture (Supplementary Fig. The left infraorbital and zygomatic pieces and all teeth were duplicated and reflected across the midline to create a maximally complete surface (Supplementary Fig. The position of the face is broadly consistent with the expected orthogonal relationship of the posterior maxillary plane and neutral horizontal axis of the orbit (based on the estimated position of the junction of anterior and middle cranial fossae). The final reconstruction yields a mostly complete nasal aperture, orbital margin, infraorbital region, anterior palate, and dental arcade. Anatomical features constrained many aspects of the reconstruction. While some virtual reconstructions produce multiple reconstructions to account for uncertainty, the complex topography of the fossil fragments constrains their positioning along multiple axes, limiting alternative arrangements that can satisfy well-established anatomical relationships. For example, the incisive canal is preserved on the medial surface of both hemipalates. This confirms good preservation of the median plane on both sides. The intermaxillary suture on the subnasal clivus is also clearly visible on the right and left fragments, where the bone rises to a gentle ridge on either side, further constraining the position of the right and left sides of the palate. As noted above, the left maxillary zygomatic root fragment was initially aligned using the mirrored right side as a guide, but the correct alignment of the canine and premolar alveoli, which are preserved on both the hemipalate and zygomatic root fragment, provides further validation (Supplementary Fig. Similar considerations were used in the final positioning of the infraorbital fragment (Supplementary Fig. The medial border preserves the lateral nasal aperture, which should align in the same sagittal plane as the inferior lateral nasal wall preserved more posteriorly on the left hemipalate. The angulation of this piece in the sagittal plane was determined by the requirement that it meet the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture superiorly and be superimposed with the mirrored right inferior nasal aperture inferiorly. There is a narrow projection of bone on the inferior border of the infraorbital fragment that appears to fit between the left hemipalate and zygomatic root fragment. We propose that this confirms that there is a natural join between the infraorbital fragment and the hemipalate/zygomatic root inferiorly. The current reconstruction produces a smooth contour from the infraorbital fragment to the subnasal contour, whereas other alignments would require flexion from the infraorbital plane to the subnasal clivus inferiorly. Simultaneously, its medial positioning was limited by the presence of the maxilla with which it also forms an articulation (zygomaxillary suture). This latter articulation also proscribes how anterior or lateral facing the zygomatic fragment can be as it must align with this suture. The biggest source of uncertainty in the current reconstruction is the hafting of the face on the vault, which we addressed with an alternative reconstruction (see next section). Smaller uncertainties are associated with the relative orientation of the left and right palate and the placement of M2 and M3, which are less constrained than the P3-M1 positions (limitations are also addressed in Supplementary Discussion). We present an alternative reconstruction for DAN5/P1 that positions the face more posteriorly with respect to the neurocranium (Supplementary Fig. In order to match the corresponding surfaces of the lateral orbit wall on the face and vault, the face was also shifted slightly inferiorly. The overall impression is not very different, but the vertical face height is greater and less prognathic overall, with a taller orbit and deeper nasal root, and the supraorbital torus projects farther forward ahead of the inferior orbit. Further posterior shifting of the face requires additional downward movement to prevent the frontal and zygomatic bones from overlapping in the lateral orbit, which produces a disproportionately tall orbit that seems unlikely. Even in the original reconstruction, the orbital index (height/breadth) of 0.92 is equal to the highest values reported for H. erectus and early Homo, and a further inferior shift of the face would increase orbit height and create an unusual orbit shape. We re-ran the cranial principal component analysis (PCA) using the alternative reconstruction. Taphonomic distortion in the KNM-ER 3733 fossil was corrected by first performing a retrodeformation via the procedure described by ref. 49 in the R statistical environment v. 4.5.050 and then manually repositioning the left zygomatic bone to reduce the gap between the zygomatic and frontal bones at the fronto-zygomatic suture in Geomagic (Supplementary Fig. The surface renderings were generated from CT scans provided by the Department of Earth Sciences, National Museums of Kenya. We used a virtual reconstruction of KNM-WT 1500051 that corrected previously described asymmetry of the face and misalignment of the face and vault. The LES1 (H. naledi) cranium is not fully reconstructed physically, but scans of the calvaria, left temporal/occipital piece, maxilla, and nasals provided by J. Martin, and a small piece of the anterior left temporal bone from the Morphosource calvaria scan (Morphosource ID: 000084599; ark:/87602/m4/M84599) were articulated and mirrored across the midline. The maxilla articulated with the nasal bones after a small superolateral rotation of the infraorbital piece. The right inferior nasal border and infraorbital region were then duplicated and mirrored to the right side, completing the reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. Early Homo fossils are rare and poorly preserved, including the original KNM-ER 1470 and OH 24 fossils from Koobi Fora, Kenya, and Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, respectively. Right posterior vault and cranial base landmarks (e.g., asterion and postglenoid process) were reflected from the better-preserved left side in KNM-ER 1470 to avoid the more distorted right side. We used thin-plate spline (TPS) to estimate the position of landmarks in the regions affected by crushing of the superior vault in OH 24 (bregma, coronale, and opisthion). These “solutions” to the problem of taphonomic damage are imperfect, but the benefits of including rare African early Pleistocene fossils outweigh the disadvantages. Linear dimensions were acquired from the 3D model of the DAN5/P1 cranial reconstruction in Geomagic and used to generate shape ratios scaled by endocranial volume or superior face length (Table 1). Three-dimensional (3D) landmarks for the cranial analysis (Supplementary Table 4) and both landmarks and semilandmarks for the midface topography analysis (Supplementary Table 5) were collected from original fossils or casts of Pleistocene Homo fossils (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Data 1). The cranial landmarks were primarily acquired using a Microscribe 3D or Microscribe MX 3D digitizer and from surface renderings generated from CT, µCT, or surface scan data in a smaller number of cases, including the 3D model of the DAN5/P1 cranial reconstruction, using Avizo. All data for the midface analysis were collected from surface renderings in Landmark Editor52. After imputing missing landmark data (see below), the curve and surface semilandmarks were slid by minimizing the bending energy of a TPS deformation between each specimen and the sample mean shape (separately for the cranial and mid-face datasets). After sliding, all landmarks and semilandmarks were symmetrized and converted to shape variables using generalized Procrustes analysis for each dataset independently. This was followed by principal components analysis of the superimposed cranial landmarks (41 total) or midface landmark/semlandmarks (12 and 81 total, respectively). We present PC ordinations overlaid with nearest neighbor connections calculated in full shape space. Loadings on PCs were used to “warp” the surface of the DAN5/P1 surface rendering to visualize shape change in the cranium and midface analyses. Landmark and semilandmark data were processed and analyzed in RStudio v. 1.4.171753 primarily using “Morpho” v. 2.1254 and “geomorph” v. 4.0.1055,56 packages for R ordinations were produced with “ggplot2” v. 4.0.057. Landmark estimation was considered on a case-by-case basis and tailored solutions were used in some cases (discussed below). Otherwise, landmarks were estimated using standard protocols58. Missing bilateral landmarks and semilandmarks were estimated by mirroring the preserved side (reflected relabeling) in the “Morpho” package for R. Missing landmarks and semilandmarks lacking a bilateral counterpart were estimated by deforming the sample average onto the deficient configuration using TPS interpolation in the “geomorph” package for R (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). In the cranial analysis, the TPS procedure was performed for the H. sapiens and non-H. sapiens (i.e., archaic) samples separately. In addition, four landmarks were included in the cranial TPS procedure to improve these estimates (frontomalaretemporale, parietal notch, canine-P3 interdental, M1–M2 interdental) but dropped before GPA and subsequent cranial shape analyses. Five or fewer unique landmarks were estimated for any one fossil in the cranial analyses. The average percentage of missing data was 6.9% (s.d. 2.8%) for the cranial analysis and 8.2% (s.d. 10.1%) for the midface analysis (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Some minimal landmark estimation was deemed necessary to fully capture the face shape of DAN5/P1 in the cranial analysis. The nasoalveolar clivus and anterior palate of DAN5/P1 was superimposed with a surface model of the A.L. 666-1 maxilla, which was better preserved anteriorly, to establish the likely position of alveolare (Supplementary Fig. A small segment of well-preserved buccal alveolar bone between the P4 and M1 was isolated and repositioned between M2 and M3 to acquire the M2-M3 inter-dental landmark (Supplementary Fig. A second paired landmark, zygomaxillare inferior, captures the transverse orientation of the cheek in this fossil. The landmark was imputed using the TPS method based on reference to the rest of the non-H. sapiens cranial sample and its reasonableness was validated by comparison to the surface model of the face reconstruction. A similar approach of reconstructing alveolar bone for recording inter-dental landmarks was applied to the KNM-ER 3733 virtual reconstruction described previously. Likewise, a local alignment of the naseoalveolar clivus and anterior palate of OH 24 and A.L. 666-1 was used to establish the position of prosthion for the former. With regard to the cranial analysis, LES1 is the most complete cranium available for H. naledi, which is of special interest given its similarly small endocranial volume and previously noted similarity to early Homo and H. erectus. However, the LES1 reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 12g–l) would require TPS estimation of six unique landmarks, including all midline landmarks from the posterior neurocranium (opisthion, inion and lambda), which does not meet the criterion for inclusion in Fig. The DH1 (H. naledi) vault, which was similar in morphology to LES1, was used to estimate the position of these midline points (Fig. S12k, l) in LES1 and the landmark configuration was projected onto the previously calculated axes from Fig. For the midface analysis, two fossils require special mention. KNM-ER 3733 is the sole adult African H. erectus with a reasonably complete facial skeleton and LES1 is the only H. naledi with a preserved face. However, the face is damaged and requires estimation of a number of landmarks and semilandmarks in both cases (Supplementary Table 7). The nature of damage in KNM-ER 3733 allows for primarily interpolation among existing regions, but it remains the case that some error is introduced during the missing data estimation. For LES1, most missing data was located on the lateral maxilla and frontal process of the zygomatic. However, the FMT and FMO landmarks were present on the frontal bone and helped to anchor the height and breadth of the upper face. We performed a direct comparison of the DAN5/P1 and KNM-ER 3733 surfaces after scaling the latter to 86% of its original size (based on centroid size from the mid-face analysis) to validate topographic differences. The young adolescent KNM-WT 15000 would have undergone additional facial development given its un-erupted third molars, based on analogy with extant hominoids59. We computed linear regressions of the Procrustes shape coordinates on the natural logarithm of centroid size in ontogenetic samples of Pan troglodytes (n = 12) and recent H. sapiens (n = 81) using the “RRPP” package v. 2.1.060,61 for R. We then used these two regressions to predict the adult shape of KNM-WT15000 by “growing” the fossil along each trajectory to the mean size of an adult chimp and human, respectively (developmental simulation62). This assumes a similar pattern of face development in H. erectus and either P. troglodytes or H. sapiens. The midface topography analysis was re-run with the estimated adult face shape of KNM-WT 15000. Body mass was estimated in DAN5/P1, LB1, KNM-WT 15000, D4500, D3444, and D2700 based on the published least square regression equations based on hominoid data for orbital height and orbital area (height × breadth) as outlined in ref. These were among the most reliable predictors among the cranial dimensions evaluated in that study. This was combined with estimates for other fossil hominins from the same ref. 63 and plotted alongside body mass estimates from supero-inferior femoral head diameter (or the equivalent acetabular diameter) presented in ref. Dental measurements of DAN5/P1 were based on 3D surface models produced from the CT scan (Supplementary Data 1). Prior to measurement, slight distortion of the glued connections in the right P3 crown had been virtually restored using Avizo 3D 2021.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MD and BL diameters of the teeth of DAN5/P1 were obtained using MeshLab 2022.02, while the same measurements for the comparative specimens were collected using a digital caliper (Mitsutoyo Inc.) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. PCA of size-adjusted MD and BL diameters of the P3‒M3 or P4‒M3 crowns was used to investigate the “TSA” in the tooth row. The size-adjustment of the variables was done by dividing each measurement by the geometric mean of all the dimensions considered (MDs and BLs for P3‒M3 or P4‒M3). This method follows the previous study65 but differs from that study in that, for PCA, we use variance-covariance matrix rather than correlation matrix for the already size-adjusted variables. Visualization of TSA for DAN5/P1 and D4500 in the subspace of PCs 1 and 2 was calculated by first scaling the PC 1 and 2 eigenvectors by the PC 1 and 2 scores for DAN5/P1 and D4500, respectively; line thickness in Fig. 6b is then proportional to the sum of the scaled eigenvectors for each fossil. Occlusal crown contours of maxillary premolars and molars were analyzed by normalized (i.e., size-standardized) EFA. Crown contours of DAN5/P1 were extracted from their 3D surface models as viewed from infinite distance, using Avizo and Geomagic. Those for the comparative specimens were taken from standardized photographs of high-quality plaster casts. A 100 mm macro lens was used for the photography to minimize parallax effect as detailed elsewhere66. In cases where interproximal wear on a tooth was minimal and the original occlusal contour could be assessed confidently with reference to the surrounding unworn enamel, we manually reconstructed the contour. Comparisons were made on the images from the right teeth or horizontally flipped images of the left teeth. The crown contour of each tooth was captured with a tooth placed so that its cervical line is horizontal (whenever a marked enamel extension was present, it was not taken into account to orientate the cervical reference plane). To compute normalized elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs), each premolar crown was aligned along the long axis of its first ellipse, and each molar crown was aligned along its MD axis. EFDs and PCAs of the normalized EFDs were conducted using the software SHAPE v. 1.367. The DAN5/P1 fossils are curated at the National Museum of Ethiopia (accession code: DAN5/P1). The original surface renderings and 3D reconstruction of DAN5/P1 generated for this study are available under restricted access because additional permission must be obtained from the National Museum of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Heritage Authority (EHA, formerly ARRCH); data requests should be addressed to K.L.B., S.S., and M.J.R. Likewise, virtual reconstructions of KNM-ER 3733 generated for the current study and KNM-WT 15000 (published previously) are available by request from K.L.B. after receiving a data user agreement from the National Museums of Kenya. The virtual reconstruction of LES1 generated for the current study is available by request to K.L.B. after receiving permission from University of Witwatersrand. Scan data for other fossil hominins typically requires a data sharing agreement with the institution curating the original (or cast) of that fossil (listed in Supplementary Tables 1–3).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Bies was recovering in the hospital from injuries inflicted during a car accident in May 2007 when routine laboratory tests showed that her blood glucose and cholesterol were both dangerously high. Doctors ultimately sent her home with prescriptions for two standard drugs, metformin for what turned out to be type 2 diabetes and a statin to control her cholesterol levels and the heart disease risk they posed. The combo, however, didn't prevent a heart attack in 2013. The resulting cocktail left her feeling so terrible that she considered going on medical leave from work. “I couldn't even get through my day. “I would come out to my car in my lunch hour and pray that I could just not do this anymore.” Medical researchers now think Bies's conditions were not unfortunate co-occurrences. Harm to one organ creates ailments that assault the other two, prompting further illnesses that circle back to damage the original body part.

Diseases of these three organs and systems are “tremendously interrelated,” says Chiadi Ndumele, a preventive cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University. The wildly popular GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro, target common pathology underlying CKM. Although most of these drugs come only in injectable forms that can cost several hundred dollars a week, pill versions of some medications are up for approval, and people on Medicare could pay just $50 a month for them under a new White House pricing proposal. More than a century before Bies entered the hospital, doctors had noticed that many of the conditions CKM syndrome comprises often occur together. And diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for developing kidney conditions. Until the 1940s, scientists thought fat cells were simply a stash for excess energy. The 1994 discovery of leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, showed researchers a profound way that fat could communicate with and affect different body parts. Since then, researchers have learned that certain kinds of fat cells release a medley of inflammatory and oxidative compounds that can damage the heart, kidneys, muscles, and other organs. In addition to depriving cells of their primary energy source, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in the blood—the telltale symptom of diabetes—further harming blood vessels and the organs they support. Too much glucose harms mitochondria—tiny energy producers within cells—and nudges them to make unstable molecules known as reactive oxygen species that disrupt the functions of different enzymes and proteins. Diabetes reduces levels of stem cells that help to fix this damage. High glucose levels also prod the kidneys to release more of the hormone renin, which sets off a hormonal cascade critical to controlling blood pressure and maintaining healthy electrolyte levels. This metabolic move releases other chemicals that cause lipid molecules such as cholesterol to clog blood vessels. The constriction leads to spikes in blood pressure and heightens a diabetic person's risk of heart disease. Just as diabetes can lead to heart and kidney conditions, illnesses of those organs can increase a person's risk of developing diabetes. Adrenomedullin, a hormone that increases during obesity, can also block insulin signaling in the cells that line blood vessels and the heart in humans and mice. Early signs of heart disease such as constricted blood vessels can exhaust kidney cells, which rely on a strong circulatory system to filter waste effectively. Not seeing these connections creates dangers for patients like Bies. “What we've done to date is really look individually across one or two organs to see abnormalities,” says nephrologist Nisha Bansal of the University of Washington. And those narrow views have led doctors to treat the different elements of CKM as separate, isolated problems. For instance, doctors have often used clinical algorithms to figure out a patient's risk of heart failure. But in a 2022 study, Bansal and her colleagues found that one common version of this tool does not work as well in people with kidney disease. As a result, those who had kidney disease—who are twice as likely to develop heart disease as are people with healthy kidneys—were less likely to be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner than those without kidney ailments. In another study, researchers found that among people with type 2 diabetes—one in three of whom are likely to develop chronic kidney disease—fewer than one quarter were receiving the kidney disease screening recommended by the American Diabetes Association and KDIGO, a nonprofit group that provides guidelines for global improvements in kidney health. If the drug reduced diabetes, accompanying heart trouble should have gone down, not up, he thought. A Senate investigation followed this vein of evidence and led to a 2007 advisory panel convened by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The discussions brought about a transformational change in how diabetes drugs were approved: It was no longer enough to simply show an improvement in blood glucose. Pharmaceutical companies would also need to demonstrate that the drugs were not linked to increased chances of developing heart health issues. Clinical trials to test the drugs would need to include people at high risk of heart or blood vessel diseases, including older adults. Those fears were not unfounded—many large pharmaceutical companies “abandoned the search for diabetes drugs” because the trials would take longer to complete and cost more, according to endocrinologist Daniel Drucker of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. “The pharma industry was 100 percent worried about this,” Drucker says. Drucker, who at the time was studying a promising new group of drugs for diabetes, was concerned about the extra time and expense, too. But in preliminary experiments, the scrutiny for additional conditions began to pay off. In 2008, at about the same time the fda updated its guidance on diabetes drugs, Drucker and other researchers discovered that the new molecules they were investigating seemed to protect mice and rats from heart disease. The new drugs mimicked a small protein named GLP-1, which normally regulates blood sugar and digestion. Small studies suggested it had wider benefits and might protect heart function in people who were hospitalized after a heart attack and angioplasty. At the time, these GLP-1 mimics were being used only as diabetes treatments. But studies in animals suggested they could do more, and subsequent trials in people showed the drugs also protected heart and kidney function. “We might not have discovered these actions of GLP-1 for some time if we hadn't been directed by the fda to really study this,” Drucker says. The regulations ended up leading to very successful multifaceted drugs. These so-called SGLT2 inhibitors are “almost a wonder drug,” says nephrologist Dominic Raj of George Washington University. These studies also confirmed that cardiac, kidney and metabolic diseases are “more closely linked than we anticipated,” Bansal says. But instead of looking only at diabetes improvement, they examined kidney and heart conditions as well. Although the GLP-1 medicines do have side effects (nausea and vomiting are some), within a few short years clinicians found that they had therapies that were designed to protect one organ but also treated others. “Now we have excellent evidence to say that not only will you have better control of your diabetes, and not only will these medicines help you lose weight, but they will prevent or attenuate the risk of developing serious heart disease and serious kidney disease,” Drucker says. Bies's physician prescribed her the GLP-1 receptor agonist drug Ozempic in 2024. And with fewer drugs in her system, Bies feels much better overall. Nissen, for one, says it is “a rebranding of a very old concept.” The symptoms and health risks linked to CKM overlap significantly with those of metabolic syndrome, an older term used to describe a similar constellation of health risks, he says. For one, the CKM framework encompasses more disease states. And clinicians can use the concept to identify different stages of risk: very early warning signs followed by clinical conditions—including but not limited to metabolic syndrome—and ultimately late stages of CKM, which include full-blown heart and kidney disease. “This is meant to better support prevention across the life course,” Ndumele says. Ongoing studies are testing new ways to identify those at risk of CKM early on and help with preventive care. For decades she and countless other patients have struggled to manage different aspects of their health. Bies remembers that although all her doctors were affiliated with the same hospital, they didn't communicate with one another or see others' notes about her prescriptions. A few years ago Bies joined an American Heart Association advisory committee on CKM to inform clinicians and advocate for others who deal with this complex illness, in hopes that speaking up about her own traumatic journey might help others so that “somebody else won't have to wait 10 to 12 years to advocate for themselves,” she says. At the University of Washington, Bansal and her colleagues are testing an integrated care model in which patients meet with multiple specialists at the same time to chart out their care. “How do we actually improve the rates of screening and disease recognition and get more people who are eligible on therapies to treat CKM disease?” Bansal says. “Although there have been a lot of exciting advances, we're only at the beginning. Such integrations are critical to help with early diagnosis—a crucial step in squelching the rise of CKM around the world, according to Ndumele. In the future, even more specialties may need to coordinate. New research already hints at the involvement of other organs and organ systems. Cardiologist Faiez Zannad of the University of Lorraine in France suspects that as researchers glean a clearer picture, CKM syndrome will further expand to include liver disease. Researchers and patients caution, however, that the move to group different diseases into CKM should not hinder efforts to understand each condition. Each person's course of disease—their initial diagnosis, the complications they are at greatest risk of developing and how best to treat them—can vary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eclipse (J41) is one of 74 orcas remaining in the southern resident population. Like many people who visit San Juan Island, I came here for the orcas. They have their own language, customs and culture, and they are the most studied population of orcas on Earth. But because of human encroachment on the shores and waters of their territory, they are in dire trouble. I arrived at Giles's mooring just moments before she did. She lives on whale time, meaning she will drop anything to get on the water with southern residents, the focus of her research. She told me she hasn't taken a vacation away from San Juan Island in years—it's just not relaxing. What if the southern residents appear while she's gone?

Giles's research assistant Aisha Rashid handed everyone life vests and strapped a peach one around Eba. I hunkered down in the back near the boat's onboard wet lab—a large metal box that holds a centrifuge, various vials, and other research equipment. She is an orca researcher at the SeaDoc Society. Giles and other scientists have devoted their careers to understanding and reversing the decline of this ancient population. By building out a picture of the whales' health, habits and diet, researchers are deciphering the many ways humans impact their lives and guiding conservation actions that may mean life or death for the orcas. But the research itself is now at risk, too. Actions by the Trump administration threaten to stall, diminish or stop a swath of conservation studies at a crucial juncture for southern residents—and for other populations that hang by a human-made thread. They share food and collectively care for their young. In the 1980s, as human teens donned parachute pants and leg warmers, southern resident adolescents took to wearing dead salmon “hats” on their heads. With big, wrinkly brains and high levels of intelligence, orcas seem likely to have complex internal lives. “They're clearly very smart animals; they're just different from us,” says Amy Van Cise, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who studies orcas and other cetaceans. Can you echolocate?” In 2018 a southern resident whale named Tahlequah made headlines for carrying her deceased newborn for 17 days in what became known as a “tour of grief.” The mother traveled nearly 1,000 miles with her baby draped over her forehead or held gingerly in her mouth; in January 2025, when another calf died, Tahlequah repeated the ritual. Also like us, orcas are deeply familial creatures. Resident killer whale offspring stay with their mothers for their entire lives, forming a nearly inseparable family group called a matriline. No matter how far apart, though, the pods are tied together by their shared language, diet, habits and behaviors—a culture distinct from that of any other population. Daniel P. Huffman; Sources: NOAA (resident ecotype range data); NOAA, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Center for Whale Research, via a map by Emily M. Eng in “Hostile Waters,” in Seattle Times; November 11, 2018 (additional range reference) Humans and killer whales share a long, complicated history. But settlers who arrived in the 1800s took a different view: orcas became feared and reviled as a source of competition for fishers, a vermin species to be avoided or, better yet, exterminated. The whale's surprisingly gentle nature (he even let his captor, Ted Griffin, ride on his back) shocked and enraptured onlookers. Scientists initially had hope that the southern residents would recover. “Then, all of a sudden, we started to see this decline,” says Kim Parsons, a supervisory research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. “He had this really cool dorsal fin,” Parsons says. What was going on with the southern residents? After millennia of relative quiet, the Salish Sea is now one of the busiest waterways in North America. Around nine million people live in the surrounding drainage basin, meaning ample urban, industrial and agricultural runoff has made its way into the water. When researchers began digging into the southern residents' decline, they found an alphabet soup of toxic chemicals in the whales' blubber: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Pollutants accumulate in the flesh of animals at every level of the food chain, but they get concentrated at higher levels, and orcas sit at the very top. These other whales, known as transients—also called “Bigg's” killer whales after pioneering orca researcher Michael Bigg—eat mammals, which are a level higher on the food chain than the fish eaten by residents, so they tend to accumulate even more pollutants. The key difference: Transient orcas had plenty to eat. Transients' favored prey—such as seals, sea lions and porpoises—have proliferated since the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 made hunting them illegal. But a combination of river damming, habitat destruction, overfishing and pollution has caused numbers of the southern residents' preferred prey, Chinook salmon, to plummet since the 1980s. Eight populations of Chinook made their way onto the endangered and threatened species lists before the southern residents joined them in 2005. Can you echolocate?” —Amy Van Cise, University of Washington In 2008 Giles helped to develop an acoustic device that she attached to the backs of orcas with suction cups, allowing her to eavesdrop on the whales as they hunted. She found that in noisy waters, “females will just say, ‘Screw it. “Males will try but miss because if vessel noise is too loud, it masks the whales' ability to echolocate and find food.” The northern resident killer whales provide another comparison: they spend more time in quieter, less polluted waters off the coast of British Columbia, and their numbers have doubled since the capture era. But each of these evolving threats is a universe unto itself, with countless variables and unknowns. The boat motor roared, and a whitewater mist prickled my skin as we neared the northern edge of Haro Strait. The sea was smooth, protected on all sides by forested islands. A towering container ship heaved across our path, and its exhaust joined a yellow-green haze that hung low across the otherwise cloudless sky. Then, just after we cleared the ship's roller-coaster wake: “Whale!” Rappold shouted. I whipped around just in time to glimpse a giant black-and-white body crashing back into the sea. Like corn kernels in slowly heating oil, the orca sightings began sparse and unpredictable. But at some imperceptible moment, things shifted; suddenly black fins, white tails and entire submarinelike bodies were popping out of the water just a few hundred feet away. Parsons works at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. Giles called out behaviors for Rashid to document. “Spyhop!” she yelled when a whale periscoped its enormous head out of the water and sank back down. “Tail slap!” Giles shouted as an orca's fluke rose up and smacked the water's surface. Giles examined the fins and saddle patches (a swirly white marking behind the dorsal fin) to identify these whales as part of J-pod. But we'd found only a handful of the 27 pod members, which was unusual. Giles told me that the pods had been splitting up more in recent years, perhaps as a “divide and conquer” strategy to make the most of scarce food. “Baby breach!” Giles called as a small body (by orca standards) shot out of the water, arced in the air and smacked back down with a belly-flop splash. In a stroke of luck, we'd found the two southern resident calves who had survived this year. She stretched over the bow, leaning her snout as close to the glassy surface as she could manage. All eyes were on Eba now—she had caught the scent of killer whale poop. “Let's find it!” Rappold said, egging Eba on. First, of course, you have to find the whales. Then one has to poop, and you need to find that poop before it sinks, gets dive-bombed by seagulls or breaks up in rough water. That's where Eba comes in: her powerful nose helps Giles home in on scat while she follows the whales at a distance. As a scent-detection dog, Eba helps Giles home in on floating killer whale poop for collection and analysis. The researchers can measure a given orca's levels of hormones and toxic chemicals, among other factors. With just a pea-size glob of scat, biologists can genetically decode which individual whale produced the sample. Hormone analysis reveals whether the whale was pregnant, and successful pregnancies are a key marker of population health. As they accumulate data over years, researchers are fleshing out a picture of southern resident health to clarify exactly how pollution, vessel disturbance and lack of prey cumulatively impact the orcas' bodies. Scientists also use scat samples to get a detailed look at what these orcas eat. Until the early 2000s, researchers could study orca diets only by cutting open the stomachs of recently deceased animals or happening on them mid-hunt. Scat samples are easier to come by (relatively speaking) and provide more detailed information. By checking fragments of DNA in a sample against a library of fish genomes, Parsons and Van Cise can identify the exact species a whale ate over a roughly 24-hour period and in what relative amounts—for instance, 60 percent Chinook salmon, 30 percent chum salmon, 10 percent halibut. Their research has shown that although the southern residents eat mainly Chinook, they also rely on a mix of other species that fluctuates throughout the year. Chum and coho salmon in particular appear to be more important than previously thought in the late summer and early fall. But the researchers still need more samples, especially between October and April, to get a full picture of the southern resident diet. Giles says it's important to know all of what the whales eat—and where and when—to ensure that they have what they need year-round. Giles turned the boat to follow her path. When Eba shuffled back to the left, Giles swerved again. They followed this zigzag pattern to stay in the “scent cone” of the feces, homing in closer with each pass. She propped her front paws on the bow and yelped like a capuchin. (I silently wondered whether that's how she got her nickname, “Fluffy Monkey.”) We had to be getting close. “Well, what do you think?” Rappold asked Eba softly. They scanned the dark surface for any signs of scat. The boat bobbed idly, water lapping against it. Giles decided there was nothing for us to collect; we should move on. With just a small amount of scat, scientists such as Amy Van Cise can examine the state of an orca's health and analyze its diet in great detail. Van Cise teaches at the University of Washington. Eba grew frenzied as we pulled away, yelping and barking, stomping around the bow and looking up expectantly at Rappold. She had sniffed admirably, but Eba doesn't get her reward—playtime with a rope toy—until Giles successfully collects a scat sample. “Good job, let's find the next one!” Eba barked at her twice. There are dozens of Chinook populations across hundreds of rivers from California to Alaska, each facing unique challenges, such as impassable dams, overfishing and urban development. To this end, Parsons and Van Cise are working to tease even more detail from the genetic mayhem of whale poop and identify which salmon runs the southern residents rely on most. “If we can target our management to specific rivers,” Van Cise says, “that might make it easier to conserve the right populations.” With proper funding, she says, they could probably tackle this genomic conundrum in the next few years. But with the way science funding plummeted in 2025, it might not happen at all. Days after Donald Trump took office in 2025, his second administration began hollowing out federal science agencies, and it aims to shrink them further in 2026. “I've watched funding source after funding source just shutter its doors,” says Van Cise, who relies almost entirely on funding from NOAA, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Naval Research. This is a crucial time for her; as an early-career research professor, she is just now establishing herself in the field. “If research funding continues the way that it is,” Van Cise says, “I could watch my career die before it really even gets off the ground.” In March 2025 Giles applied with partners at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance for an NSF grant to fund three years of an ongoing research project. Together, the researchers use drones to fly through an orca's blow and collect samples of its breath, which adds a new dimension for studying the animal's health and microbiome. They are also beginning to use infrared cameras to see whether the whales are suffering from illness or injury (hot spots can signal inflammation). Giles was told that was the fate of more than half of NSF applications at the time. NOAA is central to the conservation of all endangered marine species. In 2025 the Trump administration thinned the agency by more than 2,000 employees through layoffs, early retirements and a deferred-resignation program. One such employee was Lynne Barre, the southern residents' recovery coordinator for two decades. Barre says a colleague likened the situation to being on a pirate ship that someone lights on fire: “Then your choice is to walk the plank and either jump off yourself or be stabbed in the back [until you] jump off.” The Northwest Fisheries Science Center and the West Coast Regional Office—where the majority of 's southern resident work takes place—lost almost 30 percent of their staff in 2025, including many researchers with decades of expertise. “That's a huge hit to our workforce,” Barre says. A J-Pod baby and mother play in the Salish Sea. Southern resident killer whales have strong family ties and rarely separate from their close relatives. So where does that leave the southern residents? (Research vessels like Giles's can travel within 50 yards of the whales.) The goal is to allow the whales to hunt more easily, without a cacophony of boat motors muddying their echolocation. “If we don't have that strong foundation of science, we're not going to make very good decisions,” she says, and with such a small group of whales, there is a thin margin between recovery and the “vortex of extinction”—the point of no return. Toward the end of our encounter with the southern residents, a mother and baby beelined toward our boat. Their slick black bodies surged rhythmically out of the water every 10 yards or so. The whales emerged with heavy sighs just a few yards away. She rolled onto her side and flapped one little pectoral fin out of the water. When her mother ducked back down and began to swim away from us, she followed. Giles didn't collect any scat samples that day. As the whales headed south at sunset, we peeled off toward San Juan Island. On my last night with Giles, we visited the place where locals used to see orcas almost every day of the summer: Lime Kiln Point State Park. It's where Giles saw orcas for the first time, in 1987. The last ripe orange rays of sun snuck under her hat and tangled with the wind in her hair. She sat quietly, gazing just offshore at tasseled heads of bull kelp bobbing in the surf. “Four decades of time that I've known about these whales, and I have just watched them fail to recover,” Giles said, looking down at a photo of her 18-year-old self kneeling on the same rocks, an orca frozen mid-breach behind her. “I'll just keep trying to figure out how to help them so we can see breaching whales right off Lime Kiln again, every day.” Kelso Harper is an award-winning senior multimedia editor at Scientific American.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mysterious Bright Flashes in the Night Sky Baffle Astronomers Then about 200 million years ago one member of the cloud bumped another, a sun-size star, and sent it toward the black hole. Some of the star's gas was pulled into an orbiting stream around the black hole that widened into a flat pancake called an accretion disk. Astronomers named the flash AT2019qiz and noted that they hadn't seen it three days before. Each time this other star splashed into the disk, it flashed, though less brilliantly than the original, pulled-apart star. The multitelescope, multiwavelength data together confirmed that AT2019qiz was first a tidal disruption event and then a “quasi-periodic eruption.” Both are examples of phenomena astronomers call transients.

Transients, which are astronomical objects that appear suddenly from nowhere and usually disappear soon after, contradict the standard truth that the universe changes predictably and slowly over billions of years. They include what the typically staid National Academy of Sciences called “the most catastrophic events in spacetime.” They are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days—which is a combination of size and speed that seems impossible. If we didn't observe them, says astronomer Vikram Ravi of the California Institute of Technology, “you'd never know that physics allows these things to exist.” But physics says everything not forbidden will, sooner or later and with some probability, happen. And astronomers, noticing these improbable things and knowing that nothing is one of a kind, began to find many more, all at the far reaches of physics. Between 1976 and 2012, the number of transients listed on the International Astronomical Union's official Transient Name Server was around five each year. Chart this rise, and it looks like a long tail with an elephant attached. And the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which came online in 2025, will soon survey the entire southern sky every three nights, identifying changes within 60 seconds of their detection to create near-real-time movies of the sky and finding 10 million changes every day. With such a large amount of data, astronomers can begin to study credible demographics: that is, they can move from just finding these wild, unlikely creatures to figuring out what they are. Most of their names are just adjectives, and “when the transient's name is a description,” says astrophysicist Raffaella Margutti of the University of California, Berkeley, “that tells you we know nothing intrinsic about them.” That's about to change. Scientists sort transients into two main groups: events involving the deaths of stars and events around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies. One kind is the dead core of a star pulling gas from a nearby star, piling up mass until nuclear fusion restarts and goes critical and the whole thing pops off like a 20-billion-billion-billion-megaton thermonuclear bomb, which it is. It explodes in a day, stays bright for days to weeks, and fades out over months. Its core collapses in on itself so thoroughly that its electrons meld with the nuclei of its atoms until the star is made mostly of neutrons—a neutron star—and it shrinks in the space of one second from a radius of about 6,000 kilometers to about 10 kilometers. The collapse causes a shock wave that breaks out of the star's remaining atmosphere with a flash called a shock breakout, and minutes later the star is as bright as 10 billion suns. It fades out over months; the remnant is called a neutron star. Beyond these two main categories, though, are many variants—the Transient Name Server identifies 31 types so far. One new kind, called a gap transient, is dimmer and probably less massive than other supernovae, and nobody knows why it explodes. Another is a superluminous supernova, twice as luminous as a core collapse supernova; it has the light of 20 billion suns, and nobody knows why it's so bright. In 1967, for instance, the U.S. Vela satellites detected surprising flashes of extremely energetic gamma rays that could have been (but weren't) illegal nuclear tests in Earth's atmosphere; the National Enquirer thought similar flashes seen later might be a space war between alien civilizations. Their light rises in seconds to the brightness of a trillion suns, and they last for seconds to hours. The fastest ones might be massive stars going supernova, collapsing so thoroughly that they don't stop at neutron stars and instead condense into star-size black holes that aim high-intensity jets of plasma at Earth. Discovered in 2008, they number only around 70, although this tally will soon change. China's Einstein Probe, an x-ray satellite telescope that began collecting data in mid-2025, should find 50 to 100 fast x-ray bursts a year. “The next few years could be dramatic,” says astronomer Mansi Kasliwal of Caltech. Meanwhile, because fast x-ray transients are still rare, no one is ready to say what they are—maybe massive stars exploding, maybe neutron stars colliding before disappearing into black holes. Another dramatic rarity is called a fast optical blue transient, or FBOT—“fast” because although it explodes at the same outrageous brightness as a superluminous supernova, its light rises and falls not in months but in days. Since then, scientists have seen 12 more Cow-like FBOTs. Astronomers know they're not supernovae—“the energy source of the normal supernovae doesn't work” for Cows, Margutti says—but aren't sure what they are. In 2007 radio astronomer Duncan Lorimer and astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin, who are colleagues at West Virginia University and married, were looking in the archives of a radio telescope survey at a small galaxy 200,000 light-years away. They were interested in pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars that release jets of radio light from their magnetic poles. These lighthouselike jets sweep the sky so that whatever is in their path is exposed to a metronomically regular radio pulse every few seconds to milliseconds. In the course of their search, Lorimer and McLaughlin found a radio spike that lasted a few milliseconds, but it didn't pulse and was so bright it saturated the telescope's instrument. Lorimer calculated its distance as seven billion light-years away. “Oh,” he thought, “it's really far.” Anything that distant and still that bright had to be sending out a billion times more energy than nearby pulsars. This odd find is now called the Lorimer Burst. Surveys have since identified several thousand of these so-called fast radio bursts scattered throughout other galaxies, emitting in one millisecond the radio energy sent out by the sun in 100 years. Their weirdness quotient is high even among transients. That field is “so high it's unstable,” Ravi says. Transients are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days. “Magnetars are invoked to explain a lot of things we don't understand,” says Brian Metzger of Columbia University, a theoretical astrophysicist who specializes in stellar-death transients. Later, when the magnetar's spin period has slowed from milliseconds to seconds, its flares may be seen as a fast radio burst. The stellar-death transients are dying in ways intrinsic to stars. But stars can also die because they're just in the cosmically wrong place, in the nuclei of galaxies with supermassive black holes. Astronomers must distinguish the flashes of nuclear transients from supermassive black holes whose behavior varies. Most of the rest are inactive and just flickering; they have gravitationally cleared out much of the space around them, and their brightness varies by just 10 to 45 percent. Nuclear transients are not active quasars, and they don't flicker—they're cosmic flash-bangs. Astronomers have found around 100 tidal disruption events, each visible for a few months in the x-ray, optical and ultraviolet ranges, each with its own small accretion disk that lasts for a few tens of years. Maybe one in 10 tidal disruption events do what AT2019qiz did and become the site of another kind of nuclear transient, the quasi-periodic eruption. In these cases, an errant star passes through the tidally disrupted star's accretion disk and flares up in x-rays to the brightness of a billion suns. Such flares last minutes and repeat in hours to weeks. One kind of transient discovered in the past decade is called a changing-look quasar (CLQ). It has the brightness of a normal quasar but rapidly changes its appearance in unexplainable ways. It should take thousands of years for a quasar to switch off and go from brilliantly active to quietly inactive. Yet astronomers have found dozens to hundreds of CLQs that change their looks by 200 percent in months—they change so much and so quickly that “they're not theoretically explainable,” says astrophysicist Paul Green of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Maybe they're the aftermath of a long-gone tidal disruption event, or maybe, he says, “we haven't watched long enough to see a change of state that's lasting.” As if CLQs weren't improbable enough, astronomers also find ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), whose problem is in their name: “They're ambiguous,” says astrophysicist Philip Wiseman, who studies nuclear transients at the University of Southampton in England. ANTs are brighter than all transients except gamma-ray bursts. Their light rises slowly over months and lasts for two or more years. “We can find them, but we don't know what they are,” says astronomer Matthew Graham of Caltech, another nuclear-transients specialist. One ANT discovered in 2020 became famous: At first astronomers thought it was an actively feeding supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy, but they couldn't find the galaxy. One of its names is ZTF20abrbeie; astronomers call it Scary Barbie. ANTs could be outsize tidal disruption events—that is, instead of sun-size stars being torn apart by black holes with the mass of a million suns, they might be 10-solar-mass stars torn apart by black holes with the mass of a billion suns. Researchers are still looking for Scary Barbie's galaxy. “We're guessing at half this stuff,” Graham adds. For stellar-death transients, the answer is not exactly no. Several of them may be related to one another or to magnetars; in general, they're a menu of the variables that determine how stars end their lives. For nuclear transients, the answer is unsatisfying: either a captured star or a black hole's accretion disk is brightening. For a better answer, astronomers need to collect many more nuclear transients. Nor can stellar and nuclear transients be put together into a single grand unified theory. “The holy grail is understanding what produced the transient,” says Eliot Quataert of Princeton, a theoretical astrophysicist studying nuclear transients. Theorists want to be able to slot energy sources into a few categories, such as radioactive decay, shocks and gravity, although some transients don't seem to fit into any of these boxes. To figure out the energy sources and maybe unify transients, astronomers need to compare what they see in different wavelengths, which each reflect different physical processes. Accordingly, telescopes now operating in optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray and radio-wave bands are about to be joined by a series of new telescopes in space. Among them are NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will launch by mid-2027 and observe in the infrared; the Einstein Probe in x-ray; and NASA's Ultraviolet Explorer, which will launch in 2030. Understanding transients is important partly for answering other astronomical questions. Supernovae are used as distance markers to enable calculations of the universe's acceleration. Both tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions hold evidence about supermassive black holes that are quiescent and therefore invisible, as well as about the all but theoretical class of black holes whose masses are between those of stellar black holes and supermassive ones. And fast radio bursts, because they are visible in the distant universe, can be used as searchlights to map the distribution of regular matter, of which only 10 percent is known. But transients are also interesting for their own odd selves, for their ability to teach us what physics doesn't forbid. Kasen says they are “laboratories for fundamental physics and extreme conditions”; they are “physics at the extreme,” Margutti says, “and I can't probe that on Earth.” Transients show “the range of phenomena possible in the universe,” Ravi says. A supernova shock breakout travels the distance from Baltimore to Western Australia in half an eyeblink. A magnetar passing 160,000 kilometers away could demagnetize every credit card on Earth. The study of transients is certifiable science, but if it weren't, it would still be reason for near-holy astonishment. Ann Finkbeiner is a science writer based in Baltimore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mosasaurs were enormous marine reptiles that lived more than 66 million years ago, but new evidence shows they did not spend all their time in the ocean. The tooth likely came from an individual that grew up to 11 meters long. Led by scientists at Uppsala University, the international research team concluded that mosasaurs adapted to freshwater river systems during the final million years before their extinction. The unusual mix of land dinosaurs, river-dwelling crocodiles, and a giant marine reptile immediately stood out. If mosasaurs were ocean animals, how did one of their teeth end up preserved in a river? The work was carried out at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) in Amsterdam and focused on isotopes of oxygen, strontium, and carbon. The mosasaur tooth contained unusually high levels of the lighter oxygen isotope (16O), which is typical of freshwater environments rather than marine ones. Strontium isotope ratios also pointed to a freshwater habitat. "Carbon isotopes in teeth generally reflect what the animal ate. Many mosasaurs have low 13C values because they dive deep. The mosasaur tooth found with the T. rex tooth, on the other hand, has a higher 13C value than all known mosasaurs, dinosaurs and crocodiles, suggesting that it did not dive deep and may sometimes have fed on drowned dinosaurs," says Melanie During, one of the study's corresponding authors. When we looked at two additional mosasaur teeth found at nearby, slightly older, sites in North Dakota, we saw similar freshwater signatures. The findings also help explain how this lifestyle shift became possible. Over time, increasing amounts of freshwater flowed into the Western Interior Seaway, a vast inland sea that once ran north to south across what is now central North America and split the continent in two. "For comparison with the mosasaur teeth, we also measured fossils from other marine animals and found a clear difference. Large predators shifting between habitats is not unheard of in evolutionary history. "Unlike the complex adaptation required to move from freshwater to marine habitats, the reverse adaptation is generally simpler," says During. River dolphins live entirely in freshwater even though their ancestors were marine. Mosasaur fossils are common in marine deposits across North America, Europe, and Africa dating from 98-66 million years ago. Earlier discoveries of mosasaur bones at a nearby site support this estimate. The tooth likely belonged to a prognathodontine mosasaur, although its exact genus cannot be identified. Close relatives in the genus Prognathodon had massive heads, powerful jaws, and robust teeth, and are thought to have been opportunistic predators capable of attacking large prey. The research was carried out by scientists from Uppsala University in collaboration with Eastern West Virginia Community and Technical College, Moorefield, West Virginia, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and the North Dakota Geological Survey. The article draws on a chapter from Melanie During's doctoral thesis, which she defended at Uppsala University in November 2024. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
