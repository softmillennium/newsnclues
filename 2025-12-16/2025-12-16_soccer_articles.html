                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It calculates injury cost in top leagues over past five years Chelsea experienced a 44% increase in injuries between June and October compared with the previous season, a report released on Tuesday has found. This year's period covers their participation in the Club World Cup and its aftermath. He made five changes last week for the Champions League defeat at Atalanta, a setback followed by cryptic comments on Saturday after a Premier League win against Everton that he had endured his “worst 48 hours” at the club owing to a lack of support from unspecified people. Howden calculated the financial loss to Chelsea of players missing through injury as £17m up to October, almost a quarter of their £80m Club World Cup prize money, and more than a third of their £45m loss last season. PSG were found to have had 19 injuries, including seven during the Club World Cup. Howden's findings echo concerns expressed by the global players' union Fifpro regarding workload. A Fifpro report in October showed Chelsea's players were given 20 days off after the Club World Cup and that PSG rested their players for 22 days. The current calendar makes no sense for players, fans or clubs.” Howden has produced the Men's European Football Injury Index for the past five years, with the report released on Tuesday calculating there have been 22,596 injuries in Europe's top five men's leagues over that period, costing clubs a combined £2.97bn. Premier League clubs account for 24% of these injuries, with more than £1bn paid out in salaries to injured players. Manchester United incurred the highest injury costs of Premier League clubs at £154.5m over five years, with Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City above average. The report also highlights that young players are most susceptible to injury.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese international defender Takehiro Tomiyasu has officially joined Dutch club Ajax on a short-term contract, seeking to rebuild his career after a challenging period with injuries at Arsenal. The 27-year-old was a free agent after mutually agreeing to terminate his deal with the Gunners in July of this year. He managed 84 appearances for the Gunners in total following his 2021 transfer from Bologna. Tomiyasu has signed a six-month "prove-it" deal with Ajax, running until June next year, with reports suggesting his earnings will be linked to the number of appearances he makes. This arrangement minimises risk for the Dutch giants while offering the player a clear path to consistent playing time once fit. Obviously, I have got many things to say, but the thing that I want to tell you guys the most is just thank you for the love you guys gave me. Now back in training, the versatile defender, capable of playing at right-back or centre-back, aims to regain match sharpness and put himself back in contention for the Japan national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Ajax Director of Football Marijn Beuker has praised the signing, noting Tomiyasu's experience and ability to add balance to the team's relatively young squad. Beuker said: "Takehiro has proven himself to be an excellent defender with extensive experience in several top leagues. Together with the scouting department and the coaching staff, we have reviewed a lot of footage of him in recent weeks, and everyone is enthusiastic. From the outset, he has worked hard on his recovery, the medical staff have assessed him thoroughly, and once his work permit is finalised, he can immediately join group training. "Although he still needs to regain match sharpness, we believe that, given his experience, he will pick this up almost straight away. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Tomiyasu arrives at Ajax with the club in dire straits as, despite a recent uptick in results, the club has endured a woeful start to the season, marked by managerial upheaval and disappointing results in Europe. Results in the Champions League have been even worse with the Amsterdam side sitting 34th in the 36-team league phase, having lost five of their six games so far, though they recently secured a 4-2 victory over Qarabag. Fan unrest has also been a problem, leading to a match abandonment due to fireworks being let off before the match with Groningen. After the game was called off, a club statement said: "Ajax considers what happened in the stadium this evening to be utterly outrageous. We offer our apologies to everyone who has been affected in any way. The safety of spectators and players has been put at risk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea experienced a significant 44 per cent surge in injuries following their participation in this year's expanded Club World Cup, new findings revealed on Tuesday. However, the latest edition of the Men's European Football Injury Index suggests the newly enlarged tournament has, so far, had a "minimal impact" on overall injury rates across European football. The decision by Fifa in 2023 to expand its flagship club event from seven to 32 teams faced considerable opposition, with players' unions voicing concerns over potential physical and mental burnout due to an ever-growing match schedule. Chelsea emerged victorious in the inaugural competition, receiving the trophy from U.S. President Donald Trump at MetLife Stadium and securing approximately $125 million in prize money. Yet, according to the Index, between June and October, Chelsea recorded 23 injuries – more than any of the nine participating clubs from Europe's top leagues. This figure, which included star player Cole Palmer, represents a 44 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. While Chelsea, who played 64 games across the 2024-25 season, saw their injury count rise, the Index, compiled by global insurance firm Howden, noted an overall decrease in injuries among the top European clubs. "In principle you would expect this increased workload to lead to an increase in the number of injuries sustained, as a possible rise in overall injury severity," the Index report stated, but concluded: "The data would suggest a minimal impact on overall injury figures." The nine teams from Europe's top leagues – England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France – recorded 146 injuries from June to October, a reduction from 174 in the previous year. Despite these figures, the report's authors acknowledge it is too early to fully assess the Club World Cup's impact, as the findings only extend to October.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Red Bull New York has completed the signing of American winger Cade Cowell from Mexican side Chivas de Guadalajara on a one-year loan with an option to buy, a source tells amNewYork. It is the first significant attacking signing under new head of sport, Julian de Guzman, and comes shortly after officially announcing the hiring of US soccer legend Michael Bradley as head coach. Get amNY in your inbox!News, events, culture and more — delivered to you. He rose to prominence with the San Jose Earthquakes, scoring 12 goals and providing 12 assists in 114 matches for the MLS side before being purchased for $4 million by Chivas. REUTERS/Eloisa Sanchez Cowell now joins a Red Bulls squad that is currently in transition, but claims to have a clear vision under de Guzman and Bradley. While the new head of sport has promised a more entertaining, attacking brand of soccer, Bradley will likely institute a 4-3-3 formation that will highlight the club's attacking wealth — whenever that picture clarifies. But the Red Bulls have traded away Scottish international Lewis Morgan to San Diego FC, who, when healthy, was one of the squad's most valuable players. Cowell is expected to play a significant role in Bradley's plans on the wing, working alongside Choupo-Moting, and he is likely to be the first domino to fall in addressing de Guzman and Bradley's vision. Should the partnership thrive, there is no reason why Cowell could not at least force his way back into the national team conversation, too. RBNY signs Che Justin Che (Photo courtesy of Red Bull New York) Addressing its depth issue within its back line, New York has also signed right back Justin Che from Brondby of the Danish first division on a three-year contract with an option for the 2029 season. The 22-year-old was once a can't-miss prospect of the US youth national team while with FC Dallas' academy, but injuries have slowed his development. Following a loan spell with German powerhouse Bayern Munich's academy, he made 15 MLS appearances with Dallas before moving to the second team of Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. After signing with Brondby three seasons ago, he proceeded to bounce around Europe on a pair of loans. Still a young, moldable prospect, he is known for his ability to play out of the back, which jives with New York's new style. He will likely compete for the significant minutes at right back with veteran Dylan Nealis. “Justin is an intelligent defender that has great speed and will help add to our backline this upcoming season,” Bradley said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup is coming to Atlanta, and with it tens of thousands of soccer fans ready to spend money. Demand for short-term rentals has already skyrocketed as prospective spectators take to travel sites and plan their World Cup experience. Now, a report from Airbnb and Deloitte found the tournament could drive as much as $70 million for the accommodation sector in Atlanta — and you can get a piece. "Tourists' spending initiates a chain reaction throughout the economy, starting with direct impacts on sectors such as accommodations and restaurants. "Additionally, induced effects arise as higher wages circulate within the economies, further stimulating economic activity across different sectors." Airbnb rental availability is directly impacted by how many Atlanta residents are willing to rent their apartments or homes, but there is a clear financial incentive. More than 200,000 people will be looking for a place to stay during the World Cup, including at least 6,000 Airbnb rentals. Guests are expected to spend an accumulated 45,000 guest nights in the city. That money isn't just going to Airbnb, but a majority portion goes into the pockets of hosts. "We project total host earnings in Atlanta and surrounding areas during the World Cup to reach nearly ($3 million), resulting in an average earnings per host of approximately ($3,700) over the event duration. These earnings could be particularly impactful for women, who represent 59% of Airbnb hosts in the USA, and for seniors, who represent 20% of hosts," according to the report. Travel searches for U.S.-bound trips was also up more than 200%, the company said. Flight interest for Atlanta for the same time period domestically was also up more than 70% from the previous year, KAYAK said. Teams and fans from Spain, Cabo Verde, South Africa, Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Haiti, Uzbekistan, Congo, Jamaica and New Caledonia could all make appearances in Atlanta.</p>

Dallas Stadium will host more matches than any other venue, welcoming eight national teams during the group stage and continuing through multiple knockout rounds. Group stage play in Arlington will feature Argentina, Austria, Croatia, England, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands and the winner of European Play-off Final B, which will be decided in March 2026. “Hosting a tournament-high nine matches featuring some of the world's best players will be an unforgettable experience for fans across our region.” Five group stage matches will be played in Arlington, drawing global attention throughout June 2026: “This is a special and historic time,” said Dan Hunt, FIFA World Cup co-chair and president of FC Dallas, during the press conference. Beyond matchdays, North Texas will serve as a major operational center for the tournament. “We truly are the epicenter of World Cup 2026,” Hunt said. “We have nine matches, a semifinal, the International Broadcast Center and all of these base camps.” Chad Estis, executive vice president of business operations for the Dallas Cowboys, said the stadium was designed with moments like this in mind. “We're excited to show the world what this stadium can be.” FIFA's next sales phase, the Random Selection Draw, opened Dec. 11 and runs through Jan. 13, 2026, at FIFA.com/tickets. According to FIFA, entry timing during the window does not affect selection chances, with successful applicants notified and charged in February. Hospitality packages that include match tickets are already available through FIFA's official provider, On Location. With schedules set and teams confirmed, preparations across North Texas are shifting into high gear. The complete FIFA World Cup 2026 match schedule is available at FIFA.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigeria's hopes of reaching the 2026 FIFA World Cup remain alive following a formal protest lodged by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) against the Democratic Republic of Congo over alleged breaches of player eligibility rules. However, questions have since arisen regarding the eligibility of several Congolese players who featured in that match. Reports suggest that up to six players may not have completed the full nationality switch process required under FIFA regulations. Further concerns have been raised about players holding European passports and being over the age of 21, circumstances that could place them in breach of FIFA's eligibility rules. The Congolese rules say you cannot have a dual citizenship or nationality. Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; there are some of them that have French passports, some of them Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition,” he said.

But right now, our concern is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. FIFA goes by its own regulations, and it was on the basis of what was submitted to FIFA that they cleared them. What we are saying is that it was fraudulent,” he added. The matter is now before FIFA, which will determine whether DR Congo breached eligibility rules. Should Nigeria's petition succeed, the Super Eagles could be reinstated into contention for the Intercontinental Playoffs scheduled to take place in Mexico in March 2026, provided the fixtures have not already been played. However, questions have since arisen regarding the eligibility of several Congolese players who featured in that match. Reports suggest that up to six players may not have completed the full nationality switch process required under FIFA regulations. Further concerns have been raised about players holding European passports and being over the age of 21, circumstances that could place them in breach of FIFA's eligibility rules. The Congolese rules say you cannot have a dual citizenship or nationality. Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; there are some of them that have French passports, some of them Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nigeria Football Federation has confirmed that it has initiated a probe into DR Congo's use of ineligible players during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, a development that could reopen Nigeria's path to the tournament in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, PUNCH Online reports. DR Congo eliminated Nigeria from the African play-offs in November after a 4–3 penalty shoot-out victory in Morocco, a result that ended the Super Eagles' hopes of progressing to the FIFA intercontinental play-off. However, their participation at that stage could now be in doubt following concerns raised by the NFF over the eligibility of several DR Congo players fielded during the African play-offs. Reports suggest that between six and nine DR Congo players who switched national allegiance may not have fully complied with the eligibility requirements under Congolese law before representing the country. While FIFA reportedly cleared the players on the basis that they possessed valid DR Congo passports, it is alleged that they failed to formally renounce their previous citizenships, contrary to the Central African nation's constitution, which does not permit dual nationality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams has suspected medial collateral ligament damage after limping out of Bournemouth's 4-4 draw with Manchester United in the Premier League on Monday. In the second minute of the match at Old Trafford, Adams was injured while challenging Matheus Cunha. He came off after treatment on the pitch. We'll have to check and see if it is a small sprain or bigger. "To lose a player like Tyler for us is massive, especially when you don't have Lewis Cook (suspended). Alex (Scott) has to play in that holding midfield position and he has done it really well but it's bad news for us because Tyler is massive for us." The next U.S. games are not until March, a pair of friendlies. He's been invaluable again for Bournemouth, appearing in all but one Premier League round and scoring twice, including the goal of the month for November.
