                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Developed in partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) and infrastructure provider Crossmint, the multimillion-dollar initiative is part of RMI's national UBI program, known locally as ENRA, the Marshalls Islands' Finance Ministry confirmed. The program replaces quarterly physical cash deliveries with direct digital transfers to eligible citizens, many of whom live across widely dispersed islands. USDM1 is a U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bond fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills. In an exclusive statement to CoinDesk, a Finance Ministry spokesperson said, “USDM1 is issued under New York law using a time-tested Brady-bond structure that has underpinned sovereign finance for decades. Its foundation is not regulatory discretion or policy preference, but settled law.” Treasury collateral is held by an independent trustee, outside the control of any government or private issuer, and redemption rights are fixed, unconditional, and legally enforceable,” the spokesperson added. SDF CEO Denelle Dixon said the program exemplifies “what adoption looks like for blockchain technology,” enabling everyday financial access where it was previously lacking. “Every unit is issued one-to-one against short-dated U.S. Treasuries held in trust, fully backed and legally segregated at all times.” Tether leads $8 million investment in Speed to push USDT further into everyday payments Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto pundit Chain Cartel has raised several key points following SWIFT's latest comment on its move to adopt blockchain technology. The pundit claimed that Ripple's XRPL network best suits what SWIFT is trying to achieve and suggested that the two firms collaborate. In an X post, Chain Cartel stated that SWIFT admitted they are building Ripple's XRPL network, but did not explicitly say so in their announcement. The pundit explained that SWIFT's language in the X post suggests that they want to build something like Ripple's XRPL. He declared that it is not Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any generic blockchain experiment but precisely what Ripple has been building for a decade. Chain Cartel noted that Ripple's model has always been a neutral settlement layer, real-time atomic finality, shared ledger visibility for institutions, interoperability with legacy rails, and liquidity-first design. Chain Cartel then alluded to SWIFT's statement about its plans to build a blockchain-based ledger to be included in its payment infrastructure and provide a single source of truth, enabling instant, 24/7 cross-border payments. In line with this, the pundit remarked that SWIFT doesn't replace rails, but instead coordinates them, and that Ripple doesn't replace banks, but instead connects them. He added that SWIFT is acknowledging that the future payment stack requires a ledger layer, not just messaging, and that the only model already battle-tested at scale is Ripple's XRPL. However, it is worth mentioning that SWIFT doesn't plan to integrate Ripple's Ledger. Instead, it is building this blockchain-based ledger in partnership with Consensys and Chainlink. Ripple is looking to expand its payment service, as it recently announced plans to begin testing its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum layer-2 networks Base, Ink, Optimism, and Unichain. Ripple plans to expand its RLUSD stablecoin beyond the Ethereum and XRPL networks to these layer-2 networks through its partnership with Wormhole. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The immediate price action points to reclaiming this $3,000 support, but a longer-term technical view suggests the current decline may be part of a much larger and more defined price framework. A macro analysis shared by crypto analyst Dona examines Ethereum's behavior over the past two years with a structured range that suggests that the cryptocurrency might bottom at $2,187. Ethereum's Two-Year Range Still Defines The Bigger Picture According to the analysis, Ethereum has largely traded within a broad horizontal range for close to two years, aside from two notable fakeouts: one below resistance in the first half of 2025 and one above resistance in the second half of the year, which led to a new price high of $4,946 in August. On the weekly timeframe, price has repeatedly respected an upper boundary around $4,000 to $4,100, while finding consistent demand near the lower range support just above $2,100. This price action has resulted in a structure that resembles an inverse head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale. Instead of signaling immediate upside, however, the formation shows how price has oscillated between these defined trendlines, with mid-range reactions often determining whether Ethereum pushes to resistance or slips back toward support. Why $2,187 Stands Out As A Critical Downside Target If Ethereum continues to trade below the mid-range support currently around $3,000, then the price could follow a familiar range rotation path toward this lower boundary. Instead, it will complete another cycle within the range, similar to previous declines that eventually transitioned into a bounce for a rally phase. Aside from range-bound trades, taking directional positions may be less attractive as liquidity thins into the end of the year. From this perspective, the next major move is more likely to arrive in January 2026. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood made a fresh multi-million dollar bet on Tom Lee-linked Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies on Monday, even as the broader crypto market continued to slide. The purchase came as Wood reiterated that Bitcoin remains her top-ranked cryptocurrency alongside Ethereum and Solana.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Ark Invest purchased  550,404 shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies across its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF exchange-traded funds, according to daily trade disclosures. Bitmine, associated with Fundstrat co-founder Lee, has positioned itself as an Ethereum-focused treasury company and has been aggressively accumulating ether on a near-weekly basis. Despite expanding exposure to Ethereum-linked strategies, Wood said that Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency in her view. Asked to rank Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana during a recent podcast appearance, Wood said Bitcoin is typically “the first one to get sold and drag the others down” during periods of market stress. Ethereum, she said, is increasingly becoming the platform institutions are choosing as they build on its layer-one blockchain and expand activity through layer-two networks. Wood also recently reiterated Ark Invest's long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, saying recent adjustments to the firm's valuation model have not altered its top-end price target of $1.5 million. Speaking during an Ark webinar  in November, Wood said parts of the model were updated to reflect the rapid growth of stablecoins, which she said are increasingly serving as an “insurance policy” in emerging markets. In this recent webinar, I discuss why the liquidity squeeze that has hit #AI  and #crypto  will reverse in the next few weeks, something the markets seemed to buy, and why AI is not in a bubble. The 123% increase noted below was in Palantir's US commercial business last qtr. Ark analyst David Puell noted that Bitcoin's share of transaction volume in developing regions remains below that of stablecoins, accounting for roughly 20% compared with between 40% and 50% for stablecoins, citing Chainalysis data. Despite these changes, Wood said Ark's long-term conviction remains intact. “Our bull price … really hasn't changed,” she said. Ethereum's near-term price action remains weak despite signs of rebuilding institutional interest, according to CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri. “If so, the main target for the bottom is at $2,065,” Tahiri said, citing a 1.61 external Fibonacci retracement level as key support, after which a significant bounce could follow. He added that while improving long-term sentiment and prominent bullish positions are constructive, they do not invalidate Ethereum's current downtrend. “This disconnect explains why Ethereum's price is falling despite the release of positive headlines,” Tahiri said. Tahiri added that downside risk remains elevated until Ethereum reclaims key resistance levels and confirms a trend reversal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, questions around where humanitarian aid money actually ends up have followed the sector. Large donation flows often move through layers of organisations, partners, and local operators, making it difficult for donors to see how funds are used once they leave their accounts. The token is designed to support on-chain tracking of humanitarian funds by using a multi-chain setup across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon zkEVMe transactions, making them more transparent and traceable. Industry estimates suggest as much as 40% of humanitarian funding is lost to fraud, waste, or administrative overhead, contributing to an annual global aid shortfall of roughly $320 billion. While these challenges are not new, they have become harder to ignore as digital finance tools change how money moves across borders in other sectors. The contrast has sharpened questions around why aid funding remains difficult to track at scale. One reason blockchain keeps coming up in these conversations is its ability to follow money as it moves. In humanitarian settings, funds often cross borders quickly and pass through several hands before reaching the ground, which makes oversight difficult. Putting transactions on a shared ledger is meant to reduce that opacity and make it easier to see how funds are allocated at each step. HumaCoin operates on a multi-chain framework across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon zkEVM, networks HumaTek says were chosen to support faster settlement and lower transaction costs. These considerations are particularly relevant in humanitarian contexts, where funding often needs to move across borders without delays or excessive fees. “Our blockchain-based ecosystem will cut out intermediaries to reduce aid delivery costs, providing faster, more efficient, and more secure aid,” said Tommy LaRocca, CEO of HumaTek. The company has also set aside 400 million coins for HumaClub, its public benefit corporation. These tokens are intended to support global aid initiatives over a 40-year period, allowing for sustained, measurable impact rather than one-off contributions. HumaTek has already begun putting HumaCoin to practical use through its HumaAID Food Box Program in Tampa, Florida. In partnership with Station House BBQ, the initiative has provided over 1,000 hot meals, all recorded on-chain to track exactly how donations are used. HumaCoin acts as the transaction layer, HumaDash provides real-time visibility into fund flows, HumaAID coordinates meal distribution as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and HumaClub supports ongoing community engagement. Crypto wallets negate these barriers, offering a portable, permissionless way for people to receive funds directly, without relying on local banks or extensive documentation. “Crypto wallets can help financially excluded populations, including refugees and the unbanked,” Tommy LaRocca added. “Accepting crypto donations also allows nonprofits to engage new, tech-forward donors.” While the platform is still expanding, these initial efforts illustrate a greater change in the space, particularly how technology is strengthening humanitarian aid rather than trying to replace it. For HumaTek, the focus remains on measurable impact, long-term engagement, and building systems that help aid in reaching those who need it most.

On 14 October 2025, the Information Commissioner's Office (the ICO) hosted its annual Data Protection Practitioners Conference, with a number of Burges Salmon's lawyers in attendance. There was an interesting session delivered on lessons learned from cyber-attacks. In this session, the ICO talked about 5 actionable insights coming out of the range of cyber attacks that they have been involved with. We have also added comments on how these apply to pension schemes trustees. MFA mitigates common attack methods such as phishing and password spraying. MFA is a security process that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before gaining access to an account, system or application. MFA can help trustees maintain the security of the mass amounts of sensitive personal and financial data they manage in a cheap and easy way. Trustees should ask questions to determine whether their administrators are carrying out vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. While the ICO does not mandate penetration testing be carried out, organisations must identify risks and ensure appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to mitigate against them. As penetration testing is invasive and costly, schemes will need to consider whether this is proportionate for them to carry out themselves. Critical or high-risk vulnerabilities (based on CVSS score) should be prioritised. Trustees should ask questions to determine whether their administrators have a clear patching policy and that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. If professional trustees hold large amounts of personal scheme data, it may be prudent to introduce patch management. Controls in place to detect unusual or suspicious activity. If resourcing is an issue, focus on critical assets. Trustees should liaise with their scheme administrators to ensure they have appropriate monitoring in place and that alerts are reviewed and acted upon promptly. It may be appropriate for professional trustees to establish their own internal monitoring and alerting processes. The systematic process of identifying, tracking and managing an organisation's assets. Consider obligations under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK GDPR. The ICO refers to this as an Information Asset Register. Once this is understood, trustees can make a risk-based decision regarding the extent to which they would like to review their suppliers (both from a processes and a contractual perspective), which is expected by the Pensions Regulator and the ICO. The 5 actionable insights from cyber attacks that the ICO has dealt with are an interesting lessons learned piece that trustees should be aware of. From a pensions perspective, the key actions and takeaways are: Data and Asset Mapping: Schemes should have an up to date data and asset map to understand their cyber footprint. Trustees can then make informed, risk-based decisions on the extent to which they would like to review their suppliers (both from a processes and a contractual perspective). whether they carry out vulnerability scanning and/or penetration testing and how frequently; We would be very happy to help pension scheme trustees with the key takeaways set out above and with building their scheme's cyber security resilience. "It is in the character of growth that we should learn from both pleasant and unpleasant experiences"</p>

Gen1 treasury approaches largely rely on price appreciation of a single asset and typically lack systematic risk management, which can expose shareholders to significant drawdowns and dilution during adverse market conditions. Eric M. Jackson, Founder and CEO of EMJX, said, “Every major technology category goes through generational transitions. In digital assets, we believe the next phase is defined by disciplined risk management and multi-asset flexibility rather than single-asset exposure alone. Many digital-asset treasuries today function more like passive markers in the market — they rise and fall with price movements. EMJX is designed to operate more like a vessel with navigation systems, applying quantitative models and AI-enabled risk controls to help manage volatility across market cycles. Our objective is to reinvest capital back into the treasury over time rather than rely on dilution, and to build a transparent, institutional-grade platform with a long-term orientation. When these risk-management activities generate excess capital, the Company intends to allocate that capital back into its digital-asset treasury rather than relying on equity issuance, subject to market conditions, governance oversight, and regulatory considerations. EMJX was founded by Eric M. Jackson, Ph.D., a long-time technology investor and market analyst known for identifying inflection points in misunderstood public companies before they became widely recognized. Over the past several years, Dr. Jackson publicly identified and analyzed a number of non-consensus opportunities that later experienced significant market re-ratings, including Carvana, Opendoor, Better Home & Finance, and Nextdoor. His work around Opendoor helped catalyze a large, engaged retail investor community commonly referred to as the “OPEN Army,” which emphasized long-term conviction, transparency, and platform-level analysis over short-term trading. That same analytical framework underpins the Rising Dynasty philosophy — a research-driven approach focused on power-law outcomes, structural change, and disciplined risk awareness. EMJX applies these principles to the digital-asset treasury space through quantitative systems rather than discretionary positioning. EMJX's digital-asset treasury operating system is powered by its proprietary Quantitative AI and Machine Learning (QAM) Engine, which has been developed and refined since 2021. The QAM Engine is designed to analyze market conditions and inform portfolio-level risk-management decisions across multiple digital assets, subject to governance and oversight. The Company believes digital-asset treasuries are entering a new phase, where survivability through volatility, disciplined capital allocation, and long-term compounding — rather than simple asset exposure — become the defining competitive advantages. EMJX is a Gen2 digital-asset treasury operating system designed to manage multi-asset digital holdings using quantitative models, artificial intelligence, and systematic risk controls. The platform emphasizes transparency, governance, and disciplined capital allocation across varying market environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitmine Chair Tom Lee says “the best days for crypto are ahead” as the firm tops up its treasury with another $300 million worth of Ethereum. Lee said “positive developments in digital assets” such as favourable regulations, new US crypto laws and Wall Street's adoption of crypto will fuel the sector's growth. “These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate Ethereum towards our ‘alchemy of 5%' target,” he said. Backed by marquee investors including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, Bitmine currently owns more than 3.2% of Ethereum's supply. The haul follows a $435 million purchase earlier in December. Lee cited Fusaka, a major upgrade to the Ethereum network that boosted scalability and usability rolled out on December 3, as another key reason for buying. To be sure, Bitmine's stock price is down about 30% from its highs this month and trading at $31 per share. It is not the only digital asset treasury to be down. Ethereum is trading at just above $2,900 at time of reporting, down some 40% from its all-time high set in August, against the backdrop of a $1.4 trillion crypto market drawdown. The Lookonchain wallet tracking account has flagged over $100 million in selling this week. Bitmine's announcement comes the same day JP Morgan's asset management division debuted its first-ever tokenised money market fund built on Ethereum. MONY “offers daily dividend reinvestment and investors will be able to subscribe and redeem using cash or stablecoins,” the firm said. George Gatch, chief executive of JP Morgan Asset Management, said that “by harnessing technology alongside our deep expertise in active management, we're able to provide clients with advanced, innovative, and cost-effective capabilities that help them achieve their investment goals.” “JP Morgan launches its first tokenised money market fund,” Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute said on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most likely, you are managing crypto in 2025 with at least two wallets, as many people do. Crypto wallet usage has grown to almost $14 billion in 2024, with the number of user wallet downloads reaching levels last seen during the 2021 peak. In other words, there are more users, meaning more wallets are floating around, each of which may be used for a specific task or set of functions. The question is not whether you will use multiple wallets to manage your crypto, but rather how to make them work well together without creating a mess. It is not necessary to have more wallets simply because everyone else does. It's essential because each wallet does something better than the other. You may use a mobile wallet for small, quick purchases on your phone, such as coffee or NFTs. On the other hand, a hardware wallet keeps your larger investments safe because it is offline, making it unreachable to hackers. Lastly, the exchange wallet lets you trade and exchange your cryptocurrency without having to transfer funds back and forth between exchanges. AI-driven tools can now help you manage and optimise your wallets more effectively. For example, AI apps can automatically categorise your wallet activity, making it easier to track expenses, investments, and trading patterns. Security plays a major role in all of this. For example, your Ethereum wallet won't help you much on Solana or Bitcoin. When choosing the best crypto wallet for everyday needs, consider which chains you'll use most often and whether you need cross-chain functionality built in. Some of the currently most popular hardware wallets are Ledger and Trezor, while among hot wallets, the trends tend to favour Best Wallet and Exodus. Start with a clear plan before you create multiple different wallets and forget which one holds what. Write down what you need each wallet to do. When you set up each wallet, save your recovery phrases separately and securely. There will most likely be a “Connect Wallet” option on the site. When you click it, you'll select your wallet from the options provided, then confirm the connection in your mobile/wallet application. If a wallet is requesting more permissions than necessary, it is considered a red flag and warrants further research of that wallet. Most platforms also allow users to switch between connected wallets. This allows you to keep multiple wallets active for different functions without having to log in and out of the platform. Portfolio-tracking apps pull data from multiple wallets and display everything in one place. You connect your wallet addresses (read-only, not full access) and the app shows your total holdings, transaction history, and current values. CoinTracking, Delta, and similar apps save you from checking five different wallets every time you want to see your portfolio. On top of that, cross-chain bridges let you move assets between different blockchains without going through an exchange. Network fees change based on congestion, so check current gas prices before you transfer anything.

HKEX plans to adopt digital currencies and tokenisation in the next decade, which analysts say are in demand for round-the-clock trading

With Nasdaq seeking US regulatory approval to extend its trading hours to 23 hours, some industry players believe local bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will need to consider a similar move for certain products to enhance its competitiveness.

HKEX chief executive Bonnie Chan Yiting did not mention trading hours in her blog on Monday, but she did say the bourse operator would expand into digital currencies and tokenisation over the next decade, which analysts pointed out were the types of products in demand for round-the-clock trading.

“Trading securities 23 hours a day may not be suitable at the current stage in Hong Kong,” said Robert Lee Wai-wang, lawmaker and chairman of Hong Kong-based Grand Finance Group. “However, HKEX's futures trading should actively explore extending trading hours as many futures markets are already trading 24 hours a day.”

The issue came under the spotlight after Nasdaq, home to tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to extend trading to 23 hours per day, five days a week, up from 16 hours a day now, according to its filing.

“Nasdaq submits its proposal to extend its trading hours to compete for order flow from these investors, as well as to position itself favourably in the future to participate in markets that trade digital assets,” the filing said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Delhi [India], December 16: This initiative empowers key stakeholders such as drivers, NBFCs, OEMs, Policy makers and recyclers, fueling EV adoption and financial inclusion in India. Zenfinity Energy, a deep-tech battery company incubated at IIT Madras, and Chargeup, India's EV Tech platform for last mile drivers, today announced the launch of India's first blockchain-based Battery Passport, starting with a 3,000-battery pilot (15 MWh) to be deployed across major Indian cities in the next 6 months. Built on India's emerging "Battery Aadhaar" framework, this passport captures both static and high-resolution dynamic data across the full battery lifecycle--marking a pioneering step toward India's transition to Digital Battery Passports (DBPs) aligned with global standards. India is projected to import more than 25 GWh of lithium-ion cells and batteries in FY25-26, equivalent to nearly 156,000 tonnes of cells. To finance this scale of batteries--whether new, in-field, or in resale markets--stakeholders need accurate State of Health (SoH) and remaining useful life (RUL) data. These metrics can only be generated through continuous capture of in-field dynamic data reflecting cyclic ageing, calendar ageing, thermal stress, operational behavior, and telemetry patterns. All of this is anchored on a permissioned blockchain ledger, ensuring tamper-proof, immutable, and selectively shareable battery records. This system supports compliance with India's Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR 2022) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandates, while creating the data backbone for a transparent, circular battery economy. By integrating dynamic operational and ageing data, Zenfinity and Chargeup are bringing the next generation of lifecycle intelligence to India's EV ecosystem. * Chargeup's Driver Karma Score, underwriting models, and risk mitigation engine Each battery receives a unique digital identity capturing its entire operational history, degradation trends, and remaining life. The Driver Karma Score layers on driver behavior, battery usage discipline, and payment reliability, creating a unified risk signature for each asset. Weak batteries are an ongoing challenge in India's scaling EV ecosystem. A verifiable battery passport can assure all stakeholders of a battery's performance and remaining life, ultimately accelerate EV adoption and set new industry benchmarks." "Integrating Zenfinity's battery passport with our platform is a game-changer for last-mile drivers and the EV financing ecosystem. Financiers and recyclers, in turn, get unparalleled visibility into asset health. Together, we're creating a framework where trust replaces uncertainty--benefiting drivers, NBFCs, and the entire value chain with a goal to financial Inclusion and acceleration of EV adoption in India" Chargeup is India's first EV tech platform for last mile drivers, enabling battery financing, assured uptime, and guaranteed resale value for electric auto drivers. Through our AI powered platform, we de-risk financing for lenders, extend battery life for OEMs, and help drivers to run more and earn more -- connecting all in one seamless platform. Chargeup's data-led approach expands credit access for underserved last-mile drivers at lower rates, while helping NBFCs and financial institutions de-risk EV financing. With a growing presence across key Indian states, Chargeup is reimagining the future of India's EV ecosystem and working towards empowering last-mile drivers to run more & earn more. Our AI digital twin validates every pack against design intent in real time, while Battery Passport creates finance-grade traceability from commissioning to end-of-life.
