                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo are re-teaming for the feature film Heist of Benin. Set against the backdrop of contemporary London, Heist of Benin is described as a “thriller that intertwines art, love and restitution.” Oyelowo will star. It has just been announced on stage at the Studiocanal Paris showcase, which is taking place as this story publishes. The film marks the latest collaboration between DuVernay and Oyelowo, who also worked together on Academy Award-winning movie Selma, which earned acclaim for its portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 1965 Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery. DuVernay said: “Reuniting with David in this way feels full circle. This film speaks to history, identity and love, all through the lens of a high-stakes, modern adventure. “Ava and I have been looking for the right story to tell together again,” Oyelowo added. It's thrilling and high-powered with deeply resonant themes that matter to us both.” The film is produced by Endurance Media's Steve Richards and Jake Katofsky alongside Yoruba Saxon's Lisa Bruce and Oyelowo, from an original idea and spec script from screenwriter Jesse Quiñones, who will executive produce. Studiocanal will finance, distribute and handle international sales. Ron Halpern, Shana Eddy and Sam Shipp will oversee for the studio. Meanwhile, Studiocanal revealed on stage Elsinore, a Simon Stone and Stephen Beresford movie starring Andrew Scott and Olivia Colman about the life of actor Ian Charleson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Less than a month after Billy The Kid ended after three seasons, MGM+ has ordered a new western series. The streamer and linear network has greenlit a series adaptation of The Magnificent Seven from Heroes creator Tim Kring. The Magnificent Seven, the 1960 film from director John Sturges, was one of a number of MGM/United Artists movie titles that Jeff Bezos' company had targeted for development after Amazon acquired the James Bond studio. The eight-part drama series will be written by Kring, who also created Fox's Touch. It will be produced by MGM+ Studios and MGM Television Studios and is set to start production in June. After a peaceful Quaker village is massacred by mercenaries working for a greedy and ruthless land baron trying to force them off the land he covets, seven gifted but flawed mercenaries are hired by the community to protect them from the land baron's hired guns. But as the team embeds itself in the community, preparing to defend them against overwhelming odds, they are all forced to grapple with an essential question: is the use of violence acceptable to defend a people whose faith is based on non-violence? The series takes a deep dive into the stories behind each of the Seven; what's at stake for them, and why they choose to take on this mission. “Tim Kring is a master storyteller,” said Michael Wright, head of MGM+. “Tim, Donald De Line, Larry Mirisch, and Bruce Kaufman have crafted a series that delivers the energy of a classic western, honors the legacy of the original film, and reasserts its timeless themes of the power of unity against oppression and flawed heroes finding redemption by helping those who can't help themselves.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you were to stick a pin into a map of Los Angeles at the precise location where one might least expect a heinous act of murderous violence, it would likely land right here, on South Chadbourne Avenue. This narrow lane in Brentwood, tucked discreetly a few blocks south of Sunset, lined with palm trees and gated multimillion-dollar mansions, is usually as calm and idyllic as a David Hockney landscape. On this day, Dec. 14, it looks like something out of a James Ellroy fever dream. Critic's Appreciation: Rob Reiner Was So Much More Than a Capable Company Man Nick Reiner Revealed Violent Outburst, Family Issues and "Cocaine Heart Attack" on 2018 Podcast Taping At one point, a resident wanders out of her home, glances at the mob milling in front of her driveway, breaks into sobs, then rushes back inside. Police hadn't yet officially confirmed it, but everybody here knows what's just happened. Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, have been brutally murdered. There have been some hard Hollywood deaths this past year — Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Diane Keaton — but it's fair to say this one hit the town particularly hard, and not just because of the shocking circumstances. As a teenager, Reiner occasionally popped up elsewhere on the dial — there was a non-speaking part in Wagon Train — and when he was 20 his dad gave him a role in 1967's Enter Laughing, his semiautobiographical movie about growing up in Depression-era New York. But, of course, it was the part Reiner landed just a few years later, at the age of 23, that would set the course for a career that would one day rival and even surpass his father's. For a generation of TV viewers, Reiner will always be “Meathead,” Archie Bunker's long-suffering liberal son-in-law on Norman Lear's seminal 1970s sitcom All in the Family. The show, which gleefully pushed political and social hot button issues — racism, sexism, homophobia, they all were treated as punchlines — was such a cultural phenomenon it could easily have defined Reiner's legacy on its own. For starters, there was This Is Spinal Tap, his 1984 directorial debut that pretty much invented the mockumentary (poignantly, last September, it was bookended by its long-in-the-works sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, Reiner's final film). Over the next incredibly productive eight years, he'd make Stand by Me (River Phoenix's breakout film); The Princess Bride (still a cable-TV holiday staple); When Harry Met Sally (the Nora Ephron-scripted rom-com that made Meg Ryan a star — and also the film on which Reiner met his wife, who was a photographer on the set); Misery (which won Kathy Bates an Oscar); and A Few Good Men (noms for best picture and best supporting actor for Jack Nicholson). He was a founding board member of AFER, the organization that, in 2013, helped overturn California's ban on same-sex marriage. His opinions sometimes drew fire from the right — especially recently, with President Trump not even letting Reiner's death get in the way of attacking him for being “deranged” and “very bad for our country” — but most reasonable people, even when they disagreed with him, could find something to respect in his humanity and dignity. His 1994 high-concept family comedy North — with future-Frodo Elijah Wood playing a hyper-articulate 11-year-old who sues his parents for not being appreciative enough — was the flop that finally cracked his winning streak, not only tanking at the box office but also famously earning zero stars from Roger Ebert. Still, despite such later-career setbacks, Reiner's track record at his peak, in the 1980s and early 1990s, puts him right up there with Ron Howard, Robert Zemeckis and maybe even Steven Spielberg, planting him squarely in the A-list echelon of late 20th century auteurs, part of Hollywood's most elite cadre. Except for one other — the one Reiner and his 67-year-old wife of 35 years joined this past weekend, after the horrific events at their Brentwood home; it's a much sadder pantheon, but equally famous and even more enduring — the icons of Hollywood's most infamous crimes and catastrophes. It's not too far from another famous Brentwood address: 875 Bundy Drive, where Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered. And that house, it turns out, is only a short distance from Fifth Helena Drive, where Marilyn Monroe overdosed. There are scores of other equally grim landmarks strewn all over the city. Regrettably, Rob Reiner's story, however huge its imprint on the culture, is now part of that mournful, terrible tradition. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

The actor was in L.A. for the show's first round of in-person U.S. press, and he's in good spirits despite what has to be a long week. It's hard to go on the Internet and not see Williams or his co-star, Connor Storrie. HBO Max Teases 'Lanterns,' New Seasons of 'The Pitt' and 'Industry' in 2026 Preview Written and directed for television by Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney, Heated Rivalry follows Williams' Shane Hollander, an anxious and endlessly endearing Canadian hockey prodigy and his rival, Russian phenom Ilya Rozanov, played by Storrie. Even if things didn't happen overnight, life is looking a different than it used to for Williams. Before taking on Heated Rivalry, he was working as a waiter at The Old Spaghetti Factory in New Westminster, British Columbia. That was how I paid my rent. Vancouver is more expensive than Los Angeles, so it was very hard,” he says of his old gig. In a lot of ways, it was a lot easier than what it's like now.” Williams, however, is proceeding with cautious optimism, looking forward to whatever the future might hold. Below, the actor speaks with THR about what he initially thought life would look like after Heated Rivalry, how he deals with negative comments online and what he hopes comes next. I assume you've been a little crazy. It's pointing every which way, and I don't know who the hell is right, but I'm very excited. I was talking with Connor [Storrie] about this. I don't know if someone's going to reach out and be like, “We want you in this new YA show. It's really poorly written, but we think you're perfect.” Or if Luca Guadagnino is going to crawl out of Italy and be like, “I want you.” I don't want to make any assumptions, so I'm just trying to be as calm as I can. But so far, the fan reactions are very nice and mostly wholesome. Are you someone who wants to know? Instagram, I don't really have a problem actually. I can just look at it for 10 minutes, and then that's my day. But Twitter's the one [that's a problem] because it's shit posting. I always doubted celebrities when they said, “There are going to be 200 good things, and you'll remember the bad one.” I was like surely that can't be true, and it is true. I also take the bad ones with a grain of salt. Those are the ones I'm sharing with people around me. I think my friends and family sometimes even take joy in really overt assholes. It's so ridiculous to actually believe these people. Or is it simply something you can't prepare for? I don't think it's something you can prepare for. I would say to a degree it has been gradual. We saw the fans find us when we were halfway through shooting — they found it through Instagram sleuthing — so it wasn't like, oh, this is a totally normal fan base. It was like, oh, these people can be obsessive. Then I think our Instagrams only went to a few thousand followers. We had Montreal day one, which wasn't too crazy. Then we had press later on, so it was kind of a build. There's no way to prepare for what this side of things looks like. When you took this project on, what did your life look like? I was serving at The Old Spaghetti Factory [in] New Westminster. It's like y'all's version of an Olive Garden. Walking through that door every day though, through the server's entrance, is a little bit like… I'm not better than this, but I do feel I'm good enough at acting that I should be reaping some reward for it. That was how I paid my rent. Vancouver is more expensive than Los Angeles, so it was very hard. In a lot of ways, it was a lot easier than what it's like now. I'm very curious what you thought life was going to look like once the show came out when you initially signed on. When I got this role, and I saw the fan base — it wasn't a New York Times bestseller and it didn't have any metrics of how many copies it sold. Jacob was coming off Shoresy and Letterkenny, so I was looking at that as a metric. For him to do two successful shows that are hockey related, I thought it seemed a little bit more commercially viable. If you go gay hockey, less hockey… I didn't think it would blow up to this. I thought it'd be more of a niche fan base. Episode six drops, five months go past. I'll maybe cap out 100,000 followers, and that'll be the level, so this already is like, oh, fuck, did not expect this. I know there is a lot of sex and a lot of stuff that's sparking interest in it. But I always thought from the moment I read [them], they are Emmy's quality scripts, and Jacob is a brilliant writer. I'm honored to be a part of this. All Connor and I could do was fuck it up. After seeing how good Connor was at Ilya and then him getting cast, it made me a little bit more confident that Jacob must be casting me somewhat right. If Connor was so good at what he does, maybe if I'm almost as good as that, then I must be pretty OK. I [also] think queer sports hasn't really been done too much. If Challengers was the cocktease of it all, then our show just leans in and gets in there. How much did you know about this story before? I didn't even know hockey smut was a thing, let alone popular. I wasn't even very familiar with how these women-catered romance genres, how fucking vulgar they are. Not in a bad way, by any means, but they get into it. But holy fuck, I just didn't realize that was the level. It supersedes the sex and the level of intimacy, and these characters really stay with you after you read them. That's sort of what surprised me to a degree. Having read this book, it wasn't super clear how that would work on screen. Was that something you had to work through day-to-day? After reading Jacob's scripts, even before the book, I immediately saw how he would operate. My dad is on the spectrum, he knows it. He's a mechanical engineer, graduated top of his class, first in class in everything, very technical genius in a lot of ways, but sort of socially… I think he would say that he doesn't want to deal with emotions. He has told me, I'm not even paraphrasing, “I relate more with Vulcan than human,” referencing the Star Trek, the hyper-cerebral alien creatures. He has a sensitivity to him that is very boyish. Rachel [Reid] has said [Shane] is autistic, so I think I knew how it should look. I empathized with him a lot, immediately. What is it about Shane that you love and were drawn to? He is hyper competent at this one thing. He's stereotypically masculine in a lot of regards. He's harboring something that he thinks is a career-ending secret because he just doesn't have the emotional maturity or societal maturity to sort of understand what his own queerness means. And yet, he still never harms a fly. This story takes place over almost a decade. How do you handle that as an actor? I [asked him if he was] blockshooting this thing. He [said we were] shooting it one giant five-hour movie. I was talking with actors who had done Christopher Nolan-y storylines because I [wanted to know how] they did that. A lot of the actors I kept hearing [from] were talking about physical maps that they drew, like a cheat sheet of timeline points. Then the scripts were so clear of where they were each time that if I was coming into a day, we're doing year two, and it's the 10th hour of the shoot day, and before that we were shooting year eight. I would have to [ask Jacob] what happened right before. “Pre-Rose, post this, this happened, haven't said this yet.” I got it, and then he would have to tell me very little for me to know exactly what happens after and what has happened right before. I goof off a lot, but all the work was done was well before I even got to set. You said something earlier that was essentially that you were doing a gay hockey show minus a lot of the hockey. But hockey was still a part of it. I could stand without falling, and push and waver around the ice, but it wasn't even a true skate, skate. I [asked] Jacob how much hockey he needed us to do. That was one of the first questions I asked him. He was like, “Jump off the bench, skate up to the face off.” I made it my goal to be able to play rec hockey; drop in beer league hockey was my sort of obnoxious goal. I fell short, but from the gist of what I understood from him, it would've been more than what we needed. What about when you shot the hockey scenes? The hockey section was all packed into one week, and it was much later into the shoot. We didn't step on the ice until our fourth week in or something. Even when we were in Toronto, we were meeting with our hockey coordinator to skate. The closer we got to the hockey, I [started thinking]; how do I hold a mouth guard? How do I jump over the thing? I realized it wouldn't be all this hockey stuff, it'll be hockey culture stuff. You seem to be having a lot of fun with this experience, which is nice to see. What are you doing to keep it fun, especially as it gets a bit more daunting perhaps? Well, I have one of my best friends for life right beside me through it all, which is already a luxury that a lot of actors don't get. At the end of the day, I'm pretty forgiving with myself if I'm talking with a reporter in a polite, more boring way. There was already a built-in fanbase for this project, but you did shoot most of it in a bubble before people knew. In hindsight, I want to say it was probably really helpful. I did still go on social media and Reddit to hear people's discussion about the book because I did want it to be a shared effort in a way. Shane is fucking overthinking things every single second. If this just makes me more neurotic, it can only help. For another character, I would not do that necessarily. I think he cried during one of the chemistry reads. I [thought] that was a good sign. After reading the book, and then reading discussions about the book and the character — I think it was good that it got to feel like a student film. At this level of hype, it could've only added more pressure on Connor and me, and just made it a little bit more uncomfortable. Some people talk about this show like it's just smut. At the end of the day, I believe I have a lot more to offer. As an actor, and an actor who likes character actors, those have always been the role models from a single digit age. That's just where I'd want to go — challenging roles with auteur filmmakers is the very natural, not forced proclivity. If it actually pans out that way, I'm very appreciative. If it leads to very commercial piss and cheap fast food movies, well then, OK, I guess. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

Steven Spielberg is returning to the aliens-among-us grandeur of his classic films like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “War of the Worlds” with his latest event film, “Disclosure Day.” The film's title was revealed in a teaser shared online by Universal Pictures on Tuesday; the movie is set for release on June 12, 2026, with the teaser rumored to play ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” this December. about the film's first look when an ominous billboard appeared in Times Square this month showcasing a bird and the promise that “all will be disclosed.” Spielberg's latest film stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, and Colman Domingo, with a script by David Koepp. Related Stories When Indie Film Becomes a Startup: How a $65,000 Feature Guaranteed Its Distribution ‘Avatar: Fire and Ash' Review: For the First Time in His Spectacular Career, James Cameron Delivers a Movie That Feels Like Something You've Seen Before The story for “Disclosure Day” comes from Spielberg's own idea, and while the trailer showcases some apocalyptic imagery, particularly as Blunt delivers a weather forecast interrupted by disturbing extraterrestrial noises, the plot has been concealed until now. This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. Spielberg shoots the film with his regular director of photography, Janusz Kamiński, whose widescreen images of flares and shadows are on full display here. “Disclosure Day” is produced by five-time Academy Award nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (“The Fabelmans,” “West Side Story”) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. Spielberg's last feature was Best Picture nominee “The Fabelmans.” “Disclosure Day” is set for theaters from Universal Pictures on June 12, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michelle and Barack Obama were supposed to see Rob Reiner and Michele Singer the day they were killed, the former First Lady revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live Monday night. Reiner was a longtime activist, supporter of progressive causes, and booster of the Democratic Party, and as Obama noted, she and her husband had known the Reiners for “many, many years.” She added, “We were supposed to be seeing them that night, last night. Let me just say this, unlike some people, Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know.” (That seemed to be a not-so-subtle nod to President Donald Trump, who mocked Reiner after hearing the news.) Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, was arrested later that night and eventually booked for murder. He remains in custody without bail, and a court hearing is expected to happen today. Along with all his peers, friends, and admirers in the entertainment world, Reiner was also mourned by many in politics, especially those on the left. Though best known for his comedy, Reiner's work often had a sharp political edge, especially his two career-defining films with Aaron Sorkin, A Few Good Men and The American President. Joe Ely, Progressive Texas Country Legend Who Toured With the Clash, Dead at 78 Jack White Calls Out ‘Egomaniac Loser' Donald Trump for Unhinged Reaction to Rob Reiner's Death In his own statement, Barack Obama said that all of Reiner's stories were imbued with “a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.” He added, “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. Other tributes were also shared by Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>

Independent film has been declared dead often enough to qualify as a horror subgenre. Box office is synonymous with struggle, streamers retreated from discovery, and the festival-to-distribution pipeline feels like a straw. Everyone knows the drill: fewer buyers, slower deals, shrinking risk tolerance, and a talent pool stuck waiting for a system that isn't correcting itself. At the same time, a growing cohort of filmmakers is opting out of the long march toward institutional validation. Related Stories ‘The Housemaid' Review: Amanda Seyfried Turns in Her Second Great Performance of 2025 in Thriller Too Timid to Go Full Camp ‘Disclosure Day' Teaser: Spielberg's UFO Thriller Reveals Title and Something Very Wrong with Emily Blunt It's nepotism as apprenticeship, and a case study in what happens when filmmakers stop waiting for permission and start building. In another era, a straight-to-streaming film made for $65K would have been dismissed. Today, it looks like part of a larger power shift — one in which distribution, marketing, and even greenlights are no longer handed down, but designed from the ground up. Evan Shapiro and Jamie Shapiro's candid, sometimes combative exchange is both blueprint and provocation for filmmakers still clinging to the old model. What follows is their unvarnished conversation about making Skit, navigating a creator-driven marketplace, and why the future of indie film may belong to those who greenlight themselves first. EVAN SHAPIRO: I am really worried about indie movies — basically panic stricken over their future. I've worked in independent film for over 20 years: I was general manager of IFC and then president of both IFC and Sundance TV. In 2006, I executive produced the Kirby Dick documentary “This Film Is Not Yet Rated,” which demonstrated the bias Hollywood and movie theater owners have against indie film, using the MPA as bag man. Last year, I collaborated with Keri Putnam on her study of independent and documentary film which showed that, despite streamers, commissioners, and theaters all but abandoning independent cinema, there is still a huge demand among Americans for indies and documentaries — one that goes underserved as the general economics of Hollywood slip into systemic failure. At that very moment, you, my daughter, pitched me on producing an indie movie called “Skit.” JAMIE SHAPIRO: I moved to LA a year and a half earlier in the hopes of living out my dream as an actress, only to be met with the industry-wide strikes. Ever dramatic, I was mourning the death of my nonexistent career. Post-strikes, Hollywood resembled one of those dinosaur dioramas right before the asteroids hit: actors scrambling for work, directors teaching workshops they don't believe in, writers pretending to “staff” on imaginary shows. You had been coaching me (aka screaming at me) to take control of my career now, or I'd be at risk of waiting tables at a hipster Silverlake restaurant for the rest of my life (or worse, living at home with you and Mom). And then you texted me budget spreadsheets, demanding we drive toward production far faster than any of us had originally planned. EVAN: Simultaneously, I had been writing and speaking about the rise of the creator economy — how it was becoming the gravitational center of global culture, andhow, if they so choose, producers and publishers could and should become creators themselves. We ran the entire production like a DIY startup: casting brilliant, up-and-coming actors and comedians who hadn't yet gotten the roles they deserve; utilizing a SAG micro-budget contract (which feels like the only part of Hollywood tethered to the current media reality); and embarking on a whirlwind eight-day shoot that took years off our lives. EVAN: As we finished the film, we started collaborating with BBC Studios on content about their fandom-first business model and creator mindset. I also fell down the rabbit hole of #filmtok. All of this helped me solidify a distribution strategy for Skit built entirely on the foundation of the creator economy. JAMIE: The wild part is how quickly that creator theme boomeranged back at us in real time. I met Anjali Sud (on whom I have an insane career crush) at a Fordham Business School event where you were interviewing her, and I all but ambushed her with: “Hi, I love your whole thing, please continue reinventing streaming so people like me don't starve.” Then at StreamTV in Denver I met Sam Harowitz, head of content acquisitions at Tubi, who spoke about the future of content like he was reading prophecy off a stone tablet. EVAN: So we built a fully fleshed-out meta marketing and community strategy. I took it to our friends at Filmhub over a sushi dinner. We partnered with the amazing PR team at FerenComm. Then we went to Tubi, where Sam introduced us to Rich Bloom — who Anjali had just brought on board to build out their creator platform — and where Filmhub already had a strong content partnership. It allowed Tubi to come on board without crafting a one-off deal for a single tiny indie film from smaller creators. Instead, we were able to use existing infrastructure to move quickly and make a deal for an exclusive premiere on the platform. Then go make your stuff, with a budget and timeline that lets you take advantage of the market — before the market changes again. Unfortunately, making films or TV series isn't only about the art. It's not just camera angles and narrative structure. Filmmakers need to be strategists, marketers, press agents, and dealmakers. I know that sounds daunting, but when artists think beyond the art and focus on the business part of show business, they can make things happen. JAMIE: That's been the most surprising part of this process. Just: yes, let's do it, and here's how. EVAN: But that's because we came in with everything already figured out. We made it easy for them to say yes. As Rich Bloom said on our podcast: Yes, it was a really good film; we had the right expectations; the project perfectly matched their strategy; we came to the table with an existing partner; and we arrived with a fully fleshed-out marketing plan. That's how we got a worldwide, day-and-date premiere for a $65,000 film shot in eight days, one year after we wrapped. But the reality is that by understanding our audience — and the needs of potential buyers — we found genuinely good partners who believe indie doesn't mean insignificant. EVAN: So what do you think this experiment has taught us? JAMIE: “Skit” taught me that the old-school indie philosophy of “just start making stuff” isn't quaint nostalgia. I've learned that a young artist who wants to work needs to greenlight themself — make the thing in a way they can actually afford. Then we're releasing it on YouTube — an idea I would have rejected out of hand before this experience. Young filmmakers still cling to traditional distribution — festivals, theaters, gatekeepers — because of a romantic Hollywood fantasy we were all raised on. Film schools still preach it, partly because the people teaching haven't made a movie since dial-up internet, and partly because it's easier to teach submission than subversion. I loved making “Skit” with you because it's timely and fresh — but also because it's a real case study for the next generation of indie filmmakers. Making “Skit” didn't just give me a film. Stop emailing the same manager for eight months. Then develop the plan to get it seen. “Skit” is now available to stream for free on Tubi, Amazon, Apple TV, Relay, Roku, and YouTube Movies & TV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's so good, in fact, that those second installments often feel complete without a third (and if someone else makes a third anyway, maybe even more so). This means that Avatar: Fire And Ash is actually the first threequel of his 40-year career. It's also his first follow-up to trail its predecessor within a normal sequel timeframe—and, for that matter, the quickest turnaround for any Cameron film since True Lies emerged almost exactly three years after Terminator 2. Maybe that's why Fire And Ash, despite some lingering momentousness in the relatively scarce Avatar series, carries the constant, looming threat that it will feel something like a normal sequel. Just another spectacular, near-ceaselessly entertaining fantasy epic that shames 90% of its big-ticket competition. It's an appropriately rarified problem for a repeated engineer of the “most expensive movie ever made.” As frustrating as it may have been to wait a decade-plus between Cameron's fiction films, the earlier Avatar sequel The Way Of Water took advantage of that gap, catching up with human-turned-Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his Na'vi wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) years after the end of the first film. All of a sudden, with the addition of four Sully children, the movie was about a family of six—plus Pandora's favorite son-in-law Spider (Jack Champion), a human who aspires to roll with the Na'vi full-time. Because Spider requires special oxygen masks to breathe the alien atmosphere, Jake and Neytiri insist that he return to the friendly human scientists maintaining a base on Pandora, over the protests of their kids Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Kiri (Sigourney Weaver, again playing a teenager through the magic of motion capture), and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss). The family decides to accompany Spider on his journey back, via airships that combine seafaring vessels and horsedrawn carriages with a veiny, organic-looking hot-air balloon technology. They're quickly attacked by another, more aggressive Na'vi tribe led by the literally fiery Varang (Oona Chaplin); the family is separated, pursued by both Varang and that pesky Quaritch (Stephen Lang), the ex-human colonel whose consciousness has been transferred to a Na'vi body, providing an ongoing dark mirror to Jake's metamorphosis. In classic '90s Batman-villain style, Varang and Quaritch decide they may be of use to each other. Varang holds no particular grudge against Jake and Neytiri, but she sure as hell isn't happy with their beloved goddess Eywa, and wants to get her hands on what other Na'vi will not permit: firearms. There's more plot than that, too, some of which more closely rehashes material from the first two films—Water in particular, to the point where it's easy to wonder whether some sequel material was dragged and dropped from the second movie into the third during their lengthy gestation period. The new movie parcels out action sequences at a more typical epic-blockbuster clip. Then again, it's hard to complain that Cameron serves up slam-bang set pieces at regular intervals. As Fire And Ash goes on, it feels increasingly unsure of just how much of a wrap-up this will be—or even what's on the table for story threads that can be wrapped up, versus what will be left as the kind of dangling (or are they frayed?) threads that, until the Avatar sequels, rarely had a place in Cameron's fantastical worlds. As a result, some of the most intriguing new wrinkles in this film, primarily involving Quaritch's unlikely and sometimes downright hallucinatory alliance with Varang, fail to develop into full-fledged subplots. Quaritch's Dark Sully act in particular feels like it could be excavated further, especially in a series that sometimes wants to have its colonialism and vanquish it, too. The Avatar movies are so lushly overgrown with visual detail, and draw such surprisingly nuanced and sensitive motion-capture performances from its human cast, that any momentary storytelling hiccup can feel like a glitch in the machine. Fire And Ash is terrific entertainment that occasionally gives the impression of well-appointed vamping; it's almost enough to wonder if all the meticulous writer's-room blueprinting of two-to-four Avatar sequels might have done as much harm as good.

For Jolie, the moment is about connection and community. “I wanted to join them, knowing that TIME France would be sharing information about breast health, prevention, and knowledge about breast cancer.” To jog your memory a little, Jolie decided to undergo a double mastectomy in 2013 after her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, died from cancer at age 56 in 2007. In a May 2013 New York Times op-ed titled “My Medical Choice,” Jolie revealed that tests indicated she carried the BRCA1 gene. This genetic mutation significantly raised her risk of developing breast cancer. CBS reported that two years later, in 2015, Jolie underwent further preventative surgery. She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to guard against ovarian cancer. “Every woman should always be able to determine her own healthcare journey and have the information she needs to make informed choices: genetic testing and screening should be accessible and affordable for women with clear risk factors or a significant family history,” Jolie said. She added that access to care must be equitable. “Access to screening and care should not depend on financial resources or where someone lives.” Sure wish I had someone like her around here, my mom had a double mastectomy and then she died from ovarian cancer the doctors told my sister and I that we would definitely have the ovarian cancer but my insurance won't cover genetic testing and I can't afford to pay for it now I get to worry if I'll be here for my kids while I try to raise money to get the genetic testing for my daughter.

According to law enforcement Reiner and Singer were found dead inside their Brentwood home on Saturday evening (Dec. 14), with reports indicating that both suffered traumatic injuries. Tributes Pour In Following Death of 'Spinal Tap' Director Rob Reiner Nick Reiner was located hours later in South Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California campus — approximately 15 miles from the crime scene — and taken into custody around 9:15 p.m., law enforcement officials confirmed. At a news conference on Monday (Dec. 15), Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell addressed the arrest and ongoing investigation. Nick Reiner, who co-wrote the 2015 film Being Charlie — a semi-autobiographical story about a young man's battle with addiction — has reportedly struggled with substance abuse and mental health issues for years. Sources told the Los Angeles Times that Reiner had cycled in and out of rehab facilities, experienced periods of homelessness, and had recently moved back into the family's Brentwood home. Reiner and Singer's family confirmed their deaths in a statement yesterday, writing, “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. Rob Reiner, 78, was a prolific actor, writer, and director best known for helming classic films including Stand By Me, When Harry Met Sally, A Few Good Men, and The Princess Bride. His wife, Michele Singer Reiner, was a photographer and activist in her own right. As of Tuesday morning (Dec. 16), Nick Reiner remains in custody at the LAPD Metropolitan Detention Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Nick had been living in their guesthouse, the same one he destroyed more than once, but it had been like a revolving door all his adult life,” an insider told the Daily Mail Monday. “He was a ticking time bomb,” the source said. The insider claimed Nick “would fight with his parents because they would give him the ultimatum, take medication and stop using, or move out.” The 32-year-old allegedly once threatened his sister, Romy Reiner, for confronting him, and “all hell broke loose.” “Nick would reportedly find the aftermath of his rages funny and “brag [about] how he could get away with anything.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “He laughed about destroying his parents' guesthouse more than once,” the insider continued. “Everything in the guest house got wrecked,” he said. Nick was arrested Sunday after his parents were found stabbed to death at their Los Angeles home. Insiders told The Post that Rob and Michele's daughter, Romy, found their bodies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest draft of the screenplay comes from David Callaham, who, before becoming a regular writer on various superhero properties, including penning versions of Ant-Man, Wonder Woman 1984, Shang-Chi, and Across The Spider-Verse, was best known for introducing us to Sylvester Stallone's Expendables. Deadline didn't offer any plot details for the film. Still, we have a feeling it'll revolve around the untold tragedy of Gaston's life, retroactively making this despicable scallywag's behavior justified, like Cruella, whose puppy-killing ways we now understand because a dog pushed her mother off a cliff. We also expect Disney to drop the character's gay undertones that caused a minor controversy in 2017. Disney would hate to force Snoop Dogg into another instance of “talking to his grandkids.” Evans was expected to reprise the role for a TV series, Deadline continues, but a singing, French push broom swept those plans away. Still, fans annoyed by the recasting will soon be able to make their own Luke Evans-Gaston slop using the magic of AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick wore a black jacket with white strips and jeans. Nick was reportedly arrested by a metro station 15 miles away from Rob and Michele's home, with sources telling ABC News he was near University of Southern California. Page Six confirmed that Nick had been arrested on charges of murder after Rob and Michele were found stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Sunday afternoon. He was originally booked in Downtown Los Angeles' Parker Center Jail before being transferred to Twin Towers Correctional Facility. Nick is currently being held without bail and reportedly on suicide watch. Before the murders, Nick and his parents had attended Conan O'Brien's Christmas party on Saturday night. Several sources told People that he was behaving erratically and “freaking everyone out, acting crazy.” Additional insiders told TMZ that Nick stuck out at the party, wearing a hoodie while everyone was dressed up in formal attire. Nick has been in and out of rehab due to his drug addiction, and once admitted to destroying his parents' guest house after going on a drug-fueled rage.
