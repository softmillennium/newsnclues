A US military attack “would bring more chaos, more poverty,” one Caracas resident said.

President Donald Trump has escalated threats against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks, and reports now say the Trump administration is preparing for the days after a potential Maduro overthrow.

What might happen in such a scenario? In November, Michael Crowley at The New York Times pursued this question by reminding readers that, during Trump's first term, U.S. officials were asked to run a war game to examine what Venezuela in a post-Maduro era would look like. According to Douglas Farah, a national security consultant who specializes in Latin America, the war game showed that the overthrow of Maduro would yield “chaos for a sustained period of time with no possibility of ending it.” Crowley, at his end, adds that the results of the exercise note that “chaos and violence were likely to erupt within Venezuela, as military units, rival political factions and even jungle-based guerrilla groups jockeyed for control of the oil-rich country.”

Currently, no such chaos has erupted in Venezuela despite at least 95 people having been killed by the United States military in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific as of December 16. Although the White House has repeatedly alleged that those targeted have been involved in smuggling narcotics into the U.S. mainland, the Trump administration has yet to produce any evidence to support its claims.

At least 95 people have been killed by the United States military in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.

At the end of November, Trump took to social media, stating: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.” And on December 10, Trump told journalists that the U.S. had recently “seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually.” The Venezuelan government condemned the seizure as “blatant theft and an act of international piracy.”

With the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier group in the Caribbean Sea in November, and media reports indicating that there are now 15,000 U.S. troops in the region and approximately 5,000 personnel at bases in Puerto Rico, there are two likely outcomes: Trump is either bluffing to see if the Venezuelan military will carry out a coup against Maduro, or worse, is actually planning for the U.S. to attack Venezuela militarily. Meanwhile, a recent poll conducted by CBS News concluded that 70 percent of people in the United States are opposed to the Trump administration taking military action against Venezuela.

Inside Venezuela, the people Truthout spoke to for this article said that, while they are certainly following the crisis, most people are continuing with their daily lives. According to Fanny Chacón Sánchez, a 39-year-old mother of two who works for a government bank, “the way [the] international media portray things on social networks looks like a completely different reality.” Chacón notes that although the U.S. Navy's actions are on people's minds, this is “just another chapter of the illegal blockade we already know” that “suffocate[s] us” — a reference to the U.S. economic sanctions on Venezuela which commenced in 2005.

Living in a state-built apartment, which she is paying off at affordable rates though the government's massive housing program known as Gran Misión Vivienda Venezuela (Great Mission Housing Venezuela), Chacón used to live in New Horizon, which is part of Catia, one of Venezuela's largest, poorest and most densely populated areas. A supporter of the Maduro government, Chacón says on the streets of Caracas:

People are focused on their own stuff: working, making ends meet, and now, even more so, getting Christmas ready for the kids. Making sure there are Christmas bonuses and the Nativity scene. Life continues on its “normal” course, as much as this harsh reality allows. It's not that we ignore everything else; it's that we've been resisting for years and we're not going to stop now.

Anais Márques, a communal leader at the 5 de Marzo Commune in Caracas, a grassroots community organization in El Valle neighbourhood that comprises around 2,270 working class families, shared a similar perspective with Truthout. With life continuing largely as normal, Márques notes the recent November election in which more than 5,300 community circuits (communes) voted to pick which community proposed projects will obtain state funding. According to Márques, the election saw “civic participation” as “several communal councils renewed their spokespersons through secret ballots.”

In Márques's opinion, “both Chávez and now Maduro have always had the support and backing of an organized, mobilized people,” which “is why they still haven't defeated us.” Believing that Maduro will resolve the crisis, Márques highlights the civic-military union that exists between the government and the armed forces, stating: “We have a people and we have soldiers, and the soldiers have the people.”

Although mainstream reporting in favor of overthrowing Maduro often (and rather conveniently) ignores this fact, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's political movement was originally born in the barracks when he was a soldier in the 1980s. Chávez's came to power through an election in 1999, then suffered a short-lived U.S.-backed coup d'etat in 2002 headed by the upper echelons of the armed forces. Subsequently Chávez proceeded to purge the army and cement his doctrine of Latin American-style socialism. From 2007, Venezuela's armed forces adopted the slogan: “Patria, socialismo o muerte! Venceremos!” (“Fatherland, socialism or death! We will prevail!”)

With a different perspective from those of Chacón and Márques, Antonio Gonzalez Plessmann, a human rights activist in Caracas and militant leftist since the 1980s, no longer supports Maduro. Plessmann thinks Venezuelans' main anxiety remains “economic precariousness” and says household incomes for an average family of four cannot cover the cost of food and basic necessities. As a result, Plessmann told Truthout, many people have “several jobs to make ends meet,” a situation that is not uncommon throughout many Latin American countries. 

“Madurismo is a mutation of Chavismo, which separates from the strategic postulates of the Bolivarian Revolution: popular participation, democratic radicalism, and anti-capitalist orientation,” Plessmann says. Former President Chávez, in his view, “was hated by Fedecámaras [the main business association] and loved by the poor” while Maduro is “loved by Fedecámaras” and “despised by the majority of the popular sectors, many of whom were once Chavistas.” While Washington has attempted “regime change” on several occasions against Venezuela's head of state, Plessmann says, Maduro now finds himself “at one of his weakest moments: He lacks popular support and real backing from much of Latin America.”

According to one survey in September, 65 percent of Venezuelans rated Maduro's management of the country positively, 28 percent said they had a negative opinion, while 7 percent answered with either don't know or no answer.

“Democracy Now! co-host Juan González asserted in a recent interview with Jyotishman Mudiar, host of the “India & Global Left” podcast, that if the United States attacks Venezuela militarily, the conflict will broaden throughout Latin America. Observing that Maduro has already “put out a call for international volunteers to come to Venezuela to support the Bolivarian Revolution,” González argued that Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Colombians “will be a part of that resistance.” Elaborating on his comments on Colombia, González stated that, up until recently, the country had the “single largest and most extensive revolutionary movement in the history of Latin America,” as was the case with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia that demobilized in 2016 after reaching a peace agreement with the government.

Colombia's second-largest guerrilla movement, the Army of National Liberation (ELN) has yet to reach an agreement with the administration of Gustavo Petro, who presides over a broad-left coalition. According to a report from the International Crisis Group, whose analysis is often in line with U.S. political establishment, the ELN “has repeatedly stated its commitment to defend the Maduro government, and has promised to turn its fire on any foreign forces that intervene in the region; its expertise includes use of improvised explosives and, more recently, armed drones.”

While there is no hard evidence of complicity between the Maduro administration at the highest levels and the ELN, the current government in Caracas and the guerrillas are, broadly speaking, both influenced by liberation theology, the Cuban Revolution, and the 18th-century independence fighter Simón Bolívar's calls for regional unification among Latin American countries. According to the Washington Office on Latin America, the ELN in April this year numbered over 6,000 active guerrillas, while a local report in Colombia claims about 20 percent of the rebels operate in the region of Catatumbo, on the northern border with Venezuela.

González also noted that China has become an important factor in Washington's calculations and aggression toward Venezuela, given that it has become the main purchaser of the country's oil. “At one point, something like 70 percent of Venezuela's oil was going to China,” says González, with that figure now down to “about 45 percent” However, it still remains the largest buyer of the South American country's oil. As with the case of Panama, where the government ended the Central American country's participation in China's Belt and Road Initiative after Trump issued a series of threats ranging from increasing trade tariffs to an outright military invasion to take back the Panama Canal, Trump's advisers cannot be looking at Beijing's growing economic presence in Latin America kindly. 

Miguel Tinker Salas, a professor of Latin American history at Pomona College in Claremont, California, told Truthout that the massive military deployment off the coast of Venezuela, the exuberant negative press campaign against the Maduro administration, and the crushing economic sanctions all look to “expose fissures within the Venezuelan military and the political apparatus of the governing party.” He adds that despite this pressure, “the concerted campaign fissures have not materialized” as the majority of “Venezuelans are firmly opposed to a U.S. intervention.” From Tinker's perspective, the majority of Venezuelans reject violence as a tactic to obtain political change.

At Washington's end, Tinker says Trump's new approach “involves efforts to isolate China, which has gained an important foothold in the past 20 years” while “investing close to a billion dollars to produce oil in Lake Maracaibo,” — a region located in the northwest of Venezuela in the state of Zulia, which accounts for most of the country's oil production. Tinker told Truthout he thinks U.S. military forces are aiming for an extended stay in the Caribbean as part of a “Western Hemisphere Strategy.”

Any administration imposed through force will face a “crisis of legitimacy, especially if they begin to implement neoliberal economic policies as they have proposed.”

The problem, he says, is that “U.S.-led efforts at regime change have been disastrous” and any administration imposed through force will face a “crisis of legitimacy, especially if they begin to implement neoliberal economic policies as they have proposed.” He adds that while “important segments of the population may be critical of Maduro,” these Venezuelans “will not stand idly by and allow their rights to be subverted.”

Steve Ellner is a retired professor of economic history and political science from the Universidad de Oriente in Venezuela, where he lived for over 40 years. As things currently stand in the crisis, “the most likely scenario is an extended siege,” because “the other options at this point are too risky for Washington,” Ellner told Truthout. Elaborating on this point, he added:

Venezuela has advanced weapons systems from Russia and training which Washington claims comes from the Wagner mercenaries. It doesn't matter who does the training; from Caracas's viewpoint the training is absolutely justifiable, given the intensity and prolonged nature of the threat. From a political viewpoint it's unlikely that Trump would just pull out, since he would face intense criticism and a loss of MAGA support given everything that has been done up until now.

Back in Caracas, according to Ellner, “many non-Chavistas and anti-Chavistas are enrolling in the militia.” Asked about an article published in The New York Times in October that claimed that secret negotiations around Venezuela's resources were taking place in order to avoid a military conflict, Ellner said the chance they succeed should not be dismissed entirely. “Maduro,” claimed Ellner, “is willing to make concessions … which would allow Trump to spin a narrative that the U.S. got what it wants.” Such concessions might include handing over individuals accused of being involved in the drug trade as well as “concessions regarding Venezuela's oil reserves.”

Márques, like all the Venezuelans Truthout spoke to, is hopeful the crisis will be resolved. “It has taken so much effort to achieve our independence, and we cannot believe that a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela would bring stability,” she said. “Without a doubt,” she added, a U.S. military attack “would bring more chaos, more poverty — especially for the working class.”

Officials said they were considering such a move last week, but the plan was widely condemned by health experts.

Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top official Marty Makary announced that the agency has opted not to put “black box” warnings on coronavirus vaccines, despite reports that FDA officials were considering such a move last week.

Black box warnings are considered the most serious designation from the FDA. Such warnings are placed on opioid medication, for example, to warn users about the risks of overusing the drug, including addiction, overdose, and death.

The news that the FDA was considering black box labels for COVID vaccines was widely condemned by medical experts as yet another attempt by the Trump administration to undermine public trust in the vaccine, which studies have consistently shown is safe and effective.

Following last week's report, FDA commissioner Marty Makary told Bloomberg News on Monday that the heads of the agency had determined that there isn't a need for the black box warnings after all. 

Among the agency leaders who decided that the designation isn't necessary is noted anti-vaxxer Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA.

However, the news comes as Prasad has pursued other avenues to sow distrust in the vaccine. A recently leaked FDA memo, authored by Prasad, announced that the agency would investigate whether there is a link between COVID vaccinations and deaths in the U.S. The memo sparked concerns from medical experts, who noted that many of Prasad's claims are not backed by evidence.

Prasad claimed, for instance, that COVID itself “was never highly lethal for children” and that its effects “are comparable” to other respiratory viruses — despite one study indicating that the virus was more lethal to children than the flu.

The memo also claimed that the agency has found “at least 10 children [who] have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination.” But an investigation from Inside Medicine discovered that Prasad's statement was made before a preliminary examination of deaths — and that the actual number of deaths from adverse reactions to the vaccine could be as high as seven or as low as zero.

Notably, a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report has demonstrated, like many others before it, that vaccines are both safe and beneficial for children. That report examined hundreds of children who had received dosages of COVID vaccines and compared outcomes with children who hadn't received them. Researchers found that “vaccine effectiveness…was an estimated 76 percent against COVID-19-associated emergency department or urgent care visits” among kids 9 months to 4 years old. The vaccines also had 56 percent effectiveness against such visits for kids 5-17 years old, versus those who did not receive a vaccine. 

The memo is just one of many anti-vaccination moves by agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the leadership of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The memo also comes as the U.S. is dealing with a resurgence of measles — which were deemed virtually eradicated in the U.S. just two decades ago — in large part due to Kennedy's disinformation campaign about vaccines.

Hundreds are currently quarantined in communities in northern parts of South Carolina, and an outbreak along the Utah-Arizona border has also led to quarantines in that area. In both places, low mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates have likely led to the outbreaks.

Spartanburg County, South Carolina, for example, has an MMR vaccine rate around 90 percent — 5 points below the 95 percent vaccine rate that health experts say is needed to protect against community-level outbreaks. Mohave County, Arizona, has a 79.4 percent rate of MMR vaccination, while Washington County, Utah, has a rate of 82.7 percent. 

As of December 9, there have been 1,912 measles cases confirmed across the U.S., a 570 percent increase from the total number of cases counted in 2024.

Staff at the Ashland animal shelter sold merch of raccoon they cared for after he was found passed out in a liquor store

Merchandise commemorating the raccoon that gained international fame by barging into a Virginia liquor store, smashing bottled spirits and passing out drunk in a bathroom on Black Friday has raised more than a quarter-million dollars for the local animal shelter where he slept off his bender.

The Hanover county animal protection shelter raised the charitable amount after caring for the inebriated raccoon in question and teaming up with custom apparel maker Bonfire to create and sell items seizing on the internet virality achieved by the creature.

Emblazoned with the words “Trashed Panda”, the shirts, sweatshirts, cups and stickers contain an image of a raccoon spread-eagle next to a spilled booze bottle – unmistakably evoking the compromising position the animal that burgled the Ashland ABC store on 29 November was found and photographed in.

Proceeds from the campaign anchored by those limited edition items “directly support shelter animal care and enrichment”, according to Bonfire's website.

Figures posted by the company based in Richmond, Virginia, indicated the campaign had raised more than $254,000 as of Tuesday morning. At the time, the campaign was also within 250 sales of its goal of selling 19,000 items.

“While this raccoon gave us all a much-needed laugh, our officers handle hundreds of calls each year involving wildlife, stray animals, and emergencies requiring specialized training and equipment,” said a message from the shelter on Bonfire's website. “Your support helps us continue providing compassionate, professional service to both animals and residents of Hanover county.”

An ABC store employee found what Bonfire's website referred to as “our unexpected raccoon celebrity” next to a toilet the day after Thanksgiving. Shattered whiskey bottles littered the path to the bathroom, and the raccoon was evidently inebriated when it was photographed for posterity's sake.

The animal was uninjured beyond possibly grappling with hangover symptoms and regret over “poor life choices”, said officials at the shelter where the raccoon was brought to proverbially dry out.

Hanover county animal protection officer Samantha Martin more recently told the local government's official podcast that the raccoon had at least two other break-ins on his rap sheet.

Martin told Hear in Hanover that the raccoon had previously broken into a karate studio and a department of motor vehicles office, all on the same block of businesses. She made it a point to say that the raccoon had eaten some of the DMV's snacks, calling him “a smart little critter”.

After the raccoon sobered up from the drunken liquor store break-in, officials released him in the vicinity of that business, the karate studio and the DMV office. Martin said on the podcast that to relocate the raccoon from his familiar environs would be “a death sentence”.

“I think he's living his best life,” Martin joked on the podcast. “And why not? Have a drink or two, especially on Black Friday.”

News of the raccoon's liquor store banditry spread worldwide after a study recently concluded that his brethren had adapted to living in urban areas so well that they had been developing certain physical signs of domestication, including shorter snouts and smaller teeth.

Experts say raccoons have been able to successfully live alongside people because of their ability to survive on human refuse.

News of Ahmed al-Ahmed's selfless act quickly reached al-Nayrab, where locals say it proves religion or birthplace no barrier to heroism

A man who risked his life to wrestle a gun from a shooter in the Bondi beach terror attack on Sunday has become a hero in his home town in Syria.

Video of Ahmed al-Ahmed's selfless act quickly reached his birthplace of al-Nayrab, a small town in the countryside of Idlib, north-west Syria. Ahmed, a 44-year-old father of two children, left the village to emigrate to Australia in 2007. He initially worked in construction, but soon opened a fruit and vegetable shop in Sydney.

“His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” said farmer Mohammed, a 60-year-old uncle of Ahmed. Mohammed said he discovered his nephew's bravery through social media, coming across the video on his feed.

On Sunday, two gunmen, alleged to be 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, attacked a Hanukah celebration on the Sydney beach, killing 15 people. One of the alleged gunmen also died.

Ahmed was having lunch in the area when the shooting started, his brother Huthaifa told the Australian broadcaster ABC. Upon hearing the shots, Ahmed crept closer using cars for cover, before launching himself at one of two gunmen. Ahmed disarmed the attacker, pulling the rifle out of his hands and pointing it at the gunman, before laying the weapon against a tree. 
 Ahmed was shot in the shoulder at least twice during his attempt to wrest the gun out of the shooter's grip.

The act of heroism has made him famous in Australia and in Syria, where Syrians have been widely sharing the video of him disarming the gunman with pride.

In Nayrab, Ahmed is the talk of the town. The small village was under the control of Syrian rebels during the country's civil war and much of it is destroyed. Ahmed's own home is ruined, with the roof still patchy from bombs and no windows or doors surviving.

“This incident caused a global sensation. He is from Syria and he is a Muslim, and he had no motivation for doing this other than heroism and bravery,” Mohammed said.

Another relative recalled Ahmed as a heroic man and praised him for saving “innocent lives.”

“We are proud of what Ahmed, the son of our village did … his act was heroic and no one else could have done it,” Abdul Rahman al-Mohammed, a 30-year-old resident of Nayrab, told AFP.

In a video recorded while he was being wheeled in a bed through hospital corridors, Ahmed greets his Syrian relatives in Arabic. 
  “What can I say? I have passed through a very difficult phase, but thank God for everything,” Ahmed says while wishing specific family members well.

Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visited Ahmed in the hospital, shaking his hand and telling him that his “bravery is an inspiration for all Australians”. An online fundraiser to pay for his medical bills has received more than £1.2m in donations, with the GoFundMe being shared around the world.

The attack on Bondi beach, allegedly carried out by a father and son who reportedly underwent military training in an Islamist militant hotbed in the southern Philippines, seemed to be “motivated by Islamic State ideology,”, said Albanese.

The PM went on to say that Ahmed's heroism proved that coexistence, not extremism, was the essence of Australian society.

“At the best of times, what we see is Australians coming together. And what I want is for Australians to come together, for this to be reinforcing the need for us to promote national unity, and that is critical. There is no place in Australia for anti-semitism. There is no place for hatred,” Albanese said.

District attorney's office has until Wednesday to file charges against Nick Reiner following deaths of his parents

Los Angeles investigators are expected on Tuesday to lay out their case against Nick Reiner, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering his parents, the actor-director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.

Detectives from the Los Angeles police department's (LAPD) homicide division took Nick, 32, into custody on Sunday night, hours after his parents were found dead in their Brentwood home, the department announced on Monday.

The police said that on 14 December, around 3.40pm local time, LAPD officers responded to a call of a death investigation in the 200 block of South Chadbourne Avenue.

They said that once inside the residence, officers discovered two victims, who were later identified as Rob and Michele.

Authorities said that as a result of the initial investigation, it was determined that the Reiners were the victims of homicide and they said that the investigation “further revealed” that their son, Nick, “was responsible for their deaths”. Authorities did not provide any additional details.

Nick was located and arrested at around 9.15pm local time, police said, and was booked for murder. He was being held without bail.

The police said the case would be presented to the Los Angeles county attorney's Office on Tuesday for filing consideration.

Alan Jackson, Nick Reiner's defense attorney, told reporters that his client had not received medical clearance to appear in court and would not do so before Wednesday.

It will be up to the DA's office to charge Reiner with specific counts, per CNN.

The Los Angeles district attorney's office has until Wednesday to formally file the charges.

On Monday, the Los Angeles police chief, Jim McDonnell, confirmed that Nick had been “booked for murder” in connection with his parents' killings and called the deaths “very tragic”.

Nick Reiner had previously struggled with addiction and mental health, and co-wrote a screenplay based on his experiences that was made into a 2015 film directed by his father. A family friend told the Los Angeles Times that Nick was living at the family property in Brentwood and that Michele Reiner was recently worried about his mental health.

The evening before the killings, Rob and Nick Reiner were heard arguing at a Christmas party at comedian Conan O'Brien's home, media outlets reported.

The United States is stalling the implementation of a US$40-billion technology agreement with Britain, officials said, following concerns in Washington over London's approach to digital regulation and food standards.

The “Tech Prosperity Deal,” covering artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy, was agreed during President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain in September, in a celebration of the countries' close ties and ability to work together on trade and technology.

Britain became the first country to agree in principle to lower some U.S. tariffs in May, but implementation has been slow. Talks on sectors such as steel stalled, though the two sides agreed a framework pharmaceutical deal earlier this month.

British officials confirmed on Tuesday that the U.S. has paused implementation of the tech deal. The New York Times, which first reported the move, said U.S. officials were frustrated by Britain's online safety rules, digital services tax, and food safety restrictions.

U.S. and Britain to announce tech, nuclear energy deals during Trump visit

British ministers say the May tariff deal allowed higher U.S. beef exports without compromising U.K. standards and insist digital regulations and tax will not be negotiated away.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment in detail on what he said were “live negotiations,” adding that the relationship with Washington was still strong.

“Negotiations of this kind are never straightforward. Both parties obviously want what's best for their countries, but ... we remain in active conversations,” he told reporters, adding it was “natural and normal” for countries to prioritize their own interests.

“These talks are not simple. They are complex, and they take time to secure.”

Under the Tech Prosperity Deal, Britain and the United States agreed to work together on quantum computers and artificial intelligence, while the likes of Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and OpenAI pledged to invest tens of billions of dollars in Britain.

The White House did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

The U.S. is Britain's largest trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their U.K. operations.

British Trade Secretary Peter Kyle visited the United States last week for talks with trade officials and tech firms, and “raised the importance of keeping up momentum on implementing all aspects of the U.K.-U.S. deal,” his office said.

“Both sides agreed to continue further negotiations in January.”

Aging doesn't happen in a straight line. One moment, you feel strong and energetic; the next, fatigue, stress, or hormonal shifts seem to age you overnight. But what if aging follows predictable milestones—and you could adjust your habits at each stage to stay younger, sharper, and more resilient?

Dr. Tsung-Han Chou, an attending physician at Taiwan's Mingtang Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, said that wellness is never one-size-fits-all. In an episode of “Health 1+1” on NTD, a sister outlet of The Epoch Times, he explained that each decade of life brings unique biological and emotional challenges—and requires its own strategy for preserving vitality.

Chou identifies two major turning points in the aging process: “The first comes after having children, and the second is menopause.”

For both men and women, the years following parenthood demand extra support to maintain energy and hormonal balance. Later, menopause—driven by dramatic hormonal shifts—ushers in the next major stage of aging.

In traditional Chinese medicine, the spleen and stomach represent the body's digestive and metabolic strength—the ability to convert food into energy. A strong digestive system buffers against stress, supports immunity, and helps maintain stable energy throughout demanding work years.

Investors wade through busy economic week

- Reuters

Canada's main stock index dipped for the third successive session on Tuesday, as heavyweight energy stocks followed oil prices lower.

At 11:19 a.m. ET, the S&P/TSX Composite index was down 144.46 points, or 0.46 per cent, at 31,338.98, and was set for its lowest close in a week.

Canada's energy sector tumbled 3 per cent as oil prices sank below US$60 after prospects of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen.

Meanwhile, shares of cannabis firms Canopy Growth (WEED-T), Trulieve Cannabis (TRUL-CN) and Curaleaf Holdings (CURA-T) rose between 4.8 per cent and 9.3 per cent, extending their recent gains, after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he is considering an executive order to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.

U.S. stocks were lower on Tuesday after data showed jobs growth rebounded in November, but the unemployment rate stood at 4.6 per cent.

Canada's retail sales data for October is due later this week. The Bank of Canada held its key policy rate steady last week as widely expected, and Governor Tiff Macklem said the economy was proving resilient overall to the effect of U.S. trade measures.

Macklem is set to speak later in the day.

“It's just going to be a data-driven market for a little while,” said Ian Chong, portfolio manager at First Avenue Investment Counsel Inc.

After a strong year, doubts about valuation could prompt investors book profits, he said.

Wells Fargo global investment strategist Douglas Beath explains why it's completely reasonable to be worried about market concentration in AI-related stocks,

“1 .The world's largest company and Al bellwether has a market capitalization higher than the Energy, Materials, and Real Estate sectors combined (in addition to the Utilities sector as of this writing). The Magnificent 7 (Mag 7; a group of 7 stocks (Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia) weighting reached an all-time high of 36 per cent of the S&P 500 Index in November. As of November 30, the S&P 500 Information Technology sector accounts for 34 per cent of the S&P 500 Index market-cap weight — slightly higher than its share at the peak of the dot.com bubble in 2000. 

“2. Earnings concentration: The two dominant sectors related to the Al theme (Information Technology and Communication Services) have accounted for 27.4 per cent and 10.6 per cent of S&P 500 earnings to date this year through November 30. According to Ned Davis Research, they are projected to account for 21.3 per cent and 9.5 per cent in 2026, respectively. 

“3. Performance. Since ChatGPT was released on November 30,2022, the three-year total return through November 30,2025 for Al-related stocks has dominated that of the benchmark S&P 500 Index 

Mr. Beath is predicting a widening of market leadership. He notes that the S&P 500 equal weight index is closing in on an all-time high and the number of stocks above their 50 day moving average is steadily increasing. Only two of the Magnificent seven stocks outperformed the index year-to-date to Nov. 30.

Pfizer's (PFE-N) profits will fall short of Wall Street estimates next year, as it faces weaker sales of COVID products and squeezed margins stemming from its deal with the U.S. government to lower prescription drug costs.

The stock fell nearly 5 per cent in Tuesday trading. Pfizer shares have dropped more than 50 per cent since early 2023 as demand for COVID vaccines and treatments waned, leaving the company trailing peers in performance.

The drugmaker does not expect to return to growth until 2029, facing looming generic competition on several older medicines set to lose patent protection in coming years.

Its pipeline has not produced a game-changing drug since it helped to develop COVID vaccine Comirnaty and produced COVID treatment Paxlovid. The company is working to save more than US$7-billion annually through 2027 as it tries to control costs.

The drugmaker expects 2026 adjusted profit per share to be between US$2.80 and US$3, below analysts' average estimate of US$3.05 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Wall Street's main indexes were little changed in volatile trading on Tuesday as healthcare and energy stocks led losses, while investors assessed a jobs report that signaled a cooling labor market and kept hopes for future interest rate cuts alive.

A Labor Department report showed U.S. job growth rebounded in November after nonfarm payrolls declined in October because of government spending cuts.

But the unemployment rate was at 4.6 per cent in November as the labor market weakened against the backdrop of economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy.

The data offered clarity on the state of the labor market after a recent historic government shutdown deprived both investors and the Federal Reserve of official figures. Policymakers broadly acknowledged signs of a weakening jobs market when the central bank lowered rates last week.

“When the unemployment rate moves up like this, it does fuel the potential for continued rate cuts. But as we've seen in the past, this is not a consistent trend,” said Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital Management.

Investors raised expectations for rate cuts next year, according to data compiled by LSEG, and are now pricing in at least 58 basis points of reductions, higher than the 25 bps signaled by the central bank last week.

A separate survey showed U.S. business activity growth hit a six-month low in December.

Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, also one of Trump's top contenders for the Fed chair post, said the central bank's independence was important, amid concerns he might be too close to the president.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.66 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 48,406.44. The S&P 500 lost 1.97 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 6,814.54, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 33.47 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 23,090.89.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hovered near their three-week lows as persistent uncertainty over rate cuts and concerns about lofty tech valuations continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

North America's main indexes slipped at the open on Tuesday after data broadly signaled a cooling U.S. economy, paving the way for more monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.4 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 48,380.17 at the open. The S&P 500 fell 16.4 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 6,800.12​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 75.6 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 22,981.819.

At 9:31 a.m. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.3 per cent at 31,399.073 points.

The U.S. unemployment rate was at 4.6 per cent in November as the labor market weakened against the backdrop of economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy.

On the inflation front, average earnings rose by a less-than-expected 0.1 per cent on a monthly basis, while a separate delayed report showed retail sales in October were unchanged.

- Reuters

U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in October, though consumer spending appears to have remained on a solid footing at the start of the fourth quarter despite the rising cost of living that is forcing some households to scale back.

The unchanged reading in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department's Census Bureau on Tuesday followed a downwardly revised 0.1-per-cent gain in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, edging up 0.1 per cent after a previously reported 0.2-per-cent rise in September.

The report, originally due in mid-November, was delayed by the 43-day shutdown of the government. Americans are facing higher prices for food, furniture and a range of other imported goods, the result of President Donald Trump's sweeping import duties. Healthcare and housing costs have also surged.

Economists say lower- and middle-income households have been disproportionately impacted by the soaring cost of living. Trump, who last year swept to election victory on promises to tame inflation, has in recent weeks alternated between dismissing affordability problems as a hoax, blaming former President Joe Biden, and promising his economic policies will benefit Americans next year.

U.S. stock index futures turned positive on Tuesday, as investors assessed a long-delayed jobs report and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

A Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased 64,000 in November, compared with an estimated 50,000 rise, according to economists polled by Reuters.

The unemployment rate stood at 4.6 per cent, compared with estimates of 4.4 per cent. Year-on-year average earnings came in at 3.5 per cent versus estimates of 3.6 per cent.

A separate reading from the Commerce Department also showed retail sales for October were flat, compared with an estimate of a 0.1 per cent increase.

At 8:31 a.m., Dow E-minis were up 70 points, or 0.14 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were up 8.5 points, or 0.12 per cent and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 32.25 points, or 0.13 per cent.

 U.S. job growth rebounded in November after nonfarm payrolls declined in October because of government spending cuts, but the unemployment rate was at 4.6 per cent as the labour market weakens against the backdrop of economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy.

The delayed employment report for November and a partial update for October published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday did not include the unemployment rate and other metrics for October after the 43-day shutdown of the government prevented the collection of data from households.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 64,000 jobs last month, the BLS said. The economy shed 105,000 jobs in October, reflecting the departure of more than 150,000 federal employees who took deferred buyouts as part of the Trump administration's push to shrink the government's footprint. Most of them dropped off government payrolls at the end of September.

Payrolls were not impacted by the furloughing of workers during the longest shutdown in history as they were retroactively paid when the government reopened.

The unemployment rate was at 4.4 per cent in September. The BLS made changes to weights for labor force estimates because no data was collected in October.

BMO chief economist Doug Porter highlighted climbing food costs,

“For the past two years, much of the affordability discussion in Canada has centred around the cost of housing. The good news on that front is that home prices continue to drift down nationally, market rents are easing, and of course interest rates have come down heavily since spring 2024. Housing affordability is not yet back to ‘normal', but it's moving into the same hemisphere. Accordingly, the shelter component of the CPI is calming quickly—it's almost all the way down to 2 per cent year-over-year, and looks to moderate further. Alas, the main villain of the inflation episode of 2021-23 has come roaring back onto the scene—food costs. Grocery inflation has been slowly building over the past year, after holding almost steady in 2024. But November saw a large monthly rise across many categories, and groceries are now up a meaty 4.7 per cent year-over-year. That's a big deal for monetary policy, as food prices are a key driver of inflation expectations”

BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett compiled the results of his monthly survey of global fund managers with his usual punchy writing style,

“Most bullish FMS [fund manager survey] of past 3½ years, macro optimism highest since Aug'21 on ‘run-it-hot' belief, allocation to stocks+commodities highest since Feb'22, cash level at record-low 3.3 per cent (down from 3.7 per cent); Dec FMS pushes BofA Bull & Bear Indicator up to 7.9, v close to ‘sell signal'; bullish positioning remains biggest headwind for risk assets. 

“On Macro & Policy: profit expectations (net 29 per cent) highest since Aug'21 as 57 per cent predict macro soft landing, 37 per cent say no landing and record-low 3 per cent say hard landing; liquidity conditions rated 3rd best of past 17 years as most investors since Apr'22 predict higher bond yields, 69 per cent of investors expect Kevin Hassett to be the next Fed Chairman.

“On Crowds & Risks: AI bubble (37 per cent) = biggest tail risk; most likely source of credit event = private credit (40 per cent) & hyperscaler capex (29 per cent); long Magnificent 7 (54 per cent) & long gold (29 per cent) = most crowded trades.

Citi strategist Adam Pickett compiled what he believes will be the 12 most important market themes in 2026,

“#1 AI Everywhere, All the time — We see the AI bubble likely building further in 2026. The big sector rotation happens after the bubble peaks, not before. While diversification is likely still helpful next year, tech should be part of the longs … 

#2 Sector rotation around reflation — It will not be only about AI in 2026. We think cyclicals can do well in a reflating economy, as shown by our regime work … 

#3 Election cycles into the midterms — Midterm election years are typically subpar for both bonds and equities. Downside in equity markets typically occurs in Q3 and is more likely when the incumbent party keeps control. 

#4 Global cyclical strength — We see long copper as a clean expression of global cyclical strength, and is an all-weather trade, somewhat independent of US growth developments.

#5: Fading central bank pricing — The average length between the last cut and first hike may be shorter than recent history suggests …

#7 ‘Tis the season for more spending —We think the European continent offers some opportunities on fiscal, monetary and political divergence, particularly in UK and France … 

#8 Trading a new Fed Chair — We see the new Fed Chair as a cap on hikes, rather than a turbo-dove base case, and are skeptical of Fed independence fears. We see the run-it-hot stance as an H2 risk to term premia and inflation expectations (both higher).

#9 FX – divergence and USD correlations — We see a year of three thirds for the USD: weaker Q1, stronger summer, weaker again Q4. USD correlations fall as we move into the ‘recovery' regime, so we sell USD correlations in dual digitals to leverage up our pro-cyclical view.

National Bank Financial analyst Richard Tse sees “more risks” for Canada's technology sector heading into 2026 than a year ago, believing “uncertainty around AI's potential disruption ... won't abate until there's short-term proof one way or the other around the pace of potential disruptions.

“We think the opportunities at the time of writing will continue to be narrow and likely come from firm market leaders and inflection candidates — the latter being names with inflecting revenue growth and operating leverage, or earlier-cycle sensitivity to IT spending recoveries," he added.

Global fund managers are the most bullish in three and a half years this month, Bank of America's survey showed on Tuesday, as optimism over a “run-it-hot” macro backdrop and policy expectations drove allocations to risk assets.

Cash holdings tumbled to a record low of 3.3 per cent from 3.7 per cent in November, as exposure to equities and commodities hit the highest since February 2022, the bank said.

The survey's “Bull & Bear” indicator climbed to 7.9, close to a “sell signal”, suggesting that bullish investor positioning remains the biggest headwind for risk assets.

Profit expectations are at their strongest since August 2021, with 57 per cent of respondents predicting a soft landing for the global economy and just 3 per cent bracing for a hard landing, according to BofA.

AI bubbles topped the list of tail risks for the coming year. Private credit and hyperscaler spending were seen as the most likely sources of a credit event, which ranked fourth among tail risks.

203 participants with US$569-billion in assets under management responded to the global survey.

 European stocks fell in early trading on Tuesday, struggling to make gains as traders took a cautious position ahead of key U.S. jobs data, while the dollar stayed near its lowest in two months.

In a busy week for market data, investors were waiting for the October and November U.S. employment reports due later in the session, following delays to data collection during the U.S. government shutdown.

The data could influence expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy next year, after the Fed's commentary when it cut rates last week was interpreted as less hawkish than anticipated, strengthening expectations for more rate cuts in 2026. 

Stock markets fell during Asian trading, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropping to its lowest in three weeks. Growth in China's factory output stalled to a 15-month low in November, data showed. European indexes also opened lower, before edging slightly higher. 

At 4:56 a.m. ET, the STOXX 600 was down 0.1 per cent on the day , London's FTSE 100 was down 0.3 per cent and Germany's DAX was down 0.5 per cent. Progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks contributed to a fall in European defense stocks. Still, the pullback comes in the context of stock markets hitting record highs in 2025, with the STOXX 600 on track for a 14.8 per cent gain in 2025 overall.

The MSCI world equity index was down by 0.3 per cent on the day , and up 19.8 per cent on the year as a whole. 

Economists predict that the U.S. jobs data will show that federal government cost-cutting led to a decline in nonfarm payrolls in October, followed by a rebound in job growth in November.

“Either you get strong numbers, so the economy re-accelerates. Or you have not that good of a number and hence expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates even more,” said Kevin Thozet, a member of Carmignac's investment committee.

Investors are also watching out for U.S. inflation data on Thursday, although a number of key details will be missing, and central bank meetings including rate policy decisions from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan

Global markets were lower amid investor caution ahead of a slate of U.S. data, including the jobs report, that may help signal the path for Federal Reserve policy next year.

Wall Street futures were in negative territory after major North American markets closed in the red yesterday. Dow futures were down 0.17 per cent, S&P 500 futures declined 0.36 per cent and Nasdaq futures were 0.57 per cent lower as of 4 a.m. ET.

TSX futures followed sentiment lower after sagging oil prices weighed on Canada's main stock market yesterday.

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Lennar Corp.

“The most important question is whether the [jobs] report opens the door for more rate cuts in the early part of next year,” said analysts at Deutsche Bank.

“As it stands, the Fed have only signalled one further cut for 2026 in the dot plot, but we've repeatedly seen in this cycle how a softer labour market has pushed them back in a dovish direction.”

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.09 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.34 per cent, Germany's DAX gave back 0.42 per cent and France's CAC 40 inched up 0.04 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 1.56 per cent lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.54 per cent.

Oil prices fell on Tuesday, adding to the previous session's losses, as prospects for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen, raising expectations of a potential easing of sanctions.

Brent crude futures fell 89 US cents, or around 1.5 per cent, to US$59.67 a barrel at 4:42 a.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was trading at US$55.90 a barrel, down 92 US cents, or 1.6 per cent. Both contracts were near their lowest since May this year.

“Brent has dropped this morning to below $60 per barrel for the first time in months, as the market assesses a potential peace deal resulting in additional Russian volumes becoming available and oversupplying the market further,” said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah.

The U.S. offered to provide NATO-style security guarantees for Kyiv and European negotiators reported progress in talks on Monday to end Russia's war in Ukraine, sparking optimism that an end to the conflict was closer.

Russia, meanwhile, said it was not willing to make any territorial concessions in talks on ending the Ukraine war, state news agency TASS quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.

“The grind in talks will be matched with the continued grind lower in prices as we enter 2026 with all it associated predictions of ‘glut.' Brent will make a fresh year-to-date low, but will not break below $55 a barrel before the year is out,” said PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans. 

Adding to the pressure, soft Chinese economic data released on Monday further fueled concerns that global demand may not be strong enough to absorb recent supply growth, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore in a note.

China's factory output growth slowed to a 15-month low, official data showed. Retail sales also grew at their slowest pace since December 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic

Stocks closed lower on Monday as investors braced for a slew of U.S. economic data later this week while assessing reports on Federal Reserve candidates and commentary from policy makers for clues on the interest-rate outlook.

The non-farm payroll figures for October and November are due later this week, along with reports on retail sales, business activity and inflation. October's jobs data was delayed by the government shutdown earlier this quarter. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had logged their steepest daily declines in more than three weeks on Friday amid concerns about inflation and debt-fuelled AI investments.

Traders also assessed Monday a report that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett's candidacy for the Fed chair role received some pushback from people close to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Speculation has been rife over a possible frontrunner as Jerome Powell's term ends in May. Expectations for a dovish Fed chair have fuelled bets for interest rate cuts next year. Also on Monday, New York Fed President John Williams said the central bank's interest rate cut last week leaves it in a good position, while Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued that current inflation does not reflect the true supply-demand dynamics.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.49 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 48,416.56, the S&P 500 lost 10.90 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,816.51 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 137.76 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 23,057.41.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended down 43.95 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 31,843.44, slightly extending its pullback from a record closing high on Thursday.

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Moscow will under no circumstances agree to the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine in any form, including within the NATO framework, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with ABC News.

"We are open-minded in terms of what decisions might be made. We definitely will not at any time subscribe to, agree to, or even be content with, any presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian territory," the senior diplomat said.

When asked further whether Russia would be prepared to agree to the deployment of European forces in Ukraine outside the NATO framework, Ryabkov replied: "No, no, no. The coalition of the willing is just the same. May be even worse, because it may be arranged without usual NATO procedures that are more or less stable. Nothing is stable in the Western world these days. So, no confidence, no trust, rather total and dominating mistrust to anything that comes from major NATO capitals."

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has set off for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian officials in Moscow, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali announced.

"Stable relations between Iran and Russia are getting stronger thanks to continued high-level meetings. Following last week's consultations between the two countries' presidents in Ashgabat, Dr. Araghchi set off today for a meeting with this country's foreign minister and other officials in Moscow," the Iranian embassy quoted the ambassador as saying on its Telegram channel.

At present, the agenda includes a wide range of political issues and economic projects, as the two countries maintain regional and international cooperation to promote shared goals and approaches designed to take bilateral relations to a new level, he emphasized.

Earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the two top diplomats will discuss in detail current international issues, including the situation around the Iranian nuclear program, and exchange views on regional topic of mutual interests.

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Politicians in Germany and other European countries are starting to remember their ancestors who were active members of the Nazi party, which causes much concern, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).

He also noted that the situation around Russia's frozen assets made it clear that "stealing is in the Europeans' blood."

TASS has compiled the main points from the top diplomat's remarks.

Politicians in Germany and other European countries are starting to remember their ancestors who were active members of Nazi party, which "causes much concern."

"The ideas and practices of Nazism" are being revived in Europe as efforts are being made to unite it and send it to fight against Russia the way Hitler and Napoleon did in the past: "It's about openly Nazi approaches and flagrant disregard for what the Nazi regime in Ukraine is doing."

Europe, united "under the Nazi flag," is once again waging a war against Russia, which involves "European money and European instructors," but Ukrainians are being used as proxies.

Europe has had a lot of opportunities to become part of the process to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but it ignored them all.

Russia has nothing to communicate about with the current European leadership.

Western media allegations that Russia cannot be trusted are "empty words."

The West has no evidence to prove that Russia ever failed to implement any of its obligations.

The goal of the new US National Security Strategy "is to make sure that Europe knows its place and doesn't try to impose its liberal ways, <...> but minds its own business, without dragging the US in its rather dirty games."

In its new National Security Strategy, the US is telling Europe, "Go about your own business and don't expect the US to keep supporting your reckless ventures because it has more important affairs to attend to, primarily in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region."

US sanctions on Russia's oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft stem from the desire "to suppress its competitors by using dirty methods."

The US is pursuing a policy of confronting China, which is becoming economically and politically stronger with every year, but "competition must be fair."

Imposing tariffs of 100% and 500% to suppress competitors runs counter to the principles of globalization, which is what the US promoted for Russia after World War II: "When sanctions are introduced and no one is hiding that the political positions of countries and individuals are the reason, it's not even inequality, it's disrespect for human rights."

The situation around Russia's frozen assets makes it clear that "stealing is in the Europeans' blood." "Our Western ‘colleagues' seem to have a bent towards stealing in their genes."

Many global media outlets don't call European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen anything but "Fuhrer Ursula."

Reasonable people in the US and Europe call for restoring "the principle of arms control," and Russia shares this approach.

Moscow is confident that Tehran should remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: "We believe it's worth it."

Russia seeks to boost security cooperation with Iran, particularly through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO): "We are open to cooperation."

The normalization of relations between Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council would mark "an important contribution to strengthening peace" in the region.

Moscow expects that Tehran will ratify the Convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea in the coming months: "I hope that the convection will come fully into force" before a Caspian nations' summit in Tehran, set for August 2026.

Western countries seek to divide the five Caspian nations "in order to impose decisions that won't be based on a consensus."

NEW YORK (AP) — An on-duty Customs and Border Protection officer fired his gun several times during a confrontation with another motorist Tuesday on an access road for New York's Kennedy Airport, police said.

The CBP officer told authorities that he pulled his weapon after the other driver attacked him over a minor traffic crash, Port Authority police said. 

It wasn't clear if the shots hit anything. The other driver fled the scene after the shooting, according to the CBP officer, who was unhurt.

The two-vehicle crash happened shortly before 5 a.m. near the airport's main car rental facilities on the tangle of roads and ramps that lead to the airport's terminals, administration buildings and cargo areas.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports a Customs and Border Protection officer fires a gun in dispute with a driver.

JFK's roadways are currently undergoing a major construction overhaul and navigating the thicket of detours and traffic changes has been a source of frustration and confusion for many drivers. 

The Port Authority didn't say if the officer was driving an official vehicle. His name has not been released.

The investigation led to traffic delays in the area during the morning commute, but those issues lessened as the morning progressed.

'Outkick Hot Mic' podcast host Jonathan Hutton joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the United States' placement in the 2026 World Cup, his predictions for the upcoming college football playoffs and more.

Former U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe mocked the U.S. men's national soccer team World Cup campaign in a recent podcast episode last week.

The U.S. team unveiled "Never Chase Reality" as its campaign heading into the 2026 World Cup. The 90-second film featured narration by Marcello Hernandez. The squad said in a release that "'Never Chase Reality' reflects the journey to 26 for the Men's National Team."

Rapinoe touched on it during the latest episode of "A Touch More" with her partner Sue Bird and sportscaster Katie Nolan.

"The team's slogan going into the World Cup, this was like their drop, and their slogan is ‘Never chase reality.' I was like, guys, I don't think it's saying what you think it's saying," Rapinoe said. "I'm kinda like, why didn't we just stick with, ‘Dream big?'

"To me, it said like you already think you're not good. So, I didn't like that."

Hernandez lays out what the campaign means to him.

"This campaign isn't just about soccer; it's about the American dream. Never chasing reality means ignoring the odds and daring to dream," he said in the release. "I played soccer since I was four years old until college and have been a fan of the Men's and Women's U.S. National Team since I was a kid, so it's an honor to bring my passion and enthusiasm for the game to U.S. soccer."

The reality is the U.S. men's soccer team has not had very much success on the world stage despite the squad being considered the "golden generation."

The U.S. made it to the knockout stage in 2022, even tying with England in group play, but lost to the Netherlands. The U.S. made it to the quarterfinals in 2002.

Authorities knocked on doors and scoured yards Monday in search of any video or other evidence that might lead them to the Brown University gunman after a weekend attack killed two students and wounded nine others.

Authorities believe they are looking for a person shown in a short clip of video footage walking away, but the person is not facing the camera.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Additional police were sent to Providence schools on Tuesday to reassure worried parents that their kids will be safe with the Brown University shooter on the loose and no indication yet that investigators have zeroed in on a specific suspect.

Authorities on Monday released several new videos of the man suspected in Saturday's mass shooting inside of a Brown classroom, which killed two students and wounded nine others. After releasing a person of interest in the case because the evidence pointed elsewhere, they once again pleaded with the public for any tips that might help them catch the attacker.

Tensions remain high in Providence. With the investigation in its third day Monday, officers were still knocking on doors and poring through dumpsters and backyards near the Ivy League campus in search of additional video evidence or other clues.

But some locals expressed defiance.

“Of course it feels scary. But at the same time, I think that if the person really wanted to scare us, we shouldn't allow him or her to win,” said Tatjana Stojanovic, a Providence parent who lives next door to the Brown campus. “Despite all of that, we should just go about our lives. I mean, obviously, you cannot forget this. But I think we shouldn't cower and just sort of stop living despite what has happened.

In the five videos authorities have released of the suspect, he was wearing a mask or his face was turned. The FBI described him as about 5 feet, 8 inches (173 centimeters) tall, with a stocky build.

The attack and the shooter's escape have raised questions about campus security, including a lack of security cameras, and led to calls for better locks on campus doors. Others pushed back, though, saying such efforts do little to address the real issue.




“The issue isn't the doors, it's the guns,” said Zoe Kass, a senior who fled the engineering building as police stormed in Saturday. “And all of this, like, ‘Oh, the doors need to be locked.' I get it, parents are scared. But any of us could have opened the door for the guy if the doors had been locked.”

After spending of her life in schools where every door was locked and school shootings continued to persist, Kass said such security measures only created “the illusion of safety.”

Meanwhile, details have emerged about the victims, who were in the first-floor classroom in the school's engineering building studying for a final.

Only one of the wounded students had been released as of Sunday, Brown President Christina Paxson said. One was in critical condition and the other seven were in critical but stable condition. 

One of the wounded students, 18-year-old freshman Spencer Yang of New York City, told the New York Times and the Brown Daily Herald that there was a mad scramble after the gunman entered the room. Many students ran toward the front, but Yang said he wound up on the ground between some seats and was shot in the leg. He expected to be discharged within days.

Jacob Spears, 18, a freshman from Evans, Georgia, was shot in the stomach, “but through sheer adrenaline and courage, he managed to run outside, where he was aided by others,” according to a GoFundMe site organized for him.

Ella Cook, a 19-year-old sophomore who was one of the two students killed, was vice president of the Brown College Republicans and was beloved in her church in Birmingham, Alabama. In announcing her death Sunday, the Rev. R. Craig Smalley described her as “an incredible grounded, faithful, bright light” who encouraged and “lifted up those around her.”

The other student killed was, MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, an 18-year-old freshman from Brandermill, Virginia, who was majoring in biochemistry and neuroscience. His family immigrated to the U.S. from Uzbekistan when he was a kid.

As a child, Umurzokov suffered a neurological condition that required surgery, and he later wore a back brace because of scoliosis, his sister Samira Umurzokova told The Associated Press by phone. He knew from an early age that he wanted to be a neurosurgeon to help others like him. 

“He had so many hardships in his life, and he got into this amazing school and tried so hard to follow through with the promise he made when was 7 years old,” she said.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks discusses the strengths he has seen in North Carolina as he continues walking across America.

As I continue my Walk Across America through the great state of North Carolina, I have heard from folks up north that "the South is America's problem." These friends of mine, who are not so familiar with this region, often think of it as the nation's hotbed of backwardness, where the lingering echoes of slavery, segregation and Confederate nostalgia fuel divisive debates over race, guns and social progress. They believe this region is mired in poverty and prejudice and forever locked into battles over old monuments. But they're outsiders who've never walked the backroads I have.

I have met farmers, factory hands, professors, business people, churchgoers, chefs and veterans, and I am calling it like I see it: These outsiders are flat-out wrong.

MY WALK ACROSS AMERICA IS A LESSON IN GRATITUDE AND GIVING THANKS

The truth is that the South — and North Carolina especially — is the backbone of what makes America strong. People forget that I spent the first 12 years of my life in the South, in Kenton, Tennessee. We all grew up with a deep faith in God and in America. We believed in rock-solid families, a work ethic that doesn't quit, and a resilience that sees us through adversities of all kinds. I see all that today as I walk, and I have been thanking the Lord for these sights, for they strengthen me.

When Hurricane Helene slammed into the North Carolina mountains last year, flooding out small towns, the feds were worse than the Keystone Kops. But the churches? They moved into action. Volunteers from all around saved what could be saved, tarped the roofs and cleared debris.

AT LANCASTER MARKET, I WITNESSED AN AMERICA THAT STILL WORKS — NO POLITICS REQUIRED

I met a retired couple, and they told me that their home sat under nine feet of mud and water. A team of church folks they had never met came and prayed over the ruins. Then they built it back, wall by wall. The wife told me, "Pastor, we lost our home but never our faith, and it is because of that that God's people showed up."

I have seen a hardcore work ethic everywhere I go. I've walked through factory towns where folks don't chase viral fame — they chase the ability to provide for their families.

I've also seen great family values in this state. One morning in a diner, I read in the local paper that the North Carolina House of Representatives created Opportunity Scholarships for every family, using a sliding scale based on income. The aim of this program is to free kids from failing schools. As the state's website explains, "The Opportunity Scholarship helps North Carolina families pay for tuition and other required fees to attend registered private schools."

FROM A CHICAGO ROOFTOP TO 3,000-MILE JOURNEY, HERE'S HOW I'M FIGHTING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL 

When I talked about this with a family that I met, they informed me that there were also programs like All Pro Dads & Responsible Fatherhood that teach men to step up for their families.

On the cultural front, the legislature has kept girls' sports for biological girls only, yanked explicit books from elementary shelves, and cut taxes so hardworking moms and dads keep more of their paycheck — personal income tax is down to 4.25% this year, with triggers for further cuts if revenues hold.

I have long hated the government for the dependency it created in communities like mine on the South Side of Chicago, but this feels different. It's our money being used to create agency, responsibility and accountability. That, in the long run, saves the state money. And, in the end, it is up to the individual to take advantage — or not.

Speaking of the individual, I have seen a hardcore work ethic everywhere I go. I've walked through factory towns where folks don't chase viral fame — they chase the ability to provide for their families. North Carolina's manufacturing jobs hit 473,000 last year, and they say there will be 3.5% growth through 2032, adding more than 16,000 jobs.

But it's the stories that stick. Over 20,000 veterans are transitioning out of the armed forces this year, and they bring that military discipline straight to the shop floor. And the numbers back it up. 

This is a record year for jobs — 33,745 new ones announced, with $23 billion invested. JetZero is dropping $4.7 billion on an airplane plant in Guilford County for 14,500 jobs; Vulcan Elements, $918 million in Benson for 1,000 magnet factory spots; Novartis, $771 million in Durham for 700 pharma roles. These aren't handouts — they're jobs for men and women who show up on time, work overtime and thank God for the opportunity.

The South has its sins and struggles like anywhere. But the claim that it is a drag on America is false. The South is the lift — the faith that rebuilds, the family that fights for what's right, the work that provides and the patriotism that unites. 

As 2 Chronicles 7:14 says, if my people humble themselves and pray, God heals the land. North Carolina is living that out, and it's a model for the nation. This is where America's heart still beats strong.

            After months of speculation about his future on the radio, Howard Stern has signed a new contract with SiriusXM.
    


            Stern announced his new deal with the satellite radio giant on his show Tuesday morning. “I'm happy to announce that I figured out a way to have it all, more free time, and continuing to be on the radio,” Stern said. “So, yes, we are coming back for three years.”
    


            SiriusXM had no immediate comment on the terms of the new deal.
    


            Stern, 71, had been the subject of rumor-mongering because his current five-year deal is due to expire in a couple of weeks.
    


            In August, the US Sun claimed that “The Howard Stern Show” was “set to be canceled after a stunning 20-year run.” The story also suggested that Stern's exit might be related to his outspoken criticism of President Trump.
    


            The Sun story drew a lot of attention despite its thin sourcing. A SiriusXM executive then said of Stern and his crew, “We'd love them to stay,” but “it certainly has to make sense” financially.
    


            When Stern returned to his mic after Labor Day, he punked his listeners by having Andy Cohen pretend to take over the show. Several news outlets fell for the prank, much to Stern's delight. When he returned to the air, Stern said his deal talks have been “fantastic,” but didn't address his future beyond that.
    


            The contract talks continued out of public view. Stern said Tuesday that he feels “very loyal” to SiriusXM, which has paid him hundreds of millions of dollars for exclusive rights to his content over the years.

NFL legend Brett Favre lamented in a recent podcast episode the culture of instant satisfaction that has been created in society as a result of the social media age.

Favre and his co-host David Kano talked on "4th and Favre" about the lack of loyalty in college sports with the advent of name, image and likeness deals and the transfer portal, coupled with coaches leaving schools without consequences.

Kano compared what he believed was going on in college sports with the state of society.

"I think that's more matter of opinion – what you're exposed to. There's some people who don't watch YouTube. There's some people who don't have TikTok. I am one of those," Favre said in response. "Again, a matter of opinion. But I think, presently, in this world, or this country, it's about how many clicks you can get immediately. Like, what can I do to get the most followers? It's sort of like what we just talked about.

The Green Bay Packers legend said the lack of loyalty in college sports is the "sign of the times right now." He added that college athletics is about "how well you can do now as a player or as a coach and move on to bigger and better things."

Fox News political analyst Lisa Boothe discusses Democrats' outrage over President Donald Trump's ballroom construction during the ongoing shutdown. 

The Trump administration argued in a court filing on Monday that pausing construction on the new White House ballroom would undermine national security, citing a Secret Service declaration warning that halting work would leave the site unable to meet "safety and security requirements" needed to protect the president. 

The declaration says the White House's East Wing, demolished in October and now undergoing below-grade work, cannot be left unfinished without compromising essential security measures.

"Accordingly, any pause in construction, even temporarily, would leave the contractor's obligation unfulfilled in this regard and consequently hamper the Secret Service's ability to meet its statutory obligations and protective mission," reads the filing in part.

The government's memorandum was in response to a lawsuit filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit that says it advocates for preserving historic sites of national importance and protecting the public's role in that process.

The National Trust lawsuit targets key government officials responsible for overseeing the White House grounds and the agencies managing the construction project, including the National Park Service and the Department of the Interior.

It argues that pausing the Trump administration's ballroom project is essential to prevent irreversible changes while the required oversight and public involvement procedures are carried out.

"Submitting the project to the National Capital Planning Commission for review protects the iconic historic features of the White House campus as it evolves. Inviting comments from the American people signals respect and helps ensure a lasting legacy that befits a government of the people, by the people, for the people," said Carol Quillen, the president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The White House announced President Donald Trump's plans in July to move forward with a 90,000-square-foot state ballroom that would cost an estimated $200 million. That figure has now risen to at least $300 million, and while the project is backed by some private donors, Trump has also insisted it will be funded "100% by me and some friends of mine."

In its filing, the administration emphasized that key regulatory reviews are forthcoming, saying it plans to submit draft architectural drawings and materials to the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in the coming weeks. 

The government argued the lawsuit is premature because above-grade construction is not scheduled to begin until April 2026.

The National Trust, however, counters that the scale of the project makes early intervention necessary. In its lawsuit, the group argues that the 90,000-square-foot addition would dwarf the Executive Residence and permanently upset the classical balance of the White House's design. 

The complaint also cites an October statement from the Society of Architectural Historians, which warned that the proposed ballroom would represent the most significant exterior change to the building in more than 80 years.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a deal to end the fighting in Russia's nearly 4-year-old invasion of his country could be finalized within days, after which American envoys will present them to the Kremlin before possible further meetings in the U.S. next weekend. 

A draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin on Monday is “not perfect” but is “very workable,” Zelenskyy told reporters hours after the discussions. He cautioned, however, that some key issues — notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces — remain unresolved.

U.S.-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But as the spotlight shifts to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.

Zelenskyy said that after the Berlin talks, “we are very close to (a deal on) strong security guarantees.”

The security proposal will be based on Western help in keeping the Ukrainian army strong, an official from a NATO nation said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

“Europeans will lead a multinational and multi-domain force to strengthen those troops and to secure Ukraine from the land, sea and air, and the U.S. will lead a ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, with international participation,” the official said.




Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.

If Ukraine seeks “momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,” he said.

“We want peace — we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,” he told reporters. “We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.”

American officials said Monday there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. U.S. President Donald Trump said: “I think we're closer now than we have been, ever” to a peace settlement.

Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, notably the land issue.

Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either but Trump has previously indicated that Ukraine will have to cede territory.

“The Americans are trying to find a compromise,” Zelenskyy said, before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. “They are proposing a ‘free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a ‘free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.”

Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.

Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense, such as enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons.

Zelenskyy said that what's driving Kyiv officials in the negotiations is for Russia to be “held accountable for what it has done — for this war, for all the killings, for all the suffering.”

Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.

He was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks.

“Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,” Zelenskyy said. “It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.”

            • Police are pursuing a new lead based on photos and videos of an individual taken around 2 p.m. Saturday, hours before the deadly mass shooting at Brown University, authorities said today. The FBI, which announced a $50,000 reward leading to an arrest and conviction, also released a description, saying the person is “approximately 5'8” with a stocky build.”
    


            • Earlier, a person of interest detained in connection with the attack was released, and has been cleared in the investigation, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.
    


            • The shooting left two students dead and nine others injured at the Ivy League school, where classes and exams have been canceled.  The campus remains on edge.



Our coverage of the ongoing search for a suspect in the shooting at Brown University has moved.
    


            When Brown freshman Khimari Manns heard about the shooting on campus, he immediately reached out to his wrestling teammates, his classmates and his roommate, MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, while sheltering in a restroom.
    


            But when Umurzokov didn't respond during the lockdown, Manns began to worry. “Something didn't feel right. I texted him and he didn't text back,” Manns told CNN affiliate WBZ.
    


            “What I do know is that Brown is grieving. I am grieving,” he said, adding that Umurzokov was a “ball of joy” and that his absence is felt throughout the Brown community.
    


            “His soul truly did reverberate throughout the community,” he said.
    


            Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee has ordered a sweeping review of school safety measures after the Brown University shooting left the campus on edge.
    


                    “As a parent who has sent my children off to college – I can only imagine how families are feeling right now. And I will assure you: The safety and well‑being of your children and all Rhode Islanders are my priority,” McKee said in a post on X.
                





            He directed the state's top education officials to “work with both K-12 and higher education to conduct a full review of their school safety and security plans.”
    


            The governor said the state is committing “every resource available” to assist Providence and Brown University as the manhunt for the gunman continues. He also called for an increased police presence at schools to steady anxious students, families and educators.
    


                    “I know that many people are feeling anxious right now,” McKee added. “Given the emotional toll that a tragedy like this can take, it is essential that mental health resources are visible, accessible and responsive.”
                





            Authorities on Monday released photos and videos of a new person of interest, described as “approximately 5'8” with a stocky build.” A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
    


            The images show an individual dressed in dark clothing and masked. The person's distinctive gait and consistent rhythm could be recognizable to someone close to them, a CNN senior law enforcement analyst said.
    


            The new lead comes after the release of a person of interest previously detained in connection to the shooting, a decision that has sparked confusion and concern within the Brown community.
    


            With a manhunt underway, here's what we know:
    


Victims



            Brown University officials are asking anyone who was in the Barus and Holley Hall - the site of Saturday's shooting - to assist investigators in their efforts to track down the suspect.
    


            “We ask that anyone who was in Barus & Holley building on Friday or Saturday, Dec. 12-13, immediately contact the Providence police to arrange for an interview,” the university said in an update Monday evening. “Even what seems like an incidental detail may ultimately be helpful in law enforcement's efforts to protect our community.”
    


            The university also emphasized that campus safety remains its foremost priority. It said reports circulating about additional intruders and violence on and around campus were unfounded and that police have responded to several calls about reported threats, each determined to be baseless. Brown has also experienced an uptick of “swatting” calls, it said.
    


            The university said it has put in place additional safety measures, including an enhanced security presence on campus and restricted building access.
    


            Brown University student Annie Johnson's sense of security was “completely destroyed” after news that an initial person of interest was released from custody, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday.
    


                    “It felt like just the smallest amount of comfort to know, well, like, at least they found the guy and they have him and they know who it was, but now it's like that one sense of sort of security was just completely destroyed,” she said.
                





            Johnson said being in the airport to fly home “was a really weird experience” as she was surrounded by people who may have read about the university shooting on their phones and likely “didn't understand what it was like to live through it.”
    


            “I have to have sympathy for those people, and I have to understand them because like, just a week before, I probably would have done the same thing,” Johnson added.
    


            New videos of an individual police are calling a person of interest provide a fresh look at the person's size, how they walk and other details that may help the public to identify them, CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe said.
    


            The individual has a distinctive gait with a consistent rhythm that someone close to them might be able to identify, McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
    


            “He kind of walks the same way when he's on the sidewalk or crossing the street, and he appears to favor his left leg just slightly, not so much that it would be indicative of any sort of permanent disability, but maybe the remnant of an old surgery or a knee injury or something like that,” McCabe said.
    


            The videos also reveal the individual's size and build, and more detail of their dark clothing.
    


            “It's those kind of details that I think could maybe trip somebody's recollection that this is someone they know in their lives,” McCabe said.
    


            Authorities released the videos Monday afternoon, describing the individual in them as “approximately 5'8” with a “stocky build.” The FBI also announced Monday a $50,000 reward for information leading to “the identification, arrest, and conviction of the individual.”
    


            The FBI continues to assist in the investigation into the Brown University shooting, with the Providence Police Department leading the investigation, Director Kash Patel wrote in a post on X.
    


            The agency sent additional resources to the area today “to help track down leads, canvass neighborhoods, and develop intelligence,” and the Evidence Response Team is still helping to process evidence, he said.
    


            “Anything Rhode Island authorities need from this FBI, we will be there,” Patel said.
    


            Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha told CNN's Erin Burnett that he was “confident” law enforcement would be able to find the person of interest in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University.
    


            He called the person shown in videos released by police “a significant person of interest, possibly more than that.”
    


            “Hopefully very quickly, we can get this person identified, detained, questioned if possible, but certainly he is our primary person of interest right now,” the attorney general said.
    


            Responding to comments President Donald Trump made about Brown University being to blame for the failure to quickly identify a suspect, Neronha said the shooting was instead a symptom of a greater problem.
    


                    “It's not a Brown problem, it's a national problem, a symptom that happened here in Rhode Island,” he said. “What we're focused on here is solving this crime. It's not Brown's fault. It's the fault of this gunman.”
                





            Authorities provided significant new information in their latest news briefing on the shooting at Brown University, and announced a $50,000 reward from the FBI for information that leads to the identification, arrest and conviction of the suspect who is believed to be armed and dangerous.
    


            The shooter in Saturday's attack “definitely” targeted Brown University, Chief of Police Oscar L. Perez, Jr.
    


If you're just tuning in for a quick roundup of the key details, here's the rundown:



Suspect's movements:



Community safety:



About the suspect:



Additional clarifications:



CNN's Danya Gainor, Zoe Sottile and Michelle Watson contributed to the report.



            Videos released by the Providence Police Department show a person of interest walking around the area on Saturday hours before the deadly shooting at Brown University.
    


            In the video, the person is walking on a sidewalk by a picket fence around 2 p.m. on Saturday, officials say.
    


            Surveillance video shown during the Monday press conference showed an individual wearing what appears to be a mask crossing a street.
    


            In another clip, the same individual is seen walking on the sidewalk next to an iron gate.
    


            Additionally, officials displayed photos of the individual, who appeared to be wearing dark clothing.
    


            The FBI released a description of a person they described as the suspect in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University, along with photos.
    


            The shooter is “approximately 5'8” with a stocky build,” reads a poster released by the bureau.
    


            Images show a person dressed in dark clothing with a face mask and beanie.
    


            The FBI is urging members of the public to contact them with any information related to the shooting.
    


            Rhode Island Rep. Seth Magaziner urged the public on Monday to not pay attention to theories “floating around online” about who the suspect might be, warning some people may use “tragedies” like this “to stoke more fear and to stoke more division.”
    


            “Unless there is official notification or official guidance, we shouldn't be guessing or making assumptions about what the motive might have been or who the shooter might be,” Magaziner, a Democrat, told CNN's Jake Tapper.
    


            “So I would say, you know, follow those those regular press conferences from the local officials to get the real information, not the noise online,” he continued.
    


            At Monday's afternoon news conference, a journalist asked officials about the timing of the release of photos the FBI says show the suspect in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University.
    


            The photos were released Monday, two days after a gunman opened fire in the Ivy League school's engineering building, killing two students and injuring nine others.
    


            “It takes time,” Providence police chief  Oscar L. Perez Jr.  said. “Investigations are very complex, and when you're doing canvassing areas or when you're developing evidence, sometimes you get directed to another direction, and then that's what makes you go back to certain areas and continue to investigate.”
    


            Asked a pointed question about surveillance footage at Brown University, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley emphasized the hard work all agencies were putting into tracking down the suspect and their commitment to transparency.
    


            “We continue to answer your questions,” he said during a tense moment. “We will continue to do so, but the best way to inform the public and to ask for their help is for these opportunities to not degrade into baseless accusations.”
    


            Mayor Brett Smiley said Providence officials will not provide another news briefing Monday unless there is a “significant update” to the situation.
    


            Chief of Police Oscar L. Perez, Jr. said Monday the shooter in Saturday's attack “definitely” targeted Brown University.
    


            “What I can tell you is that this individual definitely targeted Brown University, because clearly we're here speaking about that, and I can also tell you that obviously it's something that we're looking into – as far if there was anything else that he was targeting, but it's all open” Perez said.
    


            Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he and other officials have “all been working for 49 hours, we're tired – we're serious about the task at hand.”
    


            “I know that people are weary, and so I'm asking please for a little bit of patience and grace,” the mayor said. “We have been fully transparent. We continue to answer your questions.”
    


            Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said authorities are working to reconstruct the person's movements both before and after Saturday's shooting.
    


            “What's critical here is that we reconstruct … this man's movements, both before and afterwards,” Neronha said Monday.
    


            “My hope is that we will eventually have that pattern,” he added.
    


            Providence Police Chief Oscar L. Perez, Jr. said reports that a second person of interest was taken into custody in connection to the shooting at Brown University were false.
    


            One person was taken into custody Sunday before later being released and cleared.
    


            Providence Police Chief Oscar L. Perez, Jr. told reporters on Monday that investigations can take different paths.
    


            “All detectives throughout this nation and in the world understand that when you investigate in a case, it takes different paths,” Perez said.
    


            “You know, you start somewhere, you start here, and all of a sudden, something else pops off, and you're going in a different direction. And that's what happens. It's complex,” he said.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and nutrition and fitness specialist Dr. Paul Saladino discuss the Trump administration's $1 billion airport upgrade plan on ‘Fox & Friends.'

Once a rare luxury reserved only for premium international travelers, the ability to shower at airports is gaining new attention as fliers look for ways to refresh during long-haul trips and extended layovers — especially amid the MAHA push for healthier living in virtually any venue. 

Travelers are even sharing TikTok videos detailing the amenities offered by a variety of airports, including private stalls and toiletries.

Others are asking why airports haven't widely adopted more wellness-focused amenities such as publicly accessible shower suites or dedicated gyms.

Frequent fliers on Reddit have also compared their experiences using lounge showers — noting that access can vary widely depending on airline status and airport.

The Trump administration recently spotlighted a $1 billion initiative for family-friendly improvements, unveiled during a pull-up event at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C.

Frequent fliers say the ability to shower between flights can make a dramatic difference on long travel days, especially after overnight routes or lengthy international connections.

FINGERPRINT SCANS COMING FOR AMERICAN TRAVELERS TO MOST OF EUROPE IN NEW POLICY

Peter Shankman, a New York–based corporate keynote speaker and author, said he logs more than 250,000 miles a year.

He said travelers need to know a few things before using an airport shower for the first time.

Numerous fliers said they appreciate having a comfortable space to freshen up between connections. (iStock)

Some of the best airport shower facilities are found overseas, he said, where long flights and connections make it essential for travelers to reset between journeys.

"You've been on a plane all night, you're greasy, you're gross," said Shankman. "To get a shower and let the hot water wash all the ‘plane' off you makes a world of difference."

Many lounges now notify passengers through an app or buzzer when a shower suite is ready.

Zurich Airport is one of his top picks, he said. 

It offers private shower rooms in its lounges that allow passengers to freshen up before continuing on, he said.

Several major U.S. airport lounges, including United Polaris, American Flagship and Delta Sky Club locations, offer shower suites for travelers, according to the companies' websites. 

Programs such as Priority Pass, an independent membership initiative, provide access to lounges with shower facilities at airports around the world.

Access varies by airport and airline — but lounge membership or elite status typically offers the most reliable option. 

Some lounges sell day passes, and several international airports host independent shower or spa facilities that any traveler can pay to use.

Shankman said the process is usually straightforward. After checking into the lounge, travelers go to the shower desk, where staff assign them a room or place them on a waiting list. 

Many lounges now notify passengers through an app or buzzer when a shower suite is ready.

Most facilities provide basic toiletries such as shampoo, soap and towels — and Shankman noted that showers are generally cleaned after each use.

Airport lounge showers can be easy to use, with travelers checking in, waiting for a room, and getting an alert when it's ready. (iStock)

Still, timing matters. 

Any traveler planning to use an airport shower should head straight to the lounge after landing, as wait times can spike when several international flights arrive at once, he said.

In some airports, Shankman said he's seen passengers wait up to two or three hours for an available shower suite.

First-time users should also come prepared, he suggested.

"Always pack a clean pair of socks and underwear," he said.

One by one, they are singing, the men who used to do dirty deeds for the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. Nobody knows what's going to happen, whether the United States will attack, and whether Maduro will fall. But these Venezuelans sniff change in the air. As more countries exit Venezuela's orbit, more allegations are likely to emerge.

Two of the men are in prison here in the U.S.: Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former spy mastermind, and Cliver Alcala Cordones, a former general, both of whom have written letters to President Donald Trump airing bales of dirty laundry regarding narco-trafficking to the U.S. A third is a top official who has defected and is cooperating with the U.S. government, to whom I spoke a couple of months ago.

Over in Bolivia, where change has already begun, information regarding that government's involvement with narco-terrorism may soon see the light of day as well. The new president, Rodrigo Paz Pereira, elected earlier this year and sworn into office last month, had his predecessor, Luis Arce, arrested on Wednesday. Many members of Arce's government may follow him into the clink, and they may soon start “cooperating” by airing dirty laundry as well.

Arce's Movement for Socialism party is every bit as socialist, as steeped in drug trafficking, and as Cuban-influenced as Chavez's and Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. They fed off each other back in the heyday of Marxism in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Even Spain, currently run by the Left, may soon start producing information. Last week, the Economic and Fiscal Crime Unit searched the offices of an airline run by people with close ties to Venezuela and Cuba, Plus Ultra. The firm is also close to former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, an anti-American socialist who advocates on behalf of Venezuela and China in Madrid.

The Venezuelan regime itself forms the Cartel de los Soles, a narco-trafficking, terrorist group that helped flood our streets with drugs. Maduro and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, in fact, lead it, something we already knew, but which Carbajal confirmed in his letter to Trump.

But the Venezuelan government, using revenues not just from narcotics but also from the world's largest oil reserves, which Venezuela owns, led not just domestic bad actors against the U.S., but the region's communist states. The ideology and deep hatred of the U.S., and the planning on how to operationalize this animus, have come from Havana, but the resources come from Caracas.

Grouped in a regional Marxist bloc called the Foro de Sao Paulo, founded by Cuba's dead dictator Fidel Castro and Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, these Marxist parties swept to power in a second wave — the first was in the early 2000s — four or five years ago in Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Brazil, etc.

Voters in Ibero-America are now bringing this era to a screeching halt, which means that many more narco-terrorist secrets will surely come out. In Chile on Sunday, Jose Antonio Kast romped to victory, defeating the communist candidate Jeannette Jara by 20 points.

Honduras, too, held elections recently, and the candidate supported by the outgoing Marxist President Xiomara Castro, Rixi Moncada, got less than 20% of the vote in elections held Nov. 30. With 99% of the vote counted in that Central American nation, the Trump-backed candidate, Nasry Asfura, has a commanding lead. Castro and her Marxist husband, Manuel Zelaya, will try everything not to hand power to a Trumpian, but they will only be inviting trouble if they do.

All these Marxist presidents who were unable to help their chosen candidates get elected, or may be about to meet the same fate, as Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, is certain to face in elections in May, came to office in our hemisphere under unusual circumstances.

This new pink tidal wave was unleashed by the seismic force of Venezuelan-organized riots in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and other South American countries between 2019 and 2022. Marxist revolutionaries emerged victorious in elections in all the countries following the riots. Most of these new governments then aided Venezuela's narco-terrorist activity.

America, too, was rocked in 2020 by nationwide riots organized by Black Lives Matter, whose leaders were close to Chavez and Maduro. According to the defector who spoke with me, at least one of them received financial assistance from Chavez.

If you pull the information together, a picture emerges of a Cuban-led plan to create disarray inside the U.S., both by flooding U.S. streets with drugs that would undermine the fiber of this country or with street mayhem. Venezuelan gangs and Colombian guerrillas carried out the plan.

Carvajal's letter, which confirms most of this, starts as an act of contrition:

“My name is Hugo Carvajal Barrios. For many years, I was a high-ranking member of the Venezuelan regime. … Today, I sit in an American prison because I voluntarily plead guilty to the crimes charged against me: a narco-terrorism conspiracy. I write to atone by telling the full truth so that the United States can protect itself from the dangers I witnessed for so many years.”

Carvajal clearly does not want to spend the rest of his days in an American prison and is seeking a better deal by revealing what he did. “Today, I see the need to address the American people about the reality of what the Venezuelan regime truly is—and why President Trump's policies are not only correct, but absolutely necessary to the United States' national security,” he wrote.

Carvajal explained that he “personally witnessed how Hugo Chavez's government became a criminal organization that is now run by Maduro, Cabello, and other senior regime officials.” The purpose of this criminal organization, “now known as the Cartel of the Suns, is to weaponize drugs against the United States,” he wrote. “The drugs that reached your cities through new routes were not accidents of corruption nor just the work of independent traffickers; they were deliberate policies coordinated by the Venezuelan regime against the United States.”

This plan, he wrote, “was suggested by the Cuban regime to Chávez in the mid-2000s.” It was “successfully executed with help from FARC, ELN, Cuban operatives, and Hezbollah,” he wrote of the Narco-Marxist guerrilla groups in next-door Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army. The Venezuelan regime, Carvajal wrote, “has provided weapons, passports, and impunity for these terrorist organizations to operate freely from Venezuela against the United States.”

Then Carvajal let dangle that he could furnish more information: “U.S. diplomats and CIA officers were paid to assist Chávez and Maduro in remaining in power. These Americans acted as spies for Cuba and Venezuela, and some remain active to this day.”

The letter by Alcala Cordones, dated Dec. 8 and revealed by Venezuelan investigative journalist Maibort Petit, confirms most of the information contained in Carvajal's own missive.

Alcala Cordones is the highest Venezuelan military leader behind bars in the U.S. He is serving a 21-year sentence after admitting to being a member of the Cartel of the Suns and collaborating with the FARC to smuggle weapons, including grenade launchers, and cocaine into the U.S.

He fingers Maduro as the man in charge of international relations, especially with Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, and Cabello as the leader who maintains armed protection for the smuggling networks, but he says that the Cartel of the Suns is run by Executive Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and her brother, Jorge Rodriguez. The letter details the evolution of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua into a transnational organization with operatives in U.S. streets and the role of Cuban intelligence.

The “current supreme core of Venezuelan power,” Maduro, Cabello and the Rodriguezes, according to the letter, has ties with U.S. congressmen who were left unnamed. It closes with this warning: “The regime run by Maduro and Cabello represents a threat to the national security of the United States.”

Whether this emerging picture provides a casus belli for Washington to act against Maduro by hitting targets inside Venezuela is unclear. The U.S. has been bombing boats coming out of Venezuela that it says are carrying drugs headed for the U.S.

But in a way, nothing here is new. In October 2019, Cabello already put the world on notice that Venezuela's regime would destabilize our hemisphere. “We are headed towards a Bolivarian hurricane,” Cabello warned. “It cannot be stopped by absolutely anyone. What is happening in Peru, what is happening in Chile, what is happening in Argentina, what is happening in Honduras, in Ecuador is just a little breeze. A hurricane is what is to come. It is absolutely impossible that Colombia remains how it is. It is absolutely impossible that Brazil remains how it is. There is no way.”

WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR ABOUT THE BROWN SHOOTING

While all the media attention here has been devoted to whether War Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to shoot at one of these boats a second time, the so-called double tap, while some survivors were still swimming in the Caribbean, less attention has been paid to the singing Venezuelans.

That may soon be seen to have been a case of journalistic malpractice.

Mini gyms and healthier food options aren't going to make airports less miserable.

This month, a video of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. popped up on my feed. Wearing a blue dress shirt and tie, the bronzed, tin-voiced secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services began doing pull-ups. While videos of septuagenarians doing body-weight might be rare if not odd, performing exercises on film has sort of become Kennedy's modus operandi. Watching this man, who was born in 1954, push and pull his body in aggressive ways is supposed to underscore his job as the man in charge of the country's health. If he's healthy, the country must be. But what made this particular video strange was that he was doing these pull-ups at Reagan airport in Washington, DC.

Behind Kennedy is a departures board. Even farther back are restroom and defibrillator signs. His video is papered with the sounds and sights of hapless travelers rolling their carry-ons through the terminal.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

The stunt was part of a press conference in which Kennedy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that they would invest $1 billion in making airports a wellness space. That would include, the administration says, installing gym equipment, more children's play areas, and healthier food options. More broadly, the investment follows proclamations from Duffy that he wants to bring more “civility” to the flying experience, and as a first step in that mission, he encouraged travelers to dress better.

This didn't go over too well, and it's not difficult to understand why: Airports are a bad place and exercises or dressing better will not fix their badness.

Airports are where people want efficiency. The best airports are ones where everything feels less painful — less waiting in lines, less delays, less fluorescent lighting, and everything in between. In fact, people spend money to make the entire process less miserable. They'll shell out money for TSA PreCheck, a feature that shortens the security lines and let you keep shoes on (before TSA got rid of that policy this year). They'll spend money for access to already-crowded lounges, just so they don't have to kill time at the even-more depressing gates.

No one wants to go to the airport and work out. The only time a gym may come handy is in the event of a major delay or if the gym inadvertently becomes a more humane place to wait for your flight than the airport bar (lying down on a yoga mat in peace and quiet might be nice!). Healthier options at a liminal space like an airport are nice in theory, but one of the few joys is that food rules don't apply. You can have alcohol in the morning, eat at a place that advertises itself as an abbreviated version of Chili's, and even test your luck with sushi.

Adding gyms and healthy food to make air travel better isn't directly making air travel better.

But perhaps the outrage is part of the point. Getting upset over a gym you're never going to use, or a bad salad you're never going to eat, or watching an old tan man struggle to do some jungle gym exercises, draws attention away from the things Duffy and his cohort won't fix.

There's still a shortage of FAA flight controllers, which have led to safety concerns and flight delays. In the event of flight delays, Duffy and Trump's administration dissolved a Biden-era initiative for airlines to compensate passengers for lengthy delays. Additionally, airfare is more expensive compared to a year ago and those figures don't include all the upcharges (e.g., sitting toward the front of the main cabin, checked baggage, etc.) that customers choose to make flights more bearable. Said airlines have also made seats smaller and smaller to increase profits.

The awful state of air travel is one of the few things that transcends political partisanship. Go to the airport right now, ask anyone waiting for their flight to board, and they will tell you ways it could improve. Bigger seats, better deals, less delays, more compensation for delays, not being treated like cattle — these are the things people want. Not 15 pull-ups and business casual.

Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt reports live from Brentwood, Calif. on the arrest of Nick Reiner, son of director Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, for their murder on 'America Reports.'

From addiction struggles to violent outbursts, Rob and Michele Reiner's son, Nick, has had his share of battles throughout the years. On Monday, the 32-year-old was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder in the horrific deaths of his parents — who were found dead at their Brentwood, Calif., home on Dec. 14. 

Reiner was initially booked on $4 million bail, but records now show he is being held without bail. On Monday, he was transferred to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. 

Investigators believe Rob and Michele suffered stab wounds, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

"This is not the first time their son has been violent," a longtime neighbor told the New York Post. "I know of another incident a few years back with Nick, but I won't say more than that. I just never thought it would ever get to this point."

"Rob was always heartbroken that his son couldn't beat his addiction," the neighbor continued. "I know they wanted him to get help, go to rehab, but he wanted to get help while at home — he did not want to get treatment at a facility."

"And I know they have argued about that for years. Nick has had demons for the longest," they added. "It is such a nightmare. The whole thing is a tragedy."

Another neighbor told Fox News Digital that Nick had gone to rehab years ago, and she thought he was "back to normal."

"Years ago, when he was young, he was on heroin and cocaine, and he went to rehab and did well and was apparently back to normal, but obviously, that wasn't the case," Maryanne Lewis, who has lived in the Reiners' neighborhood for over 50 years, said. "I heard nothing about him recently."

Nick had been open about his struggles in the past. 

In 2015, Nick and Rob released a semi-autobiographical film titled, "Being Charlie" — a movie loosely based on Nick's real-life experience with addiction and recovery.

"It forced me to have to see more clearly and understand more deeply what Nick had gone through, and I think it forced him to see things that I experienced during this process," Rob said during a 2016 interview on BUILD, YouTube's live interview series. "It brought us closer together."

"The whole process, for me, made me understand him a lot more. And I think it made me a better father. Hopefully, it did. If your kid is going through a rough time, the parent, your main job is to keep your child safe. I felt at a loss."

Nick gave an interview about "Being Charlie" alongside his family at the Toronto Film Festival in 2015, saying his decision to quit heroin was driven by a practical realization.

"I got sick of it. I got sick of doing that," he told the Times. "I come from a nice family. I'm not supposed to be out there on the streets and in homeless shelters doing all these...things."

During that same interview, Rob spoke candidly about how he handled his son's addiction at the time.

"When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen," he said. "We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son."

"We were so influenced by these people," Michele added. "They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them."

Despite their differences, the film ultimately bonded father and son. 

"To be honest, by the time we got to the point of making the movie, it didn't matter if we actually did," Reiner told the Times. "Because our relationship had gotten so much closer."

During an appearance on the "Dopey" podcast in 2018, Nick opened up about a time when he became violent while using meth in his parents' guest house. 

"I went 10 rounds in my guest house," he shared. "It's not much of a story. I got totally spun out on uppers — I think it was coke and something else — and I was up for days on end. I started punching out some things in my guest house."

"Everything in the guest house got wrecked," said Nick, who admitted there was "no logic" behind his outburst. 

According to TMZ, Rob and Nick allegedly got into a "very loud argument" while attending Conan O'Brien's Christmas party one night before the murders. 

"Nick was freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous," a source told People. 

A representative for O'Brien did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

A source told Page Six that Nick "really resented his dad" and "hated himself for not being as talented, prolific or beloved as his dad or grandad."

A family spokesperson initially confirmed the deaths to Variety, saying, "It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time."

Following the initial investigation into the Reiners' homicides, authorities determined Nick was "responsible for their deaths."

Nick was located and arrested at approximately 9:15 p.m. Sunday. He was booked on suspicion of murder and is now being held without bail, according to the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.

The case will be presented Tuesday to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the LAPD confirmed in a release.

Rob and Michele had three children together: Jake, Nick and Romy.

House Democrats and Republicans are hurtling toward the New Year's expiration of Obamacare subsidies but both have decided doing nothing is better than reaching a deal.

The House will vote this week on the GOP legislation, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, which combines elements of other bills that have previously passed. But it is merely intended to display Republican willingness to act and is highly unlikely to become law before subsidies expire on Dec. 31.

The parties have fought over healthcare since Democrats put it front and center during the government shutdown. Neither supports the other's demands, bringing Congress to an impasse.

Democratic leaders have issued a scathing rebuke of the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, calling it “unserious,” which signals they will not encourage their caucus to vote for the bill. Meanwhile, Republican leaders have stated they do not support Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries's (D-NY) three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies, instead arguing that their bill will provide “clear, responsible alternatives” to lower healthcare costs.

Bipartisanship appeared to be on the horizon last week, after centrist Republicans and leadership worked out a deal to amend the legislation and extend the Obamacare subsidies for two years with some reforms. GOP leadership aides told reporters Friday that they expected a vote on an amendment to extend the Obamacare subsidies to come this week.

But that bipartisanship appears to be short-lived as the deal between leaders and GOP members led by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) is allegedly falling apart due to leadership arguing that members would need to find healthcare offsets to pay for the extension, according to multiple reports. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told reporters Monday that a final decision had not yet been made on whether an amendment would be allowed on renewing the subsidies.If leadership and rank-and-file members cannot come to an agreement, the centrist lawmakers will have to find their own way to get a vote to extend the tax credits. To do so, they will have to present a version similar to Fitzpatrick's bill to the House Rules Committee, offering it as an amendment to extend the subsidies by two years.

Given that the Rules Committee is largely a cudgel of leadership and has conservatives such as Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC), it is unlikely their proposal will pass.

This could push lawmakers to a crossroads. Given that 12 Republicans have signed Fitzpatrick's discharge petition, and 11 Republicans have joined the petition led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), there are a few options for the GOP.

One option for Democrats is to band together and join either of the discharge petitions. Doing so would force a vote on a bill to extend the subsidies in some shape or form. Gottheimer's extends the Obamacare subsidies for one year and sets up for a vote on a longer extension or reform process in the second year.

If all Democrats signed one of the petitions, it would be enough to reach the 218-signature threshold. But leaders have dragged their feet on wholeheartedly endorsing either petition, including the one led by their own Democratic caucus member.

Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement Saturday that anything less than a clean three-year extension of the subsidies is a “waste of time.” On Monday, Jeffries said he reviewed the discharge petitions.

“We have a position: a straight three-year extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the minority leader said.

He dodged repeated questions on whether he would explicitly tell his caucus not to sign the discharge petitions.

Rep. Greg Landsman (D-OH) predicted that “anything” that extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies will “ultimately get enough support,” if it's able to make it on the schedule or through the Rules Committee for a vote.

“For me, it is, and has always been, about the 32,000 people in my district that need us to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies,” Landsman told the Washington Examiner. “So I'm supporting any and every attempt to do that, because they come first.”

Another option for centrist Republicans is to join Jeffries's three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies. All Democrats have signed Jeffries's discharge petition, so only four Republicans are needed to reach the 218 threshold.

“We are going to continue to reach our hand out and say, ‘Come join us. Four of you, who seem to now be very concerned about what is happening in their communities as they see their political numbers failing.' …The [American people] deserve so much better than what they are getting from this Republican Party,” House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) said.

However, centrist Republicans, although they favor a smaller extension of the tax credits, are not budging on signing the three-year extension at this time and say it is up to Democratic leadership to make a move.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), who has signed both Fitzpatrick and Gottheimer's petitions, said he is not supportive of a blanket, three-year extension.

“I don't like it,” Bacon said, arguing some of the provisions of the subsidies are “very wasteful.”

“Why should somebody earning $600,000 get these tax credits, and why do we want a third of all the tax credit money, not go to individuals' premiums? That's what's going on right now. … I think Hakeem Jeffries and his team should get on one of the two discharges we have, because we deal with both those issues,” Bacon added.

“So if we're going to do an extension, it's got to be a reform plan.”

Lawler said he thinks Democrats are wavering in their support for the petitions for political reasons.

“We have two discharges that already have more than enough Republican signatures on them, and that's really up to the Democratic leadership, whether or not they truly want an extension or they want the issue,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) told reporters Monday. “Based on many comments they've made, certainly internally, they seem to want the issue, not the actual extension.”

A three-year extension, proposed by Democrats, and a competing Republican proposal failed last week in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said Monday that there is not enough support to have a “straight-up extension” of the tax credits without some significant reforms, essentially putting Capitol Hill at a standstill.

“So how is it an option when it can't get through the Senate?” Lawler asked.

Wednesday's House vote comes as a bipartisan group of senators makes a last-ditch attempt to negotiate a subsidy extension. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bernie Moreno (R-OH), both of whom support a two-year subsidy extension with reforms, organized a Monday evening meeting with a large, ideologically diverse group of senators to discuss what a Senate deal might look like.

HERE'S WHY HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE INCREASINGLY BUCKING LEADERSHIP BY FORCING VOTES ON UNAPPROVED BILLS

Leaving the meeting, senators conceded that reaching a deal before the end of the year would be difficult. Still, they described their conversations as a step in the right direction, following the Senate's failure last week to pass a Democratic-backed extension.

“It seems like the calendar precludes getting something done this week,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the author of a competing GOP bill that lets the subsidies lapse. “But still, a commitment to work together is a lot of progress.”

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the Trump administration's maneuvering on Venezuela and Colombia on ‘Special Report.'

After the U.S. seized a tanker carrying Venezuelan crude oil, the shadowy fleet of "ghost ships" used to evade sanctions drifted squarely into President Donald Trump's crosshairs.

On Dec. 10, Trump announced the seizure of the "Skipper," a vessel that secretly ferries oil in defiance of sanctions. 

The broader fleet, a clandestine armada of roughly 1,000 tankers, quietly navigates global sea routes to move oil from sanctioned countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.

The so-called "ghost ships" sail under foreign flags to obscure their origins, repeatedly change names, shift ownership through shell companies, disable transponders to evade tracking and conduct mid-sea transfers to mask their cargo.

The result is a labyrinthine system of handoffs and disguised voyages.

US–VENEZUELA SHOWDOWN MIGHT JOLT GAS PRICES IN THE LONG TERM

Benjamin Jensen, who heads the Futures Lab at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the challenge extends well beyond Venezuela.

"I do think it's time that the United States and other countries start to address what really is a global problem," explained Benjamin Jensen, director of the Futures Lab at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Jensen said the seizure sends a shock not just to Caracas, but to other actors as well. 

"What we don't know is how they're following that up behind the scenes," he said, adding that further seizures under Trump are possible.

With Venezuela's economy tethered almost entirely to oil revenue, he noted that even a single interdiction can have an outsized impact. 

"Anything you do that puts pressure on their ability to bypass sanctions and trade in oil is a direct threat to the economy and, by extension, the regime," he said. 

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signaled that the seizure of the "Skipper" is only the opening salvo in a new effort to cut off the oil revenues that keep Moscow, Tehran and Caracas afloat.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the vessel is "undergoing a forfeiture process."

"Right now, the United States currently has a full investigative team on the ground, on the vessel and individuals on board the vessel are being interviewed, and any relevant evidence is being seized," Leavitt said, adding that the U.S. will take hold of the oil after the legal process is completed.

The move comes as China continues to be the leading importer of Iranian oil and the second-largest buyer of Russian crude, much of it routed through a growing fleet of nondescript tankers evading U.S. sanctions.

Earlier this year, the 19-year-old crude oil tanker named "Eventin" was seized by German authorities after the ship suffered engine failure in the Baltic Sea. The vessel was previously identified as a ship that exports Russian crude oil and other petroleum products.

German authorities discovered that the Panama-flagged vessel, which was previously named Charvi and Storviken, was carrying 99,000 tons, or approximately $45 million worth, of Russian oil.

Former Trump economic advisor Steve Moore breaks down the impact of inflation and residual effects from the Biden administration on the American economy on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

President Donald Trump loves a good foil. For America's sake, he should find his next one in my home state of Illinois. 

Cook County — home of Chicago and most of the state's leftist lunacy — has taken the nation's furthest step toward a so-called universal basic income (UBI). Going forward, many low-income residents will permanently get monthly checks of $500. The goal is to help the poor stay on their feet, but in reality, the poor will stay poor and get more numerous. Not only should the president call out this injustice, but he should contrast it with his recent call to eliminate income taxes altogether. This may be Trump's greatest opportunity for moral and economic leadership yet. 

Make no mistake: A UBI is the left's next national priority. It's the epitome of their now-impenetrable belief that government alone should provide for people's needs. Democrats have laid the groundwork for UBI, as it's called, with refundable child tax credits during the pandemic and pilot programs across the country. The rise of artificial intelligence, with its threat of job losses, gives further momentum to leftists who say that government should give everyone enough money to get by. Even some on the right, like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have jumped aboard the UBI bandwagon.  

COOK COUNTY IN ILLINOIS ESTABLISHES PERMANENT GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM

But UBI, like so much of the welfare state, is a frontal assault on the human soul. It saps people's willingness to develop and apply their inherent talents, making poverty a permanent way of life. While activists and media outlets unfailingly call programs like Cook County's a "success," real-world evidence shows their moral, economic and individual failure.

The recent pilot programs in Democratic cities caused fewer people to work. So did the refundable child tax credit. When the federal government tested an early version of UBI in the 1970s, recipients lost $5 in lifetime earnings for every taxpayer dollar they received. 

Only one word can sum up UBI: evil. It's morally wrong to steal people's drive to make the most of their life. It's inhumane to replace the ladder of opportunity with a cot. At its core, UBI encourages people to tolerate an unhappy existence instead of finding fulfillment through striving, succeeding and contributing to society. 

But as Cook County shows, UBI has political momentum. The best way to beat such a bad idea is with a better idea. A transformative idea that not only highlights the injustice, but shows a real path forward. That's where Trump comes in, especially his idea to eliminate income taxes.

The president made this comment flippantly after a Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2, saying that income taxes won't be needed because of tariff revenue. But the real case for killing income taxes is that, like UBI, they also stifle work and limit its rewards. He could frame ending income taxes as giving every American the "universal right to earn," while directly contrasting it with a universal basic income.  

PROGRESSIVE CITIES GAMBLE WITH UNIVERSAL INCOME WHILE INFLATION THREAT LOOMS

Without income taxes, every American would keep every penny of what they earn, full stop. There's no greater spur to work, to innovate, to start a small business — to do all the things that move individuals and the entire nation forward. The universal right to earn would unleash a new era of growth and wealth creation, benefiting the least fortunate the most. Why? Because it taps into every person's innate desire to strive and rise. Contrast that with a universal income, which traps people in poverty.

Americans aren't used to hearing such bold vision or language from Republicans, but if any politician can make a strong case, it's Donald Trump. In fact, the president could go even further rhetorically, while still staying on firm moral grounds. At its core, taxing labor is a form of slavery, since it takes away the fruits of man's labor. The 13th Amendment banned slavery, but the 16th Amendment reinstated a sliver of it by allowing income taxes. Donald Trump could easily say: For America's 250th birthday, we should end this injustice once and for all and finally realize our national promise. 

I freely acknowledge that eliminating income taxes is a gargantuan political lift. The chances of success are miniscule. But the same was once true of a universal basic income. Now it's a fact of life in Cook County, and it will surely be Democrats' top priority the next time they control the White House and Congress. Someone has to provide an alternative vision — one that actually uplifts the poorest Americans, instead of shackling them in poverty forever. President Trump, the universal right to earn is in your hands.

            Retiring Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Monday her engagement to Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump pundit who works for the far-right news network Real America's Voice.
    


            “Happily ever after!!!” Greene posted on X. Glenn, who is chief White House correspondent for the MAGA-aligned network, also shared the engagement on social media with a photo of him embracing Greene while she shows off her engagement ring.
    


            The announcement comes weeks after Greene had a public falling out with President Donald Trump an dsaid she would resign from office in January, noting that she wanted to avoid a nasty primary. Trump has called her a “traitor” and said he'd support a GOP challenge to her House seat.
    


            Greene, who had been an ardent Trump supporter since arriving on Capitol Hill in 2021, now insists the president has been too focused on foreign policy in his second term and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home. She, along with fellow Republican Rep. Thomas Massie has been one of the most vocal critics of the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene will leave Congress after five turbulent years



            Glenn notably called out Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for not wearing a suit to the White House, at a contentious Oval Office event in February.
    


            Greene and Glenn met in 2022 and began publicly dating early the next year, after both had begun divorce proceedings for their first marriages, according to the Washington Post.
    


            The next steps in Greene's career remain unclear. CNN has previously reported that the Georgia congresswoman, who earlier this year had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state's high-stakes Senate race, currently has no known plans to run for office.

            A Secret Service official involved in the construction of President Donald Trump's massive new White House ballroom said Monday that any temporary pause on the project could hamper the agency's ability to carry out its protective mission.
    


            The warning – made in a sworn statement by USSS Deputy Director Matthew Quinn – comes a day before a federal judge in Washington, DC, is set hold an emergency hearing to consider whether to order the White House to pause work on the ballroom pending a lawsuit challenging how the project has unfolded thus far.
    


            Quinn, who oversees USSS' role in the ballroom project, said a contractor involved in the construction is still working to provide temporary security and safety measures around the site and that “any pause in construction, even temporarily, would leave the contractor's obligation unfulfilled … and consequently hamper the Secret Service's ability to meet its statutory obligations and protective mission.”
    


            The lawsuit filed last week by the nation's top historic preservation group claims Trump is pursuing the project unlawfully because he hasn't gotten approval from Congress or submitted his plans to the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts for review, which would give the public a chance to weigh in.
    


            The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, to issue a temporary restraining order that would pause any further work on the ballroom until Congress authorizes it, the commissions review it and environmental assessments are completed.
    


            In a separate sworn statement filed by the government in the case on Monday, an official with the National Park Service, which is a named defendant in the case, revealed that above-ground work on the ballroom would not begin until at least April and said that efforts were underway for the White House to coordinate with the pair of commissions.
    


            That official, John Stanwich, noted that the Commission on Fine Arts does not currently have a quorum but that “plans are underway to appoint new members” to it. The White House fired all six members of the commission in October, CNN previously reported, amid Trump's push to impose his style on the nation's capital through a slate of construction projects, including the ballroom.
    


            The declaration also confirms the White House plans to bring the project before the National Capital Planning Commission before vertical construction begins, as officials have previously said.
    


            The declaration from Stanwich, who is the NPS' liaison to the White House, gave the most thorough public accountings yet of the work that was undertaken before construction crews tore down the historic East Wing of the White House this fall, prompting outrage among Democrats and preservationists.
    


            Stanwich said that in August and September his staff worked with the White House to “identify and remove museum objects, including paintings and historic furniture, from the East Wing, East Colonnade, and the Ground Floor State Rooms of the White House to be stored or curated” off-site.
    


            Crews also worked to salvage “historic materials” from the East Wing before it was torn down, Stanwich said, which included “stone columns, doors, and other items that are planned to be reincorporated into the new facility.”
    


            Extensive documentation of the East Wing was undertaken pre-demolition, he told the court, through photography and the creation of a 3D scan of the building to create “a digital twin … for future preservation and interpretive purposes.”
    


            The massive project, Stanwich said, has caused a ripple effect across the White House's professional and historic spaces. Public-facing parts of the building that used to be stops on White House tours, including the famous China Room, are now being used as office spaces.
    


            “If progress on the project were halted, this would prolong these impacts to the experiences of Park visitors,” he told the court.

President Donald Trump has an "alcoholic's personality" and has engaged in legal "retribution" against his enemies since his return to office, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in a remarkably candid series of interviews with Vanity Fair published Tuesday.

Wiles said in March that she and Trump had a "loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over."

Around five months later, she initially denied that Trump was "on a retribution tour," contending that he was motivated by getting "people that have done bad things" out of the government.

But she admitted, "In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time."

And she said that the administration's attempted prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James — who helmed a business fraud case against Trump and was seen as one of his most reviled political foes — "might be the one retribution."

The case against James on mortgage fraud-related charges was dismissed in November, after a judge ruled Trump's pick of prosecutor was invalidly appointed. The Department of Justice has so far failed to convince subsequent grand juries to re-indict her.

Wiles' eyebrow-raising remarks came during 11 interviews with author Chris Whipple, conducted over the course of Trump's first year back in the White House. 

Wiles, who enjoys unparalleled influence and power in Trump's orbit, mostly operates behind the scenes. But in the conversations with Whipple, she offered blunt descriptions, and occasionally criticism, of many of the administration's highest-profile officials.

Those officials include Trump himself. 

Wiles — whose father, former New York Giants kicker Pat Summerall, is described as an alcoholic and an absentee parent — said her difficult upbringing made her "a little bit of an expert in big personalities."

Trump does not drink, but he has "an alcoholic's personality" in that he "operates [with] a view that there's nothing he can't do," Wiles told Whipple. "Nothing, zero, nothing." 

She also spoke about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering behind some of Trump's biggest agenda items, including his global "reciprocal" tariff policy.

The early April tariff rollout, which Trump touted as America's "Liberation Day," was the product of what Wiles described as a divided White House that could not agree on the policy's impact.

"So much thinking out loud is what I would call it," Wiles said in an interview at the time, recalling that she urged advisers who doubted the tariff plans to get on board, but "they couldn't get there." 

Wiles pushed back on Vanity Fair's reporting in an X post later Tuesday morning, calling it "a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history."

"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team," she wrote. 

She added that she has been "honored" to work for Trump for nearly a decade, and declared, "None of this will stop our relentless pursuit of Making America Great Again!"

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to CNBC, added that Wiles "has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history." 

"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her," Leavitt said.

Whipple also reported Wiles saying that Vice President JD Vance, once a Trump critic who became a leading figure of the MAGA movement, had "sort of political" motivations for changing his viewpoint. 

She said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the government-reform  guidebook known as Project 2025, was "a right-wing absolute zealot."

Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, "completely whiffed" on her early handling of government records related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Wiles said.

Trump said on the 2024 campaign trail that he would support declassifying files from the federal investigations of Epstein, a well-connected money manager who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. But the Trump administration later said it determined that no more disclosures were warranted, sparking outrage from many MAGA supporters.

Bondi, who in February gave binders with old information labeled "The Epstein Files: Phase 1" to a group of conservative influencers, failed to appreciate that those people were "the very targeted group that cared about this," Wiles said.

"First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk," Wiles said, adding, "There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk." 

As for Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief who briefly ran Trump's controversial government-slashing group known as DOGE, Wiles accused him of being "an avowed ketamine [user]" and "an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are."

She said that she "was initially aghast" when DOGE moved to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, which Musk has claimed was rife with fraud.

"I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work," she said.

"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon," Wiles said. "And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody."

Databricks is raising $4 billion in a funding round that would value the data analytics software company at $134 billion, the company announced Tuesday.

The valuation is a 34% jump from the funding round announced in August, which valued the company at $100 billion. At the time, Databricks became one of a handful of private companies to surpass a $100 billion valuation, after SpaceX, ByteDance and OpenAI.

Databricks said it plans to use the capital to support customer app building as artificial intelligence accelerates development. 

Tune in at 4:15 p.m. ET as Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joins CNBC TV to discuss the latest funding round and valuation. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream.

The company said it topped a $4.8 billion revenue run-rate during the third quarter and is growing 55% year-over-year. That figure is also up from the $4 billion revenue run-rate announced earlier this year.

Databricks is among a growing list of companies that have opted to stay private for longer as private markets offer more funding opportunities.

Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company and JPMorgan Asset Management led the round, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz.

Databricks was founded in 2013 in San Francisco and ranked third on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, one of the finalists for the Federal Reserve chair job, showed support Tuesday for central bank independence.

With President Donald Trump apparently in the final days of picking a successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, Hassett declined in a CNBC interview to directly address his own candidacy but said forging consensus is an important part of the job.

"The Federal Reserve's independence is really, really important, and the voices of the other people at the [Federal Open Market Committee], they're important, too," he said. "So the way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data."

Prior to last week, Hassett had been considered the leading contender for the job to take over for Powell, who is nearing the end of his second term as head of the central bank. However, Trump said last week that former Governor Kevin Warsh has come to the front of the pack as well, following an interview between the two last Wednesday.

There has been some pushback against Hassett in recent days. Sources told CNBC that the president's advisors worry that Hassett will be perceived as too close to Trump and will do his bidding rather than seek to set interest rates in line with the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.

However, Hassett said his relationship with Trump shouldn't be held against him.

"The idea that someone isn't qualified for the job because they are a close friend who's worked well with the president is something that I think the President rejects," he said.

Though he appointed Powell, Trump has been a constant critic of the Fed chief. 

Trump has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts, unsatisfied even as the FOMC has approved three consecutive cuts since September totaling three quarters of a percentage point. Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee who came on board in September, has voted against each of those reductions in favor of half-point cuts.

Hassett stressed the need for consensus building at the Fed. Trump has advocated that the Fed should consult the president when making rate decisions.

"The way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data," he said. "When you get things wrong, you explain why and fix it. So that's the way it moves forward. But the President is a seasoned observer of the economy, and if he has a good point, then I'm sure others will recognize it as such."

Hassett and Warsh were part of five finalists for the job. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the process, said Tuesday morning on Fox Business that the decision likely will come in early January.

LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky sees a lot of career advice on the site every day, but he doesn't always agree with every piece that's shared.

One common tip that Roslansky said is "a little bit outdated" is that "you have to have a five-year plan," he told content creator Erin McGoff in an interview for her YouTube channel AdviceWithErin. 

In Roslansky's view, having a five-year plan is "a little bit foolish," he said: given how rapidly technology and the workplace are changing, it's not realistic to "chart out what the next five years of your life are going to look like."

Instead, Roslansky advised workers to focus on what they want to learn and what experiences they want to have.

"I think that's the right mental model in this environment," he said. "If you focus on those shorter steps, gaining learning, gaining experience, a lot of your career path will open up for you."

According to Roslansky, having a linear career path isn't realistic anymore. 

Many people think "you graduate high school and then go to a certain college and then become a consultant and then get an MBA," he said – but "that's not how it happens at all for most people."

Once you let go of that idea, "you can take your own career into your own hands," he said. "No one is trying to figure this out for you. You have to take care of it yourself."

Roslansky also shared his best advice for young people navigating their careers right now.

His first tip is to "learn the tools" and experiment with using AI at work, he told McGoff.

"Try and figure out how to create a PowerPoint presentation out of chat," he said. "You know, figure out how this can help you with a better marketing message."

"Whether or not you like it, whether or not it's a good fit for what you're trying to do, that mental model – like, 'I'm going to use this tool and learn it to help me do something' – I think is the most important thing," he continued.

Still, "it's not just about the tools and technology," Roslansky said: skills like empathy, judgment and communication are still "critical" in the modern workplace.

"In a world where everyone is kind of, you know, focused more on the technology, if you really work on a lot of those human skills, it can be a great differentiator for you," he said.

Kevin Hassett has reclaimed the lead in prediction markets betting on who President Donald Trump will nominate as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, after briefly losing ground to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

On Kalshi, traders on Tuesday assigned Hassett a roughly 53% chance of securing the nomination, up from about 39% earlier in the day following reports of internal pushback from figures close to Trump. Warsh's implied probability fell to about 33% from 46% earlier Tuesday.

The shift seemingly occurred after Hassett showed support for central bank independence on CNBC and said forging consensus is an important part of the job.

"The Federal Reserve's independence is really, really important, and the voices of the other people at the [Federal Open Market Committee], they're important, too," he said. "So the way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data."

Hassett's odds took a dip earlier after fresh pushback from high-level figures with direct access to the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Those advisers have raised concerns that Hassett, currently director of the National Economic Council, is seen as too close to Trump. 

Warsh, a former Fed governor who served from 2006 to 2011, has long been viewed as a credible pick for Republicans. Hassett has been a fixture of Trump's economic team across both terms, a proximity that some advisers now fear could undermine the Fed's institutional standing.

The race for Fed chief opened up after Trump injected new ambiguity into the race late last week. After previously telling reporters he already knew whom he would choose as Fed chair, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that Warsh had risen to the top tier of contenders.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Investors and economic policymakers alike are counting down to this morning's delayed nonfarm payroll report, due out at 8:30 a.m. ET. The data comes less than a week after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and as the race to lead the central bank takes another turn.

Here's what to know:

Ford's shift away from all-electric vehicles is costing it $19.5 billion in special items, the automaker said yesterday. Shares rose nearly 2% in extended trading.

The charges, most of which Ford expects in the fourth quarter, are related to Ford's new focus on hybrid vehicles and its decision to cancel a generation of all-electric trucks in favor of smaller and more affordable EVs. As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, the move comes as the broader EV industry grapples with a sales slump following the end of federal tax credits for EV buyers in September.

Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" yesterday that the carmaker is "following customers to where the market is." For high-end EVs in particular, Farley said that they "just weren't selling."

Revenue from the new tariffs imposed by Trump this year has surpassed $200 billion, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said yesterday.

Trump's broad and steep duties have reshaped global trade this year, but their fate hangs in the balance as the Supreme Court weighs their legality. If the court rules against the White House, it could require refunds for companies that have already paid the tariffs.

Despite the milestone, tariff revenue recently pulled back. Collections fell to $30.75 billion in November from above $31 billion in the prior month — the first decline since Trump announced his sweeping new tariffs in April.

Consumers are still feeling doom and gloom about the economy. But as CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Melissa Repko report, that isn't stopping them from spending.

Even as a key consumer sentiment gauge sits near record lows, data shows that the highest number of Americans shopped in the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday in at least nine years. Retailers ranging from Costco to Best Buy have also said they've had positive starts to the all-important holiday shopping period.

There are still signs that the economic outlook is weighing on consumption habits. Namely, strength in value-oriented retailers like Walmart and T.J. Maxx signal shoppers' increased attention to prices.

A decade ago, robotaxis were still being written off as the work of science fiction. Today, these driverless cars have become commonplace across America, from the Las Vegas Strip to school drop-off lines in Phoenix.

Alphabet-owned Waymo – the industry leader – is now operating, testing or planning to launch service in 26 markets around the world. Meanwhile, Amazon-owned Zoox and Tesla launched the first iterations of their services this year. Tesla shares surged to a new 2025 high yesterday after CEO Elon Musk confirmed that driverless robotaxi tests were happening in Austin.

There are still obstacles on the road to becoming more mainstream, whether it's complaints around noise and congestion, consumer concerns about safety or higher prices than traditional rideshare platforms.

Baron Capital founder Ron Baron joined CNBC's "ETF Edge" yesterday to discuss his firm's new exchange-traded funds and SpaceX investment.

— CNBC's Sean Conlon, Sarah Min, John Melloy, Steve Liesman, Michael Wayland, Lori Ann LaRocco, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Lora Kolodny, Jennifer Elias, Annie Palmer and Yun Li contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

In its push to create an "AI-first" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.

The social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.

One of the company's priorities is to "make AI core to how we work," Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention "Llama" — alongside products from other firms.

In November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: "It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work."

The social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.

Among those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees "work smarter and have more impact," Banerjea told employees in the June memo.

Meta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.

After Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for "concept and production uses" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.

Gemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to "unlock AI-driven capabilities" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.

On the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. "Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences," Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.

To encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called "Level Up," which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove "AI-driven impact" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.

Kraft Heinz on Tuesday announced that former Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane will lead the company ahead of its planned split next year.

Cahillane will join the Oscar Mayer owner as chief executive on Jan. 1. After Kraft Heinz divides into two publicly traded companies, he will serve as CEO of the business it is temporarily calling Global Taste Elevation, which will include high-growth brands like Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac & Cheese.

"These are phenomenal brands that need to be contemporized, shown a little bit of love and brought back to growth," Cahillane said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street," comparing the opportunity with Kraft Heinz with the one he tackled at Kellogg.

Cahillane previously led Kellogg through its own breakup in 2023. The company split its sluggish North American cereal business from its high-growth snacking unit, which was then renamed Kellanova. Cahillane stayed on as chief executive of Kellanova until Mars acquired the company for $35.9 billion.

Outgoing Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera was originally tapped to lead the other company known as North American Grocery. However, he will now serve as an advisor through March 6. Abrams-Rivera has been chief executive of the food giant since 2024.

The Kraft Heinz board will initiate a search for a chief executive to lead the portfolio of grocery staples, which includes brands like Oscar Mayer and Kraft Singles.

As part of the transition, John Cahill, who served as CEO of Kraft during its merger with Heinz a decade ago, will succeed Miguel Patricio as chair of the board.

Kraft Heinz is projecting that the separation will happen in the second half of 2026. The company announced the breakup plans in September, following years of sluggish sales despite turnaround efforts. The split reverses much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world.

Kraft Heinz shares rose 1% in morning trading. The stock has fallen about 20% this year.

Andre Lewis said he's "anxious 364 days of the year." Yet the rideshare and delivery driver wants to make it a special holiday season for his 7-year-old daughter.

"I told myself I'd keep it modest," said the 31-year-old, who lives in New York City. But he said his daughter wants a pink keyboard that lights up, and he'll buy it for her — "even if it's a little over budget."

"Christmas is the one day I let myself stop worrying," he said. 

For many U.S. consumers like Lewis, economic worries have cast a cloud over an otherwise cheery season. Consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than three years in early November, close to its all-time low, according to University of Michigan's monthly survey. The metric posted a slight uptick in December.

Yet so far, that downbeat backdrop hasn't stopped shopping this year or dragged down the typical kickoff of the holiday season. That apparent contrast has left investors and economists wondering whether — and when — jitters over high costs of living, increased tariffs and a tepid job market will start to emerge more in spending data. 

Across the country, nearly 203 million U.S. shoppers hit retailers' stores and websites during the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday — the highest turnout in at least nine years, according to the National Retail Federation, which surveys shoppers to calculate the annual estimate.

Big-box and club retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy and Costco, topped Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations, and executives said they saw an encouraging start to the crucial shopping season. Meanwhile, discretionary retailers like Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle also exceeded quarterly estimates, and company leaders said consumer demand has been steady. 

"I know everybody's looking for cracks in consumer health," Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC in late November. "It feels pretty consistent to us."

Some executives also said lower-income consumers, who have felt economic pressures most acutely over the last year, have kept spending.

"The headline is that we feel very good about the lower-income customer," Burlington Stores CEO Michael O'Sullivan said when the company quarterly results last month. "This customer has been very resilient. When we look at our stores in lower-income trade areas, they continue to outperform the chain."

Some key dynamics have supported U.S. consumer spending, even as concerns about an AI investment bubble and layoffs by companies including Verizon and Target cloud the 2026 economic outlook. Unemployment numbers are still relatively low, though the labor market has slowed. While the U.S. added more jobs than expected in November, the unemployment rate hit the highest level in four years, according to delayed government data released Tuesday. Separate ADP figures showed the private sector unexpectedly lost jobs in November. 

Higher-income consumers, in particular, have propped up retail sales as they benefit from rising home values and stock market gains. And holiday spending, in particular, tends to be insulated since families across incomes prioritize the season, even if that means sacrificing other kinds of spending or racking up the credit card bill. 

Marcus Feldman, a biotech project manager from Cambridge, Mass., said he will spend about 15% more this year on the holidays. He and his wife plan to take their 9- and 12-year-old sons on a skiing trip, and splurge on nicer gifts.

"It's partly because we can and partly because life's short and the boys are only little once," he said.

And, he added, he's noticed others spending freely.

"Every headline says people are scared to spend," he said. "Then I walk down [one of Boston's major shopping streets] Newbury Street on a Saturday and it's shoulder-to-shoulder."

On a call with reporters in early December, National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay said "there's a bit of a moat" around holiday spending, a time when emotions fuel demand.

"One of the key drivers here is that for many Americans and many families, holiday spending and holiday shopping is an essential part of the budget," he said on the call.

Plus, as interest rates remain high, consumers have put off some of the priciest purchases they typically make, such as new houses and cars. That's freed up money for spending on goods, said Naveen Jaggi, who leads retail transaction and advisory services at commercial real estate services firm JLL.

Still, warning signs loom over the economy. Nearly every retailer has said consumers continue to be selective about spending and are looking for deals to stretch dollars. Shoppers' hunt for deep discounts fueled strong turnout and growth during the sales days known for promotions, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. 

Some of the retail spending growth has come from price hikes, which have persisted even as the rate of inflation eases.

After being hit by higher prices for groceries, electricity and housing, consumers are seizing upon sales to get ahead of further price increases.

Eugenio Aleman, chief economist for equity research firm Raymond James, attributes lower consumer sentiment to price hikes. He said that's accelerated some purchases because shoppers worry prices will keep going up.

"Even though they feel bad, they say, 'Okay, I have to do whatever it takes to buy now,'" he said. 

The contrast between spending data and consumer sentiment captures a head-scratching gap between what consumers are saying and what they are doing.

That divergence dates back to 2021, soon after the Covid pandemic, when surveys of consumer spending intentions became less predictive of their behavior, said Ali Furman, the U.S. consumer markets industry leader for consulting firm PwC.

In particular, she said PwC has seen higher-income households and those on the East and West Coasts more likely to keep spending, even as they report a low sentiment.

That gap influenced PwC's own holiday forecast. Its consumer survey during late June and early July indicated that holiday shoppers planned to pull back on purchases from last year, with Gen Z consumers especially slashing their budgets.

Based on that survey, PwC projected that consumers' average spending on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment would decline 5% from the year-ago period.

Yet in late October, it surveyed consumers again and reversed its projections. PwC now expects consumers across age groups will spend 3% to 4% more on the holidays year over year. 

Furman said consumers may have felt a little better in the fall, as some worries about higher tariffs faded and they saw retailers' holiday merchandise start to hit the shelves. 

The durability of consumer spending has even surprised the National Retail Federation, the industry's major trade group. For the vast majority of months this year, retail sales have climbed nearly or more than 4% year over year, according to U.S. Census Bureau retail figures. 

That's higher than the 2.7% to 3.7% annual year-over-year growth that the trade group predicted.

It's not just consumers: Businesses have shown caution about their spending. Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to be the lowest in at least 15 years, according to the NRF, as companies try to manage higher costs from tariffs.

Retailers have also stressed the unpredictability of consumer behavior, even when posting otherwise strong results.

Macy's, for example, earlier this month reported its strongest growth in more than three years as it made progress on its turnaround strategy. Still, it disappointed Wall Street with a cautious forecast for the holiday quarter. CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the "customer is hanging in there," but is still spending selectively. 

Costco CFO Gary Millerchip said the warehouse club, which has benefitted from consumers seeking value, has seen "bumpy" trends that have muddied a consistent pattern of consumers spending more and seeking value, quality and new items.

"When you look at month by month, there's definitely been some lumpiness in the individual monthly sales results that we've posted," he said on an earnings call on Thursday.  

The buzzwords retail executives have used in public comments underscore how confusing the consumer backdrop has become. CEOs in recent years have repeatedly called shoppers "choiceful" about their spending.

Yet retailers have also started to describe consumers as "resilient." In the most recent round of earnings calls, leaders from Macy's, Burlington Stores, Tapestry, Abercrombie & Fitch and Ralph Lauren all used the word to describe their customers.

At some companies, it's unclear if healthy results have come from individual execution or a strong economy. The retail industry has been more starkly divided between winners and losers over the last year, and those that are executing well have won the dollars of selective shoppers.

For example, Gap's Old Navy, which primarily caters to low- and middle-income shoppers, had an "incredibly strong" third quarter, CEO Richard Dickson said. The apparel brand's comparable sales rose 6%, far better than the 3.8% increase analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. 

Dickson said shoppers responded to value across all income groups, as the brand saw "consistency and strength in our customer behavior." Still, Gap has been in the midst of a major turnaround and only started posting stronger results after Dickson took over. 

Even as U.S. consumers have shown resilience, there have also been clues that they're making tradeoffs and trying to get more for their money. 

Value-oriented retailers including Walmart and Dollar General have attracted more high-income shoppers. Off-price chains like TJX-owned T.J. Maxx and mall names like Gap have also drawn in wealthier shoppers who are looking for home decor and clothing. 

Luc Wathieu, a professor of marketing at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, said the disconnect between sentiment and spending is a "paradox," but added shoppers and retailers have left behind a trail of breadcrumbs to explain it. He said holiday season has gotten off to a strong start because people are shopping early around events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday to save money. 

Retailers have been able to meet that demand and keep offering deals because of the extra inventory they bought earlier this year to avoid tariffs. Many experts expect companies to sell through those items by the end of the year. 

For those reasons, "we should see a very good beginning of the season" but "a pretty bad end of the season," said Wathieu, the research director of the NRF Business of Retail Initiative at Georgetown.

Consumers also feel like they don't have control over what's happening around them during an indulgent season, which is fueling spending despite their negative outlook, Wathieu said.

"It's a little bit like dancing on the Titanic before it collapses, right?" he said. "We don't know what's going to happen. We might as well live our life in the meantime."

Plus, industry growth so far this season may be more related to inflation than actual strong demand, said Omair Tariq, the founder and CEO of Cart.com, which provides logistics, fulfillment and other services for retailers including Eddie Bauer, Adidas and Guess. 

Tariq told CNBC more than half of Cart's customers confirmed they were raising prices this year, and those companies' volumes fell after the hikes took effect.

"Conversion dropped, order volume dropped," Tariq said. "What we saw was that even during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, while there was obviously some growth, it was in in the low single digits."

In Salesforce's Cyber Week results, the company found the average selling price over the Thanksgiving selling weekend was up 6% compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, volumes only grew 2% globally and 1% in the U.S. 

Lewis, the rideshare and delivery driver, shopped at Brookfield Place in downtown Manhattan last week. Income is up and down with his job, he said, but a wave of holiday visitors to New York has boosted business for now. He bought a pair of Nike shoes for his daughter while at the mall.

Yet to make sure he has enough for her, he's trimmed back in other ways. He's put off shoe purchases for himself, postponed a phone upgrade and hasn't taken a trip in over a year.

"I want her to feel like the world is full of possibility," he said.

Some of Europe's biggest military contractors urged investors not to cash out of the sector on Tuesday, as stocks sold off on hopes of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner joined peace talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin over the weekend. Zelenskyy said during the talks that Kyiv was willing to give up its NATO membership ambitions in order to secure a deal to end the war.

American officials then told reporters a peace deal was close to completion, while U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiators were "closer now than we have been ever" to stopping the conflict. Talks are expected to continue into the weekend. 

European defense stocks sold off on Tuesday as investors weighed the news, with some big names extending losses from the previous day. The regional Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index lost 1.8%, with Swedish fighter jet maker Saab leading losses on a 4.8% fall. Italy's Leonardo, finishing down 3.9%, and Germany's Rheinmetall, ending 4.5% lower, were also among those seeing the biggest declines. 

A spokesperson for German defense prime Hensoldt said the company hopes for "a just and lasting peace for Ukraine," but added that, even if this is achieved, Europe remains under threat of attack. 

"A cessation of hostilities would give Russia the opportunity to reconstitute its military capabilities. From a European security perspective, the underlying threat remains and could even intensify," they said.

"Against this backdrop, defense readiness continues to be a structural necessity for Europe," they added.

Hensoldt's representative said the company's business exposure to Ukraine is limited, accounting for a single-digit percentage of revenues. The company's stock, which has more than doubled in value this year, finished 3.6% lower on Tuesday.

"Our growth trajectory is primarily driven by large, long-term programs in Germany and across Europe," the spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday morning, pointing to a three-digit-million-euro contract to equip the German armed forces' reconnaissance vehicles with software and advanced sensors, and projects under the European Sky Shield Initiative.

Many of the firm's contracts will continue "in 2026 and beyond," they added. 

A representative for German vehicle systems manufacturer Renk – a contractor to more than 70 armies across the globe – acknowledged "an elevated level of volatility" in European defense stocks "anytime there is news surrounding a potential peace deal or ceasefire in Ukraine." 

They added: "While we would very much welcome peace in Ukraine for the Ukrainian people, we see the threat scenario in Europe and globally unchanged and highest since the end of the Cold War."

Renk's share price, which has gained around 194% year-to-date, ended the day 4.3% lower. 

"Downward movements of the share prices are strongly driven by market sentiment rather than by clear impacts on the business outlook of Renk and other defense peers," the company's spokesperson added on Tuesday morning.

"European NATO members have committed to the 3.5% [spending] target until 2035, leading to a structural long-term growth environment in military budgets," they said.

Europe's defense sector has seen a meteoric rise this year, amid the Ukraine war and commitments from regional governments and the NATO military alliance to ramp up defense spending. 

The pledges are widely expected to boost European firms' bottom lines, with regionally headquartered companies already reporting record order backlogs and huge upswings in income. 

Since the start of the year, the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index has surged more than 50%, with some regional defense players more than doubling in value.

Hensoldt and Renk's view that Russia will continue to pose a threat to the continent is shared by regional officials.

"We are Russia's next target, and we are already in harm's way," NATO Chief Mark Rutte said in a speech last week, while Blaise Metreweli – the head of the U.K.'s Secret Intelligence Service – warned in a speech on Monday that the region is facing "the menace of an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia."

Christopher Granville, managing director of TS Lombard, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Tuesday that, while the "end game phase" of the war appears to be underway, money markets may be mispricing this.

"The markets are pricing that in the form of a peace dividend," he added. "That can be seen in the retracement of the share prices of European defense companies, which have handily outperformed for the last two to three years and have pulled back – in our view, that looks like a buying opportunity, because there will be no peace dividend."

Granville argued that this is because Russia's relationship with Europe has shifted. 

"The outcome of the war will be that Russian military power has secured an unreversed territorial change in Europe, and that will be a huge incentive to improve European defense industrial capacity, and continue arms procurement," he added.

He added that a "non-peace dividend" would be reflected in lower risk premiums, because, even with the war over, "you still get the spending on defense industrial capacity."

Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, called the market reaction to a potential peace deal "overdone."

"The Ukraine war has been a significant driver of the European defense sector, but what the market is overlooking now is that the Ukraine war set about a series of structural drivers to the sector, drivers that remain in place even if a peace agreement is reached," he told CNBC. 

"An increase in NATO spending targets has been agreed by participating members and will not be unwound. Similarly the restocking story remains intact. It will likely take nations like Germany a decade at least to restock weaponry supplied to Ukraine. Both of these conditions will be highly supportive of the European defense sector for the medium term, into the longer term, supporting share price valuations," he added.

Claire Titmarsh, a defense equity analyst at U.K. wealth management firm Rathbones, told CNBC: "It seems unlikely the risk of aggression will be fully eliminated."

"What's more is that predicted increases in European defense spending are not solely driven by the Ukraine war. Deep-rooted structural factors persist: long-standing underinvestment, the ongoing strategic challenge from Russia – even after a Ukraine settlement – and the imperative for European strategic autonomy amid signals that the U.S. will reduce its role in underwriting European defense," she said by email on Tuesday.

She also questioned how stable any peace settlement would actually be. 

"Whether Russia will honor any peace agreement remains highly uncertain," Titmarsh added. "History suggests caution and President Putin's behavior is notoriously unpredictable."

A shortage of memory chips fueled by artificial intelligence players is likely to cause a price rise in smartphones in 2026 and a drop in shipments, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Tuesday.

Smartphone shipments could fall 2.1% in 2026, according to Counterpoint, versus a previous outlook of flat-to-positive growth.

Shipments do not equate to sales but are a measure of demand as they track the number of devices being sent to sales channels like stores. 

Meanwhile, the average selling price of smartphones could jump 6.9% year-on-year in 2026, Counterpoint said, in comparison to a previous forecast of a 3.6% rise.

This is being driven by specific chip shortages and bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain, which are pushing up component prices.

The continued build-out of data centres globally has hiked demand for systems developed by Nvidia, which in turn uses components designed by SK Hynix and Samsung — the two biggest suppliers of so-called memory chips. 

However, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, is also critical for smartphones. DRAM prices have surged this year as demand outstrips supply. 

For low-end smartphones priced below $200, the bill of materials cost has increased 20% to 30% since the beginning of the year, Counterpoint said. The bill of materials is the cost of producing a single smartphone. 

The mid and high-end smartphone segment has seen material costs rise 10% to 15%. 

"Memory prices could rise another 40% through Q2 2026, resulting in BoM costs increasing anywhere between 8% and over 15% above current elevated levels," Counterpoint said. 

The rising price of components could be passed on to consumers and that will in turn, drive the rise in the average selling price.

"Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters," MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint, said in the note. "But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins."

Hwang said this will "play out especially" with Chinese smartphone makers who are in the mid-to-lower end of the market. 

Counterpoint said some companies may downgrade components like camera modules, displays and even audio, as well as reusing old components. Smartphone players are likely to try to incentivize consumers to buy their higher-priced devices too.

Business Insider Edition 

South Sudan has grounded four aircraft linked to United Nations operations, citing security risks and suspected involvement in smuggling, in a move that has raised fresh concerns over aviation safety and relations with international partners.


        South Sudan's government has grounded four aircraft contracted to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), accusing them of operating with undisclosed surveillance equipment and engaging in the smuggling of natural resources, a move that has heightened tensions between Juba and the UN peacekeeping mission.



        The decision was announced after a government investigation into the aircraft's operations, with officials describing the findings as a serious breach of national aviation and security regulations. 
    


        The planes have been barred from further flights pending the outcome of the probe, although other UNMISS air operations continue uninterrupted.
    


        Addressing heads of foreign missions in Juba, Foreign Minister Monday Semaya Kumba said authorities had uncovered evidence that two of the aircraft were fitted with reconnaissance and surveillance systems that had not been declared to the government. 
    


        He said the equipment went beyond what had been approved under existing aviation agreements, raising concerns about sovereignty and national security.
    


        The foreign minister added that two other aircraft are suspected of being used to smuggle sandalwood, a high-value natural resource, between South Sudan and neighbouring Sudan. Kumba said investigators have “preliminary evidence” supporting the claim, though further verification is ongoing.
    


        The aircraft were identified as UNO-570P and UNO-571P for the alleged undisclosed equipment, and UNO-535P and UNO-536P for alleged cross-border smuggling.
    


        South Sudanese officials have stressed that the allegations target the operators of the aircraft rather than UNMISS itself. 
    


        According to the government, the planes are run by private contractors under UN agreements, and the issue revolves around non-disclosure and alleged misuse of aviation assets.



        Authorities said a special investigation committee has submitted its findings to relevant agencies, and appropriate action will follow. Juba reassured international partners that the move does not signal a rejection of peacekeeping operations.
    


        UNMISS, established in 2011 to protect civilians and support peace in the country, said it was unaware of the specific equipment or activities cited by the government. The mission maintains that it operates within its mandate and coordinates with national authorities.
    


        The UN has faced repeated criticism in Africa for inadvertently fueling insecurity. In the DRC and Central African Republic, peacekeepers' failures to prevent violence and misconduct, including sexual abuse, undermined stability. 
    


        In South Sudan, Mali, and the Sahel, operations have sometimes disrupted political dynamics or provoked armed groups. Allegations of trafficking, abuse, and corruption by UN personnel have further eroded public trust, highlighting the challenges of large-scale peacekeeping in fragile states.
    


        The grounding occurs amid ongoing internal security challenges, humanitarian pressures, and strained international relations. 
    


        Analysts say the incident reflects growing scrutiny over foreign aviation operations and the limits of international missions in sovereign states.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) has completed the world's first on-chain disbursement of universal basic income (UBI) using a digitally native sovereign bond, USDM1, via the Stellar blockchain.

Developed in partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) and infrastructure provider Crossmint, the multimillion-dollar initiative is part of RMI's national UBI program, known locally as ENRA, the Marshalls Islands' Finance Ministry confirmed. The program replaces quarterly physical cash deliveries with direct digital transfers to eligible citizens, many of whom live across widely dispersed islands.

USDM1 is a U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bond fully backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The bond is distributed through the Stellar Disbursement Platform into a custom-built digital wallet app called Lomalo. Developed by Crossmint, Lomalo allows recipients to receive funds instantly via Crossmint wallets on the Stellar network.

In an exclusive statement to CoinDesk, a Finance Ministry spokesperson said, “USDM1 is issued under New York law using a time-tested Brady-bond structure that has underpinned sovereign finance for decades. Its foundation is not regulatory discretion or policy preference, but settled law.”

“U.S. Treasury collateral is held by an independent trustee, outside the control of any government or private issuer, and redemption rights are fixed, unconditional, and legally enforceable,” the spokesperson added.

SDF CEO Denelle Dixon said the program exemplifies “what adoption looks like for blockchain technology,” enabling everyday financial access where it was previously lacking.

The government emphasized that USDM1 does not compromise the country's monetary or technological sovereignty. “ENRA is a fiscal distribution program, not a currency initiative,” the spokesperson said. “Every unit is issued one-to-one against short-dated U.S. Treasuries held in trust, fully backed and legally segregated at all times.”

The rollout, years in the making, was shaped by the Marshall Islands' geography and infrastructure constraints. “Distance, dispersion, and limited physical infrastructure shape the realities of daily life,” the spokesperson said. “This was purpose built for the Marshall Islands.”

A white paper released alongside the initiative outlines the broader policy and financial framework for USDM1.

American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC) acquired another 54 bitcoin during Monday's sharp selloff, bringing its total stack to 5,098 coins worth just less than $450 million based on BTC's current price of $87,600.



That places the company, co-founded by Eric Trump, who serves as its chief strategy officer, in the top 20 of publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firms, according to bitcointreasuries.net. The Nasdaq listed firm said its accumulated holdings were acquired through a combination of self mining and targeted purchases, including bitcoin held in custody or pledged under a miner purchase agreement with Bitmain.The company also highlighted a 96.5% bitcoin yield since its Nasdaq debut, alongside 533 satoshis per share as of Dec. 14. Bitcoin yield tracks the percentage change in satoshis per share over time. While satoshis per share measures the amount of bitcoin attributable to each outstanding share.Despite bitcoin's gains on Tuesday, ABTC is down another 2.7% Tuesday, continuing to reel after an unexpected stock lock-up expiration two weeks ago. Shares are down nearly 60% since.

Crypto pundit Chain Cartel has raised several key points following SWIFT's latest comment on its move to adopt blockchain technology. The pundit claimed that Ripple's XRPL network best suits what SWIFT is trying to achieve and suggested that the two firms collaborate. 

In an X post, Chain Cartel stated that SWIFT admitted they are building Ripple's XRPL network, but did not explicitly say so in their announcement. The pundit was referring to an X post from SWIFT highlighting their earlier announcement to add a blockchain-based ledger to their infrastructure.

The pundit explained that SWIFT's language in the X post suggests that they want to build something like Ripple's XRPL. He declared that it is not Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any generic blockchain experiment but precisely what Ripple has been building for a decade. Chain Cartel noted that Ripple's model has always been a neutral settlement layer, real-time atomic finality, shared ledger visibility for institutions, interoperability with legacy rails, and liquidity-first design. 

Chain Cartel then alluded to SWIFT's statement about its plans to build a blockchain-based ledger to be included in its payment infrastructure and provide a single source of truth, enabling instant, 24/7 cross-border payments. He declared that this is Ripple's blueprints with the XRPL, as the crypto firm uses the network for its payment services. 

In line with this, the pundit remarked that SWIFT doesn't replace rails, but instead coordinates them, and that Ripple doesn't replace banks, but instead connects them. He added that SWIFT is acknowledging that the future payment stack requires a ledger layer, not just messaging, and that the only model already battle-tested at scale is Ripple's XRPL.

However, it is worth mentioning that SWIFT doesn't plan to integrate Ripple's Ledger. Instead, it is building this blockchain-based ledger in partnership with Consensys and Chainlink. As such, although SWIFT may plan to build a network similar to Ripple's XRPL, it intends to do so without assistance from the crypto firm. 

Ripple is looking to expand its payment service, as it recently announced plans to begin testing its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum layer-2 networks Base, Ink, Optimism, and Unichain. The move comes just days after the OCC granted Ripple a conditional approval to become a bank, which is also a major boost for the firm's payment service. 

Ripple plans to expand its RLUSD stablecoin beyond the Ethereum and XRPL networks to these layer-2 networks through its partnership with Wormhole. The firm noted that the future of crypto is multichain, which is why it is adopting this strategy. This move gives Ripple's clients greater options when using the RLUSD stablecoin, and it could also attract new users to the stablecoin, which is currently one of the fastest-growing stablecoins.

Ethereum's price action has weakened further over the past 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency falling below $3,000 and shedding about 6.8% in the last 24 hours alone. 

The immediate price action points to reclaiming this $3,000 support, but a longer-term technical view suggests the current decline may be part of a much larger and more defined price framework. A macro analysis shared by crypto analyst Dona examines Ethereum's behavior over the past two years with a structured range that suggests that the cryptocurrency might bottom at $2,187.

Ethereum's Two-Year Range Still Defines The Bigger Picture

According to the analysis, Ethereum has largely traded within a broad horizontal range for close to two years, aside from two notable fakeouts: one below resistance in the first half of 2025 and one above resistance in the second half of the year, which led to a new price high of $4,946 in August. On the weekly timeframe, price has repeatedly respected an upper boundary around $4,000 to $4,100, while finding consistent demand near the lower range support just above $2,100.

This price action has resulted in a structure that resembles an inverse head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale. Instead of signaling immediate upside, however, the formation shows how price has oscillated between these defined trendlines, with mid-range reactions often determining whether Ethereum pushes to resistance or slips back toward support. 

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading within the mid-range of the two-year range. Based on this context, the recent bearish move can be viewed less as a breakdown and more as a rotation towards the lower trendline within the same long-standing range.

Why $2,187 Stands Out As A Critical Downside Target

The chart accompanying the analysis places particular emphasis on the lower boundary of the range near $2,187. This level has repeatedly acted as a bounce floor during prior downtrends in 2024 and another one in July 2025.

If Ethereum continues to trade below the mid-range support currently around $3,000, then the price could follow a familiar range rotation path toward this lower boundary. This move will see Ethereum fall to as low as $2,187. 

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,928, and is still a 25% decline away from $2,187. Although this would be tragic for bullish traders, such a move would not necessarily invalidate the broader structure. Instead, it will complete another cycle within the range, similar to previous declines that eventually transitioned into a bounce for a rally phase.

One of the more notable aspects of the outlook from Dona is the expectation for subdued activity in the near term. Aside from range-bound trades, taking directional positions may be less attractive as liquidity thins into the end of the year. From this perspective, the next major move is more likely to arrive in January 2026.

Cryptocurrencies stabilized after Monday's sharp selloff, with bitcoin BTC$85,944.78 bouncing above $87,000 in the early U.S. session on Tuesday.

The largest crypto climbed about 3% from overnight lows, while ether ETH$2,921.02 was underperforming, ahead just 1.4%. Altcoin majors including BNB BNB$867.23, XRP$1.8818, SUI$1.4998 showed relative strength, gaining 3% to 6% overnight.

Crypto-related equities also rebounded after Monday's panicky action. Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) and brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) were 3%-4% higher, while Circle (CRCL), issuer of the $78 billion USDC stablecoin, jumped 9%.

In a rare occurrence, crypto is outperforming U.S. equities, which are modestly lower across the board on Tuesday, the S&P 500 down 0.5% and Nasdaq off 0.3%.

In the news were delayed U.S. employment reports, with November data showing a troubling jump in the unemployment rate to a four-year high of 4.6%. For the moment, the weakness isn't flowing though to trader expectations for a January Fed rate cut, which remain muted at just a 24% chance.

Tuesday's early action could offer some hope that bitcoin's slide from last week's high above $94,000 has been arrested in the short-term, but at least one analyst sees BTC making new lows soon.

Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at broker XS.com, said that BTC's bounce from the November low of $80,000 to early December was a "corrective high," with the next leg down likely making a fresh low below $80,000.

In a Tuesday market note, he described the current environment as "fragile," with derivatives markets underscoring the caution. Then past two days saw $750 million in long liquidations, including $250 million tied to bitcoin futures, he noted.

"Traders are either stepping aside ahead of the data or being forced out, reinforcing downside momentum," Hasn said. "Without a positive macro catalyst to reset sentiment, bitcoin remains exposed to a deeper flush, with sub-80,000 levels increasingly part of the near-term conversation rather than a tail risk."



"The market now faces a short-term battle between the delay in monetary easing and the long-term attractiveness of BTC as a store of value," said David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21shares. "Immediate selling pressure may emerge as traders re-evaluate the risk landscape, forcing BTC to defend key support zones," he continued. "Yet, the underlying economic tension reinforces the bullish argument for smart money accumulation: where the Fed struggles to tame inflation without crashing the economy, bitcoin's finite supply becomes an essential asset."

                            Cathie Wood remains bullish on Ethereum and Bitcoin.                         

ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood made a fresh multi-million dollar bet on Tom Lee-linked Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies on Monday, even as the broader crypto market continued to slide.

The purchase came as Wood reiterated that Bitcoin remains her top-ranked cryptocurrency alongside Ethereum and Solana.

Ark Invest purchased  550,404 shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies across its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF exchange-traded funds, according to daily trade disclosures.

The buying followed an 11.2% decline in Bitmine shares on Monday, which closed at $30.95, valuing Ark's purchase at roughly $17 million.

At the stock's $30.95 closing price, the purchase would have cost approximately $17 million.

Bitmine, associated with Fundstrat co-founder Lee, has positioned itself as an Ethereum-focused treasury company and has been aggressively accumulating ether on a near-weekly basis.

Ark also increased exposure to other crypto-related firms, purchasing 64,946 shares of Coinbase, 143,579 shares of Circle Internet Group, and 122,360 shares of Bullish. All three stocks posted losses during the session.

Despite expanding exposure to Ethereum-linked strategies, Wood said that Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency in her view.

Asked to rank Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana during a recent podcast appearance, Wood said Bitcoin is typically “the first one to get sold and drag the others down” during periods of market stress.

She added, however, that she believes markets may be approaching a bottom, as adverse developments have largely been absorbed.

Cathie Wood breaks down her top 3 crypto assets:

– Bitcoin as the global monetary system and entry point for institutions– Ethereum as the institutional infrastructure layer– Solana as the consumer-focused chain pic.twitter.com/bHqgPfSQkp 

— Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 14, 2025 



Wood described Bitcoin as “a very big idea,” calling it a global monetary system, a technology, and a new asset class.

She said it is “leading the charge into a completely new asset class” and remains the primary entry point for institutional investors.

Ethereum, she said, is increasingly becoming the platform institutions are choosing as they build on its layer-one blockchain and expand activity through layer-two networks.

Wood characterized Ethereum as more of an institutional play, while describing Solana as more consumer-focused.

Wood also recently reiterated Ark Invest's long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, saying recent adjustments to the firm's valuation model have not altered its top-end price target of $1.5 million.

Speaking during an Ark webinar  in November, Wood said parts of the model were updated to reflect the rapid growth of stablecoins, which she said are increasingly serving as an “insurance policy” in emerging markets.

In this recent webinar, I discuss why the liquidity squeeze that has hit #AI  and #crypto  will reverse in the next few weeks, something the markets seemed to buy, and why AI is not in a bubble. The 123% increase noted below was in Palantir's US commercial business last qtr.

Watch… https://t.co/GdBZtEQcxM 

— Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) November 26, 2025 



Ark analyst David Puell noted that Bitcoin's share of transaction volume in developing regions remains below that of stablecoins, accounting for roughly 20% compared with between 40% and 50% for stablecoins, citing Chainalysis data.

As a result, Ark reduced its assumptions for Bitcoin's adoption as a safe-haven asset in those markets.

Despite these changes, Wood said Ark's long-term conviction remains intact.

“Our bull price … really hasn't changed,” she said.

Ethereum's near-term price action remains weak despite signs of rebuilding institutional interest, according to CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri.

At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading  at around $2,920, down nearly 7% over the past seven days.

Tahiri said Ethereum's recent rebound likely marked the completion of a fourth wave within a broader corrective structure, suggesting the asset could now be entering a fifth and final downward wave.

“If so, the main target for the bottom is at $2,065,” Tahiri said, citing a 1.61 external Fibonacci retracement level as key support, after which a significant bounce could follow.

He added that while improving long-term sentiment and prominent bullish positions are constructive, they do not invalidate Ethereum's current downtrend.

“This disconnect explains why Ethereum's price is falling despite the release of positive headlines,” Tahiri said.

Tahiri added that downside risk remains elevated until Ethereum reclaims key resistance levels and confirms a trend reversal.

For years, questions around where humanitarian aid money actually ends up have followed the sector. Large donation flows often move through layers of organisations, partners, and local operators, making it difficult for donors to see how funds are used once they leave their accounts. That lack of visibility has become a growing point of concern as global aid demands continue to rise.

As a result, HumaTek has announced the launch of the HumaCoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO), the company's latest blockchain initiative, as a possible response to this issue. The token is designed to support on-chain tracking of humanitarian funds by using a multi-chain setup across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon zkEVMe transactions, making them more transparent and traceable. 

Industry estimates suggest as much as 40% of humanitarian funding is lost to fraud, waste, or administrative overhead, contributing to an annual global aid shortfall of roughly $320 billion. While these challenges are not new, they have become harder to ignore as digital finance tools change how money moves across borders in other sectors. The contrast has sharpened questions around why aid funding remains difficult to track at scale.

One reason blockchain keeps coming up in these conversations is its ability to follow money as it moves. In humanitarian settings, funds often cross borders quickly and pass through several hands before reaching the ground, which makes oversight difficult. Putting transactions on a shared ledger is meant to reduce that opacity and make it easier to see how funds are allocated at each step.

As a result, HumaTek's HumaCoin offers that visibility to humanitarian funding, using on-chain records to support transparency without changing how aid organisations themselves operate.

HumaCoin operates on a multi-chain framework across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon zkEVM, networks HumaTek says were chosen to support faster settlement and lower transaction costs. These considerations are particularly relevant in humanitarian contexts, where funding often needs to move across borders without delays or excessive fees.

“Our blockchain-based ecosystem will cut out intermediaries to reduce aid delivery costs, providing faster, more efficient, and more secure aid,” said Tommy LaRocca, CEO of HumaTek. “The public ledger allows donors and organisations to track the flow of funds, ensuring aid reaches recipients and reducing fraud.” The multi-chain framework sits at the centre of how HumaCoin is intended to operate as the platform moves into its public token sale.

HumaTek has minted a total of 2 billion HumaCoins, of which 300 million are available for public purchase during the Initial Coin Offering at $0.04 per token. The ICO can be accessed through three major platforms: ICOHotList.com, ICODrops.com, icoannouncement.com, and humatek.io, the company's own pre-launch website. 

The company has also set aside 400 million coins for HumaClub, its public benefit corporation. These tokens are intended to support global aid initiatives over a 40-year period, allowing for sustained, measurable impact rather than one-off contributions.

HumaTek has already begun putting HumaCoin to practical use through its HumaAID Food Box Program in Tampa, Florida. In partnership with Station House BBQ, the initiative has provided over 1,000 hot meals, all recorded on-chain to track exactly how donations are used.

The pilot program also demonstrates how the different parts of the HumaTek ecosystem come together. HumaCoin acts as the transaction layer, HumaDash provides real-time visibility into fund flows, HumaAID coordinates meal distribution as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and HumaClub supports ongoing community engagement.

Furthermore, the company is working with six major local Tampa Bay charities focusing on issues such as human trafficking awareness, health, poverty relief, and support for wounded veterans, while also sponsoring the Philanthropists of the Year Awards, reinforcing its engagement with the local nonprofit community.

Many refugees, displaced people, and underserved communities struggle to access traditional banking services, making it difficult to receive aid quickly or securely. Crypto wallets negate these barriers, offering a portable, permissionless way for people to receive funds directly, without relying on local banks or extensive documentation.

“Crypto wallets can help financially excluded populations, including refugees and the unbanked,” Tommy LaRocca added. “Accepting crypto donations also allows nonprofits to engage new, tech-forward donors.”

By reducing the need for physical cash and central intermediaries, HumaCoin provides an additional layer of safety and traceability for both donors and beneficiaries. The system allows organisations to reach populations that might otherwise struggle to access assistance, while also opening the door to donors interested in blockchain-enabled giving.

HumaTek is a humanitarian technology company based in Tampa, Florida, focused on improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability in global aid. Its platform combines HumaCoin, HumaDash, HumaAID, and HumaClub to provide traceable, real-time support and long-term engagement.

Founded by veterans of finance and technology, HumaTek works with more than 50 NGOs to reduce fraud, cut costs, and restore donor confidence. By integrating blockchain, AI, and cloud-based SaaS tools, the company aims to make aid more measurable and effective.

As humanitarian aid faces growing demands and persistent challenges, tools that increase transparency and accountability are becoming essential. HumaTek's HumaCoin ICO and its early pilot programs show how blockchain and digital finance can be applied in practical ways, providing both donors and organisations with clearer insight into how funds are used.

While the platform is still expanding, these initial efforts illustrate a greater change in the space, particularly how technology is strengthening humanitarian aid rather than trying to replace it. For HumaTek, the focus remains on measurable impact, long-term engagement, and building systems that help aid in reaching those who need it most.

On 14 October 2025, the Information Commissioner's Office (the ICO) hosted its annual Data Protection Practitioners Conference, with a number of Burges Salmon's lawyers in attendance. 

There was an interesting session delivered on lessons learned from cyber-attacks. The slides from the session are available online here. In this session, the ICO talked about 5 actionable insights coming out of the range of cyber attacks that they have been involved with. 

In the table below, we set out the 5 actionable insights and the comments from the ICO on these. We have also added comments on how these apply to pension schemes trustees. 

The ICO's five actionable insights

No.

Action 

ICO comments

Our comments for trustees

1

Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

MFA mitigates common attack methods such as phishing and password spraying. 

Article 25 – Data Protection by design and by default.

ICO guidance states it should be implemented wherever it is possible to do so. 

 

MFA is a security process that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before gaining access to an account, system or application. 

MFA is an easy win for all schemes. MFA can help trustees maintain the security of the mass amounts of sensitive personal and financial data they manage in a cheap and easy way. 

As well as using this for trustee email accounts, schemes can use MFA where scheme administration platforms or trustee portals are accessed remotely as it helps protect against unauthorised access. 

Vulnerability scanning

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

 

 

 

Trustees should ask questions to determine whether their administrators are carrying out vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. 

While the ICO does not mandate penetration testing be carried out, organisations must identify risks and ensure appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to mitigate against them. As penetration testing is invasive and costly, schemes will need to consider whether this is proportionate for them to carry out themselves. 

We would, however, expect scheme administrators to be conducting regular penetration testing given the volume of scheme data that they process.

Patch management

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

Continuous monitoring and timely remediation of vulnerabilities. 

Critical or high-risk vulnerabilities (based on CVSS score) should be prioritised. 

How is patching approached by your organisation?

Trustees should ask questions to determine whether their administrators have a clear patching policy and that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. 

If professional trustees hold large amounts of personal scheme data, it may be prudent to introduce patch management.

Monitoring and alerting

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

Controls in place to detect unusual or suspicious activity. 

This will likely vary significantly based on the size of the organisation and the data being processed. 

If resourcing is an issue, focus on critical assets. 

Trustees should liaise with their scheme administrators to ensure they have appropriate monitoring in place and that alerts are reviewed and acted upon promptly. 

The importance of this takeaway was highlighted during the Capita breach in 2023 as despite a high security alert being raised within 10 minutes of the breach, Capita failed to effectively respond for 58 hours which allowed the attacker to exploit their system. 

It may be appropriate for professional trustees to establish their own internal monitoring and alerting processes.

Know what you have, know what it holds 

 

The ICO slides make the following comments: 

The systematic process of identifying, tracking and managing an organisation's assets. 

The ICO have an expectation an Information Asset Register will be in place. 

Consider obligations under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK GDPR. 

As data controllers, trustees should engage in data and asset mapping so that they know what data they are responsible for and where it is. The ICO refers to this as an Information Asset Register. 

Once a scheme has processes in place to map their data and assets, they can understand their cyber footprint. This means understanding who their suppliers are, who their suppliers' sub-processors are and what the flow of data and assets actually looks like for their scheme in practice. 

Once this is understood, trustees can make a risk-based decision regarding the extent to which they would like to review their suppliers (both from a processes and a contractual perspective), which is expected by the Pensions Regulator and the ICO. 

Key takeaways for trustees

The 5 actionable insights from cyber attacks that the ICO has dealt with are an interesting lessons learned piece that trustees should be aware of. From a pensions perspective, the key actions and takeaways are: 

Multi-Factor Authentication: Trustees without MFA should implement it as a priority, both for email use and portal use (where relevant).

Data and Asset Mapping: Schemes should have an up to date data and asset map to understand their cyber footprint. Trustees can then make informed, risk-based decisions on the extent to which they would like to review their suppliers (both from a processes and a contractual perspective). 

Understanding third party processes: Linked to reviewing their suppliers, trustees should be asking questions of their third party suppliers, including their scheme administrators. Based on the ICO's actionable insights, some of the questions to ask include:

whether they carry out vulnerability scanning and/or penetration testing and how frequently; 

whether they have a clear patching policy and that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly; and 

whether they have appropriate monitoring in place and that alerts are reviewed and acted upon promptly. 

How can we help?

We would be very happy to help pension scheme trustees with the key takeaways set out above and with building their scheme's cyber security resilience. Details of our experience in advising pension schemes in relation to cyber security can be found on our dedicated webpage.

  NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec.  16, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SRx Health Solutions, Inc. (
  
   NYSE American: SRXH
  
  ) (the “Company”) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
  

    EMJ Crypto Technologies (“EMJX”)
   

  , a digital-asset treasury platform designed as a treasury operating system, applying quantitative models, artificial intelligence, and systematic risk controls to multi-asset digital treasury management. Upon completion of the transaction, Eric M. Jackson, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of EMJX, is expected to serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the combined company.
 



   A Gen2 Approach to Digital Asset Treasuries:
  

  EMJX is designed as a
  
   next-generation (“Gen2”) digital-asset treasury platform
  
  , differentiated from earlier “Gen1” treasury models that primarily hold a single digital asset on a passive basis. EMJX's Gen2 approach is structured as a platform that governs how capital is allocated, hedged, and reinvested across market cycles, rather than functioning as a passive balance sheet tracking asset values. Gen1 treasury approaches largely rely on price appreciation of a single asset and typically lack systematic risk management, which can expose shareholders to significant drawdowns and dilution during adverse market conditions.
 



   By contrast, EMJX is structured to support:
  



  The Company believes this Gen2 framework reflects the continued maturation of digital-asset treasuries toward more disciplined, institutional-grade capital management models.
 


  Eric M. Jackson, Founder and CEO of EMJX, said, “Every major technology category goes through generational transitions. In digital assets, we believe the next phase is defined by disciplined risk management and multi-asset flexibility rather than single-asset exposure alone. Many digital-asset treasuries today function more like passive markers in the market — they rise and fall with price movements. EMJX is designed to operate more like a vessel with navigation systems, applying quantitative models and AI-enabled risk controls to help manage volatility across market cycles. Our objective is to reinvest capital back into the treasury over time rather than rely on dilution, and to build a transparent, institutional-grade platform with a long-term orientation. Platforms aren't valued on what they hold – they're valued on what they enable.”
 



   Capital Discipline and Treasury Compounding:
  

  As a treasury operating system, EMJX is designed to manage risk and capital allocation at the system level rather than through asset-by-asset trading. The platform applies quantitative risk-management tools, including hedging strategies, with the objective of mitigating drawdowns during periods of market stress.
 


  When these risk-management activities generate excess capital, the Company intends to allocate that capital back into its digital-asset treasury rather than relying on equity issuance, subject to market conditions, governance oversight, and regulatory considerations. The Company believes this approach may allow the treasury to compound over time while reducing the need for shareholder dilution that has historically accompanied single-asset, unhedged treasury models.
 



   Founder Track Record and Market Insight:
  

  EMJX was founded by Eric M. Jackson, Ph.D., a long-time technology investor and market analyst known for identifying inflection points in misunderstood public companies before they became widely recognized.
 


  Over the past several years, Dr. Jackson publicly identified and analyzed a number of non-consensus opportunities that later experienced significant market re-ratings, including Carvana, Opendoor, Better Home & Finance, and Nextdoor. His work around Opendoor helped catalyze a large, engaged retail investor community commonly referred to as the “OPEN Army,” which emphasized long-term conviction, transparency, and platform-level analysis over short-term trading.
 


  That same analytical framework underpins the Rising Dynasty philosophy — a research-driven approach focused on power-law outcomes, structural change, and disciplined risk awareness. EMJX applies these principles to the digital-asset treasury space through quantitative systems rather than discretionary positioning.
 


  Dr. Jackson is a frequent commentator on technology and market structure and has appeared on major financial media outlets including CNBC, Bloomberg, and Fox Business.
 



   Platform Development:
  

  EMJX's digital-asset treasury operating system is powered by its proprietary Quantitative AI and Machine Learning (QAM) Engine, which has been developed and refined since 2021. The QAM Engine is designed to analyze market conditions and inform portfolio-level risk-management decisions across multiple digital assets, subject to governance and oversight.
 


  The Company emphasizes that the platform's objective is risk-aware treasury management, not short-term speculation.
 



   Strategic Rationale:
  

  The transaction is intended to position the combined company at the intersection of:
 


  The Company believes digital-asset treasuries are entering a new phase, where survivability through volatility, disciplined capital allocation, and long-term compounding — rather than simple asset exposure — become the defining competitive advantages. The Company believes the long-term value of EMJX will be driven not by the digital assets held at any point in time, but by the risk-management, capital-routing, and compounding capabilities the platform enables over full market cycles.

The U.S. labor market appears to have continued to soften in recent months as the government caught up to reports that had been delayed due to the shutdown in D.C.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 64,000 in November, according to a Tuesday morning report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist estimates had been for jobs growth of 50,000.

The November unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6%, versus expectations of 4.4% and 4.4% in September.

For October, the economy saw jobs decline by 105,000 versus 119,000 added in September. The negative October print, however, was surely influenced by the government shutdown.

Taken together, the reports paint at least a modestly weaker picture of the employment situation than had been expected.

The price of bitcoin BTC$85,944.78 gave back some of its small overnight gains in the minutes following the report, dipping to $87,000. U.S. stock index futures swung from small gains to small losses and the 10-year Treasury yield was steady at 4.17%.

Ahead of the data, markets were pricing in a 75% probability that the Federal Reserve would hold rates steady at its January meeting. Those odds remained the same shortly following the release.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitmine Chair Tom Lee says “the best days for crypto are ahead” as the firm tops up its treasury with another $300 million worth of Ethereum.

The fresh haul brings the crypto treasury firm's total holdings of the second-biggest token to $12 billion.

Lee said “positive developments in digital assets” such as favourable regulations, new US crypto laws and Wall Street's adoption of crypto will fuel the sector's growth.

“These strengthen our conviction that the best days for crypto are ahead and why we continue to accumulate Ethereum towards our ‘alchemy of 5%' target,” he said.

Backed by marquee investors including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, Bitmine currently owns more than 3.2% of Ethereum's supply.

The haul follows a $435 million purchase earlier in December. Lee cited Fusaka, a major upgrade to the Ethereum network that boosted scalability and usability rolled out on December 3, as another key reason for buying.

To be sure, Bitmine's stock price is down about 30% from its highs this month and trading at $31 per share. It is not the only digital asset treasury to be down. DAT pioneer Strategy is down some 63% since July.

Ethereum is trading at just above $2,900 at time of reporting, down some 40% from its all-time high set in August, against the backdrop of a $1.4 trillion crypto market drawdown.

Meanwhile, some whales are offloading. The Lookonchain wallet tracking account has flagged over $100 million in selling this week.

Bitmine's announcement comes the same day JP Morgan's asset management division debuted its first-ever tokenised money market fund built on Ethereum.

The $4.6 trillion bank's My OnChain Net Yield Fund — MONY — invests in US Treasury securities and allows qualified investors to hold the token on the Ethereum blockchain to earn yield.

MONY “offers daily dividend reinvestment and investors will be able to subscribe and redeem using cash or stablecoins,” the firm said.

George Gatch, chief executive of JP Morgan Asset Management, said that “by harnessing technology alongside our deep expertise in active management, we're able to provide clients with advanced, innovative, and cost-effective capabilities that help them achieve their investment goals.”

Market watchers took notice.

“JP Morgan launches its first tokenised money market fund,” Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute said on X.

“And seeding it with $100 million. Using Ethereum blockchain. See where this is all heading yet?

 Most likely, you are managing crypto in 2025 with at least two wallets, as many people do. Crypto wallet usage has grown to almost $14 billion in 2024, with the number of user wallet downloads reaching levels last seen during the 2021 peak. In other words, there are more users, meaning more wallets are floating around, each of which may be used for a specific task or set of functions.

You may need one wallet for regular trading, another for long-term storage, and a hardware wallet for your highest-value assets. The question is not whether you will use multiple wallets to manage your crypto, but rather how to make them work well together without creating a mess.

It is not necessary to have more wallets simply because everyone else does. It's essential because each wallet does something better than the other. You may use a mobile wallet for small, quick purchases on your phone, such as coffee or NFTs. On the other hand, a hardware wallet keeps your larger investments safe because it is offline, making it unreachable to hackers. Lastly, the exchange wallet lets you trade and exchange your cryptocurrency without having to transfer funds back and forth between exchanges. AI-driven tools can now help you manage and optimise your wallets more effectively. For example, AI apps can automatically categorise your wallet activity, making it easier to track expenses, investments, and trading patterns.

Security plays a major role in all of this. If you were to lose access to one wallet, the loss would be limited to the amount in that wallet. Therefore, if you had your crypto spread across multiple wallets, you wouldn't lose it all at once. The idea of spreading your assets across various locations is why you wouldn't carry all your money in cash. In 2025, more than $2.17 billion was reported in crypto thefts, with most cases caused by unauthorised access to a user's wallet.

Further, different blockchains require different wallets, too. For example, your Ethereum wallet won't help you much on Solana or Bitcoin. While some wallets now support multiple chains, specialised wallets often give you better features and lower fees for specific networks. When choosing the best crypto wallet for everyday needs, consider which chains you'll use most often and whether you need cross-chain functionality built in. Some of the currently most popular hardware wallets are Ledger and Trezor, while among hot wallets, the trends tend to favour Best Wallet and Exodus. 

Start with a clear plan before you create multiple different wallets and forget which one holds what. Write down what you need each wallet to do. One for everyday spending, one for DeFi activities, one for cold storage. Keep it simple at first. When you set up each wallet, save your recovery phrases separately and securely. Don't store them all in the same place or on the same device. A physical notebook in a safe beats a screenshot folder on your phone any day because it's hackproof.

The majority of DeFi and NFT platforms allow users to connect multiple digital wallets to a single user account. There will most likely be a “Connect Wallet” option on the site. When you click it, you'll select your wallet from the options provided, then confirm the connection in your mobile/wallet application. You are always shown exactly which permissions you are granting for each connection request. Be sure to read them carefully. Some applications only need your digital wallet address and your current token balance, while others may require the ability to spend your tokens. If a wallet is requesting more permissions than necessary, it is considered a red flag and warrants further research of that wallet.

Most platforms also allow users to switch between connected wallets. The majority of platforms display a wallet icon or your digital wallet address in the upper-right corner of the screen. Clicking either the icon or the address will prompt you to view all your connected wallets and select the one you want to use. This allows you to keep multiple wallets active for different functions without having to log in and out of the platform.

Portfolio-tracking apps pull data from multiple wallets and display everything in one place. You connect your wallet addresses (read-only, not full access) and the app shows your total holdings, transaction history, and current values. CoinTracking, Delta, and similar apps save you from checking five different wallets every time you want to see your portfolio.

On top of that, cross-chain bridges let you move assets between different blockchains without going through an exchange. This helps when you need to consolidate funds or use a token on a different network. Bridge usage has grown significantly, with platforms like OKX Wallet reporting a 57% increase in cross-chain feature usage between mid-2024 and mid-2025. Just remember that ignoring transaction fees when you move funds between wallets can shock you. Network fees change based on congestion, so check current gas prices before you transfer anything.

Oops, something went wrong

 Key Takeaways

Coinbase has expanded its “perpetual-style” futures offering.

Eleven altcoins have joined the roster alongside Bitcoin and Ether.

Unlike traditional perps, perpetual-style futures comply with U.S. derivatives regulations.

Following the launch of its flagship BTC and ETH products earlier this year, Coinbase has expanded its derivatives offering with perpetual-style futures tied to a slate of major altcoins. 

While offshore and decentralized exchanges have long dominated the global perp market, Coinbase's move highlights the steady normalization of regulated crypto derivatives in the U.S. market—albeit in a distinctly American wrapper.

Coinbase initially listed “perpetual-style” futures for Bitcoin and Ether in July, marking the launch of a new asset class for the U.S.-regulated market.

The contracts are designed to replicate perpetual exposure without being legally classified as swaps. They are technically still futures with expiries, but because they automatically roll over at maturity, from the perspective of traders, they behave the same as true perps.

On Thursday, Dec. 15, Coinbase introduced eleven new altcoins to its perpetual-style derivatives offering:

Avalanche (AVAX)

Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

Cardano (ADA)

Chainlink (LINK)

Dogecoin (DOGE)

Hedera (HBAR)

Litecoin (LTC)

Polkadot (DOT)

Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Sui (SUI)

Stellar (XLM)

The selection leans toward large-cap, liquid tokens with long trading histories. Legacy networks, such as Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Stellar, sit alongside newer layer-one and infrastructure plays, including Avalanche, Sui, and Chainlink. 

Memecoins also feature, with both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu included in the list, their persistent liquidity and retail demand.

Unlike traditional perps offered by decentralized or offshore exchanges, Coinbase's perpetual-style futures comply with U.S. derivatives regulations, making them suitable for American retail and institutional traders.

Perp-style futures are listed on Coinbase Derivatives rather than the company's spot exchange. Traders must access them via the firm's registered FCM (Futures Commission Merchants) partners, which include ABN Amro, Architect, and Clear Street.

HKEX plans to adopt digital currencies and tokenisation in the next decade, which analysts say are in demand for round-the-clock trading

With Nasdaq seeking US regulatory approval to extend its trading hours to 23 hours, some industry players believe local bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will need to consider a similar move for certain products to enhance its competitiveness.

HKEX chief executive Bonnie Chan Yiting did not mention trading hours in her blog on Monday, but she did say the bourse operator would expand into digital currencies and tokenisation over the next decade, which analysts pointed out were the types of products in demand for round-the-clock trading.

“Trading securities 23 hours a day may not be suitable at the current stage in Hong Kong,” said Robert Lee Wai-wang, lawmaker and chairman of Hong Kong-based Grand Finance Group. “However, HKEX's futures trading should actively explore extending trading hours as many futures markets are already trading 24 hours a day.”

The issue came under the spotlight after Nasdaq, home to tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to extend trading to 23 hours per day, five days a week, up from 16 hours a day now, according to its filing.

“Nasdaq submits its proposal to extend its trading hours to compete for order flow from these investors, as well as to position itself favourably in the future to participate in markets that trade digital assets,” the filing said.

India PR Distribution



New Delhi [India], December 16: This initiative empowers key stakeholders such as drivers, NBFCs, OEMs, Policy makers and recyclers, fueling EV adoption and financial inclusion in India.



Zenfinity Energy, a deep-tech battery company incubated at IIT Madras, and Chargeup, India's EV Tech platform for last mile drivers, today announced the launch of India's first blockchain-based Battery Passport, starting with a 3,000-battery pilot (15 MWh) to be deployed across major Indian cities in the next 6 months. Built on India's emerging "Battery Aadhaar" framework, this passport captures both static and high-resolution dynamic data across the full battery lifecycle--marking a pioneering step toward India's transition to Digital Battery Passports (DBPs) aligned with global standards.



India's Growing Battery Dependence Requires Smarter Lifecycle Data

India is projected to import more than 25 GWh of lithium-ion cells and batteries in FY25-26, equivalent to nearly 156,000 tonnes of cells. With rapid electrification of commercial fleets, the nation must ensure these assets stay productive for as long as possible. To finance this scale of batteries--whether new, in-field, or in resale markets--stakeholders need accurate State of Health (SoH) and remaining useful life (RUL) data. These metrics can only be generated through continuous capture of in-field dynamic data reflecting cyclic ageing, calendar ageing, thermal stress, operational behavior, and telemetry patterns.



A Technological Breakthrough for India's Battery Ecosystem

Zenfinity's Battery Passport is engineered to combine:

* Manufacturing metadata (supply chain, batch characteristics, QC parameters)

* Real-time field telemetry (temperature, current, voltage, C-rates, GPS)

* Physics-informed SoH/RUL algorithms

* Lifecycle events (service history, repairs, swaps, firmware updates)

* End-of-life insights for recycling, material recovery, and circularity

All of this is anchored on a permissioned blockchain ledger, ensuring tamper-proof, immutable, and selectively shareable battery records. Importantly, the architecture ensures complex analytics from Zenfinity's SoH engine do not burden the blockchain ledger, maintaining scalability and performance.

This system supports compliance with India's Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR 2022) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandates, while creating the data backbone for a transparent, circular battery economy.

Until now, most battery passport initiatives--domestically and globally--focused primarily on static data, material provenance, and supply-chain compliance. By integrating dynamic operational and ageing data, Zenfinity and Chargeup are bringing the next generation of lifecycle intelligence to India's EV ecosystem.

3,000-Battery Pilot: Linking Battery Health, Driver Behavior & Financing

Over the next six months, Zenfinity and Chargeup will onboard 3,000 drivers and 3,000 blockchain-enabled L3 batteries to the program. OEMs, NBFCs, recyclers, and policymakers will gain access to live dashboards and operational telemetry streams.

This pilot integrates:

* Zenfinity's Battery Passport, SoH/RUL engine, and analytics stack

* Chargeup's Driver Karma Score, underwriting models, and risk mitigation engine

Each battery receives a unique digital identity capturing its entire operational history, degradation trends, and remaining life. The Driver Karma Score layers on driver behavior, battery usage discipline, and payment reliability, creating a unified risk signature for each asset.

With all lifecycles, behavioral, and financial data in one place, NBFCs gain the ability to lower credit risk, reward responsible drivers, reduce non-performing assets (NPAs), and increase recycling value--while drivers and fleet operators enjoy more uptime and fairer loan terms.

Dr. Kriti Yadav, CEO, Zenfinity Energy, said:

"We're creating guard rails for bankable batteries. Weak batteries are an ongoing challenge in India's scaling EV ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain to create an open yet secure battery record, we aim to boost confidence in EV batteries and make it easier for fleet operators and drivers to obtain financing. A verifiable battery passport can assure all stakeholders of a battery's performance and remaining life, ultimately accelerate EV adoption and set new industry benchmarks."

Mr. Satish Mittal, Co-founder, Chargeup, added:

"Integrating Zenfinity's battery passport with our platform is a game-changer for last-mile drivers and the EV financing ecosystem. Through our Driver Karma Score and real-time battery data, responsible drivers will be rewarded with better loan terms and more uptime. Financiers and recyclers, in turn, get unparalleled visibility into asset health. Together, we're creating a framework where trust replaces uncertainty--benefiting drivers, NBFCs, and the entire value chain with a goal to financial Inclusion and acceleration of EV adoption in India"

Key takeaways:

Leverage surged in the crypto market, with $527 million in liquidations in 24 hours, signaling growing caution among traders.

Tighter liquidity and increasing AI debt risks push traders to exit riskier assets, contributing to a market correction.

The cryptocurrency market saw a correction on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) retesting the $85,000 level and Ether (ETH) dropping to $2,900. Traders became more risk-averse after a survey showed worsening economic conditions in the United States and changes in investor expectations regarding the proposed options for the next US Federal Reserve chair. 

The resilience of the US five-year Treasury after hitting a low of 98.64 on Wednesday points to a more defensive shift in positioning as liquidity conditions tightened across global markets. That caution comes amid mounting fiscal pressures after a recent tax and spending package extended credits and raised the US debt ceiling by $5 trillion. Also, the Federal Reserve said it will begin purchasing about $40 billion per month in short-dated Treasury bills as part of a technical reserve-management operation aimed at maintaining ample liquidity, a move policymakers have stressed is not a return to broad quantitative easing or a shift in the Fed's monetary policy stance.

The consumer sector remains a concern, as a CNBC survey revealed that 41% of Americans plan to spend less during the holidays this year, up from 35% in 2024. Additionally, 61% of respondents cited affordability problems due to stagnant wages amid rising prices. US October retail sales data will be released on Tuesday, along with November nonfarm payrolls figures. 

Excessive leverage in the cryptocurrency market continues to be a major issue, with futures open interest standing at $135 billion. Over $527 million worth of bullish leveraged positions have been liquidated in the past 24 hours, causing traders to worry about further downside. Weakness in the artificial intelligence sector has also driven traders to increase cash positions, exiting riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies.

Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates reportedly said that tech firms' heavy reliance on debt markets to fund AI investments has reached a dangerous phase, according to Reuters. “Going forward, there is a reasonable probability that we will soon find ourselves in a bubble," Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen wrote in a note. 

Demand for leverage on short (sellers) positions surged on Bybit, pushing the annualized funding rate below zero. This unusual situation, where longs (buyers) are paid to keep their leveraged positions open, rarely lasts as arbitrage opportunities emerge. Still, since the Oct. 10 crash, liquidity has become much tighter, with some market makers likely facing sizable losses.

Part of Monday's decline in the US stock market can be attributed to a decrease in Kevin Hassett's odds of replacing Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair. CNBC reported that President Donald Trump's inner circle pushed for someone perceived as more independent. Trump said on Friday that Kevin Warsh would also be a great fit, which eased concerns about the fragility of the US dollar. 

The US Dollar Index (DXY) found support at the 98 level after four consecutive weeks of decline. This stability suggests higher confidence in the US government's ability to avoid a recession, which is somewhat supportive for the stock market but less so for cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin and Ether are generally seen as part of an independent financial system, so the relative strength of the US dollar reduces the demand for alternative hedges. The excessive leverage in the cryptocurrency market, combined with broader macroeconomic uncertainty, is likely to continue weighing on prices.

Vessels brimming with coins suggest a convenient method of hiding savings underground.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

There was (obviously) no such thing as online banking 1,700 years ago. While the ancient Romans did adopt early banking systems from ancient Greece, the most convenient way to put aside cash that would have simply been transfered into a savings account over a thousand years later was remained stashing it in a vessel that was later buried.

Wherever the Roman Empire spread, its customs came with it. The empire and all its wealth extended through France, and archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) have now unearthed three clay amphorae overflowing with coins. Found at a site in Senon, northeastern France, makeshift piggy banks were buried in a pit beneath the lime concrete floor of what was likely someone's living room. The research team found more than 40,000 coins, weighing about 183 pounds in total. Some had been deposited in the necks of the jugs even after the containers were buried.

“Contrary to what one might think at first glance, it is not certain that these are ‘treasures' that were hidden during a period of insecurity,” numismatist Vincent Geneviève, who studies ancient currency, said in a statement from INRAP. “Many other explanations are possible, and these deposits should be seen instead as a snapshot of complex monetary management, planned over the medium to long term, within a household or administration, capable of making deposits and withdrawals at various intervals.”

At the time, Senon was populated by the Mediomatrici tribe, whose name translates to “middle mother,” and is probably a reference to the middle goddess of the three mothers worshipped in northwest Europe during the Roman era. These Celtic people, or Gauls, lived in the region during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar's forces conquered parts of Belgium, France, and Switzerland between 57 and 50 B.C.E. Caesar fought the Gauls when a subgroup known as the Helveti (from what is now Switzerland) began to migrate and clash with Roman allies. According to Caesar's own account of the Gallic Wars, Celts near the Rhine (probably including the Mediomatrici) clashed with German tribes. 

The vessels and coin hoards found by the reasearcher date from much later, around the late 3rd to early 4th century C.E. Geneviève found some 23,000 to 24,000 coins in the first amphora (weighing a total of 83 pounds), and 18,000 to 19,000 in the second amphora (weighing a total of 110 pounds). Only three coins remained in the third vessel.

Researchers who found coins stuck to the outer face of one vessel realized that they had been added to the hoard before the pit was filled with sediment. The Mediomatrici settlement in which the vessels were found had been burned to the ground in the 4th century and rebuilt, only to be reduced to ashes again, and these artifacts were there before the fires. That can only mean that they had been there before the Romans conquered.

Because the reserves of coins were buried between 280 and 310 C.E., it is thought that they may be associated with the Roman military occupation at Senon—whether they belonged to Roman warriors or Mediomatrici, however, is unclear. The artifacts were buried at a time when urban growth began to trigger a shift in building practices and materials, and the living space, as a result, was made of limestone bricks (limestone was a plentiful resource in this part of France at the time). Rooms are separated by brick walls, with multiple pits that may have been latrines or spaces for storage. What they were actually used for will be determined by lab analysis.

It seems that Senon was heavily influenced by its Roman conquerors. Impressions on the coins appear stylistically Roman, and the ruins at the site reflect an affluent city with a public square, courtyards, temples, baths, and even a theater. Its inhabitants may have been artists or merchants. INRAP officials, therefore, do not think that there was a rush to bury these coins because of impending disaster. The fact that the tops of the amphorae were almost at ground level indicates that they were supposed to be easily accessible for deposits or withdrawals.

“Their exceptional nature lies less in the discovery of a large quantity of coins (some thirty coin hoards are known in the Meuse department alone) than in the possibility of documenting their depositional context so precisely,” Geneviève said, “which is rare.”

All living organisms adapt in order to survive, and bacteria are no exception. Over many decades, some bacteria have gradually become resistant to widely used antibiotics and disinfectants, creating serious challenges for medicine and public health. At the same time, countless bacterial species play a helpful and often critical role in keeping the human body healthy. This raises an important question. Instead of trying to eliminate bacteria, could scientists find ways to influence how they behave to reduce disease and improve health?

Bacteria are far from silent. Inside the human mouth, roughly 700 different bacterial species constantly exchange information through a process called quorum sensing. This chemical communication allows bacteria to coordinate their actions as a group. Many oral bacteria rely on signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to send and receive these messages.

Investigating Bacterial Communication in Dental Plaque

Researchers at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences and the School of Dentistry set out to explore how bacteria in the mouth communicate and whether that communication could be deliberately disrupted. Their goal was to determine if interfering with these signals could help prevent plaque buildup and support a healthier oral microbiome. The findings, published in the journal npj Biofilms and Microbiomes, suggest this approach could reshape how doctors think about treating bacterial diseases.

Key Findings From the Study

The researchers discovered several important patterns in how oral bacteria communicate and organize themselves:

Dental Plaque as a Living Ecosystem

"Dental plaque develops in a sequence, much like a forest ecosystem," said Mikael Elias, associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences and senior author of the study. "Pioneer species like Streptococcus and Actinomyces are the initial settlers in simple communities -- they're generally harmless and associated with good oral health. Increasingly diverse late colonizers include the 'red complex' bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are strongly linked to periodontal disease. By disrupting the chemical signals bacteria use to communicate, one could manipulate the plaque community to remain or return to its health-associated stage."

"What's particularly striking is how oxygen availability changes everything," said lead author Rakesh Sikdar. "When we blocked AHL signaling in aerobic conditions, we saw more health-associated bacteria. But when we added AHLs under anaerobic conditions, we promoted the growth of disease-associated late colonizers. Quorum sensing may play very different roles above and below the gumline, which has major implications for how we approach treatment of periodontal diseases."

Toward New Microbiome-Based Treatments

The researchers plan to next examine how bacterial signaling differs across various regions of the mouth and among patients at different stages of periodontal disease. "Understanding how bacterial communities communicate and organize themselves may ultimately give us new tools to prevent periodontal disease -- not by waging war on all oral bacteria, but by strategically maintaining a healthy microbial balance," said Elias. The team believes this strategy could eventually lead to therapies for other parts of the body, where imbalances in the microbiome are linked to illness and certain forms of cancer.

Colorectal cancer has long been viewed as a condition that primarily affects older adults. That assumption is changing as more cases are now being diagnosed in younger people, a shift that is raising concern among health experts around the world. Public awareness increased sharply after the death of actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 at age 43, which highlighted the growing number of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases occurring in people under 50 and challenged long-standing ideas about who is most at risk.

As Colon Cancer Awareness Month draws attention to this trend, researchers are examining the forces behind the rise in early-onset CRC. At the same time, advances in genetic testing are opening new possibilities for prevention and earlier detection.

Rising Rates of Colorectal Cancer in Younger Adults

A large international study published in The Lancet Oncology found a clear increase in CRC diagnoses among younger adults. From 2013 to 2017, incidence rates rose in 27 of the 50 countries included in the analysis for people under the age of 50. Although the highest numbers continue to appear in North America and Europe, notable increases were also reported across Eastern Europe, South-Central and Southeastern Asia, and South America.

Researchers believe this global pattern reflects broad changes in daily life, including shifts in diet, reduced physical activity, urban living, and environmental exposures. Specialists emphasize that earlier screening, healthier eating habits, and stronger public education are essential to slow this trend. Without effective intervention, experts warn that early-onset CRC cases are likely to continue rising over the coming decades.

Lifestyle and Diet Linked to Increased Risk

Research increasingly points to diet as a major contributor to colorectal cancer risk. High intake of ultra-processed foods, red and processed meats, and sugary drinks has been associated with inflammation and a greater susceptibility to cancer.

One example comes from Kazakhstan, where a population study found that average meat consumption was almost double the World Cancer Research Fund's recommended limit of 500 grams per week. The same study showed that only 8.6% of participants consumed fish at recommended levels, a pattern that may contribute to nutritional imbalances linked to higher cancer risk.

Obesity is another important factor tied to CRC. Excess body fat can drive chronic inflammation and interfere with normal metabolic processes. However, researchers note that obesity's role may be more complex than it appears. An analysis of 18 studies revealed that many CRC patients experience unintended weight loss before diagnosis, suggesting that standard measures used to assess obesity-related risk may not fully capture its impact.

Genetic Factors and Inherited Cancer Syndromes

Genetics also plays a significant role in early-onset colorectal cancer. According to Dr. Alexei Tsukanov, head of the Laboratory of Genetics at the National Medical Research Center for Radiology, many younger CRC cases are linked to inherited cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. These disorders are caused by mutations in tumor-suppressor genes, which sharply increase the likelihood of developing CRC at a younger age.

Despite the importance of early diagnosis, warning signs are often overlooked. Symptoms can include lasting changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, unexplained weight loss, and ongoing abdominal discomfort.

Dr. Tsukanov emphasizes the value of genetic testing for individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer. "Identifying a hereditary mutation allows us to implement lifelong clinical monitoring and early intervention, significantly improving survival rates," he explains.

New screening technologies are also expanding detection options. Tools such as BGI Genomics' COLOTECT® Stool DNA Methylation Test identifies CRC-related genetic markers (SDC2, ADHFE1, and PPP2R5C) through stool DNA analysis, providing a non-invasive approach to identifying cancer-related changes at an earlier stage.

Screening Gaps and the Need for Public Awareness

Access to colorectal cancer screening varies widely across regions. In parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, screening programs remain uneven. Countries including Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Latvia, and Georgia have established national screening efforts, while others depend on opportunistic testing. This inconsistency leaves many cases undetected until later stages.

Education is seen as a critical step toward improving outcomes. "To improve early detection, we must educate both healthcare providers and the public about the importance of screening," says Jemma Arakelyan, an advisor at the Immune Oncology Research Institute and CEO of The Institute of Cancer and Crisis in Armenia.

Colorectal cancer is no longer confined to older populations. Younger adults are increasingly affected, with unhealthy lifestyle patterns playing a major role. Addressing this growing challenge will require coordinated action from governments, healthcare systems, and individuals to raise awareness, support healthier choices, and expand access to early screening. The urgency of the situation continues to grow.

Humans have been modifying their skull shapes since prehistory, but the discovery of a cube-shaped skull has researchers scratching their (round-shaped) heads.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nearly every corner of the world contains archaeological evidence of the ancient practice of artificial cranial deformation. The Huns of Central Asia are a well-known example, but so are the Hirota people of ancient Japan, the Maya of Central America, and even members of the peasant class in Toulouse, France, around the end of the 19th century. Today, some cultures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Vanuatu in the South Pacific still practice the tradition. 

Most of these examples—both historical and contemporary—form pointed skulls by binding an infant's head while the skull bones fuse (typically up until the age of two). It's not incredibly common to see a cube-shaped skull, but the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) recently reported one such discovery in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas near the Balcón de Montezuma—an archaeological site occupied by various ethnic groups between 650 B.C.E and 1200 C.E.

One of these communities, around the year 400 C.E., contained roughly 90 houses and a variety of artifacts. As the archaeologists sifted through these finds, they discovered what appeared to be a parallelepiped, or cube-shaped, skull. Artificial skull deformation was a common practice among the Maya, but hasn't been documented in this particular site. 

“Not only was intentional cranial deformation identified for the first time for this type of site, but also a variant with respect to the models recognized in Mesoamerica, not reported, until now, in the area,” biological anthropologist Jesús Ernesto Velasco González said in a translated press statement. Velasco González noted that similar deformations occurred at the El Zapotal archaeological site in Veracruz, located further south along the Gulf of Mexico, so scientists tried to piece together potential migration leaks. However, those didn't quite pan out. 

“Stable oxygen isotope studies in collagen and bioapatite samples from bone and teeth, a technique used to infer the geographic origin of the second individual's skeletal remains, indicate that he was born, lived, and died in this part of the mountains,” Velasco González said in a press statement. “Therefore, the results rule out a direct mobility relationship with the groups of El Zapotal or those further south.”

The reasons why the people of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica—or any people, for that matter—practiced skull formation are almost as varied as the people groups themselves. Sometimes it was a marker of social hierarchy, sometimes it was a religious rite, and sometimes it was just for aesthetics. Although the health effects are debated, it's largely believed that this practice doesn't decrease the size of the skull, and as such, health impacts are mostly negligible (though some research has asserted that the practice could impact cognitive or memory function).

In September, the US government announced a one-off US$495-million funding boost for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). This is welcome news — but doesn't redress their chronic underfunding.

The financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States

The financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States

In the United States, HBCUs educate 1.5% of all university students — yet receive only 0.9% of federal research and development (R&D) funding. Data reported in 2024 show combined HBCU endowment assets around $100,000 per student. By contrast, the ten wealthiest US universities received $2 million to $7 million per student in 2023.

As a scientist and administrator at Meharry Medical College — a 150-year-old private historically Black health-sciences institution in Nashville, Tennessee, with some 1,500 students — I've seen how hard it can be to manage on scant budgets. I urge the government to redress funding levels. In the meantime, HBCUs and TCUs can target their investments, as Meharry has done with some success.

Over the past decade, Meharry has increased its funds for research, and its scholarly output, by using metrics to guide budgeting and investments. We tracked publications and citations, grants, awards, student engagement, graduation and career placement rates, facility use, data generation and sharing (how many samples were processed, what data sets were produced and how were shared), research collaborations and investigator diversity. We also expanded our number of sponsors and monitored how funds were used.

Between the periods of 2010–15 and 2020–25, the number of cross-disciplinary collaborations increased, both between groups at Meharry and with external investigators. The number of papers with Meharry authors indexed in the PubMed database of biomedical literature rose from 444 to 1,067.

End racism in science

End racism in science

Three measures underpin this growth. First, we established transdisciplinary pilot grants of $50,000–$75,000 per faculty member lasting for 12–18 months — funded by federal research endowments or private foundations — to seed ideas and support core staff and infrastructure. While maintaining budgets for ongoing cancer, HIV and oral-health studies, we prioritized new projects in genomics, inflammation, immunity and cardiometabolic health. We also launched two new schools: one in applied computational sciences, in 2021; and one in global health, in 2023.

Second, we invested in infrastructure to handle, store and analyse data securely. We established procedures — including some around human consent and data sovereignty — that meet both federal and Tribal Nations' standards. Studies that involve human participants must be co-designed with community members to ensure that any concerns — for example, about privacy, potential stigma or data misuse — are addressed early on. Steps such as pre-consented sharing of electronic health records or clinical notes can help to accelerate the analysis of disease risk, treatment response and gaps in care, to inform services and policies that benefit local people. This transparent and respectful approach deepens public confidence in science, especially among populations long marginalized in research.

Here we present the ambiphilic reactivity of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in the stereoselective synthesis of diverse cyclopropanes from olefins, under palladium(II) catalysis. The sulfonyl fluoride functionality serves as both an acidifying group and an internal oxidant within the ambiphile, enabling successive carbopalladation and oxidative addition steps in the catalytic cycle, respectively. The transformation grants access to cis-substituted cyclopropanes and exhibits broad compatibility with various alkyl sulfonyl fluorides, including those bearing –CN, –CO2R, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl and aryl groups. With internal alkene substrates, 1,2,3-trisubstituted cyclopropanes that are otherwise challenging to synthesize are formed in good-to-moderate yields and predictable diastereoselectivity. Detailed mechanistic insights from reaction progress kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the SN2-type C–SO2F oxidative addition is the turnover-limiting and diastereoselectivity-determining step.

Organosulfonyl fluorides have emerged as central players in organic synthesis1,2,3, owing to the rise of sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEX) chemistry, which enables rapid and reliable diversification through nucleophilic displacement of fluoride with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles4,5,6. The utility of organosulfonyl fluorides in this context has motivated the development of a growing number of methods to synthesize structurally diverse sulfonyl fluorides in an efficient, selective and modular manner7,8,9,10,11 (Fig. 1a).

In contrast to widely studied aryl-12,13,14,15,16,17, alkenyl-18,19,20,21 and alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides11, alkyl sulfonyl fluorides have been less thoroughly investigated despite offering unique opportunities as synthetic building blocks owing to the acidifying effect of the sulfonyl group on the α-protons5. In recent work, Bull developed an elegant series of desulfonative couplings of azetidine and oxetane sulfonyl fluorides for C–heteroatom bond formation22,23. Prior work has demonstrated the utility of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in C–C bond formation through reaction with classical electrophiles, such as alkyl halides and carbonyl compounds, in the presence of base16,17,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 (Fig. 1b). We surmised that alkyl sulfonyl fluorides could exhibit unique ambiphilic reactivity in transition metal catalysis, capitalizing on the ability of the sulfonyl fluoride group to serve the dual role as a pronucleophile activator and electrophilic reactive group (internal oxidant).

Our laboratory previously developed a palladium-catalysed anti-cyclopropanation of olefins with various carbon pronucleophiles and I2 as the bystanding oxidant, where the hypothesized mechanism involves initial α-iodination of the nucleophile, directed carbopalladation, PdII/PdIV oxidative addition of the newly formed C(sp3)–I bond and, finally, C(sp3)–C(sp3) reductive elimination from the palladacyclobutane intermediate31. The need for doubly activated carbon pronucleophiles in all cases but nitromethane limits the scope of substituted cyclopropanes that can be accessed with this method, leading us to search for alternative nucleophilic coupling partners in which a leaving group and an acidifying group could be merged into the same entity.

Here, we demonstrate alkyl sulfonyl fluorides acting as ambiphilic coupling partners in the stereoselective cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins through the PdII/PdIV redox couple. The catalytic cycle leverages a novel mode of reactivity, C(sp3)–SO2F bonds oxidatively adding to organopalladium(II) intermediates, to deliver stereochemical outcomes that are inaccessible using conventional leaving groups32,33,34,35 (Fig. 1b). While this paper was in revision, Mane and Baidya reported a directed cyclopropanation reaction involving ketone-derived sulfoxonium ylides to access related cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclopropane products36.

In this context, alkenyl amide 1a, featuring the 8-aminoquinoline directing auxiliary required for reactivity31, and alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a were selected as model substrates. After extensive screening, we identified optimal reaction conditions using a combination of Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%) and Na2CO3 (1.0 equiv.) in dimethylacetamide (DMA) (0.33 M) under a nitrogen atmosphere to afford cyclopropane 3aa in 94% yield with 98:2 diastereomeric ratio (d.r.); the unusual cis-configuration of the major product was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction37,38,39,40,41,42 (Table 1). Key findings from our optimization campaign include the important role of Na2CO3 as the base, as other carbonate salts, such as K2CO3 and Cs2CO3, led to substantially lower yields (entries 2 and 3), as did bases with other counteranions (entries 4 and 5). Other commonly used PdII sources, such as PdCl2 and Pd(TFA)2 (where TFA is trifluoroacetate), gave slightly lower yields and comparable diastereoselectivity (entries 6 and 7). Increasing the concentration of the reaction mixture decreased the yield (entry 8). The use of a polar aprotic solvent was crucial, and dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were reasonably effective alternatives to DMA (entries 9–13). We were also pleased to find that the reaction gave 92% yield even when set up and run under air with anhydrous DMA (entry 14). In control experiments, we found that changing the leaving group to sulfonyl chloride (LG2), phenyl sulfonyl (LG3) or methyl sulfonyl (LG4) groups led to no reaction or trace product formation (entry 15), indicating that the sulfonyl fluoride is key for the observed reaction. A representative sulfonium bromide sulfur ylide precursor (LG5) gave moderate yields but poor d.r. Beyond sulfur-based leaving groups, halides were also tested but found to be ineffective. An additional control experiment revealed that 2a furnished a different product, a tri-substituted cyclopropane with the –SO2F group intact, when subjected to previously reported conditions for PdII-catalysed cyclopropanation31 (see ‘Pd(0) salt screening and control experiments' section in Supplementary Information).

In seeking to rationalize the optimization data, we considered previous reports that found alkyl sulfonyl fluorides, such as phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), to be highly unstable in aqueous solutions43. We questioned whether yield differences could be partially attributed to the competitive decomposition of the nucleophile under different conditions (in different solvents and in the presence or absence of adventitious water). To this end, we examined the stability of alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a in DMA, DMF and DMSO (see Table 2 and ‘Stability tests' section in Supplementary Information for details). Surprisingly, alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a was fully decomposed in anhydrous DMSO after 2 h but proved to be relatively stable in anhydrous DMF. Similarly, we found no decomposition of alkyl sulfonyl fluoride 2a in anhydrous DMA under an inert atmosphere. However, under air, moderate levels of decomposition in DMA could be detected, and complete decomposition was observed in wet DMA. Under aerobic conditions, oxidation and subsequent decomposition of DMA into N-methylacetamide and formaldehyde has been previously documented and could be a contributing factor to these observations44. These results indicate that the rate of decomposition of 2a is dependent on the solvent identity and amount of adventitious water in the solution.

Having optimized the conditions, we began investigating the scope with respect to the alkyl sulfonyl fluoride, many of which are commercially available or readily accessible using routine procedures (see ‘General procedures for starting material preparation' section in Supplementary Information) (Fig. 2). The reaction proceeded in moderate-to-excellent yields with various ester nucleophiles, including ethyl ester (3ab), tert-butyl ester (3ac), benzyl ester (3ad), allyl ester (3ae) and phenyl ester (3af), providing the corresponding cis-cyclopropanes as the major products with high diastereoselectivity and without appreciable base-mediated epimerization45. Amide or nitrile-based coupling partners (3ag–3ah) led to diminished yield but maintained excellent cis-diastereoselectivity (>20:1). We found that the reaction could tolerate weaker electron-withdrawing groups, including a 2-bromopropenyl group (3ai) and various heterocycles, including isoxazole (3aj) and 1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (3ak), which gave 32%, 43% and 20% yield, respectively. An α-aryl alkyl sulfonyl fluoride nucleophile participated in the reaction to form a fully substituted carbon centre within the cyclopropane, albeit with moderate yield and d.r. (3al). Aryl-substituted methylene sulfonyl fluorides were also investigated. Interestingly, the reaction did not proceed with unsubstituted, electron-neutral benzylsulfonyl fluoride, but proceeded with substituted benzylsulfonyl fluoride substrates bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the para-position (3am–3ap). Stronger electron-withdrawing groups led to improved yields and diastereoselectivity. A meta-nitro substrate was also tolerated (3aq).

Reactions performed on 0.1 mmol scale. Percentages represent isolated yields. The d.r. was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of crude or purified reaction mixture. The diastereomeric centre is highlighted with a blue circle. aReactions performed under 20 mol% catalyst loading. bReactions performed under 5 equiv. alkyl fluoride loading. cReactions performed under 24 h. dReactions performed under 36 h.

Next, the scope of alkenes was investigated. Internal alkenes afforded good-to-moderate yields (4aa–4ae). Notably, (Z)-alkenes reacted with excellent diastereoselectivity (>20:1), affording a single diastereomer. To our delight, under the standard condition, the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable all-cis cyclopropane could be synthesized from an (E)-configured internal alkene in one step in moderate yield (4ad) with 1.1:1 d.r. In addition, α-substituted β,γ-unsaturated amide substrates are well tolerated, giving the desired products in moderate-to-excellent yields (4af–4ai). Specifically, a diene substrate (4ag) could be chemoselectively cyclopropanated at the β,γ-alkene, while leaving the δ,ε-alkene unperturbed. When the tether length between the alkene and directing group was extended and a γ,δ-unsaturated amide was tested, the cyclopropane product was furnished in moderate yield with excellent diastereoselectivity (4ak).

The methodology could be easily scaled up and performed on 1.0-mmol scale under the standard reaction conditions, giving cis-cyclopropane 3aa in 86% yield (Fig. 3a). Performing the reaction on 100 mmol scale resulted in 81% yield with 9:1 d.r. Removal of the directing auxiliary was possible through a two-step sequence46. Initial introduction of an N-Boc activating group proceeded in 83% yield (5aa). Then, hydrolysis with LiOOH/water gave carboxylic acid 6aa in 86% yield on multigram-scale, which has been commercialized by Enamine (Fig. 3b). Alternatively, a representative amine could be used in the second step in a net transamidation (58% yield, 6ab). If desired by the practitioner, the loading of nucleophile 2a can be lowered to 1.5 equiv. while maintaining comparable yield and diastereoselectivity with a dual base system (0.75 equiv. NaF and 0.25 equiv. Na2CO3) (Fig. 3c; see ‘Base screening at lower nucleophile loading' section in Supplementary Information for details).

The distinctive reactivity of alkyl sulfonyl fluorides in this cyclopropanation, along with the observed stereochemical outcomes, prompted us to examine the mechanism through experimental and computational techniques. We performed reaction progress kinetic analysis to determine key mechanistic features of the reaction from a minimal number of experiments47. First, we compared the standard reaction profile with a ‘same excess' experiment that simulated 25% conversion (Fig. 4a). Time-shifting reveals that the two curves overlap as the reaction proceeds to approximately 50% conversion; beyond this point, a slight deviation emerges—an indication of either mild product inhibition or partial catalyst deactivation. To distinguish between the two possibilities, a third experiment was performed with product 3aa (83 mM) as an additive, and overlay with the same excess experiment confirmed mild catalyst deactivation. The lack of product inhibition is notable given the capacity of the product to bind to the catalyst in a polydentate fashion. To explore potential coordination between the product and catalyst further, 3aa was treated with Pd(OAc)2 (1 equiv.), resulting in the formation of N,N,C-palladacycle Pd–3aa in which the 3 °C (cyclopropyl)–H bond was cleaved (Fig. 4b) as characterized by X-ray crystallography48. Complex Pd–3aa proved to be catalytically competent under the standard reaction conditions, showing the reversibility of C–H activation, consistent with the lack of product inhibition. Next, to estimate the order of the reaction components, we performed a series of ‘different excess' experiments (Fig. 4c). Considering that catalyst deactivation becomes more pronounced at higher conversion, we focused on the early stages of the reaction (<50% conversion). The variable time normalization analysis49 plot showed both alkene (1a) and nucleophile (2a) to be close to zero-order and Pd(OAc)2 to be close to first-order. Overall, the kinetic data are consistent with either oxidative addition or reductive elimination as the rate-determining step. To gain further insights into the rate-determining step, we conducted an Eyring analysis to obtain activation parameters (Fig. 4d). At temperatures close to standard conditions (70–100 °C), the experimental ΔS‡ was determined to be −25.8 e.u. and ΔH‡ to be 16.1 kcal mol−1 (ΔG‡80°C = 25.2 kcal mol−1). Given that large negative ΔS‡ values are commonly observed with bimolecular associative reactions50, and oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the current system are unimolecular steps, the data suggest potential desolvation and coordination of a ligand to the metal centre in traversing from the catalyst resting state to the rate-limiting transition state along the potential energy surface, which informed subsequent density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

DFT calculations with alkene 1a and alkyl sulfonyl fluoride nucleophile 2a as model substrates were performed to gain insights into various facets of the catalytic cycle, including the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining steps (Fig. 5a). A particular focus was placed on the oxidative addition mechanisms and the origin of diastereoselectivity favouring the cis-cyclopropane product 3aa. Ligand exchange of the precatalyst Pd(OAc)2 with 1a forms π-alkene PdII complex Pd-1 with the 8-aminoquinoline directing group binding to the Pd in a bidentate fashion. Two competing anti-nucleopalladation transition states with the deprotonated nucleophile 2aʹ were considered (TS1 and TS1ʹ), which lead to two different diastereomers of the palladacycle intermediate (A and Aʹ, respectively). The deprotonation of 2a to form 2aʹ is expected to be facile based on its predicted aqueous pKa value of 7.75 for 2a and the experimental pKa of 6.83 for the analogous trifluoromethanesulfonyl51,52,53 (see Supplementary Fig. 10 for details). In the more stable transition state TS1, the largest substituent on the nucleophile, SO2F, is placed anti-periplanar with the alkene C=C bond, which could minimize steric strain, whereas in the less stable diastereomeric transition state TS1ʹ, the ester group is anti-periplanar with the C=C bond (Supplementary Fig. 4). This steric effect probably leads to the 3.4 kcal mol−1 higher energy of TS1ʹ than that of TS1. Although the formation of palladacycle A is kinetically favoured in the anti-nucleopalladation, diastereomers A and Aʹ rapidly epimerize via deprotonation of the acidic α-C–H. The Na2CO3-mediated deprotonation of A to form enolate Aʹʹ is predicted to be exergonic by 8.4 kcal mol−1 (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for details). This deprotonation process is in part entropy-driven as the enolate oxygen replaces the acetate ligand in A to form a six-membered chelation with the Pd centre.

a, DFT-computed reaction energy profile of the formation of cyclopropane 3aa. The DFT calculations were performed at the ωB97X-D/def2-TZVP/SMD(DMA)//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G(d)–SDD(Pd) level of theory. The reaction energy profile was calculated at the experimental reaction temperature (80 °C). See the ‘Density functional theory (DFT) calculations' section in Supplementary Information for computational details. All Gibbs free energies and enthalpies are with respect to Pd-1. b, Oxidative addition transition states. All activation barriers are with respect to the enolate resting state Aʹʹ.

Due to the ablation of the new α-stereocentre formed after nucleopalladation, under the Curtin–Hammett conditions, the product diastereoselectivity is determined in the subsequent steps. Our calculations indicate that the oxidative addition proceeds via an SN2-type stereoinvertive mechanism (TS2 and TS2ʹ). Other oxidative addition pathways, including the four- and three-centred C–S oxidative addition (TS4–TS6; Fig. 5b) and the S–F oxidative addition16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 6), were found to be less favourable. Subsequent reductive elimination from the PdIV intermediate B (TS3) is kinetically facile with a low barrier of 1.7 kcal mol−1 with respect to B, consistent with our recent computational study on the strain-release-promoted reductive elimination from PdIV to form cyclopropane rings31. The liberated SO2F− anion then decomposes to SO2 gas and F− anion, similar to previous reports by Bull and coworkers22,23. In situ 19F NMR spectroscopy monitoring indicates that F− is ultimately converted to bifluoride (FHF−) (see ‘Fluorine tracking experiments' section in Supplementary Information for details). The computed reaction energy profile indicates that the irreversible intramolecular SN2-type oxidative addition (TS2) is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step. The computed overall barrier from the Pd–enolate resting state Aʹʹ to TS2 (ΔG‡ = 28.7 kcal mol−1, ΔH‡ = 17.5 kcal mol−1) is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally determined activation parameters. The large negative activation entropy (ΔS‡ = − 31.7 e.u. compared with the experimental value of −25.8 e.u.) is primarily attributed to entropy loss during the association of an OAc− ligand upon reprotonation of the enolate resting state Aʹʹ. The computed diastereoselectivity indicates that the SN2-type oxidative addition via TS2 leading to the cis-cyclopropane product is 3.0 kcal mol−1 more favourable than the minor pathway via TS2ʹ leading to the trans product, which is consistent with the experimentally observed diastereoselectivity (>20:1 d.r.). TS2ʹ is probably destabilized by steric interactions between the acetate ligand and the ester group. The SN2-type oxidative addition with a phenyl ester (2f) had an increased barrier (ΔG‡ = 30.9 kcal mol−1) and lower computed diastereoselectivity (ΔΔG‡ = 1.2 kcal mol−1), attributed to steric repulsions between the directing group and the ester that stabilize the transition state leading to the cis-cyclopropane product (Supplementary Fig. 9).

A highly diastereoselective PdII/PdIV-catalysed cyclopropanation of unactivated alkenes with alkyl sulfonyl fluorides has been developed. The synthetic versatility of this method stems from the diverse array of pronucleophiles that are compatible. With internal alkenes, all cis-substituted cyclopropanes that are otherwise difficult to access can be prepared in one step. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the SN2-type oxidative addition is the rate- and diastereoselectivity-determining step.

Outside of the glovebox, the appropriate alkene substrate (0.1 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.01 mmol, 10mol%) and Na2CO3 (0.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) were added to an oven-dried 1-dram (4 ml) vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The vial was then introduced into a nitrogen-filled glovebox antechamber. Once transferred inside the glovebox, alkyl sulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) was added to the vial, followed by anhydrous DMA (0.3 ml, 0.33 M). The vial was sealed with a screw-top septum cap, removed from the glovebox and placed in a heating block that was preheated to 80 °C for 14 h. After this time period, the resulting mixture was filtered through a pad of celite. Saturated NaHCO3 solution (10 ml) was added to the filtrate, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 2 ml). The combined organic layers were concentrated and purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexanes as the eluent.

How will artificial intelligence reshape the global economy? Some economists predict only a small boost — around a 0.9% increase in gross domestic product over the next ten years1. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today's jobs by 20452. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today — steering young people's career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres.

Why evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now

Why evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now

Given the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning.

Yet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI's effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools3. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022–23 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools4. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT's release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before5. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects.

Second, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers3 and software developers4 found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. If they do, the effect on those individuals could be the opposite of that estimated in controlled studies. Indeed, payroll data suggest that employment of younger workers has declined since 2022, particularly in occupations that include tasks that AI excels at, such as customer service and software development6. However, researchers are still trying to understand how much of the pattern is attributable to AI technology.

Carefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence.

Social science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.

One approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction7 — speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces.

For example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse8. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the ‘externality'.

Can AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people

Can AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people

Another illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI's disruptive potential. Studies9,10 suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated — such as creative direction or vetting final outputs — will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. These opportunities could cushion some of the disruptive effects of automation. But it might also deepen inequalities between people who thrive in these roles and those who do not.

More thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader.

As well as theory, policymakers will also need evidence to understand how the economy will change. Different types of information need to combine to form a more complete picture.

One common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking — testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. Benchmarks can assess an AI system's ability to solve mathematics problems, respond to customer-support requests or diagnose medical conditions. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance.

If AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption11,12. Other indicators include employment, job openings and whether firms that integrate AI earn higher profits and expand. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies.

Estimating AI's causal effects is difficult because the technology is evolving and organizations are adapting. But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme — whether in business, education or public health — will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer — for example, a government agency — rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots13–15. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments.

One important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. For example, one study16 examined AI usage by teachers in Sierra Leone who pay for Internet access by the megabyte. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive.

The capabilities of AI are another crucial determinant of its impact. It is hard to predict how these will evolve, but researchers can try to anticipate how humans might respond to more-powerful systems. Even as technology advances, human behaviour tends to follow stable patterns — in terms of how people develop trust, how they respond to incentives and how they adapt to automation.

The African Early Pleistocene is a time of evolutionary change and techno-behavioral innovation in human prehistory that sees the advent of our own genus, Homo, from earlier australopithecine ancestors by 2.8-2.3 million years ago. This was followed by the origin and dispersal of Homo erectus sensu lato across Africa and Eurasia between ~ 2.0 and 1.1 Ma and the emergence of both large-brained (e.g., Bodo, Kabwe) and small-brained (e.g., H. naledi) lineages in the Middle Pleistocene of Africa. Here we present a newly reconstructed face of the DAN5/P1 cranium from Gona, Ethiopia (1.6-1.5 Ma) that, in conjunction with the cranial vault, is a mostly complete Early Pleistocene Homo cranium from the Horn of Africa. Morphometric analyses demonstrate a combination of H. erectus-like cranial traits and basal Homo-like facial and dental features combined with a small brain size in DAN5/P1. The presence of such a morphological mosaic contemporaneous with or postdating the emergence of the indisputable H. erectus craniodental complex around 1.6 Ma implies an intricate evolutionary transition from early Homo to H. erectus. This finding also supports a long persistence of small-brained, plesiomorphic Homo group(s) alongside other Homo groups that experienced continued encephalization through the Early to Middle Pleistocene of Africa.

The oldest fossils assigned to our genus are ~2.8 million years old (Myr) from Ethiopia and signal a long history of Homo evolution in the Rift Valley1,2,3. There is evidence of multiple Homo lineages in Africa by 2.0–1.9 million years ago (Ma) and an archaeological and paleontological record of expansion to more temperate habitats in the Caucasus and Asia between 2.0 and 1.8 Ma4 (Fig. 1). The last appearance datum for the more archaic Homo habilis species (or “1813 group”) is ~1.67 (OH 13) or ~1.44 Ma, if KNM-ER 42703 is correctly attributed to H. habilis5, which is uncertain6. The archetypal early African Homo erectus fossils from Kenya (i.e., KNM-ER 3733, 3883; and the adolescent KNM-WT 15000) already present a suite of traits that distinguish them from early Homo taxa by 1.6–1.5 Ma, including larger brains and bodies, smaller postcanine dentition, more pronounced cranial superstructures (e.g., projecting and tall brow ridges), a relatively wide midface and nasal aperture, deep palate, and projecting nasal bridge1,6,7,8,9,10,11. The only evidence for H. erectus sensu lato in Africa before 1.8 Ma are fragmentary or juvenile fossils12,13,14, while fossils expressing both ancestral H. habilis and more derived H. erectus s.l. morphological traits are only known from Dmanisi, Georgia at 1.77 Ma15,16. Thus, H. erectus emerged from basal Homo between 2.0 and 1.6 million years ago, but when, where (Africa or Eurasia), and how it occurred remain unclear. An expanded fossil record also documents significant variation in endocranial volume17,18 and craniofacial6,8 and dentognathic morphology19,20 throughout the Early Pleistocene, which extends to the Middle Pleistocene with the addition of small-brained Homo lineages to the human tree.

The solid bars of the timeline indicate well-established first and last appearance data; the horizontal stripes indicate possible extensions of the time range based on fragmentary or juvenile fossils. Diagonal lines signal earlier archaeological presence in those regions. The question mark indicates a possible date of <1.49 Ma for the Mojokerto, Indonesia site cf.22,23,24,25. The horizontal gray bar represents the time range associated with DAN5/P1. Colors on the map indicate presence of fossils matching taxa or geographic groups of H. erectus as indicated in the timeline. Surface renderings of the best-preserved regional representatives of archaic or small-brained Homo fossils (beginning at top and continuing clockwise): D2700, KNM-ER 1813, KNM-ER 1470, KNM-ER 3733, SK 847, OH 24, KNM-WT 15000, and DAN5/P1. All surface renderings visualized at FOV 0° (parallel). Map was generated in “rnaturalearth” package68 for R.

The initial announcement of DAN5/P1 assigned it to H. erectus on the basis of derived neurocranial traits21. Subsequent analyses of neurocranial shape and endocranial morphology confirmed affinity with H. erectus but also noted similarities to early (pre-erectus) Homo fossils such as KNM-ER 181317,18. Only limited information about the partial maxilla and dentition was presented in the original description21. Yet, facial and dental traits are increasingly important in early Homo systematics, given overlap in brain size among closely related hominins6,8,22. The DAN5/P1 fossil is a rare opportunity to evaluate neurocranial, facial, and dental anatomy in a single Early Pleistocene Homo fossil and thus has significant implications for this discussion.

Here we present a new cranial reconstruction of the 1.6–1.5 Myr DAN5/P1 fossil from Gona, Ethiopia. This study demonstrates that the small-brained adult DAN5/P1 fossil (598 cm3 21) presents a previously undocumented combination of early Homo and H. erectus features in an African fossil.

Physical and virtual reconstructions of the DAN5/P1 neurocranium were presented previously17,21. The face reconstruction, which is new, involves 3D surface models generated from micro-computerized tomographic (µ-CT) scans of the left and right maxillae (hemi-palates), left infraorbital fragment of the maxilla, left zygomatic fragment containing the frontal process, right P3, and left P4-M3 (the left P3 was recovered, but not µ-CT scanned) (Fig. 2a, b). The right P3 was originally misidentified as a right P4 21 (Supplementary Note 1). The preserved fragments of the face were joined together along sutures (e.g., left infraorbital and zygomatic) or postmortem breaks (e.g., left infraorbital and hemi-palate) and the teeth were positioned with reference to dental alveoli and interdental wear facets (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1). The reconstruction applied standard virtual reconstruction techniques (e.g., repositioning and reflection of elements and landmark-based superimposition23) to fit together the five bony fragments and five postcanine teeth. There were many anatomical constraints which limited the way in which these fragments could be assembled. For example, the frontal process of the infraorbital fragment must be oriented to articulate with the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture, but the fragment must also align with the contours implied by the maxilla (including the zygomatic root) with which it was originally continuous. Its final position must also accommodate the zygomatic bone along the zygomaxillary suture. Such considerations applied to each element. The face was then hafted onto the neurocranium to produce a largely complete cranium (Fig. 2e, f); an alternative reconstruction with a more posteriorly positioned face was also generated (Supplementary Fig. 2).

In lateral view, the face is gently sloping anteriorly from below the projecting supraorbital torus, with a concave “nasocanine contour” (sensu24) (Fig. 2f). Many face dimensions in DAN5/P1 overlap with early Homo and early H. erectus from Africa and Eurasia (Table 1), but the superior facial and nasal heights of DAN5/P1 are absolutely short compared to African H. erectus and similar to, e.g., OH 24 (H. habilis) and D4500 (Dmanisi H. erectus).

The supraorbital torus is vertically thick and projecting with a continuous post-toral sulcus; this morphology is typical of H. erectus. The height of the torus at mid-orbit is within the range of other small African fossils assigned to H. erectus (Supplementary Table 9). The strong arching of the torus contributes to the circular orbit. An arched torus is variably expressed in small-brained Homo fossils (e.g., KNM-ER 1813 and KNM-OL 45500; Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). The inferior orbital margin is sharp and the frontal process of the zygomatic faces more anteriorly than antero-laterally. The ratio of cheek height to facial length in DAN5/P1 is similar to both H. habilis and early H. erectus (Table 1). Its nearly vertical midface with weakly everted nasal margins resembles early Homo and D2700 more so than other H. erectus25 and differs from the more rounded form in KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-ER 3883 (Supplementary Fig. 3). The well-developed maxillary sulcus seen in DAN5/P1 (Supplementary Fig. 5a) is more common in H. erectus than early Homo. The position of the anterior border of the maxillary zygomatic process at the P3/P4 level in DAN5/P1 is more anterior than in adult H. erectus, but was described similarly for H. naledi26. The nasal aperture does not show the widening typical of African H. erectus (Table 1). Nasal breadth is similar in DAN5/P1 and the early Homo KNM-ER 1805 fossil, but DAN5/P1 has a shorter nasal height and taller alveolar clivus than KNM-ER 1805. The subnasal clivus transitions smoothly to the nasal floor with no spinal or lateral crests; cresting is common for most early Homo / H. erectus fossils as well as H. naledi, but low topography of the nasal sill is documented in the adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and the Dmanisi sample27,28. There is a blunt anterior nasal spine, with no indication of anterior projection as in H. naledi28, although this region could be damaged.

The palate is large relative to endocranial volume, which aligns DAN5/P1 with early Homo and basal H. erectus from Eurasia, rather than East African H. erectus (Table 1). The DAN5/P1 palate has parallel molar rows and the preserved anterior alveoli suggested vertically oriented incisor roots (Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, it does not resemble the long, narrow dental arcade implied by the reconstruction of the OH 7 H. habilis specimen6. Its palate depth is in the range of H. erectus and at the high end of variation for early Homo. The incisive canal opens well behind the central incisors, which is primitive for the genus Homo16.

The nasoalveolar clivus is moderately prognathic and the squared-off anterior maxilla has a stout, rounded canine jugum that forms the “corner” of the palate. The canine alveolus housed a short, conical canine root. While short canine roots are said to be a H. erectus feature8, root length is variable and not fully characterized in Pleistocene Homo. For example, both OH 65 (early Homo)29 and D2700 (early H. erectus) fossils have longer canine roots. The canine jugum does not contribute to the lateral nasal aperture as it does in the Dmanisi sample, H. floresiensis, some early Homo (e.g., OH 24), and some African H. erectus (KNM-ER 3733). The DAN5/P1 clivus projects slightly beyond the level of the canine jugum in lateral view, which is typical for early Homo and early H. erectus1. The maxillary flexion, maxillary sulcus, canine jugum, moderately prognathic subnasal clivus, and more anterior origin of the maxillary zygomatic process in DAN5/P1 differ from the condition described for ATE7-1, a Spanish fossil recently assigned to H. aff. erectus30. A thin crest extends superiorly from the jugum toward the zygomatic root and demarcates a deep, round fossa between the lateral body of the maxilla and the anterior zygomatic process (Supplementary Fig. 5b). A similar morphology was described for the early Homo fossil A.L. 666-11 and the fossa is also seen in some Dmanisi fossils. The maxillary sinus extends into the zygomatic process laterally and the frontal process of the maxilla superiorly and septa partition the sinus anteriorly. More detailed discussion of the maxillary sulcus and its relationship to surrounding features can be found in Supplementary Note 2 and comparisons of DAN5/P1 to less complete hominins are detailed in Supplementary Note 3.

Some description of the teeth was provided in the original announcement21. We also present additional description (Supplementary Note 1), photographs (Supplementary Fig. 6) and crown dimensions (Supplementary Table 8).

Analysis of cranial (face and vault) shape using 3D landmarks demonstrates a broadly archaic-to-modern trajectory of shape differences along Principal Component (PC) 1. Low-scoring early Homo have a relatively smaller vault and longer, more prognathic face and clivus and a transversely flatter cheek compared to more derived Homo species on PC 1 (Fig. 3). There is separation of H. erectus and H. floresiensis from other Homo species, particularly Middle Pleistocene Homo and H. habilis, on PC 2. The second PC reflects the characteristic long, low vault that is wide inferiorly in H. erectus (and H. floresiensis), combined with relatively tall orbits, vertically shorter face below the orbits, and a long palate with moderate alveolar prognathism. The third PC mostly reflects unique anatomy of Neanderthals. DAN5/P1 is within the H. erectus range of variation and plots close to the adolescent (KNM-WT 15000) and subadult (D2700) H. erectus fossils in the subspace of PCs 1 and 2 and close to D2700 on PC 3 as well. As a group, these three fossils score lower than other H. erectus fossils and overlap H. habilis on PC 1, implying a higher face to neurocranium ratio compared to KNM-ER 3733. DAN5/P1 is the nearest neighbor for several H. erectus fossils in full shape space and is itself most similar to the subadult H. erectus fossil KNM-WT 15000. Of the adult fossils, DAN5/P1 is closest to KNM-ER 1813 in full shape space. The DAN5/P1 alternative reconstruction yields substantially similar results, while our reconstruction of the less complete LES1 H. naledi fossil is aligned with early Homo (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8).

We observe good taxonomic resolution based on a separate analysis of the midface, with the strongest contrasts between “early Homo“ (e.g., H. habilis) and Neanderthals on PC 1 (Fig. 4). The majority of the early Homo and H. erectus fossils separate from each other along PC 1 and DAN5/P1 is within the early Homo range on this component. The one Indonesian and two Kenyan fossils assigned to H. erectus have higher PC 1 scores, while the D2700 fossil from Dmanisi is close to both H. habilis and geologically younger members of H. erectus. Low-scoring individuals like DAN5/P1 have transversely flat midfaces, an anterior origin of the zygomatic process, a more sloped subnasal clivus and a narrower, non-projecting nasal region. The face is shallower antero-posteriorly and the anterior palate is wider and more squared off. PC 2 serves to highlight unique aspects of the early modern human face, particularly compared to H. naledi. H. habilis, H. erectus, and DAN5/P1 have more intermediate scores. This third PC contrasts the more sloping face and shorter subnasal clivus of H. naledi compared to the taller and more upright face with a projecting nasal bridge of H. erectus, H. floresiensis and KNM-ER 1805 (an early Homo fossil of uncertain species attribution). DAN5 scores lower than all H. erectus on PC 3 and near to OH 24 and KNM-ER 1813 (both H. habilis). DAN5/P1 is closest in full shape space to KNM-ER 1813 (H. habilis), but also quite similar to OH 24, the subadult D2700, and the adolescent KNM-WT 15000. Further development of the face in the adolescent KNM-WT 15000 fossil would have made it more like KNM-ER 3733, placing it further from DAN5/P1 on PC 2 as an adult (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Fig. 8).

Morphological descriptions of individual teeth are provided in Supplementary Note 2. In this section, we report results of the following metric analyses: crown size analyses based on computed crown area, tooth size apportionment analyses (TSA) that examine the relative mesiodistal (MD) and buccolingual (BL) diameters within each tooth row and normalized Elliptic Fourier Analyses (EFA) of the crown contour of each postcanine tooth. The computed crown areas (MD × BL: Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 8) for the DAN5/P1 molars fit comfortably in the range of H. habilis. Both computed and measured crown base areas reveal that M3 is largest, followed by M1 in DAN5/P1 (Supplementary Table 8). DAN5/P1 does not display the M1 < M2 size sequence typical of H. habilis, but this morphology is shared with L894-1 and is not unique among our H. habilis sample. The molars, particularly the M1 and M3 are at the high end of variation for both African and Dmanisi early H. erectus (5). There is a clear trend for premolar size reduction from early Homo to H. erectus, but the premolars of DAN5/P1 are small even in comparison with early African, Georgian, and Indonesian H. erectus.

The TSA analysis for size-corrected MD and BL crown dimensions of P3‒M3 (Fig. 6a) and P4‒M3 (Supplementary Fig. 9) mostly discriminates between H. habilis and H. erectus, reflecting the proportionally small P3, relatively MD elongated and narrow P4, MD short M1, and large M3 in the former. DAN5/P1 and D4500 have the highest PC 1 scores, but also the most extreme PC 2 scores in the sample. DAN5/P1 differs from D4500 along PC 2 in having particularly narrow premolars bucco-lingually, whereas the M1 is proportionally smaller in D4500 (Fig. 6b). Overall, DAN5/P1, D4500, and H. naledi group with H. habilis, whereas one early Homo specimen, OH 65, and D2700 group with African and Indonesian H. erectus. A previous study also suggested that OH 65 shows affinities with H. erectus in dental arcade shape6, which may reflect large intra-specific variation.

Premolar crown contours differ between early Homo and Early Pleistocene H. erectus from East Africa and Indonesia. Namely, early Homo is characterized by MD long premolars, whereas H. erectus has MD short premolar crowns (PC 1), and DAN5/P1 clusters with the former in this respect (Fig. 7a, b). Molar crown contours tend to separate African and Indonesian samples, but do not effectively distinguish H. habilis from H. erectus in East Africa (Fig. 7c–e). Specifically, MD long (Africa) versus short (Indonesia) crown of M1 and M3 (PC 1), and rectangular (Indonesia) versus rhomboid (Africa) crown of M2 (PC 2) characterize the two regional samples, and DAN5/P1 always clusters with the African sample. The shape of the M3 in DAN5/P1 is most comparable to early Homo rather than H. erectus fossils from Africa. Taken together, DAN5/P1 shows affinities with early Homo, including H. habilis, in premolar and M3 crown shape; its M1 and M2 crown contours are not taxonomically informative.

The DAN5/P1 reconstruction from Gona, Ethiopia, is a complete Early Pleistocene Homo cranium from northeast Africa (only the sixth from Africa; Fig. 1) and provides a high level of detail regarding midface morphology. DAN5/P1 is, to our knowledge, the first African fossil to exhibit a mixture of H. erectus and early Homo features. Some facial and possibly dental traits in DAN5/P1 appear to be derived for H. erectus sensu lato (e.g., deep palate, maxillary sulcus, projecting brow ridge, canine jugum, small premolars), corroborating previous work from the neurocranium (see also refs. 17,21) (Supplementary Table 10). Yet, the DAN5/P1 fossil, like the Dmanisi sample, blurs the boundaries between early Homo taxa (particularly “classic” H. habilis) and H. erectus. DAN5/P1 overlaps H. habilis and early Georgian H. erectus with regard to endocranial volume17,18, relative palate size, and dental dimensions (Figs. 2–4). For example, the M1 and M3 areas of DAN5/P1 are within the range of early Homo and early H. erectus from the Eurasian site of Dmanisi, but among the largest or exceed the values in African H. erectus (Fig. 5). Aspects of facial architecture, including the transversely flat infraorbital region, non-projecting nasal region, and anterior origin of the zygomatic process, are plesiomorphic in DAN5/P1 compared to contemporaneous H. erectus fossils from Kenya, confirmed by direct superimposition of the DAN5/P1 and KNM-ER 3733 faces (Supplementary Fig. 10). Altogether, this suggests that DAN5/P1 better reflects the basal African H. erectus morphology than the archetypal and roughly contemporaneous Kenyan H. erectus fossils (Supplementary Table 11), such as KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-WT 15000.

The evolutionary contrasts in brain size and face morphology embodied by the broadly contemporaneous DAN5/P1 and Kenyan fossils, KNM-ER 3733 and KNM-WT 15000 (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11) imply complex population structure rather than simple coexistence of two different lineages in the African Early Pleistocene. It is likely that the contrasts documented here signal between-population variation (assuming a single H. erectus species) in eastern Africa at 1.6–1.5 Ma. This view is consistent with previous depictions of H. erectus as a polytypic species across its temporo-spatial range9,31,32. The unique rift basin landscape of the East African Rift System, alongside the potential low population density of early Pleistocene hominins, could lead to population separation between the Horn of Africa and Lake Turkana lineages33,34. In this scenario, the Horn of Africa group retained the more archaic morphology of the population dispersing from Africa ~1.9 Ma, whereas the Kenyan group underwent greater in situ evolution. The more fragmentary Ethiopian H. erectus record may support this north-south division, but the larger-brained BSN/P1 H. erectus fossils from younger deposits at Gona (1.26 Ma) implies subsequent population replacement or in situ evolution (Supplementary Discussion). Other interpretations are, of course, possible. For example, an expanded fossil record could reveal high within-population variation (but see ref. 35 or interbreeding could result in the mosaic of ancestral and more derived features (Supplementary Discussion).

Assuming that the ages for DAN5/P1 (1.6–1.5 Ma), KNM-ER 3733 (~1.6 Ma), and OH 13 (H. habilis; ~1.67 Ma) are correct, the nearly complete adult cranium of DAN5/P1 not only supports the late survival of basal Homo facial and dental morphologies but also highlights the piecemeal nature of H. erectus craniodental evolution. Limitations on dating precision do not entirely preclude a chronology where DAN5/P1 is geologically older than KNM-ER 3733 (Supplementary Discussion). While this can be accommodated within the evolutionary scenario described above, it could also signal rapid anagenetic evolution between the Gona and Koobi Fora populations. DAN5/P1 also presents similarities to the Middle Pleistocene H. naledi species, including a small brain, flat nasal region, anterior origin of the zygomatic process and distinct occipital protuberance (Figs. 3 and S4f) despite its larger cheek teeth (Fig. 5a). These resemblances are interesting, but insufficient to support a specific evolutionary connection between these geographically and temporally distant groups. Nevertheless, DAN5/P1 confirms the presence of small-brained Homo fossils in Africa during the Early to Middle Pleistocene14,32,36,37,38, and future research should clarify the evolutionary importance of the resemblances between DAN5/P1 and H. naledi.

The Gona evidence, along with that from Dmanisi, hints that key behavioral/technological innovations may precede major morphological transformations. Diverse lines of evidence point to a broadened dietary range and access to animal resources at both Gona21 and Dmanisi39,40. Moreover, both Mode 1 (simple cores and flakes) and Mode 2 (Acheulean) stone tools are documented at DAN521. Yet, the endocranial volume of DAN5/P1 and the Dmanisi fossils show minimal expansion over early Homo18 and both DAN5/P1 and D4500 have large molars, including unreduced M3s41 (Fig. 6), and similar scaling of face to neurocranium as in early Homo (Fig. 2). While acknowledging high error associated with body mass estimates from cranial variables42, the relationship between orbital dimensions and body mass in hominoids suggests that DAN5/P1 was smaller than well-known contemporaries from Kenya—KNM-ER 3733 and 3883 and KNM-WT 15000—and more similar to adults from Dmanisi (Supplementary Fig. S11). The fossil pelvis BSN49/P27 also confirms the presence of a small-bodied hominin at Gona 400-700 thousand years after DAN5/P143,44. Although speculative, this pattern implies a dissociation between some morphological changes traditionally associated with H. erectus, and the shift to higher quality foods in the diet and initial appearance of Acheulean technology.

The DAN5/P1 fossil confirms that the emergence of H. erectus was not a simple story. The DAN5 site documents hominins with a combination of ancestral and more derived craniofacial/dental features who made both Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools21. The current study also adds data to the ongoing debate about the birthplace of H. erectus. Although some researchers suggest a Eurasian origin because of the earlier occurrence of H. erectus-like cranial features in Georgia45, the basal H. erectus morphology in DAN5/P1 is compatible with local evolution of H. erectus in East Africa.

Data were collected from the DAN5/P1 specimen (from the original micro-CT scans and two virtual reconstructions built from the surface renderings based on the same scan data). The cranial fragments and teeth of DAN5/P1 were µCT-scanned by T. Sasaki (Kyoto University Museum) at the National Museum of Ethiopia in 2015 on a SkyScan 1173 benchtop scanner at 100 kV and 31–63 mA with a rotation step of 0.4–0.6. The final resolution was 140 μm/pixel. Surface renderings of the cranial pieces and individual teeth were generated from the µCT scans in Avizo 3D 2021.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; hereafter “Avizo”). In addition to the virtual reconstruction of DAN5/P1 described here, the hominin sample for the comparative analyses included fossils assigned to early Homo, H. erectus sensu lato from Africa and Eurasia (including a virtual reconstruction of KNM-ER 3733, Supplementary Fig. 12), Middle Pleistocene species (including a virtual reconstruction of the small-brained H. naledi LES1, Supplementary Fig. 12, and H. floresiensis), and early H. sapiens (modern humans) (Supplementary Tables 1–3). The comparative sample of Pleistocene hominins included original fossils, virtual reconstructions and research quality casts (Supplementary Tables 1–3; Supplementary Fig. 2), including scan data from the Georgian National Museum, Kenya National Museums, American Museum of Natural History and Ethiopian National Museum.

All individuals were adult with the exception of two subadult specimens—the early adolescent KNM-WT 15000 and the older adolescent D270016—included to expand the small early H. erectus sample. The Indonesian H. erectus sample is from Sangiran, Java, which we divide into two chronological subsamples, “Sangiran Lower” and “Sangiran Upper,” given the demonstrated differences in their tooth crown size and cranio-dental morphology22,46. We exclude KNM-ER 42703 from the East African dental sample because of the severe tooth wear as well as taxonomic uncertainty of this specimen6. Taxonomic status for OH 65 is uncertain6, but we include it in H. habilis as originally proposed29. The late Middle Pleistocene H. naledi from South Africa and H. floresiensis from Indonesia are included because of their small brain size and suggested affinities with both H. habilis and H. erectus47,48.

Standard virtual reconstruction techniques were applied to the DAN5/P1 face and cranial reconstruction as reviewed by ref. 23. This involved reflecting missing elements from one side to the other, superimposition of mirrored elements, and repositioning of elements. The following Geomagic Wrap 2024.3.1 (Oqton; hereafter “Geomagic”) tools were utilized: “Duplicate,” “Mirror,” “Manual Registration” for initial superimposition with additional refinement using ‘Global Registration' or manual repositioning using “Object Mover.”

The matrix cementing the left zygomatic root fragment to the palate on that side21 was manually segmented and removed in Avizo, isolating the two pieces, but also revealing a small fragment that was displaced medially and anteriorly. This was also segmented out separately. Subsequent steps were performed in Geomagic. The right hemipalate was duplicated, mirrored, and aligned with the left palate based on the hard palate contours and dental alveoli (I1, I2, P3, and P4) (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Next, the left zygomatic root was superimposed onto the mirrored right side using local anatomical features (e.g., the vertical crest extended from the canine alveolus, the depression immediately posterior to this crest, the P3 buccal alveolus, and the anterior root of the zygomatic process; Supplementary Fig. 5). The alveolar bone that intervenes between neighboring teeth from the canine to M1 is preserved on the neighboring regions of the palate and zygomatic root, respectively, further confirming the anatomical validity of this repositioning (Supplementary Fig. 1). The small fragment of displaced bone was re-positioned by sliding it posteriorly and laterally to align with the broken edge of the zygomatic root fragment (green in Supplementary Fig. 1).

The right and left hemi-palates were then aligned along the median plane to produce a smooth contour of the subnasal clivus and roof of the palate. Both hemi-palates were duplicated and reflected across the midline to produce a more complete palate, into which the left P4 and M1 were positioned based on congruence of the roots and dental alveoli (Fig. 2). The P3 crown and complete M2 and M3 were added to the model based on alignment of corresponding interproximal wear facets and root orientation. The left infraorbital fragment of the maxilla was aligned with the superior border of the left zygomatic process, and the zygomatic fragment was further joined to this piece along the zygomaxillary suture (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). The left infraorbital and zygomatic pieces and all teeth were duplicated and reflected across the midline to create a maximally complete surface (Supplementary Fig. 2a–f).

The face was hafted to the cranial vault by aligning the preserved lateral orbital wall across the frontozygomatic suture (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) on the left and refined by maintaining continuity between the frontal process of the maxilla and the root of the nose and ensuring a reasonable orientation of the occlusal plane. The position of the face is broadly consistent with the expected orthogonal relationship of the posterior maxillary plane and neutral horizontal axis of the orbit (based on the estimated position of the junction of anterior and middle cranial fossae). The final reconstruction yields a mostly complete nasal aperture, orbital margin, infraorbital region, anterior palate, and dental arcade.

Anatomical features constrained many aspects of the reconstruction. While some virtual reconstructions produce multiple reconstructions to account for uncertainty, the complex topography of the fossil fragments constrains their positioning along multiple axes, limiting alternative arrangements that can satisfy well-established anatomical relationships. For example, the incisive canal is preserved on the medial surface of both hemipalates. This confirms good preservation of the median plane on both sides. The intermaxillary suture on the subnasal clivus is also clearly visible on the right and left fragments, where the bone rises to a gentle ridge on either side, further constraining the position of the right and left sides of the palate. As noted above, the left maxillary zygomatic root fragment was initially aligned using the mirrored right side as a guide, but the correct alignment of the canine and premolar alveoli, which are preserved on both the hemipalate and zygomatic root fragment, provides further validation (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c).

Similar considerations were used in the final positioning of the infraorbital fragment (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The medial border preserves the lateral nasal aperture, which should align in the same sagittal plane as the inferior lateral nasal wall preserved more posteriorly on the left hemipalate. The small fragment of the lateral nasal aperture preserved on the right maxilla further dictated the medio-lateral position of the infraorbital fragment. The angulation of this piece in the sagittal plane was determined by the requirement that it meet the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture superiorly and be superimposed with the mirrored right inferior nasal aperture inferiorly. There is a narrow projection of bone on the inferior border of the infraorbital fragment that appears to fit between the left hemipalate and zygomatic root fragment. We propose that this confirms that there is a natural join between the infraorbital fragment and the hemipalate/zygomatic root inferiorly. The current reconstruction produces a smooth contour from the infraorbital fragment to the subnasal contour, whereas other alignments would require flexion from the infraorbital plane to the subnasal clivus inferiorly.

Finally, the lateral positioning of the zygomatic fragment was limited by the presence of the orbital portion of the frontal bone, which articulates with the zygomatic bone on the lateral orbit wall. Simultaneously, its medial positioning was limited by the presence of the maxilla with which it also forms an articulation (zygomaxillary suture). This latter articulation also proscribes how anterior or lateral facing the zygomatic fragment can be as it must align with this suture. Moreover, the zygomatic bone preserves the orbital surface, which must be at the same vertical level as the orbital surface of the maxilla more medially. Additionally, the degree to which the zygomatic fragment is ‘hinged' along the relatively straight zygomaxillary suture is constrained by the requirements that the frontal process aligns with the course of the lateral supraorbital torus, while the frontal process of the maxilla must be oriented to intersect with the frontal bone at the frontomaxillary suture.

The biggest source of uncertainty in the current reconstruction is the hafting of the face on the vault, which we addressed with an alternative reconstruction (see next section). Smaller uncertainties are associated with the relative orientation of the left and right palate and the placement of M2 and M3, which are less constrained than the P3-M1 positions (limitations are also addressed in Supplementary Discussion).

We present an alternative reconstruction for DAN5/P1 that positions the face more posteriorly with respect to the neurocranium (Supplementary Fig. 2i). In order to match the corresponding surfaces of the lateral orbit wall on the face and vault, the face was also shifted slightly inferiorly. The overall impression is not very different, but the vertical face height is greater and less prognathic overall, with a taller orbit and deeper nasal root, and the supraorbital torus projects farther forward ahead of the inferior orbit. Further posterior shifting of the face requires additional downward movement to prevent the frontal and zygomatic bones from overlapping in the lateral orbit, which produces a disproportionately tall orbit that seems unlikely. Even in the original reconstruction, the orbital index (height/breadth) of 0.92 is equal to the highest values reported for H. erectus and early Homo, and a further inferior shift of the face would increase orbit height and create an unusual orbit shape. We re-ran the cranial principal component analysis (PCA) using the alternative reconstruction. The alternative reconstruction did not change the part of the face included in the midface topography analysis.

Taphonomic distortion in the KNM-ER 3733 fossil was corrected by first performing a retrodeformation via the procedure described by ref. 49 in the R statistical environment v. 4.5.050 and then manually repositioning the left zygomatic bone to reduce the gap between the zygomatic and frontal bones at the fronto-zygomatic suture in Geomagic (Supplementary Fig. 12a–f). The surface renderings were generated from CT scans provided by the Department of Earth Sciences, National Museums of Kenya. We used a virtual reconstruction of KNM-WT 1500051 that corrected previously described asymmetry of the face and misalignment of the face and vault. The LES1 (H. naledi) cranium is not fully reconstructed physically, but scans of the calvaria, left temporal/occipital piece, maxilla, and nasals provided by J. Martin, and a small piece of the anterior left temporal bone from the Morphosource calvaria scan (Morphosource ID: 000084599; ark:/87602/m4/M84599) were articulated and mirrored across the midline. The nasals were articulated with the frontal and then duplicated and mirrored across the midline. The maxilla articulated with the nasal bones after a small superolateral rotation of the infraorbital piece. The right inferior nasal border and infraorbital region were then duplicated and mirrored to the right side, completing the reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 12g–l).

Early Homo fossils are rare and poorly preserved, including the original KNM-ER 1470 and OH 24 fossils from Koobi Fora, Kenya, and Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, respectively. Right posterior vault and cranial base landmarks (e.g., asterion and postglenoid process) were reflected from the better-preserved left side in KNM-ER 1470 to avoid the more distorted right side. We used thin-plate spline (TPS) to estimate the position of landmarks in the regions affected by crushing of the superior vault in OH 24 (bregma, coronale, and opisthion). These “solutions” to the problem of taphonomic damage are imperfect, but the benefits of including rare African early Pleistocene fossils outweigh the disadvantages.

Linear dimensions were acquired from the 3D model of the DAN5/P1 cranial reconstruction in Geomagic and used to generate shape ratios scaled by endocranial volume or superior face length (Table 1).

Three-dimensional (3D) landmarks for the cranial analysis (Supplementary Table 4) and both landmarks and semilandmarks for the midface topography analysis (Supplementary Table 5) were collected from original fossils or casts of Pleistocene Homo fossils (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Data 1). The cranial landmarks were primarily acquired using a Microscribe 3D or Microscribe MX 3D digitizer and from surface renderings generated from CT, µCT, or surface scan data in a smaller number of cases, including the 3D model of the DAN5/P1 cranial reconstruction, using Avizo. All data for the midface analysis were collected from surface renderings in Landmark Editor52. After imputing missing landmark data (see below), the curve and surface semilandmarks were slid by minimizing the bending energy of a TPS deformation between each specimen and the sample mean shape (separately for the cranial and mid-face datasets). After sliding, all landmarks and semilandmarks were symmetrized and converted to shape variables using generalized Procrustes analysis for each dataset independently.

This was followed by principal components analysis of the superimposed cranial landmarks (41 total) or midface landmark/semlandmarks (12 and 81 total, respectively). We present PC ordinations overlaid with nearest neighbor connections calculated in full shape space. For the midface analysis, the KNM-ER 1805 fossil was projected onto the PC axes calculated from the remainder of the sample, as it suffered some taphonomic damage. Loadings on PCs were used to “warp” the surface of the DAN5/P1 surface rendering to visualize shape change in the cranium and midface analyses. Landmark and semilandmark data were processed and analyzed in RStudio v. 1.4.171753 primarily using “Morpho” v. 2.1254 and “geomorph” v. 4.0.1055,56 packages for R ordinations were produced with “ggplot2” v. 4.0.057.

Landmark estimation was considered on a case-by-case basis and tailored solutions were used in some cases (discussed below). Otherwise, landmarks were estimated using standard protocols58. Missing bilateral landmarks and semilandmarks were estimated by mirroring the preserved side (reflected relabeling) in the “Morpho” package for R. Missing landmarks and semilandmarks lacking a bilateral counterpart were estimated by deforming the sample average onto the deficient configuration using TPS interpolation in the “geomorph” package for R (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). In the cranial analysis, the TPS procedure was performed for the H. sapiens and non-H. sapiens (i.e., archaic) samples separately. In addition, four landmarks were included in the cranial TPS procedure to improve these estimates (frontomalaretemporale, parietal notch, canine-P3 interdental, M1–M2 interdental) but dropped before GPA and subsequent cranial shape analyses. Five or fewer unique landmarks were estimated for any one fossil in the cranial analyses. The average percentage of missing data was 6.9% (s.d. 2.8%) for the cranial analysis and 8.2% (s.d. 10.1%) for the midface analysis (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).

Some minimal landmark estimation was deemed necessary to fully capture the face shape of DAN5/P1 in the cranial analysis. The nasoalveolar clivus and anterior palate of DAN5/P1 was superimposed with a surface model of the A.L. 666-1 maxilla, which was better preserved anteriorly, to establish the likely position of alveolare (Supplementary Fig. 2f). A small segment of well-preserved buccal alveolar bone between the P4 and M1 was isolated and repositioned between M2 and M3 to acquire the M2-M3 inter-dental landmark (Supplementary Fig. 2h). A second paired landmark, zygomaxillare inferior, captures the transverse orientation of the cheek in this fossil. The landmark was imputed using the TPS method based on reference to the rest of the non-H. sapiens cranial sample and its reasonableness was validated by comparison to the surface model of the face reconstruction. A similar approach of reconstructing alveolar bone for recording inter-dental landmarks was applied to the KNM-ER 3733 virtual reconstruction described previously. Likewise, a local alignment of the naseoalveolar clivus and anterior palate of OH 24 and A.L. 666-1 was used to establish the position of prosthion for the former.

With regard to the cranial analysis, LES1 is the most complete cranium available for H. naledi, which is of special interest given its similarly small endocranial volume and previously noted similarity to early Homo and H. erectus. However, the LES1 reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 12g–l) would require TPS estimation of six unique landmarks, including all midline landmarks from the posterior neurocranium (opisthion, inion and lambda), which does not meet the criterion for inclusion in Fig. 2. The DH1 (H. naledi) vault, which was similar in morphology to LES1, was used to estimate the position of these midline points (Fig. S12k, l) in LES1 and the landmark configuration was projected onto the previously calculated axes from Fig. 3 and presented below.

For the midface analysis, two fossils require special mention. KNM-ER 3733 is the sole adult African H. erectus with a reasonably complete facial skeleton and LES1 is the only H. naledi with a preserved face. However, the face is damaged and requires estimation of a number of landmarks and semilandmarks in both cases (Supplementary Table 7). The nature of damage in KNM-ER 3733 allows for primarily interpolation among existing regions, but it remains the case that some error is introduced during the missing data estimation. For LES1, most missing data was located on the lateral maxilla and frontal process of the zygomatic. However, the FMT and FMO landmarks were present on the frontal bone and helped to anchor the height and breadth of the upper face. We performed a direct comparison of the DAN5/P1 and KNM-ER 3733 surfaces after scaling the latter to 86% of its original size (based on centroid size from the mid-face analysis) to validate topographic differences.

The young adolescent KNM-WT 15000 would have undergone additional facial development given its un-erupted third molars, based on analogy with extant hominoids59. We computed linear regressions of the Procrustes shape coordinates on the natural logarithm of centroid size in ontogenetic samples of Pan troglodytes (n = 12) and recent H. sapiens (n = 81) using the “RRPP” package v. 2.1.060,61 for R. We then used these two regressions to predict the adult shape of KNM-WT15000 by “growing” the fossil along each trajectory to the mean size of an adult chimp and human, respectively (developmental simulation62). This assumes a similar pattern of face development in H. erectus and either P. troglodytes or H. sapiens. The midface topography analysis was re-run with the estimated adult face shape of KNM-WT 15000.

Body mass was estimated in DAN5/P1, LB1, KNM-WT 15000, D4500, D3444, and D2700 based on the published least square regression equations based on hominoid data for orbital height and orbital area (height × breadth) as outlined in ref. 63. These were among the most reliable predictors among the cranial dimensions evaluated in that study. This was combined with estimates for other fossil hominins from the same ref. 63 and plotted alongside body mass estimates from supero-inferior femoral head diameter (or the equivalent acetabular diameter) presented in ref. 64 for additional context.

Dental measurements of DAN5/P1 were based on 3D surface models produced from the CT scan (Supplementary Data 1). Prior to measurement, slight distortion of the glued connections in the right P3 crown had been virtually restored using Avizo 3D 2021.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MD and BL diameters of the teeth of DAN5/P1 were obtained using MeshLab 2022.02, while the same measurements for the comparative specimens were collected using a digital caliper (Mitsutoyo Inc.) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm. PCA of size-adjusted MD and BL diameters of the P3‒M3 or P4‒M3 crowns was used to investigate the “TSA” in the tooth row. The size-adjustment of the variables was done by dividing each measurement by the geometric mean of all the dimensions considered (MDs and BLs for P3‒M3 or P4‒M3). This method follows the previous study65 but differs from that study in that, for PCA, we use variance-covariance matrix rather than correlation matrix for the already size-adjusted variables. Visualization of TSA for DAN5/P1 and D4500 in the subspace of PCs 1 and 2 was calculated by first scaling the PC 1 and 2 eigenvectors by the PC 1 and 2 scores for DAN5/P1 and D4500, respectively; line thickness in Fig. 6b is then proportional to the sum of the scaled eigenvectors for each fossil.

Occlusal crown contours of maxillary premolars and molars were analyzed by normalized (i.e., size-standardized) EFA. Crown contours of DAN5/P1 were extracted from their 3D surface models as viewed from infinite distance, using Avizo and Geomagic. Those for the comparative specimens were taken from standardized photographs of high-quality plaster casts. A 100 mm macro lens was used for the photography to minimize parallax effect as detailed elsewhere66. In cases where interproximal wear on a tooth was minimal and the original occlusal contour could be assessed confidently with reference to the surrounding unworn enamel, we manually reconstructed the contour. The contours were taken from the better-preserved side. Comparisons were made on the images from the right teeth or horizontally flipped images of the left teeth. The crown contour of each tooth was captured with a tooth placed so that its cervical line is horizontal (whenever a marked enamel extension was present, it was not taken into account to orientate the cervical reference plane). To compute normalized elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs), each premolar crown was aligned along the long axis of its first ellipse, and each molar crown was aligned along its MD axis. EFDs and PCAs of the normalized EFDs were conducted using the software SHAPE v. 1.367.

The DAN5/P1 fossils are curated at the National Museum of Ethiopia (accession code: DAN5/P1). The original surface renderings and 3D reconstruction of DAN5/P1 generated for this study are available under restricted access because additional permission must be obtained from the National Museum of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Heritage Authority (EHA, formerly ARRCH); data requests should be addressed to K.L.B., S.S., and M.J.R. (emails in Supplementary Note 5). Likewise, virtual reconstructions of KNM-ER 3733 generated for the current study and KNM-WT 15000 (published previously) are available by request from K.L.B. after receiving a data user agreement from the National Museums of Kenya. The virtual reconstruction of LES1 generated for the current study is available by request to K.L.B. after receiving permission from University of Witwatersrand. Scan data for other fossil hominins typically requires a data sharing agreement with the institution curating the original (or cast) of that fossil (listed in Supplementary Tables 1–3). Please contact K.L.B. (cranial analyses), S.F. (face analyses), or Y.K. (dental analyses) for more information (emails in Supplementary Note 5). The landmarks and dental dimensions generated in this study are available in the Supplementary Data file. Source data are provided with this paper.

Heart and Kidney Diseases and Type 2 Diabetes May Be One Ailment

These three disorders could really be “CKM syndrome,” which can be treated with drugs like Ozempic

By Jyoti Madhusoodanan edited by Josh Fischman

Jennifer N. R. Smith

Amy Bies was recovering in the hospital from injuries inflicted during a car accident in May 2007 when routine laboratory tests showed that her blood glucose and cholesterol were both dangerously high. Doctors ultimately sent her home with prescriptions for two standard drugs, metformin for what turned out to be type 2 diabetes and a statin to control her cholesterol levels and the heart disease risk they posed.

The combo, however, didn't prevent a heart attack in 2013. And by 2019 she was on 12 different prescriptions to manage her continued high cholesterol and her diabetes and to reduce her heart risk. The resulting cocktail left her feeling so terrible that she considered going on medical leave from work. “I couldn't even get through my day. I was so nauseated,” she said. “I would come out to my car in my lunch hour and pray that I could just not do this anymore.”

Medical researchers now think Bies's conditions were not unfortunate co-occurrences. Rather they stem from the same biological mechanisms. The medical problem frequently begins in fat cells and ends in a dangerous cycle that damages seemingly unrelated organs and body systems: the heart and blood vessels, the kidneys, and insulin regulation and the pancreas. Harm to one organ creates ailments that assault the other two, prompting further illnesses that circle back to damage the original body part.

Diseases of these three organs and systems are “tremendously interrelated,” says Chiadi Ndumele, a preventive cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University. The ties are so strong that in 2023 the American Heart Association grouped the conditions under one name: cardio-kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM), with “metabolic syndrome” referring to diabetes and obesity.

The good news, says Ndumele, who led the heart association group that developed the CKM framework, is that CKM can be treated with new drugs. The wildly popular GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro, target common pathology underlying CKM. “The thing that has really moved the needle the most has been the advances in treatment,” says Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern University. Although most of these drugs come only in injectable forms that can cost several hundred dollars a week, pill versions of some medications are up for approval, and people on Medicare could pay just $50 a month for them under a new White House pricing proposal. The appearance of these drugs on the scene is fortunate because researchers estimate that 90 percent of Americans have at least one risk factor for the syndrome.

More than a century before Bies entered the hospital, doctors had noticed that many of the conditions CKM syndrome comprises often occur together. They referred to the ensemble by terms such as “syndrome X.” People with diabetes, for instance, are two to four times more likely to develop heart disease than those without diabetes. Heart disease causes 40 to 50 percent of all deaths in people with advanced chronic kidney disease. And diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for developing kidney conditions.

At present, around 59 million adults worldwide have diabetes, about 64 million are diagnosed with heart failure, and approximately 700 million live with chronic kidney disease.

The first inkling of a connection among these disparate conditions came as far back as 1923, when several lines of research started to spot links among high blood sugar, high blood pressure and high levels of uric acid—a sign of kidney disease and gout.

Then, several decades ago, researchers identified the first step in these tangled disease pathways: dysfunction in fat cells. Until the 1940s, scientists thought fat cells were simply a stash for excess energy. The 1994 discovery of leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, showed researchers a profound way that fat could communicate with and affect different body parts.

Since then, researchers have learned that certain kinds of fat cells release a medley of inflammatory and oxidative compounds that can damage the heart, kidneys, muscles, and other organs. The inflammation they cause impairs cells' ability to respond to the pancreatic hormone insulin, which helps cells absorb sugars to fuel their activities. In addition to depriving cells of their primary energy source, insulin resistance causes glucose to build up in the blood—the telltale symptom of diabetes—further harming blood vessels and the organs they support. The compounds also reduce the ability of kidneys to filter toxins from the blood.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

Insulin resistance and persistently high levels of glucose trigger a further cascade of events. Too much glucose harms mitochondria—tiny energy producers within cells—and nudges them to make unstable molecules known as reactive oxygen species that disrupt the functions of different enzymes and proteins. This process wrecks kidney and heart tissue, causing the heart to enlarge and blood vessels to become stiffer, impeding circulation and setting the stage for clots. Diabetes reduces levels of stem cells that help to fix this damage. High glucose levels also prod the kidneys to release more of the hormone renin, which sets off a hormonal cascade critical to controlling blood pressure and maintaining healthy electrolyte levels.

At the same time, cells that are resistant to insulin shift to digesting stored fats. This metabolic move releases other chemicals that cause lipid molecules such as cholesterol to clog blood vessels. The constriction leads to spikes in blood pressure and heightens a diabetic person's risk of heart disease.

The circular connections wind even tighter. Just as diabetes can lead to heart and kidney conditions, illnesses of those organs can increase a person's risk of developing diabetes. Disruption of the kidneys' renin-angiotensin system—named for the hormones involved, which regulate blood pressure—also interferes with insulin signaling. Adrenomedullin, a hormone that increases during obesity, can also block insulin signaling in the cells that line blood vessels and the heart in humans and mice. Early signs of heart disease such as constricted blood vessels can exhaust kidney cells, which rely on a strong circulatory system to filter waste effectively.

The year before Bies's car accident, when she was in her early 30s, her primary care doctor diagnosed her with prediabetes—part of metabolic syndrome—and recommended changes such as a healthier diet and more exercise. But at the time, the physician didn't mention that this illness also increased her risk of heart disease.

Not seeing these connections creates dangers for patients like Bies. “What we've done to date is really look individually across one or two organs to see abnormalities,” says nephrologist Nisha Bansal of the University of Washington. And those narrow views have led doctors to treat the different elements of CKM as separate, isolated problems.

For instance, doctors have often used clinical algorithms to figure out a patient's risk of heart failure. But in a 2022 study, Bansal and her colleagues found that one common version of this tool does not work as well in people with kidney disease. As a result, those who had kidney disease—who are twice as likely to develop heart disease as are people with healthy kidneys—were less likely to be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner than those without kidney ailments.

In another study, researchers found that among people with type 2 diabetes—one in three of whom are likely to develop chronic kidney disease—fewer than one quarter were receiving the kidney disease screening recommended by the American Diabetes Association and KDIGO, a nonprofit group that provides guidelines for global improvements in kidney health.

At present, around 59 million adults worldwide have diabetes, about 64 million are diagnosed with heart failure, and approximately 700 million live with chronic kidney disease. Collectively, these illnesses are the leading cause of death in dozens of countries; the evidence for CKM indicates that the several epidemics may in fact be one.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

One of the first pushes for treating these diseases together came in the late 2000s. That's when Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen was scouring a database from a pharmaceutical company that listed its drug tests, in search of clinical trials of a diabetes drug named rosiglitazone. Across 42 trials, Nissen found, the data revealed a clear increase in heart attacks with the use of the drug. If the drug reduced diabetes, accompanying heart trouble should have gone down, not up, he thought.

A Senate investigation followed this vein of evidence and led to a 2007 advisory panel convened by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The discussions brought about a transformational change in how diabetes drugs were approved: It was no longer enough to simply show an improvement in blood glucose. Pharmaceutical companies would also need to demonstrate that the drugs were not linked to increased chances of developing heart health issues. Clinical trials to test the drugs would need to include people at high risk of heart or blood vessel diseases, including older adults.

Nissen recalls immense opposition to the idea and concern that the bar had been set too high. Those fears were not unfounded—many large pharmaceutical companies “abandoned the search for diabetes drugs” because the trials would take longer to complete and cost more, according to endocrinologist Daniel Drucker of the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto. “The pharma industry was 100 percent worried about this,” Drucker says.

Drucker, who at the time was studying a promising new group of drugs for diabetes, was concerned about the extra time and expense, too. But in preliminary experiments, the scrutiny for additional conditions began to pay off. In 2008, at about the same time the fda updated its guidance on diabetes drugs, Drucker and other researchers discovered that the new molecules they were investigating seemed to protect mice and rats from heart disease.

“There's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to all of this.” —Nisha Bansal, nephrologist

The new drugs mimicked a small protein named GLP-1, which normally regulates blood sugar and digestion. Small studies suggested it had wider benefits and might protect heart function in people who were hospitalized after a heart attack and angioplasty. At the time, these GLP-1 mimics were being used only as diabetes treatments. But studies in animals suggested they could do more, and subsequent trials in people showed the drugs also protected heart and kidney function. “We might not have discovered these actions of GLP-1 for some time if we hadn't been directed by the fda to really study this,” Drucker says. “In hindsight, it worked out very well.”

The regulations ended up leading to very successful multifaceted drugs. In 2013, the year that Bies had her heart attack, the fda approved the first of a group of medications that act to block a receptor known as SGLT2 in the kidneys. These so-called SGLT2 inhibitors are “almost a wonder drug,” says nephrologist Dominic Raj of George Washington University.

In a series of stunning, large trials, researchers established that these drugs lowered blood glucose, delayed the worsening of kidney disease, and were strongly correlated with reduced risk of several cardiac conditions. These studies also confirmed that cardiac, kidney and metabolic diseases are “more closely linked than we anticipated,” Bansal says. “The SGLT2 trials were really a landmark in this.”

GLP-1-mimicking drugs such as Wegovy have been similar changemakers. A clinical trial of GLP-1 medications was stopped early because the benefits were so overwhelming that it was unethical to continue giving a placebo to patients in a comparison group. In 2024 researchers compared one drug with a placebo in more than 3,500 participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. But instead of looking only at diabetes improvement, they examined kidney and heart conditions as well. The scientists found an 18 to 20 percent lower risk of death in those treated with the GLP-1 drug.

Although the GLP-1 medicines do have side effects (nausea and vomiting are some), within a few short years clinicians found that they had therapies that were designed to protect one organ but also treated others. “Now we have excellent evidence to say that not only will you have better control of your diabetes, and not only will these medicines help you lose weight, but they will prevent or attenuate the risk of developing serious heart disease and serious kidney disease,” Drucker says.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

Bies's physician prescribed her the GLP-1 receptor agonist drug Ozempic in 2024. Two months after she began the treatment, her blood glucose levels dipped below the diabetic range. Her heart is healthier, too. Doctors are “very happy with where my numbers are,” she says. And with fewer drugs in her system, Bies feels much better overall.

Not everyone is convinced that the CKM syndrome framework is necessary. Nissen, for one, says it is “a rebranding of a very old concept.” The symptoms and health risks linked to CKM overlap significantly with those of metabolic syndrome, an older term used to describe a similar constellation of health risks, he says.

Ndumele, however, disagrees with that characterization. “Although they are clearly related, CKM syndrome and metabolic syndrome have some very important differences,” he says. For one, the CKM framework encompasses more disease states. And clinicians can use the concept to identify different stages of risk: very early warning signs followed by clinical conditions—including but not limited to metabolic syndrome—and ultimately late stages of CKM, which include full-blown heart and kidney disease. “This is meant to better support prevention across the life course,” Ndumele says. Ongoing studies are testing new ways to identify those at risk of CKM early on and help with preventive care.

Patients such as Bies agree that combining care for the diseases that make up CKM could save lives. For decades she and countless other patients have struggled to manage different aspects of their health. Bies remembers that although all her doctors were affiliated with the same hospital, they didn't communicate with one another or see others' notes about her prescriptions.

A few years ago Bies joined an American Heart Association advisory committee on CKM to inform clinicians and advocate for others who deal with this complex illness, in hopes that speaking up about her own traumatic journey might help others so that “somebody else won't have to wait 10 to 12 years to advocate for themselves,” she says.

At the University of Washington, Bansal and her colleagues are testing an integrated care model in which patients meet with multiple specialists at the same time to chart out their care. It is, she says, a work in progress. “How do we actually improve the rates of screening and disease recognition and get more people who are eligible on therapies to treat CKM disease?” Bansal says. “Although there have been a lot of exciting advances, we're only at the beginning. Integrating care is always a challenge.”

Such integrations are critical to help with early diagnosis—a crucial step in squelching the rise of CKM around the world, according to Ndumele. In the future, even more specialties may need to coordinate. New research already hints at the involvement of other organs and organ systems. Cardiologist Faiez Zannad of the University of Lorraine in France suspects that as researchers glean a clearer picture, CKM syndrome will further expand to include liver disease. Zannad is investigating liver damage in heart patients because it is another common fallout of the same disease mechanisms.

Researchers and patients caution, however, that the move to group different diseases into CKM should not hinder efforts to understand each condition. Each person's course of disease—their initial diagnosis, the complications they are at greatest risk of developing and how best to treat them—can vary. “It's a very broad syndrome, and there will be nuances in terms of understanding subgroups, what the mechanisms are, and how we diagnose and treat patients,” Bansal says. “There's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to all of this.”

These Orcas Are on the Brink—And So Is the Science That Could Save Them

Inside the desperate rush to save the southern resident killer whales

By Kelso Harper edited by Seth Fletcher

Eclipse (J41) is one of 74 orcas remaining in the southern resident population.

Like many people who visit San Juan Island, I came here for the orcas. This little patch of forest and farmland off the coast of Washington State is one of the best places in the world to encounter them. But you can't schedule an orca sighting, so on a sunny July day I was killing time, wandering a lush meadow, when a bolt of adrenaline struck: I had missed three calls from Deborah Giles, a researcher at the SeaDoc Society, a marine science nonprofit. The southern residents had been spotted nearby for the first time in months. I had 40 minutes to meet her on the far side of the island.

The southern resident orcas have lived off the coast of the Pacific Northwest for thousands of years. They don't associate with any of the estimated 50,000 other orcas living around the world, even those who share the same home waters. They have their own language, customs and culture, and they are the most studied population of orcas on Earth. But because of human encroachment on the shores and waters of their territory, they are in dire trouble.

I arrived at Giles's mooring just moments before she did. She lives on whale time, meaning she will drop anything to get on the water with southern residents, the focus of her research. She told me she hasn't taken a vacation away from San Juan Island in years—it's just not relaxing. What if the southern residents appear while she's gone?

“Come on, pup, let's go!” Giles called, urging a little brown-and-white dog down the metal dock. The pup, named Eba, appeared immune to being rushed and trotted behind at the farthest extent of her leash, tongue lolling, black eyes squinting in the afternoon sun. As Giles climbed into a small motorboat and took her place behind the wheel, her husband and research partner, Jim Rappold, lifted Eba onto the bow, placing her on a carpeted platform that he built specially for her. Giles's research assistant Aisha Rashid handed everyone life vests and strapped a peach one around Eba. I hunkered down in the back near the boat's onboard wet lab—a large metal box that holds a centrifuge, various vials, and other research equipment.

We sped off through Haro Strait on the western side of the island. The southern residents used to spend so much time swimming up and down this channel that the locals took to calling the routine the “west side shuffle.” The whales would use the strait's steep underwater canyon to corner their preferred cuisine: big, fatty Chinook salmon. But as Chinook populations have declined, so have southern resident sightings near the island.

Over the past century the world around these whales has changed dramatically. Metropolitan centers bloomed on their coastlines, and their core habitat transformed into a bustling waterway. The Salish Sea grew toxic from pollutants, and the fish the orcas evolved to hunt with deadly precision became scarce. In a single whale's lifetime, humans have put the southern residents on a path toward extinction.

Deborah Giles has cataloged the southern resident killer whales that inhabit the waters around the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest for more than two decades. She is an orca researcher at the SeaDoc Society.

Giles and other scientists have devoted their careers to understanding and reversing the decline of this ancient population. By building out a picture of the whales' health, habits and diet, researchers are deciphering the many ways humans impact their lives and guiding conservation actions that may mean life or death for the orcas. But the research itself is now at risk, too. Actions by the Trump administration threaten to stall, diminish or stop a swath of conservation studies at a crucial juncture for southern residents—and for other populations that hang by a human-made thread. “The science is endangered now,” Giles said, “just like the whales.”

Orcas, like humans, are cosmopolitan animals. We live on every continent; orcas live in every ocean. Much like us, the whales have adapted to environments from the icy Antarctic to the balmy Gulf of California by being smart, social creatures. They pass down knowledge about where to forage and how to hunt. They share food and collectively care for their young. They even have their own cultural trends. In the 1980s, as human teens donned parachute pants and leg warmers, southern resident adolescents took to wearing dead salmon “hats” on their heads.

With big, wrinkly brains and high levels of intelligence, orcas seem likely to have complex internal lives. “They're clearly very smart animals; they're just different from us,” says Amy Van Cise, an assistant professor at the University of Washington, who studies orcas and other cetaceans. “Killer whales don't write books, but killer whales can echolocate. Can you echolocate?” In 2018 a southern resident whale named Tahlequah made headlines for carrying her deceased newborn for 17 days in what became known as a “tour of grief.” The mother traveled nearly 1,000 miles with her baby draped over her forehead or held gingerly in her mouth; in January 2025, when another calf died, Tahlequah repeated the ritual.

Also like us, orcas are deeply familial creatures. Resident killer whale offspring stay with their mothers for their entire lives, forming a nearly inseparable family group called a matriline. A handful of matrilines together form a pod; pods are led by older females, who can live for a century, more than twice as long as most males.

The southern residents comprise three pods: J, K and L. Historically the pods spent much of April through October in the Puget Sound and near the San Juan Islands, often gathering as a “superpod.” In colder months the pods tend to split up and spend more time on the outer coasts of Washington State, Oregon and even California. No matter how far apart, though, the pods are tied together by their shared language, diet, habits and behaviors—a culture distinct from that of any other population.

Humans and killer whales share a long, complicated history. Indigenous communities of the Pacific Northwest lived peacefully alongside orcas for thousands of years. Each tribe has its own relationship with the animals, whom they generally view as sacred—often as guardians of the sea or as family members under the waves. But settlers who arrived in the 1800s took a different view: orcas became feared and reviled as a source of competition for fishers, a vermin species to be avoided or, better yet, exterminated.

Then, in 1965, the world's first captive performing orca, Namu, opened hearts—and wallets—at the Seattle Marine Aquarium. The whale's surprisingly gentle nature (he even let his captor, Ted Griffin, ride on his back) shocked and enraptured onlookers. Soon aquariums around the globe began putting in orders for their very own killer whale, and over the next decade more than 50 orcas were captured from the Salish Sea or killed in the process. Most of these whales were southern residents. By the time the practice ended in the mid-1970s, the population had shrunk to just 71 whales.

Scientists initially had hope that the southern residents would recover. Their numbers rebounded to 98 whales by the mid-1990s. “Then, all of a sudden, we started to see this decline,” says Kim Parsons, a supervisory research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

At the time, Parsons was studying the southern residents as an undergraduate and could recognize every individual. Over the course of six years a fifth of southern residents died, including Parsons's favorite whale, J3. “He had this really cool dorsal fin,” Parsons says. “It almost looked like it was on backward.” The precipitous decline couldn't be explained by the generational losses of the captive era alone. What was going on with the southern residents?

After millennia of relative quiet, the Salish Sea is now one of the busiest waterways in North America. Around nine million people live in the surrounding drainage basin, meaning ample urban, industrial and agricultural runoff has made its way into the water. When researchers began digging into the southern residents' decline, they found an alphabet soup of toxic chemicals in the whales' blubber: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Pollutants accumulate in the flesh of animals at every level of the food chain, but they get concentrated at higher levels, and orcas sit at the very top.

But this couldn't have been the full story, because neighboring orcas that share much of the same habitat didn't experience the same decline. These other whales, known as transients—also called “Bigg's” killer whales after pioneering orca researcher Michael Bigg—eat mammals, which are a level higher on the food chain than the fish eaten by residents, so they tend to accumulate even more pollutants. The key difference: Transient orcas had plenty to eat. Southern residents did not.

Transients' favored prey—such as seals, sea lions and porpoises—have proliferated since the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 made hunting them illegal. But a combination of river damming, habitat destruction, overfishing and pollution has caused numbers of the southern residents' preferred prey, Chinook salmon, to plummet since the 1980s. Eight populations of Chinook made their way onto the endangered and threatened species lists before the southern residents joined them in 2005.

“Killer whales don't write books, but killer whales can echolocate. Can you echolocate?” —Amy Van Cise, University of Washington

In her early research, Giles found that the southern residents' lack of prey is compounded by the nearly constant disturbance the orcas experience from boats in and near the Salish Sea. The jetlike sounds of container ship engines can reverberate for miles, and many boat engines emit noise in the same frequency range that the whales use to communicate. In 2008 Giles helped to develop an acoustic device that she attached to the backs of orcas with suction cups, allowing her to eavesdrop on the whales as they hunted. She found that in noisy waters, “females will just say, ‘Screw it. I'm not even going to try to forage,'” she says. “Males will try but miss because if vessel noise is too loud, it masks the whales' ability to echolocate and find food.” The northern resident killer whales provide another comparison: they spend more time in quieter, less polluted waters off the coast of British Columbia, and their numbers have doubled since the capture era.

Today 74 southern residents remain. Decades of research have identified these three factors—pollution, vessel disturbance and lack of food—as central to the decline of the southern residents. But each of these evolving threats is a universe unto itself, with countless variables and unknowns.

The boat motor roared, and a whitewater mist prickled my skin as we neared the northern edge of Haro Strait. The sea was smooth, protected on all sides by forested islands. A towering container ship heaved across our path, and its exhaust joined a yellow-green haze that hung low across the otherwise cloudless sky. Then, just after we cleared the ship's roller-coaster wake: “Whale!” Rappold shouted.

I whipped around just in time to glimpse a giant black-and-white body crashing back into the sea. Giles smiled—we had found the southern residents.

Like corn kernels in slowly heating oil, the orca sightings began sparse and unpredictable. But at some imperceptible moment, things shifted; suddenly black fins, white tails and entire submarinelike bodies were popping out of the water just a few hundred feet away.

Research biologist Kim Parsons first studied the southern resident orcas in the early 1990s, just before the population experienced a steep decline. Parsons works at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

Giles called out behaviors for Rashid to document. “Spyhop!” she yelled when a whale periscoped its enormous head out of the water and sank back down. “Tail slap!” Giles shouted as an orca's fluke rose up and smacked the water's surface.

As the boat neared the whales, Giles pulled out three laminated sheets from behind the steering wheel. They bore photographs of a few dozen gently rounded dorsal fins—snapshots of each of the southern residents. Giles examined the fins and saddle patches (a swirly white marking behind the dorsal fin) to identify these whales as part of J-pod. But we'd found only a handful of the 27 pod members, which was unusual. Giles told me that the pods had been splitting up more in recent years, perhaps as a “divide and conquer” strategy to make the most of scarce food.

“Baby breach!” Giles called as a small body (by orca standards) shot out of the water, arced in the air and smacked back down with a belly-flop splash. A second, roughly one-ton baby followed suit. In a stroke of luck, we'd found the two southern resident calves who had survived this year. Two others hadn't made it.

At the bow of the boat, Rappold watched Eba closely. The dog's demeanor was shifting. Her body became stiff, alert, and her ever-wagging tail dropped low. She stretched over the bow, leaning her snout as close to the glassy surface as she could manage. An orca leapt out of the water in the distance, but no one looked up. All eyes were on Eba now—she had caught the scent of killer whale poop.

“Let's find it!” Rappold said, egging Eba on.

It is hard to collect whale poop. First, of course, you have to find the whales. Then one has to poop, and you need to find that poop before it sinks, gets dive-bombed by seagulls or breaks up in rough water. That's where Eba comes in: her powerful nose helps Giles home in on scat while she follows the whales at a distance.

As a scent-detection dog, Eba helps Giles home in on floating killer whale poop for collection and analysis. The researchers can measure a given orca's levels of hormones and toxic chemicals, among other factors.

Jeffery DelViscio

But orca poop is worth the effort because it is a data treasure trove. With just a pea-size glob of scat, biologists can genetically decode which individual whale produced the sample. They can measure that whale's levels of toxic chemicals and catalog the bacteria and parasites in its microbiome. Hormone analysis reveals whether the whale was pregnant, and successful pregnancies are a key marker of population health. As they accumulate data over years, researchers are fleshing out a picture of southern resident health to clarify exactly how pollution, vessel disturbance and lack of prey cumulatively impact the orcas' bodies. This work may also reveal new threats—a new contaminant or bad bacteria, perhaps—and identify struggling whales early on.

Scientists also use scat samples to get a detailed look at what these orcas eat. Until the early 2000s, researchers could study orca diets only by cutting open the stomachs of recently deceased animals or happening on them mid-hunt. Scat samples are easier to come by (relatively speaking) and provide more detailed information.

By checking fragments of DNA in a sample against a library of fish genomes, Parsons and Van Cise can identify the exact species a whale ate over a roughly 24-hour period and in what relative amounts—for instance, 60 percent Chinook salmon, 30 percent chum salmon, 10 percent halibut. Their research has shown that although the southern residents eat mainly Chinook, they also rely on a mix of other species that fluctuates throughout the year. Chum and coho salmon in particular appear to be more important than previously thought in the late summer and early fall. But the researchers still need more samples, especially between October and April, to get a full picture of the southern resident diet. Giles says it's important to know all of what the whales eat—and where and when—to ensure that they have what they need year-round. If, for example, fishery managers knew the southern residents typically eat a lot of chum in the Puget Sound in November, they could theoretically adjust the harvest of that stock to account for the whales' needs.

“The science is endangered now, just like the whales.” —Deborah Giles, The Seadoc Society

Whining softly, Eba began crab-shuffling over to the right side of the bow. Giles turned the boat to follow her path. When Eba shuffled back to the left, Giles swerved again. They followed this zigzag pattern to stay in the “scent cone” of the feces, homing in closer with each pass.

Eba became even more restless. She propped her front paws on the bow and yelped like a capuchin. (I silently wondered whether that's how she got her nickname, “Fluffy Monkey.”) We had to be getting close. Giles slowed the boat, and Rappold searched the water intently.

“Hit, hit, hit!” Rappold yelled. He tossed a handful of cereal puffs in the water to mark what he saw. Giles cranked the boat back around, leaned out from behind the steering wheel and squinted past a bright glare on the water. A trail of bubbles floated in a choppy slick, iridescent in the slanting sunlight.

“Well, what do you think?” Rappold asked Eba softly. He turned back to Giles.

“It's very weird,” Giles said. They scanned the dark surface for any signs of scat. The boat bobbed idly, water lapping against it. The outboard engine hummed. Eba barked. The hopeful, frenetic energy from moments before began to fade with the slick. Giles decided there was nothing for us to collect; we should move on.

With just a small amount of scat, scientists such as Amy Van Cise can examine the state of an orca's health and analyze its diet in great detail. Van Cise teaches at the University of Washington.

Jeffery DelViscio

Giles turned the boat around and pointed us back toward the orcas. Eba grew frenzied as we pulled away, yelping and barking, stomping around the bow and looking up expectantly at Rappold. She had sniffed admirably, but Eba doesn't get her reward—playtime with a rope toy—until Giles successfully collects a scat sample.

Giles tried to console Eba. “Good job, let's find the next one!” Eba barked at her twice. “Phew, she's mad,” Giles murmured, steering us toward the dorsal fins on the horizon.

As important as other species might be in the southern residents' diets throughout the year—and as eager as Giles and her collaborators are to know about them—Chinook still make up the bulk of the orcas' diets. But Chinook conservation is enormously complex. There are dozens of Chinook populations across hundreds of rivers from California to Alaska, each facing unique challenges, such as impassable dams, overfishing and urban development. And at each stream and tributary, it takes a lot of research, time and effort to demonstrate that Chinook conservation is a worthwhile priority for the species itself and for the whales.

To this end, Parsons and Van Cise are working to tease even more detail from the genetic mayhem of whale poop and identify which salmon runs the southern residents rely on most. “If we can target our management to specific rivers,” Van Cise says, “that might make it easier to conserve the right populations.” With proper funding, she says, they could probably tackle this genomic conundrum in the next few years. But with the way science funding plummeted in 2025, it might not happen at all.

Days after Donald Trump took office in 2025, his second administration began hollowing out federal science agencies, and it aims to shrink them further in 2026. Already the administration has canceled thousands of research grants totaling billions of dollars. “I've watched funding source after funding source just shutter its doors,” says Van Cise, who relies almost entirely on funding from NOAA, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Naval Research. She says she's lucky that she hasn't lost any current grants, but she also hasn't received any new grants—and her funding is starting to run out. This is a crucial time for her; as an early-career research professor, she is just now establishing herself in the field. “If research funding continues the way that it is,” Van Cise says, “I could watch my career die before it really even gets off the ground.”

In March 2025 Giles applied with partners at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance for an NSF grant to fund three years of an ongoing research project. Together, the researchers use drones to fly through an orca's blow and collect samples of its breath, which adds a new dimension for studying the animal's health and microbiome. They are also beginning to use infrared cameras to see whether the whales are suffering from illness or injury (hot spots can signal inflammation). But less than a month after the group submitted its application, the NSF returned it—unopened. Giles was told that was the fate of more than half of NSF applications at the time.

NOAA is central to the conservation of all endangered marine species. Staff scientists conduct research, and managers craft recovery plans, designate critical habitat, and work with states, tribes, and other nations to preserve vulnerable species. In 2025 the Trump administration thinned the agency by more than 2,000 employees through layoffs, early retirements and a deferred-resignation program. One such employee was Lynne Barre, the southern residents' recovery coordinator for two decades. Barre hadn't been planning to retire at 55 years old, but with the mass firings of probationary employees, the frozen budgets, “the uncertainty and the chaos,” she felt it was her best option. Barre says a colleague likened the situation to being on a pirate ship that someone lights on fire: “Then your choice is to walk the plank and either jump off yourself or be stabbed in the back [until you] jump off.” The Northwest Fisheries Science Center and the West Coast Regional Office—where the majority of 's southern resident work takes place—lost almost 30 percent of their staff in 2025, including many researchers with decades of expertise. “That's a huge hit to our workforce,” Barre says.

So where does that leave the southern residents? All the scientists I spoke to agree: the southern residents don't have time to spare. “It's a critical time,” Parsons says. “The population has been at this fairly low-level status for a long time, and that's not a great sign.” In 2025 Washington State enacted a new regulation requiring boats to stay at least 1,000 yards away from the southern residents; at that distance a whale tail looks smaller than a sesame seed. (Research vessels like Giles's can travel within 50 yards of the whales.) The goal is to allow the whales to hunt more easily, without a cacophony of boat motors muddying their echolocation. Van Cise says it took years of research to support this intervention, and it will take years—and more research—to see what impact it has. Barre says the same will be true for any actions related to the whales' health or diet. “If we don't have that strong foundation of science, we're not going to make very good decisions,” she says, and with such a small group of whales, there is a thin margin between recovery and the “vortex of extinction”—the point of no return.

Toward the end of our encounter with the southern residents, a mother and baby beelined toward our boat. Their slick black bodies surged rhythmically out of the water every 10 yards or so. Giles turned off the motor, and we all fell silent—except Eba, who yelped and whined. The whales emerged with heavy sighs just a few yards away. The baby tumbled around at the surface, flipping her white belly to the sky and rubbing up against her mother's back. She rolled onto her side and flapped one little pectoral fin out of the water. When her mother ducked back down and began to swim away from us, she followed.

Giles didn't collect any scat samples that day. As the whales headed south at sunset, we peeled off toward San Juan Island. There were no southern resident sightings for the rest of the week.

On my last night with Giles, we visited the place where locals used to see orcas almost every day of the summer: Lime Kiln Point State Park. It sits on the western side of the island and is home to a stately white lighthouse, a food truck (The Blowhole: Snacks with a Porpoise) and the spot we were headed to—Orca Whale Watching Point. It's where Giles saw orcas for the first time, in 1987.

Giles led us to a craggy mound of rock at the edge of the water. The last ripe orange rays of sun snuck under her hat and tangled with the wind in her hair. She sat quietly, gazing just offshore at tasseled heads of bull kelp bobbing in the surf.

“I remember looking out to the ocean, and all of the southern residents were right there,” Giles recalled, “foraging just right here, right off the kelp bed.” Below the dark, jagged water in front of us, the seafloor plummeted to nearly 1,000 feet—the deepest channel in the San Juan Islands. It was a rare place where both humans and orcas gather, just a few yards apart.

“Four decades of time that I've known about these whales, and I have just watched them fail to recover,” Giles said, looking down at a photo of her 18-year-old self kneeling on the same rocks, an orca frozen mid-breach behind her. “I'll just keep trying to figure out how to help them so we can see breaching whales right off Lime Kiln again, every day.”

Mysterious Bright Flashes in the Night Sky Baffle Astronomers

Celestial transients shine furiously and briefly. Astronomers are just beginning to understand them

By Ann Finkbeiner edited by Clara Moskowitz

Olena Shmahalo

Long, long ago a cloud of stars circled a galaxy-size black hole, safely at a distance. Then about 200 million years ago one member of the cloud bumped another, a sun-size star, and sent it toward the black hole. The black hole was a million times more massive than the sun-size star, and its gravitational pull proportionately stronger, so the star was drawn closer and closer—until it got too close. Some of the star's gas was pulled into an orbiting stream around the black hole that widened into a flat pancake called an accretion disk. The rest of the star came apart in a sudden and great flash of light.

On September 19, 2019, just before noon, the flash reached the 1.2-meter mirror of the Zwicky Transient Facility in southern California. Astronomers named the flash AT2019qiz and noted that they hadn't seen it three days before. On September 25, 2019, the 10-meter Keck I telescope in Hawaii identified AT2019qiz as a so-called tidal disruption event—a flare-up that occurs when a black hole's gravitational tides rip a small object apart. The star the size of the sun exploded with 10 billion times the sun's luminosity.

But AT2019qiz wasn't finished yet. An entirely unrelated star, maybe from the same cloud, was on an orbit that intersected AT2019qiz's newly created disk. Each time this other star splashed into the disk, it flashed, though less brilliantly than the original, pulled-apart star. In December 2023 the brightness of AT2019qiz (now the name of the disrupted star, the accretion disk and the flaring star that ran into them) peaked, dimmed down and then shot up again—a pattern that repeated nine times. Each flash marked a pass of the interloper through the disk, which occurred every 48 hours. Between 2019 and 2024, astronomers observed AT2019qiz with telescopes on the ground and in space, at wavelengths from x-ray through ultraviolet, optical and infrared. The multitelescope, multiwavelength data together confirmed that AT2019qiz was first a tidal disruption event and then a “quasi-periodic eruption.” Both are examples of phenomena astronomers call transients. Both involved unspeakable violence on unearthly scales. Neither could have been identified 20 years ago.

Transients, which are astronomical objects that appear suddenly from nowhere and usually disappear soon after, contradict the standard truth that the universe changes predictably and slowly over billions of years. They include what the typically staid National Academy of Sciences called “the most catastrophic events in spacetime.” They are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days—which is a combination of size and speed that seems impossible. If we didn't observe them, says astronomer Vikram Ravi of the California Institute of Technology, “you'd never know that physics allows these things to exist.”

But physics says everything not forbidden will, sooner or later and with some probability, happen. And astronomers, noticing these improbable things and knowing that nothing is one of a kind, began to find many more, all at the far reaches of physics. Between 1976 and 2012, the number of transients listed on the International Astronomical Union's official Transient Name Server was around five each year. Between around 2013 to 2015, that number jumped to about 100. Since 2019, scientists have seen roughly 20,000 a year. At press time, the total was 175,953 transients. Chart this rise, and it looks like a long tail with an elephant attached.

The growth has been the result of a large number of astronomical surveys, most still ongoing, “vacuuming the whole sky,” says experimental physicist Christopher Stubbs of Harvard University. For instance, the Zwicky Transit Facility, which started the jump in detections in 2019, scans the entire northern sky every two nights and compares each evening's images with the ones taken two nights before. And the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which came online in 2025, will soon survey the entire southern sky every three nights, identifying changes within 60 seconds of their detection to create near-real-time movies of the sky and finding 10 million changes every day. The elephant will go seriously nonlinear.

With such a large amount of data, astronomers can begin to study credible demographics: that is, they can move from just finding these wild, unlikely creatures to figuring out what they are. Because things that happen once and disappear are hard to study, the transients' identities—the physics that drives them, the processes that produce them—are still speculative. Most of their names are just adjectives, and “when the transient's name is a description,” says astrophysicist Raffaella Margutti of the University of California, Berkeley, “that tells you we know nothing intrinsic about them.” That's about to change.

Scientists sort transients into two main groups: events involving the deaths of stars and events around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The first known transients fell into the former category: they were supernovae, or massive stars that blow up. Before the 1600s, astronomers confidently knew of five of them; now they count tens of thousands. Supernovae fit into two general categories. One kind is the dead core of a star pulling gas from a nearby star, piling up mass until nuclear fusion restarts and goes critical and the whole thing pops off like a 20-billion-billion-billion-megaton thermonuclear bomb, which it is. It explodes in a day, stays bright for days to weeks, and fades out over months.

The other type of supernova is called a core collapse: A star burns through enough of its fuel and is massive enough that the outward push of its radiation loses to the inward pull of its gravity. Its core collapses in on itself so thoroughly that its electrons meld with the nuclei of its atoms until the star is made mostly of neutrons—a neutron star—and it shrinks in the space of one second from a radius of about 6,000 kilometers to about 10 kilometers. The collapse causes a shock wave that breaks out of the star's remaining atmosphere with a flash called a shock breakout, and minutes later the star is as bright as 10 billion suns. It fades out over months; the remnant is called a neutron star.

Beyond these two main categories, though, are many variants—the Transient Name Server identifies 31 types so far. One new kind, called a gap transient, is dimmer and probably less massive than other supernovae, and nobody knows why it explodes. Another is a superluminous supernova, twice as luminous as a core collapse supernova; it has the light of 20 billion suns, and nobody knows why it's so bright. Supernovae are by far the most numerous of the stellar-death transients, but, as astronomer James E. Gunn of Princeton University points out, stars have “a vast number of interesting ways to die.”

In 1967, for instance, the U.S. Vela satellites detected surprising flashes of extremely energetic gamma rays that could have been (but weren't) illegal nuclear tests in Earth's atmosphere; the National Enquirer thought similar flashes seen later might be a space war between alien civilizations. Eventually astronomers pooled data from the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to identify the flashes, which were the first known gamma-ray bursts—a class of transients now understood to be “the brightest of the brightest,” says astrophysicist Peter Jonker of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who observes space in high-energy wavelengths. Their light rises in seconds to the brightness of a trillion suns, and they last for seconds to hours. The fastest ones might be massive stars going supernova, collapsing so thoroughly that they don't stop at neutron stars and instead condense into star-size black holes that aim high-intensity jets of plasma at Earth.

Gamma-ray bursts may or may not be related to other high-energy stellar deaths called fast x-ray transients. Discovered in 2008, they number only around 70, although this tally will soon change. China's Einstein Probe, an x-ray satellite telescope that began collecting data in mid-2025, should find 50 to 100 fast x-ray bursts a year. “The next few years could be dramatic,” says astronomer Mansi Kasliwal of Caltech. Meanwhile, because fast x-ray transients are still rare, no one is ready to say what they are—maybe massive stars exploding, maybe neutron stars colliding before disappearing into black holes.

Another dramatic rarity is called a fast optical blue transient, or FBOT—“fast” because although it explodes at the same outrageous brightness as a superluminous supernova, its light rises and falls not in months but in days. The first FBOT, found in 2018, is officially named AT2018cow and is called Cow for short. Since then, scientists have seen 12 more Cow-like FBOTs. Astronomers know they're not supernovae—“the energy source of the normal supernovae doesn't work” for Cows, Margutti says—but aren't sure what they are. Maybe they flash when a nearby star's mass piles up onto a neutron star or a modest-size black hole, or maybe they represent shock breakouts from a star that puffed up in its later years. “Whatever they are,” says astronomer Anna Y. Q. Ho of Cornell University, who helped to find the original Cow, “they're interesting.”

In 2007 radio astronomer Duncan Lorimer and astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin, who are colleagues at West Virginia University and married, were looking in the archives of a radio telescope survey at a small galaxy 200,000 light-years away. They were interested in pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars that release jets of radio light from their magnetic poles. These lighthouselike jets sweep the sky so that whatever is in their path is exposed to a metronomically regular radio pulse every few seconds to milliseconds.

In the course of their search, Lorimer and McLaughlin found a radio spike that lasted a few milliseconds, but it didn't pulse and was so bright it saturated the telescope's instrument. Lorimer calculated its distance as seven billion light-years away. “Oh,” he thought, “it's really far.” Anything that distant and still that bright had to be sending out a billion times more energy than nearby pulsars.

This odd find is now called the Lorimer Burst. Surveys have since identified several thousand of these so-called fast radio bursts scattered throughout other galaxies, emitting in one millisecond the radio energy sent out by the sun in 100 years. “These things are weird,” Lorimer says.

Some of these possible stellar death transients could be related to a deeply strange object called a magnetar. Magnetars existed only in theory until they were observed in 1998. Their weirdness quotient is high even among transients. A magnetar is a neutron star that “rotates ridiculously fast,” making a full turn in milliseconds, says Daniel Kasen of the University of California, Berkeley, “but with a ridiculously high magnetic field.” The strength of the sun's magnetic field is somewhere around 10 gauss; a magnetar's is 1014 gauss or higher. That field is “so high it's unstable,” Ravi says. “It chaotically reconfigures itself.”

Transients are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days.

The object's magnetic field lines twist and snap and reconnect, and in the process they send out flares. The combination of absurdly strong magnetic fields and absurdly fast rotation leads to lots of explosive physics, Kasen says. In 2004 a flare from one magnetar halfway across the Milky Way ionized the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere. Astronomers know of around 30 of them in our galaxy so far.

“Magnetars are invoked to explain a lot of things we don't understand,” says Brian Metzger of Columbia University, a theoretical astrophysicist who specializes in stellar-death transients. For instance, different transients might be different phases of a magnetar's life. Magnetars might be born in the core collapse of the same massive stars as superluminous supernovae. A supernova might then condense into a pulsar and send out jets that are seen as gamma-ray bursts. Later, when the magnetar's spin period has slowed from milliseconds to seconds, its flares may be seen as a fast radio burst. Magnetars might even explain FBOTs, Ho says, but so far FBOTS are too distant for scientists to be sure.

The stellar-death transients are dying in ways intrinsic to stars. But stars can also die because they're just in the cosmically wrong place, in the nuclei of galaxies with supermassive black holes. These “nuclear transients,” the second overall category of transients, have turned up only in the past decade. They're rare and barely understood.

One reason for that is that nuclear transients “are a minefield of contamination,” says Suvi Gezari of the University of Maryland, College Park. Astronomers must distinguish the flashes of nuclear transients from supermassive black holes whose behavior varies. One percent of supermassive black holes, the quasars, are furiously, actively accreting gas and shine so brightly they can be seen near the beginning of the universe. Most of the rest are inactive and just flickering; they have gravitationally cleared out much of the space around them, and their brightness varies by just 10 to 45 percent. And another, unknown fraction are not accreting at all; they're completely black and invisible.

Nuclear transients are not active quasars, and they don't flicker—they're cosmic flash-bangs. One kind is a tidal disruption event such as AT2019qiz, a star trapped in a supermassive black hole's gravitational field and torn to smithereens. Astronomers have found around 100 tidal disruption events, each visible for a few months in the x-ray, optical and ultraviolet ranges, each with its own small accretion disk that lasts for a few tens of years. Maybe one in 10 tidal disruption events do what AT2019qiz did and become the site of another kind of nuclear transient, the quasi-periodic eruption. In these cases, an errant star passes through the tidally disrupted star's accretion disk and flares up in x-rays to the brightness of a billion suns. Such flares last minutes and repeat in hours to weeks.

Other nuclear transients may not involve stars at all and may reflect odd behavior of the black holes. One kind of transient discovered in the past decade is called a changing-look quasar (CLQ). It has the brightness of a normal quasar but rapidly changes its appearance in unexplainable ways. It should take thousands of years for a quasar to switch off and go from brilliantly active to quietly inactive. Yet astronomers have found dozens to hundreds of CLQs that change their looks by 200 percent in months—they change so much and so quickly that “they're not theoretically explainable,” says astrophysicist Paul Green of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Maybe they're the aftermath of a long-gone tidal disruption event, or maybe, he says, “we haven't watched long enough to see a change of state that's lasting.”

As if CLQs weren't improbable enough, astronomers also find ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), whose problem is in their name: “They're ambiguous,” says astrophysicist Philip Wiseman, who studies nuclear transients at the University of Southampton in England. They are a diagnosis of exclusion, a flash that isn't any other transient. ANTs are brighter than all transients except gamma-ray bursts. Their light rises slowly over months and lasts for two or more years. They've been found in data archives in numbers from a few to hundreds, depending on who's defining them. “We can find them, but we don't know what they are,” says astronomer Matthew Graham of Caltech, another nuclear-transients specialist.

These events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy.

One ANT discovered in 2020 became famous: At first astronomers thought it was an actively feeding supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy, but they couldn't find the galaxy. The lonely supermassive black hole, like a kind of negative island, is somewhere between 10 and 1,000 times the size of the one in the Milky Way. One of its names is ZTF20abrbeie; astronomers call it Scary Barbie.

ANTs could be outsize tidal disruption events—that is, instead of sun-size stars being torn apart by black holes with the mass of a million suns, they might be 10-solar-mass stars torn apart by black holes with the mass of a billion suns. Or they could be supermassive black holes moving from inactive flickering to active fiery accretion—black holes “turning on,” Graham says. Researchers are still looking for Scary Barbie's galaxy. “We're guessing at half this stuff,” Graham adds.

The obvious question is, Are some of these transients somehow aspects of the same thing? For stellar-death transients, the answer is not exactly no. Several of them may be related to one another or to magnetars; in general, they're a menu of the variables that determine how stars end their lives. For nuclear transients, the answer is unsatisfying: either a captured star or a black hole's accretion disk is brightening. For a better answer, astronomers need to collect many more nuclear transients.

Nor can stellar and nuclear transients be put together into a single grand unified theory. Such a picture should be based on their physics—specifically, the source of energy for their outbursts. “The holy grail is understanding what produced the transient,” says Eliot Quataert of Princeton, a theoretical astrophysicist studying nuclear transients. Theorists want to be able to slot energy sources into a few categories, such as radioactive decay, shocks and gravity, although some transients don't seem to fit into any of these boxes.

To figure out the energy sources and maybe unify transients, astronomers need to compare what they see in different wavelengths, which each reflect different physical processes. In supernovae, for instance, ultraviolet light comes from shock breakouts, and x-rays and radio waves come from collisions between matter ejected in the explosion and the surrounding gas. Collecting every possible photon from every physical process allows astronomers to assemble a complete picture of the event.

Accordingly, telescopes now operating in optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray and radio-wave bands are about to be joined by a series of new telescopes in space. Among them are NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will launch by mid-2027 and observe in the infrared; the Einstein Probe in x-ray; and NASA's Ultraviolet Explorer, which will launch in 2030.

You might wonder whether this is a lot of telescopes and effort just to learn about 100,000 one-offs in a universe full of 10,000 billion billion stars in 100 billion galaxies. Understanding transients is important partly for answering other astronomical questions. Supernovae are used as distance markers to enable calculations of the universe's acceleration. Both tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions hold evidence about supermassive black holes that are quiescent and therefore invisible, as well as about the all but theoretical class of black holes whose masses are between those of stellar black holes and supermassive ones. And fast radio bursts, because they are visible in the distant universe, can be used as searchlights to map the distribution of regular matter, of which only 10 percent is known.

But transients are also interesting for their own odd selves, for their ability to teach us what physics doesn't forbid. Kasen says they are “laboratories for fundamental physics and extreme conditions”; they are “physics at the extreme,” Margutti says, “and I can't probe that on Earth.” Transients show “the range of phenomena possible in the universe,” Ravi says.

These events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy released in the time it takes to buy groceries, drink a glass of water or snap your fingers. A supernova shock breakout travels the distance from Baltimore to Western Australia in half an eyeblink. A magnetar passing 160,000 kilometers away could demagnetize every credit card on Earth. A neutron star compresses a massive star to the length of a leisurely two-hour walk. The study of transients is certifiable science, but if it weren't, it would still be reason for near-holy astonishment.

Human stem cell-based embryo models provide experimentally amenable in vitro systems for developmental research. A key feature of embryo models is their multi-lineage differentiation, which allows for the study of tissue co-development. Here we develop human trunk-like structures that have morphologically organized somites and a neural tube that form through self-organized, endogenous signalling. Transcriptomic comparison with human embryo datasets suggests that human trunk-like structure cells approximate Carnegie stage 13–14 (28–35 days after fertilization). The absence of a notochord leads to a dorsal identity, but exogenous Sonic Hedgehog signalling activation ventralizes both the somites and the neural tube in a dose-dependent manner. We further identify reciprocal signalling: neural tube-derived cues induce medial ALDH1A2 in somites, which in turn generate retinoic acid signals that drive spontaneous neural-tube patterning. Together, our data highlight the value of modularity in embryo models, which we leverage to explore human trunk co-development.

In the embryo, tissues and organs mature alongside neighbouring tissues, using local interactions that are important for correct development and downstream function. For example, neighbouring tissues may provide positional information through spatially localized cues or provide signalling feedback that balances the proportions of cell fates. Inter-tissue interactions are also important for ensuring synchronized developmental timing, so that the embryo keeps a consistent pace. We refer to this inter-dependency between tissues as ‘co-development'.

There is therefore a need to investigate organogenesis at the multi-tissue level. This has been challenging using embryos because signalling pathway convergence and overlapping communication across many tissues can make it difficult to identify reciprocal interactions between any two tissues of interest. Classical experimental embryology provides a route to explore tissue interactions through manipulations including explants, transplants and excisions (see, for instance, refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8). However, these approaches are not feasible in humans owing to ethical and technical constraints, including limited long-term human embryo culture9.

Stem cell-based embryo models offer a practical alternative10. Their multi-lineage potential enables exploration of inter-tissue interactions, while bottom-up generation of specific tissues in the presence or absence of others can determine the necessity and sufficiency of these interactions11. Importantly, human pluripotent stem (PS) cell-derived models provide scalability, experimental flexibility and species-specific relevance that cannot be achieved with embryos alone.

Several models of early embryogenesis have now been developed. Human gastruloids are self-organized aggregates of PS cells that spontaneously break symmetry, differentiate to all three germ layers and undergo axial elongation and spatiotemporal gene expression along an anteroposterior (AP) axis12. However, they lack morphological complexity, including somitic epithelialization. Mouse gastruloids can form axially organized morphological somites through embedding in an extracellular matrix gel13 and even form integrated somite- and neural tube-containing structures called trunk-like structures (TLSs)14. Likewise, three-dimensional (3D) human models of somitogenesis15,16,17, the caudal neural tube18,19, structures that contain both neural and somitic mesoderm20,21,22, neuromuscular junctions23,24 and notochord progenitors25 have been described. These models showcase the remarkable modularity of embryo models to include or exclude particular tissues, in a building block-like manner. We reasoned that this could be harnessed to explore co-development, focusing particularly on the tissue interactions during axial extension.

Somitic and neural tube development needs to be coordinated to form functional organ systems, for instance, the innervation of muscles to form circuits. There is evidence of co-development between these tissues, such that signals from the neural tube promote myogenesis3,5,6,7,26 and prevent medial Sim1 expression in the somites2, while somitic signals to the neural tube promote neurogenesis8,27. However, the exploration of these interactions in humans has been hampered by a lack of appropriate experimental systems. Here, we modify a somite-only axioloid protocol to develop robust and reproducible human TLSs (hTLSs) that allow us to explore trunk development in the presence or absence of the neural tube.

We find that, owing to the absence of a notochord, the hTLS exhibits dorsal bias, but exogenous activation of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling induces ventralization in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, even without a localized SHH source, we observed neural tube patterning orthogonal to the anterior–posterior (AP) axis, mediated by somite-derived retinoic acid (RA) signalling, which we validate through an RA responsive element (RARE) reporter system. This RA signalling is required for localized PAX6 expression in the neural tube and for neurogenesis. Moreover, the neural tube was able to induce ALDH1A2 expression specifically in medial somites, a finding that we validated in mouse embryos. Our findings highlight the potential of stem cell-based embryo models to uncover the regulatory logic of co-development and show that the modular nature of embryo models can offer insights into the coordination of tissue interactions during early human organogenesis.

While mouse gastruloids embedded in low percentage Matrigel can develop organized epithelial somite structures13,14, human gastruloids had to be exposed to the Nodal signalling inhibitor SB431542 (hereafter, SB43) during pre-treatment12, to generate segments when embedded in 20% Matrigel (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These segments formed sequentially from the posterior, but they did not form rounded, epithelial structures characteristic of somitic morphology in the embryo. Instead, a protocol combining the Wnt–β-catenin activator CHIR99021 (hereafter, Chi) and SB43 at aggregation with embedding in 10% Matrigel enabled morphologically organized somitic tissue formation as axioloids15 (similar to in refs. 16,17). We adapted this protocol from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to human embryonic stem (ES) cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b) by adjusting the Chi concentration according to cell line requirements (Methods). In doing so, we noticed that higher concentrations of Chi biased the cultures towards the mesodermal fate, as expected28, while lower concentrations enabled the coformation of a morphologically organized neural tube alongside the somites (Fig. 1a). These structures increased in somite number, were elongated and displayed an organized somitic and neural tube morphology in 79% of aggregates (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c–g). Marker gene expression confirmed the presence of somitic (MEOX1+) and neural (SOX2+) identities with a pool of progenitors (SOX2+ and TBXT+) at the posterior and a presomitic mesoderm (PSM) domain (TBX6+ and MESP2+) in the tailbud region (Fig. 1c,d). Somites expressed TBX18 anteriorly, particularly in the first one to two newly formed somites, and UNCX4.1 posteriorly (Fig. 1d). As such, the structures were similar to recently described hTLSs20,21,22, with the important distinction that the protocol could be ‘fine-tuned' by adjusting the level of Chi to give somite-only or combined somite- and neural tube-containing structures, thereby allowing direct comparison between structures with the presence or absence of the neural tube.

Similar to in other in vitro models of somitogenesis15,21, we noted that the morphological organization of the hTLS was critically dependent on embedding in Matrigel and exposure to retinal, as time-matched structures without these had some degree of gene expression organization along an AP axis but no or little morphological organization of somites or the neural tube (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). We were also able to adapt the protocol to a total of ten cell lines (from five parental backgrounds), including both human ES and iPS cells, which showcases the versatility of the protocol beyond intrinsic line-to-line variability (Methods; Extended Data Fig. 2). Detailed step-by-step instructions for forming hTLSs are available at https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.e6nvw4d59lmk/v1 (ref. 29).

To better understand the morphological organization of hTLSs, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to visualize the surface morphology. This showed cell compaction differences, with loosely arranged cells in the posterior tailbud, medium compaction in the PSM and tightly compacted epithelialization in both the neural tube and somite domains (Fig. 1e), in keeping with descriptions in vertebrate embryos30,31. Likewise, the hTLS generated with a ZO-1::mEGFP line showed that both the somites and neural tube had internal ZO-1- and actin-rich lumina, with cells organized as epithelia (Fig. 1f). We therefore wanted to better understand how these epithelial tissues formed in the hTLS.

This question is particularly interesting for the neural tube because it is known to form through two modes of morphogenesis in mammals: primary and secondary. Primary neurulation involves the folding of the neural ectoderm32 and has been extensively studied because malformations are the leading cause of neural tube defects (NTDs) in humans33. By contrast, secondary neurulation—when neural cells condense to form rods that later epithelialize to form a contiguous tube—is much less understood because it accounts for only the caudal-most portion of the axis34. Exactly how secondary neurulation occurs in humans, how the two modes are coordinated and whether the human embryonic neural tube is branched at early stages or contiguous35 are still open questions in the field. Using the ZO-1::mEGFP cell line, we sometimes saw multiple or branched neural tubes, particularly at the posterior pole (Extended Data Fig. 1j). With live imaging, we observed epithelial cysts that progressively merged to generate a contiguous tract (Extended Data Fig. 1k and Supplementary Video 1). Therefore, it seems that the mode of neural tube formation in hTLS structures is similar to secondary neurulation and may prove useful in establishing the cell biological mechanisms of such phenomena in vitro.

To further characterize hTLSs over time, we collected samples at 72 h, 96 h and 120 h and performed 10× single-cell RNA sequencing. We detected populations including a neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) cell state (expressing SOX2 and TBXT), PSM (TBX6, HES7 and DLL1), determination front (RIPPLY1/2 and MESP1/2), somitic (MEOX1 and TCF15) and neural (SOX2 and PAX6) clusters (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3a–e). Cells from early timepoints mostly populated the progenitor populations, while those from later timepoints populated more mature states (Fig. 1h). In addition, we detected sub-clusters including endothelial cells (KDR+ and ETV2+; Extended Data Fig. 3f) that match previous reports of a somite-derived endothelial population in mouse TLSs14, human axioloids15 and embryos36,37. In addition, we observed a small population of mature neural cells (ONECUT2 and ELAVL3; Extended Data Fig. 3g), indicating that neurogenesis starts at 120 h in the hTLS. By contrast, we saw no evidence of notochord, non-neural ectoderm, neural crest, endoderm or lateral plate mesoderm fates, corroborating the observation that the hTLSs contain only neural tube and somitic progenitors (Fig. 1i). Bioinformatic projection onto an existing axioloid dataset15 confirmed that the hTLSs contain neural cell types not present in the somite-only version and also showed some differences in terms of gene expression in the two overlapping somitic clusters, indicating that, while comparable, hTLSs are indeed distinct entities from axioloids (Extended Data Fig. 4a–g). The hTLSs also showed similarities with other somite- and neural tube-containing models21,22 but with some notable differences, such as the absence of a notochord or endoderm (Extended Data Fig. 4h–m).

To further examine whether our annotated clusters had equivalents to the corresponding in vivo states, we projected our dataset onto a human embryonic atlas ranging from Carnegie stage (CS) 12 to CS16 (ref. 38). Our data clearly mapped to the somitic and neural progenitor populations, highlighting that the in vitro populations observed in the hTLS match the expected cell types in the human embryo (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Interestingly, when we performed label transfer for our dataset, the vast majority of cells were called as CS13–14 equivalent (day 28–35 of human development; Extended Data Fig. 5c–g), which is notably later than that predicted for human gastruloids (approximately CS8–9; day 17–21 of human development)12, indicating the substantial step forwards achieved by the hTLS protocol.

We also integrated the hTLS dataset with other in vitro protocols15,21,22 alongside the embryonic CS12–16 dataset38 for systematic comparison. We observed clear separation between in vitro and in vivo data in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) state space, particularly at early stages (Extended Data Fig. 5h), but overall unity of neural and somitic cell types across samples (Extended Data Fig. 5i), suggesting that, in general, these cell states approximated the embryonic identities of somitic and neural populations.

We next examined the spatial and temporal regulation of Hox gene expression, as these genes are known to be critical in the regulation of axial identity along the AP axis of vertebrate embryos39. We observed expression of HOXC6/8 along the full AP axis of the hTLS, while HOXC10 was only present in the posterior portion (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Temporally, there was progressive expression of HOX gene paralogues across the timepoints sampled (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Together with the lack of expression of HOX11–13, this suggests that the hTLS model approximates the thoracic and lumbar regions of the AP axis but not the sacral or caudal-most regions40. Given that termination of axial elongation is thought to be triggered by the expression of HOX13 in embryos41,42, we wondered what was mediating the extension and then termination of axial elongation in our hTLS model.

In the embryo, axis extension is supported by a population of NMPs: bipotential progenitors that give rise to both the neural and somitic cell fates43,44,45 (Fig. 2a). One basic characterization of NMPs is the co-expression of TBXT and SOX246 that is thought to underlie their bipotency, and we observed cells co-expressing these markers in the posterior of the hTLS (Fig. 2b,c). Using the RUES2-GLR cell line47, which contains TBXT-mCerulean and SOX2-mCitrine fluorescent reporters, we live-imaged the hTLS under conditions that promoted co-development of the neural tube and somites (hTLS) or conditions that biased towards somite-only (high pre-treatment Chi conditions; for example, 3 μM Chi before treatment and 1 μM Chi at aggregation) or neural tube-only fates (low pre-treatment Chi conditions; for example, 2 μM Chi before treatment and 3 μM Chi at aggregation; Fig. 2d). We observed an early bias (between 78 and 90 h) towards SOX2-only or TBXT-only expression in neural tube-only and somite-only structures, respectively, with co-developing structures maintaining a TBXT and SOX2 co-expressing domain for the longest duration, consistent with the role of NMPs in contributing to both fates.

However, the NMP domain showed a clear decrease in volume over the hTLS time course, as was confirmed by staining at the messenger RNA and protein level (Fig. 2e,f) and by our single-cell RNA sequencing data (Fig. 2g–i). Indeed, RNA velocity analysis showed evidence of bi-directional fates predicted from this population (Fig. 2j), and trajectory analysis rooted in the NMP cluster predicted endpoints in both somites and neural tube populations (Supplementary Fig. 1). Together, these data suggest that hTLSs contain an NMP population capable of bipotential cell fate differentiation, and its gradual depletion may be responsible for the resultant maximum axial length and number of somites observed in hTLSs.

In vertebrate embryos, the sequential addition of somites from the posterior unsegmented region is determined by a combination of local intrinsic oscillations of gene expression and a global signalling landscape48. Using a HES7::Achilles iPS cell line49, we observed oscillatory expression in the PSM of hTLSs, which moved posterior to anterior and stopped at the site of emergent somite formation (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Video 2), as has been described in embryos50,51. The time period of these oscillations comprised an average of 298 min (±17.2 s.d.; 4.96 h; Fig. 3c) which is consistent with in vitro measurements performed in alternative human systems (~5 h in somitoids16 and axioloids15 and 4.6 h in segmentoids17). However, an increased period of oscillations was observed for subsequent peaks, indicating that the clock is slowing down over time. This could be due to the exhaustion of the tailbud domain at these timepoints, similar to that seen in embryos at late somitogenesis52,53. Further research would be necessary to investigate the mechanism of this slowing.

We then turned our attention to the signalling landscape of the hTLS along the AP axis. In the embryo, the signalling gradients primarily responsible for the wavefront are thought to be fiboblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signalling in the posterior region and RA at the level of the somites (Fig. 3d). We observed FGF8 and FGF4 in the posterior region54,55; FGF18 expression in the first three to five newly formed somites, the determination front and the anterior PSM56; and FGFR1 in the neural tube and the determination front54,57 (Fig. 3e). We also saw posterior expression of WNT3A and AXIN2 in the tailbud (Fig. 3f), consistent with a posteriorly localized Wnt signalling gradient58,59,60,61.

Likewise, we observed strong expression of Notch signalling ligands DLL3 and DLL1 in the anterior PSM and determination front and in a salt-and-pepper organization in the neural tube (Fig. 3g–i), matching descriptions in the embryo, where a Notch-dependent mutual inhibition mechanism leads to neural differentiation62,63,64. In addition, expression of LFNG and NOTCH1 in the anterior PSM and newly formed somite is consistent with the role of Notch signalling in mediating the dynamic control of somitogenesis65 (Fig. 3g).

The crucial anterior signalling gradient that opposes the Wnt and FGF gradients is RA, which inhibits posterior FGF signalling and fine-tunes the progenitor-to-differentiated neuron gradient along the neural tube8,66. Typically, ALDH1A2 (an alcohol dehydrogenase involved in the synthesis of RA) and CYP26A1 (which degrades RA) have been used as a proxy for RA signalling status in chick67 and mouse embryos68. In the hTLS, CYP26A1 is strongly expressed in the most posterior tip of the tailbud, with ALDH1A2 expressed in the somites (Fig. 3i,j), which is indicative of a ‘source and sink' pattern creating an AP gradient of RA signalling. As such, it is likely that self-organized signalling along the AP axis provides endogenous signals that establish the clock-and-wavefront mechanism of somitogenesis in hTLSs.

In the embryo, signals from the surrounding tissues, including the notochord, lateral plate mesoderm and surface ectoderm, are all integrated to provide positional information to cells within the neural tube and somites69. In embryo models, the presence or absence of such tissues can allow us to investigate the extent of positional information in a simplified system. For instance, SHH signals from the notochord play a key role in setting up the dorsoventral (DV) axis in both the neural tube and somites (see ref. 70 for review). We therefore wondered what DV identity our hTLS structures assumed in the absence of these tissues.

On the basis of transcriptomic data analysis, we found that the hTLS neural tube has a dorsal identity (PAX6, OLIG3 and IRX3), with no detectable ventral (OLIG2 and NKX2-2/8), floor plate (FOXA2 and SHH) or roof plate markers (Fig. 4a,b). Indeed, comparison of the hTLS neural clusters with human embryonic spinal cord data71 showed that they aligned the most strongly to progenitor dorsal cell identities, excluding the roof plate (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

Source data

Likewise, the somitic identity (Extended Data Fig. 7b) of hTLS show expression of pan-somite markers (TCF15, MEOX1 and FOXC2), dorsal markers of dermomyotome (PAX3, PAX7, SIX1, SIX4 and EYA1) and syndetome (SCX; Extended Data Fig. 3c,h), with very few or no late dermatome or myotome markers (MYF5; Extended Data Fig. 7c; MYOD and MYOG not expressed). We observed few cells expressing markers of ventral somitic identity, the sclerotome, with only a handful expressing detectable PAX1 or PAX9 (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Together, this suggests that the lack of notochord leads to an overall dorsalization of both the somites and the neural tube in hTLSs.

To test whether hTLSs do still have the capacity to ventralize, we exposed the structures to varying concentrations of Smoothened agonist (SAG), which promotes SHH signalling, as well as to the small molecule cyclopamine that inhibits SHH signalling72 as a control (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Upon SAG addition, we observed increasing ventralization of hTLS structures in a dose-dependent manner, with increased expression of ventral neural tube (OLIG2 and FOXA2; Fig. 4c) and ventral somite (PAX1 and TWIST1) markers (Extended Data Fig. 7e). In addition, the morphology of hTLSs appeared to be altered under increasing SAG exposure with less compacted anterior somites (Extended Data Fig. 7f), suggesting that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition associated with ventral (sclerotome) fates could be occurring, while cyclopamine had no observable effect on hTLSs (Extended Data Fig. 7g). However, the dose-dependent ventralization of hTLSs exposed to SHH signalling was not simply all-or-nothing. Surprisingly, we observed that at high concentrations of SAG exposure, not only did proportions of OLIG2+ cells increase in the neural tube (Fig. 4d), but these were organized across an axis orthogonal to the AP axis (Fig. 4e). In the embryo, it is known that negative feedback between transcription factors acts to establish discrete domains of neural progenitor identity along the continuous SHH gradient73, and the same is probably happening in the hTLS model. However, because the hTLSs are exposed to a single, exogenous concentration of SAG throughout (rather than a localized source), the appearance of a consistent axis was surprising. In this case, we reasoned that the juxtaposition of the somites next to the neural tube may establish some aspects of an axis because the OLIG2+ domain was localized adjacent to the somites (Fig. 4c–e). We therefore set out to investigate the nature of this communication between the somites and the neural tube.

One of the primary benefits of a co-developing system such as the hTLS is the ability to use it to probe the interactions between tissues, which would otherwise present challenges in an embryonic context. Beyond the difficulties of accessing human embryonic material at these stages of development, the complexity of the signalling landscape—with signals emanating from diverse tissues and organs, across multiple spatial axes and dynamically changing over time—makes it complicated to unravel the contribution of a single tissue. In this case, we were interested in the signalling interactions between the neural tube and somites, in the absence of all other tissues (Fig. 5a).

We turned first to unbiased, computational approaches to interrogate the putative signalling ligand–receptor interactions predicted between the two tissues. Building on the expression profile of ligands and receptors of known pathways, we used CellChat74 to identify statistically significant, unidirectional interactions specifically from the somitic to the neural tissues (combining neural progenitor populations 1–3 and neuronal clusters) or the inverse interaction. This identified several putative signalling interactions, including RA, Notch, IGF, fibronectin and EphA signalling from somites to neural tissue and cholesterol, GDF, non-canonical Wnt, SEMA6 and SLITRK pathway signalling from neural to somitic tissues (Extended Data Fig. 8).

We validated the expression signatures of somite-derived RA and neural tube-derived non-canonical Wnt signalling by examining the localization of the gene corresponding to an RA-binding protein, CRABP2 (alongside ALDH1A2 and CYP26A1), which was expressed in the neural tube, as predicted, and by expression of ligands WNT5A and WNT5B in the neural tube and receptor FZD7 in the somites (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We therefore hypothesized that signalling between the two tissues in the hTLS is responsible for setting positional identity.

An additional surprise came on closer examination of the somites, where we noticed that ALDH1A2 was not uniformly localized across the somite but instead was most strongly expressed adjacent to the neural tube (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). This is in direct contrast with somite-only axioloid structures, where ALDH1A2 was shown to instead have an AP polarity15, consistent with our own experiments in axioloids (Extended Data Fig. 9). This hinted that the presence of the neural tube may bias the localization of ALDH1A2 expression to the neural tube-adjacent side, with important implications for the mechanism of mediolateral polarization in somites. Although this phenomenon does seem to be apparent from closer inspection of existing data75, we examined the same gene expression in E9.5 mouse embryos (Fig. 5c), where we likewise observed a clear medial bias of ALDH1A2 expression in the somites (Supplementary Video 3).

To verify that endogenous RA signalling was indeed occurring in hTLSs, we engineered a RARE/DR5–eGFP reporter line (where DR5 is direct-repeat-5) that contains five RARE/DR5 responsive element repeats that promote eGFP expression as a result of RA binding (FCI-GM25256-RARE), or control reporters without the RARE binding sequence (FCI-GM25256-Ctrl; Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9f). Although spontaneous reporter silencing led to a salt-and-pepper pattern of fluorescence, clear signal could be seen in both the neural tube and somites, indicating that active RA signalling is indeed occurring in the system (Fig. 5e). We also made use of an ALDH1A2 antibody to confirm protein-level expression of the enzyme in the somites of hTLS structures, although the medial bias was less clear at the protein level (Fig. 5e).

Together, these data suggest that the neural tube biases the localization of ALDH1A2 to the medial somite domain in both embryos and models, which leads to active RA signalling exposure within both the somites and the neural tube.

It remained unclear how the medially localized ALDH1A2 expression was established in somites. We reasoned that it was probably due to signalling from the neural tube, given the localization adjacent to the tube, and so turned to the other significantly enriched pathway proposed via CellChat analysis (Extended Data Fig. 8), the non-canonical Wnt (ncWnt) signalling pathway through WNT5A and WNT5B. To investigate whether ncWnt might act upstream of ALDH1A2 localization, we inhibited signalling using either IWP2 (a porcupine inhibitor targeting both canonical and ncWnt) or XAV939 (a tankyrase inhibitor targeting only canonical Wnt signalling) or activated it with recombinant WNT5A or WNT5B. While XAV393 had a mild effect on hTLS structure at 120 h (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c), this had fully resolved by 144 h, which was equivalent to the control structures (Fig. 5f,g). However, IWP2 had a sustained impact on both ALDH1A2 expression and hTLS morphology, with a lack of somitic epithelialization that mirrored the effect of the lack of retinal (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1i). WNT5A and WNT5B had little discernible effect on either the morphology or patterning of hTLS structures (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). While we cannot rule out that the lack of epithelialization could be a cause rather than a consequence of the lack of ALDH1A2 expression, it is possible that ncWnt is the signal originating in the neural tube that leads to localized ALDH1A2, which in turn drives endogenous RA signalling and subsequent epithelialization.

We next turned our attention to the downstream role of localized ALDH1A2. In the embryo, RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube is thought to have three main functions: (1) AP axis organization and morphogenesis of the neural tube, (2) promoting cellular neurogenesis and (3) mediating the DV patterning of neural tube populations (see ref. 76 for review). In addition, in the absence of RA signalling, there is an expanded domain of ventral gene expression in the neural tube77, suggesting that it has a dorsalizing influence on the neural tube.

To test whether similar effects were also occurring in hTLS structures, we prevented RA signalling either by removal of the exogenous retinal or by exposure to the pan-RA receptor (RAR) inhibitor, BMS49378. Following early (72–120 h) exposure to BMS493, hTLS structures were morphologically impaired, with a smaller overall area, and were composed of fewer organized somites, a smaller neural tube and an increased tailbud size (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). This is consistent with the role of RA signalling in axial organization and morphology, as Raldh2−/− mouse embryos die mid-gestation with aberrant morphology that includes a truncated posterior axis, small somites and an irregularly folded neural tube79. However, when hTLSs were exposed to BMS493 at later timepoints (96–120 h), there was a significant reduction in area but overall morphology was comparable to controls (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). This suggests that at this point, morphology had already been established and blocking the RA signalling might specifically affect the ongoing interactions between somites and the neural tube. Indeed, hTLS structures exposed to BMS493 at either timepoint showed much lower or no CYP26A1 in the neural tube, in contrast to control structures (Extended Data Fig. 10c) consistent with published data from chick embryos77. We therefore further investigated the proposed role of somite-derived RA signalling on the neural tube by focussing on the latter timepoint.

To investigate the role of somite-derived RA on early neurogenesis, we examined marker expression in hTLS structures, including DLL1 and NGN1 (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 10d–f). Upon RA signalling inhibition, we observed significantly fewer DLL1+ cells in the neural tube (Fig. 5f). In vitamin A deficient (VAD) quails that lack the precursor to RA, retinal, Delta-1 expression is depleted from the caudal neural tube in 9–19 somite-stage embryos8, but in the Raldh2−/− mouse model, Delta-1 expression is comparable to wild type (WT) at the 14–15 somite stage80. As such, the observation that hTLSs show RA-dependent neurogenesis hints that there may be additional species-specific differences in how RA signalling affects the neurogenesis cascade.

We next examined the role of somite-derived RA signalling on patterning in the neural tube. It is known that Raldh2−/− mice and VAD quails have depleted expression of Pax6 in the neural tube compared with WT embryos75,77. We therefore examined the expression of PAX6 in the hTLS with late RA signalling inhibition and observed a substantial depletion of this neural marker from the neural tube (Fig. 6a). Conversely, the addition of all-trans RA (ATRA) onto hTLS structures increased the expression of CYP26A1 in the neural tube, with no obvious difference in DLL1 expression and with broad expression of PAX6 across the neural tube (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Taken together, this suggests that somite-derived RA signalling is required for PAX6 expression in hTLS and, given the spontaneous neural tube patterning observed (Fig. 4), makes it likely that RA signalling is responsible for establishing this patterning. Similar SHH-independent RA signalling effects on neural progenitor identity have been shown in chick embryos81 but not in a human system.

Non-canonical Wnt signalling from the neural tube probably biases ALDH1A2 expression in the somites towards the neural tube (far left), followed by subsequent RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube (middle left). This leads to PAX6 expression being biased towards the somitic side (middle), or in the context of SAG exposure, increased OLIG2 expression adjacent to the somites (middle right). This patterning is dependent on endogenous RA signalling because inhibition leads to FOXA2 expression in the absence of other mediolateral patterning (far right).

Source data

To test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment in which we varied the concentration of SAG exposure in the presence of BMS493 to inhibit RA signalling. The logic was that if endogenous RA signalling from somites was responsible for the localized induction of OLIG2 with dose-dependent exposure to SAG, these expression patterns should be abrogated when an RA signalling inhibitor was added. Indeed, we observed decreased PAX6 expression and a marked increase in FOXA2 expression under BMS493 treatment (compare Figs. 4d and 6b) across all SAG exposures, while OLIG2 was no longer dose-responsive to SAG (Fig. 6b–d). As transcription factor networks composed of negative feedback motifs have been well described in the patterning of the neural tube82,83, it is likely that the concomitant increase in FOXA2 and decrease in PAX6 is the direct result of feedback mechanisms due to the lack of RA-responsive gene expression. The lack of dose-responsiveness to SAG also indicates that RA is necessary for fine-tuning the neural identities, while the consistent presence of PAX6+ and OLIG2+ cells always at the anterior part of the neural tube (Fig. 6d) indicates that timing of exposure to, or inhibition of, RA/SHH signalling likewise plays a role in patterning. This result showcases the flexibility of using an in vitro model to explore the interplay between endogenous signalling, intrinsic regulatory networks and exposure to external signalling factors, to better understand patterning dynamics, especially in a human context.

Taken together, these data suggest that initial ncWnt signalling from the neural tube to the somites results in the medial somitic localization of ALDH1A2 adjacent to the neural tube, which, in turn, leads to RA signalling from somites to the neural tube that promotes PAX6/OLIG2 expression specifically at the side adjacent to the somites (Fig. 6e). Integration with the SHH pathway leads to progressive ventralization while maintaining the self-organized patterning in the neural tube established by localized signalling from the somites, due at least in part to endogenous RA signalling. This reciprocal signalling between the somites and the neural tube may therefore play an important role in ensuring that correct axial patterning is coordinated between tissues and suggests that elements of a mediolateral or DV axis can be established, even in the absence of signalling centres such as the notochord or lateral plate mesoderm.

Our system has revealed several features associated with the development of the paraxial mesoderm and neural tube. Interestingly, although hTLSs represent the thoracic and lumbar region, the neural tube structures develop through a process similar to secondary neurulation, which is characteristic of the tail region32. This suggests that, in the embryo, the mode of neurulation is dependent on the early morphology at gastrulation, and because the hTLS model bypasses these morphological stages, they utilize secondary neurulation mechanisms instead. This may also explain why different species evolutionarily rely on primary and secondary neurulation to different extents84, as a function of their early morphological constraints. It would be interesting to explore in subsequent research whether this substitution in the mode of neurulation plays a role on the cell biology or fate decisions in the neural tube.

The most noteworthy findings from this work concerns signalling interactions between the paraxial mesoderm and the neural tube. For instance, the hTLS model revealed medially localized ALDH1A2 in the early somites of both hTLS and E9.5 mouse embryos. It could be that this organized gene expression is necessary for subsequent differentiation into the epaxial and hypaxial muscles85 and may represent the earliest distinction of mediolateral identity in the somites. It also demonstrates that neural tube-derived signals are sufficient to initiate mediolateral patterning in the somites, even in the absence of the intermediate or lateral plate mesoderm that would normally be localized laterally.

We also identified spontaneous patterning of the neural tube orthogonal to the AP axis, on the basis of somite-adjacent localization and due to RA-induced signalling emanating from the somites. While this is likely to reflect RA dependency rather than DV axis patterning per se, somite-derived signals in the human embryo could certainly contribute to DV axis patterning alongside the influence of the notochord. Previous research in animal models has suggested that RA signalling indeed plays an important role in DV patterning, but its precise function is often difficult to isolate owing to the complex interactions with other signalling pathways, including the SHH, Wnt and FGF pathways. For instance, VAD quail embryos exhibit a ‘dorsal shift' in neural tube patterning, with expanded domains of genes associated with a ventral identity compared with WT77, suggesting a dorsalizing role for RA signalling. This is complementary to the results we describe following RA signalling inhibition under SAG exposure, where hTLS neural tubes are ventralized. Embryo models such as hTLSs may therefore allow us to isolate pathways, disentangling the roles of different signalling mechanisms in tissue patterning.

However, while the hTLS model offers many advantages, it is important to recognize its limitations. For example, our data suggest that the notochord is not strictly required for neural tube-derived signalling to the somites, but we cannot exclude the possibility that additional relay interactions, such as notochord-induced floor plate maturation, may additionally occur in the embryo. We also cannot rule out that some of the differences between somite-only (axioloids) and somite and neural tube-containing hTLS might be partially due to differences in Chi concentration exposure. Dissection experiments where tissues are removed after specification may resolve this by decoupling the signalling induction from tissue presence or absence but would be technically challenging. These considerations highlight the distinction between embryo models and embryos, emphasizing the complementary role of such models in developmental research.

Moreover, we anticipate that hTLS models could be of value in disease modelling in the future, given their origin from human iPS cells. One notable observation from our study is the formation of the hTLS neural tube via a secondary neurulation-like process, which could prove valuable for investigating rare NTDs.

Overall, we have shown that interactions between the somites and the neural tube leads to patterning events including mediolateral ALDH1A2 expression in somites and patterning in the neural tube, mediated through localized RA signalling. These events are spontaneous and self organized, and they can enable us to explore how feedback and relay mechanisms combine to enable co-development across tissues in a human developmental context.

The hTLS model as described in this manuscript represents a human stem cell-based embryo model of post-gastrulation stages. However, the model lacks extraembryonic tissues (and is therefore ‘non-integrated' by 2021 International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) terminology on embryo models86) and additionally lacks tissues including the anterior neural, intermediate and lateral mesoderm; notochord; endoderm and non-neural ectoderm, among others. No human embryos were used in this research. All research with human ES cells was performed at the Francis Crick Institute under approval from the UK Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee (approval no. SCSC21-06). This work has been conducted in accordance with the 2021 ISSCR Guidelines.

All experiments carried out on mice (Mus musculus) were conducted according to the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act under licence no. PP6551133. The CD-1 animals were held within a Techniplast individually ventilated cage Green Line system, and the air movement in the cages was regulated by a Techniplast air management unit on negative pressure, 75 ACH/−20%, with all cages placed on automatic watering. The humidity and temperature were regulated at room level, set at code-of-practice standard levels of 20–24 °C and 55% (±10%) humidity. The light cycle was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., including dawn and dusk settings. The animals were kept on Datesand Eco Pure Chips sawdust, Bed-r'Nest nesting and smart homes enrichment, with sterilized Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet (2018S).

Embryos were obtained from five pregnant adult female mice at E9.5 and were dissected from maternal and extraembryonic tissues. Before fixation, embryos were washed in PBS for a few minutes. Mouse embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; v/v; Alfa Aesar, 43368.9 M) in RNase-free PBS (Invitrogen, AM9625) at 4 °C, then dehydrated gradually into methanol by incubating them for 5 min in a series of increasing concentrations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume, respectively) in RNase-free PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379) (PBST) on ice.

The cell lines used in this study include the human iPS cell lines HES7::Achilles49, SOX2::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0074-026)87, ZO-1::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0023)87, β-catenin::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0058 cl.67)87, LaminB1::mTagRFP-T (FCI-AICS-0034 cl.62)87 and H2B::mEGFP (FCI-AICS-0061 cl.36)87; and the human ES cell lines RUES2-GLR47 and H9 SOX2::H2B-tdTomato/T::H2B-GFP dual reporter88 (H9-SBR). Cell lines engineered to report RA activity and associated control cell lines were derived from the parental WTC-11 cell line (Coriell Institute, GM25256) expanded at the Francis Crick Institute (FCI-GM25256). This research used Crick Human Embryo and Stem Cell Unit (now Human Biology) core facility expanded cell lines made possible through the Allen Cell Collection (NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository), available from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (repository ID nos. AICS-0074-026, AICS-0023, AICS-0058, AICS-0034, AICS-0061 and GM25256). The HES7::Achilles iPS cell line was a gift from Olivier Pourquie. The H9-SBR ES cell line was a gift from Ting Zhou. The RUES2-GLR ES cell line was a gift from Ali Brivanlou. All cells were cultured in incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human PS cells were cultured routinely in either StemFit Basic 02 (Ajinomoto, discontinued in the European Union) supplemented with 80 ng ml−1 bFGF (PeproTech, 100-18B) or mTeSR 1 (STEMCELL Technologies, 85850) on 0.25 µg cm−2 recombinant Laminin iMatrix-511 silk E8-coated plates (AMSbio, AMS892 021). Cultures of 80–90% confluency were routinely passaged using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies, 07922), and single cells were seeded with medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris Biosciences, 1254). Fresh medium was exchanged daily. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.

Human cell lines genetically engineered to contain the RARE were established from FCI-GM25256 cells by transfection with the RARE/DR5 Lentiviral Dual-Reporter System (Fluorescence) (TRS-0043-2, LipExoGen Biotech). Two sets of cell lines were generated via lentiviral transfection, one reporting RA activity and the other as a negative control. In both systems, the lentiviral vector contains a dual fluorescent reporter system, containing (1) mCherry, constitutively expressed, and (2) eGFP, of which the expression is controlled by RA signalling. Specifically, eGFP expression is activated when RAR–RXR heterodimers bind to tandem direct-repeat-5 (DR5) response elements in the presence of the ligand ATRA. The control cell lines contain the eGFP sequence but lack the DR5 elements and therefore do not respond to ATRA.

FCI-GM25256 cells were transduced via lentiviral particles with the addition of polybrene 9 μg ml−1 (Sigma; TR-1003-G). Infection efficiency, as assessed by the proportion of mCherry+ cells, was evaluated 48–72 h later. A few days after infection, monoclonal and polyclonal cell lines for each construct were generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer) sorting 1 or 100 mCherry+ cells, respectively, per well. Newly generated cell lines were expanded and cultured in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 µg ml−1 blasticidin (Gibco, R21001) for selection. Functional validation of the reporter cell lines to 100 nM ATRA (Sigma-Aldrich, R2625) was evaluated after exposing the cells to ATRA for 24 h. Requests for use of this reporter line should be directed to the corresponding author.

RUES2-GLR human ES cells grown routinely in NutriStem hPSC XF were first plated as single cells at a density of 5.2–6.7 × 103 cells cm−2 on a layer of vitronectin (ThermoFisher, A14700; 5 μg ml−1, 0.5 μg cm−2) with 5 µM Y-27632 (Tocris Biosciences, 1254) for the first 24 h after plating. After further culture, they were pre-treated on the fourth day (96 h) with 4 µM CHIR99021 (Chiron; Tocris Biosciences, 4423) and 10 µM SB431542 (Stratech (Selleck Chemicals), S1067; TGFβ inhibitor) in NutriStem hPSC XF for 24 h. After this, they were dissociated in StemPro Accutase (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1110501), and 700 cells were seeded into each well of an ultralow-adherence 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 650970) in 50 μl Essential 6 medium (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1516401) supplemented with 5 µM Y-27632 and 3 µM Chiron. The medium was replaced daily with fresh Essential 6. At 76 h, the structures were embedded in 20% (v/v) Corning Matrigel growth factor-reduced basement membrane matrix, phenol red free, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus free (Corning, 356231) or Corning Matrigel human ES cell-qualified matrix, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus free (Corning, 354277) in Essential 6 medium to a final protein concentration of 1.96 mg ml−1. The 20% (v/v) Matrigel solutions were prepared on ice with ice-cold Essential 6, before plating as 5-μl droplets onto tissue-culture treated plastic on ice. Human gastruloids were collected and transferred individually into separate 5-μl droplets with a micropipette. After transfer, droplets were left to gelate for 1 h in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, before covering gently with excess Essential 6 medium pre-warmed to 37 °C.

The full protocol is available on https://www.protocols.io (ref. 29). In brief, once human PS cells were around 70–80% confluent, cells were dissociated in Accutase and seeded at a density dependent on the cell line (2–3.5 × 104 cells per well; see protocol) per well of a laminin-coated six-well plate with 2 ml StemFit 02 with 80 ng ml−1 bFGF supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632. After 5 or 6 days, cultures were pre-treated in StemFit 02 with 20 ng ml−1 bFGF supplemented with CHIR99021 (Chiron; Tocris Biosciences, 4423). Alternatively, cultures maintained in mTeSR1 were pre-treated with N2B27 supplemented with CHIR99021. N2B27 medium was prepared from a 1:1 mix of Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 12634028) and Neurobasal medium (Gibco, 21103049) supplemented with N-2 Supplement (100×; Gibco, 17502048), B27 supplement (50×) without vitamin A (Gibco, 12587010) and 1% GlutaMAX supplement (v/v; Gibco, 35050061). The optimal concentration of Chiron for pre-treatment needed to be adjusted depending on the cell line and medium used but ranged between 2 and 5 µM. The concentrations for the lines used in this study are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

After 24 h of pre-treatment, cells were dissociated with Accutase. Cell numbers were determined using an automated cell counter (NuceloCounter NC-202, ChemoMetec), and 500 cells were seeded into one well of an ultralow-adherence 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 650970) with 50 μl of either StemFit medium with 20 ng ml−1 bFGF or N2B27 (depending on the medium used for pre-treatment) and supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632, 10 µM SB431542 (TGFβ inhibitor) and a cell line-dependent concentration of Chiron (Supplementary Table 1). The plate was centrifuged at 160g at room temperature (RT) for 2 min to form a cell pellet at the bottom of the well. The following day, 150 μl fresh StemFit 02 or N2B27 was added to each well and exchanged again after 24 h with 150 μl medium. At 72 h after aggregation, 150 μl medium was removed from aggregates and they were embedded into medium containing 10% (v/v) growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 356231; protein concentration 7.3–8.8 mg ml−1) and 1 µM all-trans Retinal (Merck Sigma-Aldrich, R2500-100MG), unless stated otherwise. No further medium changes were required from this point.

hTLSs, made from the LaminB1::mTagRFP-T line at 120 h after aggregation, were recovered from Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, 354253) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS without Mg2+ or Ca2+ (Gibco, 14190144) and fixed overnight in 4% PFA (v/v) in PBS at 4 °C.

They were then additionally fixed in 4% PFA/2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 1 h at RT, washed three times for 5 min in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, v/v) in 0.1 M PB, post-fixed in 1% reduced osmium (1% OsO4/1.5% K3Fe(CN)6; v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times for 5 min in PB and then dehydrated with a graded ethanol series (70%, 90% and 2 × 100% by volume) for 20 min each at RT. The samples were then critical point dried (Leica EM CPD300 Critical Point Dryer), mounted on stubs, sputter coated with 5 nm of platinum (Quorum 150RS) and then imaged on the Quanta 250 FEG SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The SEM was operated between a chamber pressure of 4.0 and 4.38 Pa, with 30 μm aperture inserted using an accelerating voltage of 2.5 kV (Fig. 1e, top right), 3 kV (Fig. 1e, left) and 5 kV (Fig. 1e, middle and bottom right); a dwell time of 20 μs; and a working distance of 7.4 mm (Fig. 1e, bottom right), 7.6 mm (Fig. 1e, middle right), 9.2 mm (Fig. 1e, left) and 11.6 mm (Fig. 1e, top right). A 90° tilt sample holder was used for Fig. 1e (top right).

Pre-embedded structures were transferred into 1.5-ml tubes for fixation. Some structures were first recovered from Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution for 30 min at 4 °C (Figs. 4c,e and 6a and Extended Data Figs. 7g (top), 8c and 10c,e,g), although we noticed some lack of morphological integrity upon exposure, so this was not used routinely. They were then washed with PBS twice, fixed overnight in 4% PFA (v/v) at 4 °C and then washed again three times for 10 min in PBS. Then, samples were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) and 3% BSA (w/v) (PBS-BT) at RT and blocked for 2 h in PBS-BT at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C, with gentle rocking. Following several washes in PBS-BT (2 × 5 min at RT, 3 × 10 min at 4 °C and 4 × 30 min at 4 °C), samples were incubated with Alex-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies with 1:500 Phalloidin CruzFluor 647 (Santa Cruz, sc-363797) or 1:800 Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, H3570) in PBS-BT with 10% normal donkey serum (v/v) overnight at 4 °C, with gentle rocking away from light. After additional washes (3 × 10 min in PBS-BT at RT, 2 × 5 min in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Merck, T8787) and 0.2% BSA (PBT) and 3 × 15 min in PBT at RT), samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1900-10) or RapiClear 1.52 (SunJin Lab, #RC152001:10 ml) onto either a Superfrost microscopy slide (Epredia, AA00008032E01MNZ10) or coverslip (VWR, 631-0138).

The antibodies used in this study were 1:200 rabbit anti-Brachyury (Abcam, ab209665); 1:500 mouse anti-MEOX1 (ThermoFisher, TA-804716); 1:200 goat anti-SOX2 (R&D Systems, AF2018-SP), 1:200 rat anti-SOX2 (Invitrogen, 14-9811-82), 1:400 rabbit anti-PAX6 (ThermoFisher, 42-6600) and 1:500 rabbit anti-ALDH1A2 (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA010022). The mouse anti-PAX7 monoclonal antibody (1:10) developed by A. Kawakami, Tokyo Institute of Technology, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health and maintained at the Department of Biology of the University of Iowa. All secondary antibodies were raised in donkey and diluted 1:500, and included Alexa Fluor 488-, 594- and 647-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All primary antibodies were validated for sensitivity and specificity by the manufacturers, are reactive to human proteins and have been previously published.

Custom probe sets (all probe set sizes, 20 pairs), hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplifiers and buffers (hybridization, wash and amplification buffers) were purchased from Molecular Instruments. Pre-embedded structures were fixed in 4% PFA (v/v) in RNase-free PBS overnight, as described above. Samples were dehydrated gradually into methanol by incubating them for 5 min in a series of increasing concentrations (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume, respectively) in PBST and stored at −20 °C. For the HCR, samples were rehydrated gradually by incubating them for 5 min in a series of decreasing concentrations of methanol (75%, 50%, 25% and 0% by volume, respectively) in PBST. Samples were washed once more in PBST, incubated for 5 min with hybridization buffer at RT and then for a further 30 min at 37 °C, alongside a combination of probes (8 nM final), in hybridization buffer. Samples were then incubated with the probe solution overnight at 37 °C. To remove excess probes, samples were washed with probe wash buffer four times for 15 min each at 37 °C, followed by a further three washes in 5× SSCT three times for 5 min at RT. Samples were pre-amplified in amplification buffer for 30 min at RT, gently rocking. Amplifier hairpins h1 and h2 were snap-cooled separately by first heating at 95 °C for 90 s and then cooling down at RT for 30 min in the dark. Hairpin amplifiers were diluted to 6 nM in amplification buffer, added to samples and then incubated overnight in the dark at RT. Next, samples were washed in 5 × SSCT four times for 5 min, then two times for 30 min, with a final wash in PBST for 2 min. Samples were counterstained 1:1000 with Hoechst 33342 overnight at 4 °C. The next day, samples were washed three times with PBST for 5 min and post-fixed with 4% PFA (v/v) in RNase-free PBS for 20 min. Thereafter, they were washed a further three times with PBST for 5 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Samples were mounted in Vectashield or Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, P36980) onto either a Superfrost microscopy slide or coverslip, then coverslipped. The HCR probe targets and the associated amplifiers used are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

For HCR of mouse embryos, samples were rehydrated gradually by incubating them for 5 min in a series of decreasing concentrations of methanol (75%, 50%, 25% and 0% by volume, respectively) in PBST. Embryos were bleached in 6% H2O2 (v/v) in PBS for 15 min and were washed three times for 5 min each in PBST at RT. Samples were treated with 10 μg ml−1 Proteinase K (Roche, 3115879001) for 10 min (no rocking) and then washed twice for 5 min in PBST (no rocking). Afterwards, embryos were post-fixed for 20 min with 4% PFA (v/v) in RNase-free PBS at RT, gently rocking, and then washed three times for 5 min with PBST. To equilibrate embryos, samples were washed in 1:1 pre-warmed hybridization buffer and PBST for 5 min. Embryos were washed with pre-warmed hybridization buffer for 5 min before following the HCR protocol as described above.

Full details of imaging hardware and settings are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss Invert880 with Airyscan 2014 or Zeiss Invert880 NLO OPO, using a Zeiss Pan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 objective. Z-stacks were obtained with 5-µm steps, averaging each slice four times, unless stated otherwise. Any tiled images were acquired with a 10% overlap. Spectral unmixing was used for imaging HCR samples, unless stated otherwise (track method used for Figs. 1d, 2f, 3i,j and 5b,c and Extended Data Figs. 1h and 9a). In brief, spectra were set up for all HCR amplifiers by imaging droplets of snap-cooled mixed-hairpin pairs using lambda mode, and then areas were selected to save each spectrum to a spectral database. HCR images were recorded using lambda mode and linear unmixing was run with saved spectra of amplifiers, nuclear signal and autofluorescence spectra of the hTLS. Imaging data were acquired with Zeiss ZEN Black 2.3 SP1 software. Confocal images are presented either as optical slices or maximum intensity projections, generated using FIJI (2.14.0/1.54f) or Imaris (10.1.1, Oxford Instruments), unless stated otherwise. For Fig. 5g, XY images and YX optical slices were taken of hTLSs imaged in Fig. 5e using average mode in Imaris.

Brightfield, widefield or confocal spinning disk images on live samples were obtained on an ImageXpress Confocal HT.ai system with Nikon 10× S Plan Apo Lambda objective. Time-lapse imaging was acquired with intervals between 20 and 30 min under environmental control at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Data were acquired using MetaXpress (6.7.1.157) software.

After post-fixation following the HCR protocol, mouse embryos for lightsheet imaging were embedded in a cryomold in warm 1% ultralow melting agarose (Sigma, A5030) and placed on ice to polymerize. Samples were then prepared for clearing with a 1:2 solution of benzyl alcohol (Sigma, 24122) and benzyl benzoate (ThermoFisher, 105860010) (BABB). All steps were carried out in a glass vial, which was covered with foil. Mouse embryos were dehydrated gradually into methanol by incubating them for 1 h at RT with gentle rocking in a series of increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and twice in 100% by volume, respectively) in deionized water. Embryos were then incubated in a solution of 1:1 100% methanol and BABB for 1 h at RT with gentle rocking. Samples were then transferred into a 100% solution of BABB and left overnight. The next day, BABB was removed and the samples were washed in ethyl cinnamate (ECi; Sigma, 112372) for 5 min before transferring samples into fresh ECi for storage. Mouse embryos were imaged using Miltenyi-Lavision UM II with ECi as the imaging solution. Z-stacks were obtained with 1.88–4 µm steps with dynamic focus. Imaging data were collected with Imspector (7.5.4) software. Lightsheet images and videos were generated with Imaris.

Confocal images of hTLS stained with Hoechst, TBXT and SOX2 were processed through Imaris. Surfaces of whole hTLSs were generated from the Hoechst, TBXT and SOX2 channels. A new channel of the colocalized region was generated using the colocalization package in Imaris, and then a new surface was generated from this channel.

Confocal images of hTLSs stained with Hoechst, TBXT and SOX2 were processed through Imaris. Spots of nuclei were generated from the Hoechst channel and then subset to those that co-expressed TBXT and SOX2 above set thresholds that were the same across all conditions (TBXT >7,927; SOX2 >7,625). The numbers of NMP spots were then normalized to the total number of spots (nuclei).

Confocal images were imported into Imaris, and the Hoechst channel was used to create a manual surface rendering of the whole hTLS, the individual somites and the neural tube. New channels were created for fluorescent HCR signal within each structure, and this was then used to generate surfaces corresponding to positive signals within each somite.

Confocal images were imported into Imaris before using either the SOX2 channel automatically or the Hoechst channel manually to create a surface rendering of the neural tube. DLL1 expression was masked within this surface, and spots were created corresponding to the DLL1 signal within the neural tube.

The pixel classification tool Ilastik (1.4.1rc2)89 was used to label hTLS (24–144 h) in transmitted light images to generate probability maps, distinguishing the hTLS from background. CellProfiler (4.2.8)90 was used to obtain basic morphometry through the generation and measurement of objects using these probability maps. Objects touching the edge of the image and those below a pixel threshold were automatically discarded. Images were then manually checked, and sample images containing fibres and debris were discarded. The medial length was obtained through CellProfiler via ImageJ91: objects were skeletonized, and the largest, shortest branch length was selected. Quantification of somite number was measured through manual counting of segmented structures on 96–144 h hTLSs.

HES7-Achilles samples were imaged on the ImageXpress Confocal HT.ai system from 100 to 115.75 h in the hTLS protocol. Initial image analysis was performed in FIJI92, where regions of interest for HES7 oscillations and background were selected. Integrated density, mean pixel intensity and area were measured and inputted into the following formula: corrected total fluorescence = integrated density – (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background readings). De-trending was then performed in terminal on MacOS, and peaks and valleys were calculated in Microsoft Excel (16.101.2) and plotted in RStudio (2023.06.0+421).

For RA signalling manipulation of hTLSs, retinal was replaced with either dimethylsulfoxide or ATRA (100 nM) or treated with BMS493 (2.5 µM; Tocris 3509) at 72 h during embedding. In addition, for 96-h RA inhibition of hTLS, BMS493 was added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal and gently added to each well for a final concentration of 2.5 µM.

For SHH signalling activation of hTLS models, SAG (Tocris, 4366) was added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal and gently added to each well for the following final concentrations: 100 nM, 200 nM, 300 nM, 400 nM and 500 nM at 96 h. For RA inhibition of Shh signalling-activated hTLS, BMS493 was added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal for a final concentration of 2.5 µM BMS493 with final SAG concentrations of 100 nM, 200 nM, 300 nM, 400 nM and 500 nM at 96 h.

For Wnt signalling manipulation of 96 h hTLS, Wnt inhibitors, IWP 2 (PORCN inhibitor; Tocris, 3533) and XAV-939 (Selleck Chemicals, S1180) and Wnt activators, WNT5A (Bio-techne, 645-WN) and WNT5B (Bio-techne, 7347-WN), were added to 20 µl medium containing 10% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (v/v) and 1 µM all-trans retinal for final concentrations of 5 µM, 5 µM, 100 ng ml−1 and 100 ng ml−1, respectively.

Samples from each timepoint were collected from 96-well plates and pooled together. TrypLE Select was added to the samples and they were incubated at 37 °C for 15–20 min. Samples were gently pipetted up and down until the hTLSs were dissociated into single cells. The cells were then spun in the centrifuge at 170g for 4 min and resuspended in PBS−/− + 0.04% BSA (v/v) and kept on ice until further processing. The concentration and viability of the single-cell suspension was measured using acridine orange and propidium iodide with a Luna-FX7 Automatic Cell Counter. A total of 13,200 cells were loaded onto a chromium chip and partitioned in nanolitre scale droplets using the Chromium Controller and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Reagents (where GEM is Gel Bead-in Emulsion; CG000315 Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1, Dual Index)). Within each droplet, the cells were lysed and the RNA was reverse transcribed. All of the resulting complementary DNA within a droplet shared the same cell barcode. Illumina-compatible libraries were generated from the cDNA using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell library reagents in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics, CG000315 Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits User Guide (v3.1, Dual Index)). Final libraries were quality controlled using the Agilent TapeStation and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The sequencing read configuration was 28–10–10–90.

FASTQ files were aligned to the hg38 transcriptome, and count matrices were generated, filtering for GEM cell barcodes (excluding GEMs with free-floating mRNA from lysed or dead cells) using CellRanger (version 6.0.1). Count matrices were imported into R (version 4.1.0) and processed using the Seurat library (version 4.4.0) following the standard pipeline93. Low-quality cells were removed, with cells kept for further analysis if they met the following criteria: the mitochondrial content was within three standard deviations from the median, more than 500 genes were detected and more than 1,000 RNA molecules were detected. DoubletFinder was used to identify doublets, assuming a theoretical doublet rate of 7.5%, which were removed from subsequent analysis94. In total, 18,405 cells were sequenced, of which 17,661 cells passed the quality control and 15,808 passed subsequent doublet filtration for downstream analysis (5,979 cells from the 72 h sample, 3,669 cells from the 96 h sample and 6,160 cells from the 120 h sample).

All samples were integrated using the reciprocal principal component analysis (RPCA) method, implemented by Seurat's functions FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData(), using the top 3,000 variable features and the first 25 principal components as determined using the ‘maxLikGlobalDimEst' function from the intrinsicDimension package (version 1.2.0). Effects of cell cycle heterogeneity was calculated using cell cycle phase scores on the basis of canonical markers and regressed out of the data using ScaleData. Eight clusters were identified at a resolution of 0.5.

For RNA velocity analysis, loom files containing spliced and unspliced matrices were calculated, from BAM files generated by CellRanger, using the package velocyto (version 0.17.8) and Python 3.6.4. The matrices were used as input to scVelo (version 0.2.4) to calculate the RNA velocity values for each gene of each cell using the package loompy (version 3.0.6) and scanpy (version 1.8.2). scVelo was used in the dynamical mode with default settings. The resulting RNA velocity vector was overlaid onto the UMAP space by translating the RNA velocities into likely cell transitions using cosine correlation to compute the probabilities of one cell transitioning into another cell.

Lineages for trajectory analyses were identified separately for the somite and neural fates with the NMP cluster as the starting population using Monocle3 (version 1.3.0)95. Differentially expressed genes along each of the lineages were identified with the ‘graph_test' function using the Morans I test. The top 100 genes were used to draw smoothed heat maps using Tradeseq (version 1.7.07)96 and ComplexHeatmap (version 2.2.0)97.

Cell-to-cell crosstalk was inferred using the R library CellChat (version 2.1.2)74 and the CellChat human database. Clusters designated NP1, NP2, NP3 and neuronal were merged to create one cluster. Only the somites and the merged neuronal clusters were considered for Cellchat analysis. The CellChat analysis was performed as outlined in the CellChat vignette, with the ‘population.size' parameter set to 'true' when computing the communication probability between clusters. Significant interactions were filtered on inter-cluster and intra-cluster interactions were removed.

Published datasets were reprocessed using Seurat93 (version 4.4.0) from either the counts matrix of a Seurat object or downloaded outputs of CellRanger from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Four samples (comprising hAxioloid_48h, hAxioloid_72h, 96h_MG_RAL and 120h_MG_RAL from the axioloid dataset (GSE199576)15) were downloaded as count matrices and processed using Seurat version 4.4.0. Samples were integrated using methods highlighted in the authors' publication and cells assigned clusters according to published cell metadata. Cells from this dataset were projected onto our integrated dataset using the functions ‘FindTransferAnchors' (using the first 30 dimensions of the principle component analysis space) and ‘MapQuery'. To determine the similarity between axioloid clusters and hTLS-integrated clusters, a two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation was calculated on the aggregated cell expression using the mean gene expression per cluster and per sample, after filtering on the basis of common genes between datasets.

The full human embryo dataset (GSE157329)38 was downloaded and processed using scripts provided by the authors (https://github.com/zhirongbaolab/heoa) with Seurat 4.4.0. Cells were annotated using published annotation. Predicted cell type cluster and stage annotation scores were filtered using a threshold of >0.5.

The human neural tube dataset71 was used to look for similarity of clusters within our integrated neuronal clusters (labelled NP1, NP2, NP3 and neuronal). A two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation test was used on aggregated cell expression per cluster using common genes between both datasets.

Single-cell datasets from refs. 15,21,22,38 and our hTLS data were integrated using harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony) to account for experimental batch effects with the following parameters (group.by.vars = experiment; reduction.used = pca, nclust = 100). The normalized expression for the integrated multi-experiment dataset was aggregated per cluster. To look for similarities between clusters, a Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated using the normalized aggregated expression for genes, which was identified as the union of the top 50 markers per cluster per dataset. The Spearman's correlations are shown as a tile plot, where the rows and columns are hierarchically clustered, using the ‘ward.d2' method.

No statistical method was used to pre-determine the sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications15. Statistical testing included tests of normality to guide the use of appropriate statistical methods. Data were excluded from morphometric analyses where images were of empty wells or debris, where structures were partially out of the field of view, where pixel values fell beneath a threshold for object detection or where manual validation identified poor segmentation. In bioinformatic analyses, low-quality cells or doublets (identified by DoubletFinder with a theoretical rate of 7.5%) were removed from downstream analysis. Cells were only retained if they met the following criteria: the mitochondrial content was within three standard deviations from the median, more than 500 genes were detected and more than 1,000 RNA molecules were detected. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during the experiments and outcome assessment. Data collection and analyses were not performed blinded to the conditions of the experiments.

Enhancer–promoter (E-P) interactions regulate transcription during cell fate determination. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying E-P interactions have remained elusive. Here we present a chromatin-interaction-based proteomic approach, LoopID, to profile proteins (termed the looposome) at certain E-P anchors. We find that histone demethylase JMJD2, a key looposome component, can regulate E-P interactions and the looposome in a catalytic-independent manner through formation of biomolecular condensates. Furthermore, we introduce a system to engineer E-P interactions by assembling JMJD2 condensates at certain genomic loci, enabling construction of cell-type-specific E-P interactions to promote cellular reprogramming into pluripotent or two-cell-like cells. Our findings reveal a noncanonical function of a histone demethylase in regulation of chromatin organization and provide a strategy to regulate cell fate transitions through E-P interactions.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures brain activity indirectly by monitoring changes in blood oxygenation levels, known as the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, rather than directly measuring neuronal activity. This approach crucially relies on neurovascular coupling, the mechanism that links neuronal activity to changes in cerebral blood flow. However, it remains unclear whether this relationship is consistent for both positive and negative BOLD responses across the human cortex. Here we found that about 40% of voxels with significant BOLD signal changes during various tasks showed reversed oxygen metabolism, particularly in the default mode network. These ‘discordant' voxels differed in baseline oxygen extraction fraction and regulated oxygen demand via oxygen extraction fraction changes, whereas ‘concordant' voxels depended mainly on cerebral blood flow changes. Our findings challenge the canonical interpretation of the BOLD signal, indicating that quantitative functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a more reliable assessment of both absolute and relative changes in neuronal activity.

Neuronal activity is the primary energy consumer in the brain, driven by oxygen metabolism and quantified as the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2)1. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) maps this activity indirectly by detecting regional changes in blood oxygenation2. The resulting blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal originates from fluctuations in deoxygenated hemoglobin, rather than from neuronal activity itself.

Interpreting BOLD signal changes (∆BOLD) as changes in neuronal activity depends on neurovascular coupling, the process that links neuronal activity to local changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF)3,4,5,6,7. Classical work in human sensory cortices using positron emission tomography (PET) showed that sensory stimulation evokes modest increases in CMRO2 but a disproportionately larger increase in CBF, resulting in a positive coupling ratio of ∆CBF/∆CMRO2 (n-ratio ~2–4)8. This surplus in CBF forms the basis of the canonical hemodynamic response (n-ratio > 1), which generally allows the interpretation of a positive BOLD response as increased neuronal activity and vice versa9,10. Mesoscopic studies have supported this principle by linking heightened neural or synaptic activity to increased CBF and positive BOLD responses11,12,13. Likewise, others have shown that inhibitory processes and decreased activity are linked to negative BOLD changes14,15,16,17,18. However, it remains unclear whether the canonical hemodynamic response applies uniformly beyond sensory cortices, particularly throughout the entire human cortex.

Several studies have shown that ∆BOLD does not always accurately reflect neuronal activity. Animal studies identified task-induced changes in CBF and metabolic activity, accompanied by minimal or opposite BOLD signal responses19,20, indicating conditions where hemodynamics and neuronal activity are decoupled4,21. Reports of unchanged or even increased metabolism despite significant negative ∆BOLD or ∆CBF further challenge the assumption of uniform neurovascular coupling22,23,24,25. The BOLD signal itself reflects a complex interplay among changes in CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV) and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) during capillary passage, making its interpretation region-dependent10,26. Consequently, various studies have reported inconsistencies between BOLD signal responses and cognitive or neuronal activity in humans25,27,28,29,30. Moreover, variations in vasculature31 and hemodynamic responsiveness9,31,32,33,34 can produce similar macroscopic BOLD patterns through distinct underlying mechanisms. These differences particularly affect the interpretation of BOLD signal patterns in patients with altered hemodynamics10,30. Together, these studies challenge the reliability of the BOLD signal response as an indicator of neuronal activity across the cortex, motivating a more quantitative examination of neurovascular coupling.

We addressed this question by measuring absolute oxygen metabolism and individual vascular components underlying positive and negative ∆BOLD. The gold standard for CBF and CMRO2 measurements is 15O PET; but this technique requires an on-site cyclotron, a sophisticated imaging setup and substantial experience in handling three different radiotracers (CBF, 15O-water; CBV, 15O-CO; OEF, 15O-gas) of short half-lives8,35. Furthermore, this invasive method poses certain risks to participants owing to the exposure to radioactivity and arterial sampling. As an alternative, various MRI approaches have been developed over the past three decades to quantify voxel-wise oxygen extraction and metabolism in the human cortex36,37,38. The quantitative BOLD (qBOLD) approach is based on an analytical model39 that relates R2′ to OEF40,41,42. A multiparametric variant of the qBOLD technique (mqBOLD) combines separate measurements of the intrinsic and effective relaxation times, T2 and T2* for reversible transverse relaxation rate (R2′), with an independent quantification of CBV for OEF measurement. mqBOLD imaging has been widely applied to study patient groups with vascular pathologies and brain tumors42,43,44,45,46,47, summarized recently by ref. 36.

In this study, we used both quantitative and conventional BOLD imaging to test the hypothesis that ∆BOLD would not reliably reflect changes in oxygen metabolism throughout the entire cortex. We found that in a substantial fraction of voxels with significant BOLD responses, oxygen metabolism changes in the opposite direction to both positive and negative BOLD signals. Notably, these discordant voxels regulated oxygen demand primarily via changes in OEF, rather than CBF. These findings challenge the canonical hemodynamic response model, demonstrating that ∆BOLD alone can lead to misleading interpretations of underlying neuronal activity.

Brain imaging data were collected using BOLD and quantitative fMRI while participants completed four experimental conditions within a single session (Fig. 1a,b). These conditions allowed identification of (1) ‘task-positive' regions with increased BOLD signal and (2) ‘task-negative' regions with negative BOLD response during calculation (CALC). We also examined (3) positive BOLD responses in the ‘task-negative' regions during an autobiographical memory task (MEM). BOLD-contrast images for CALC and MEM were calculated relative to a controlled baseline task (CTRL) or an uncontrolled resting state (REST).

a, We performed BOLD and quantitative fMRI on healthy subjects performing four different conditions within the same imaging session: CALC, MEM, CTRL and REST. b, During each imaging session, we acquired BOLD fMRI data with a 30-s block design, together with multiparametric, quantitative fMRI data. Conditions were presented in pseudorandomized order: T2* mapping to measure both reversible and irreversible dephasing; pCASL to measure CBF during each condition; T2 mapping to measure irreversible dephasing due to tissue properties; and DSC MRI using a contrast agent to measure CBV during CTRL, at the end of the session. c, Quantitative fMRI delivers voxelwise CMRO2 by integrating T2, T2*, CBV and CBF parameters via Fick's principle (see Methods section for detailed equations). Brain slices of subject-average parameter maps and boxplots illustrating average GM values across all 40 subjects and all conditions of the main study (line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR); individual dots, subject average per condition). R2′ reflects a voxel's overall dHb content. The OEF is proportional to R2′/CBV. Voxel-wise CMRO2 is then calculated as the product of OEF, CBF and the arterial oxygen content of the blood (CaO2) as derived from individual measures of oxygen saturation and hematocrit. d, The canonical hemodynamic response model of the BOLD signal: increased neuronal activity leads to higher CMRO2, which results in decreased oxygenation levels and an increased concentration of dHb in venous blood. Neurovascular coupling mechanisms initiate an increase in CBV and CBF. This hemodynamic response counteracts the effects of oxygen metabolism, ultimately leading to a decrease in dHb content. In BOLD fMRI, the net fluctuation of dHb levels is dynamically measured with T2*-weighted (T2*w) EPI. ΔBOLD during any task condition is calculated by subtracting task (T) from baseline (B) T2*w data. Based on the canonical hemodynamic response function, positive ∆BOLD are commonly interpreted as increased neuronal activity.

Quantitative fMRI, combining mqBOLD and pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI, estimates CMRO2 as a metabolic marker of neuronal activity. CMRO2 was calculated using Fick's principle, integrating parameter maps of several aspects of the hemodynamic response into a measure of oxygen metabolism (Fig. 1c and Methods). Table 1 lists parameter and CMRO2 values averaged across all subjects and conditions.

The canonical hemodynamic response model (Fig. 1d) assumes an identical hemodynamic response across voxels, with ∆CBF exceeding ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio > 1). In this study, we used quantitative fMRI to measure hemodynamic parameters per condition and compared them to task-induced BOLD changes relative to an experimental baseline (∆BOLD (%)).

We performed separate partial least squares (PLS) analyses on BOLD and mqBOLD parameter maps to compare BOLD and quantitative fMRI results. Bootstrap ratios were used for statistical mapping (Fig. 2a shows CALC versus CTRL; additional contrasts in Supplementary Fig. 2). We found widespread significant positive and negative ∆BOLD for CALC versus CTRL. Group histograms (Fig. 2b) show task-related changes for each parameter within significant ∆BOLD regions (CALC-positive, CALC-negative). In CALC-positive masks, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 showed canonical amplitudes: ∆BOLD = 0.37%, ∆CBF = 6.5%, ∆CMRO2 = 3.1%, n-ratio (∆CBF(%)/∆CMRO2(%)) = 2.1 (Fig. 2b). CALC-negative masks showed near-zero ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2, despite negative ∆BOLD reaching 70% of the positive amplitude (−0.26%). To address potential normalization distortions, we also analyzed native-space data using individual BOLD masks, confirming robust positive ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 in CALC-positive masks, with no significant response in CALC-negative masks across subjects (Fig. 2c). A second-level GLM model (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), instead of the PLS approach, confirmed near-zero changes of median ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 in CALC-negative masks. Overall, positive ∆BOLD values matched the canonical hemodynamic response, with ∆CBF (in %) being at least ten times higher than ∆BOLD and twice the amplitude of ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio > 2). However, no significant negative ∆CBF, ∆CBV, ∆T2* or ∆CMRO2 were found in negative ∆BOLD masks across subjects.

All analyses across N = 40 subjects of the main study, CBV results across N = 10. a, Statistical results of the PLS group analysis in standard MNI space, comparing CALC and CTRL, for both BOLD and quantitative fMRI parameter maps. Maps projected on the brain surface show non-thresholded bootstrap ratios (BSRs) (akin to z values) of the first latent variable, which was significant in each analysis: that is, for BOLD, CBF, CBV (N = 10), T2* and CMRO2, respectively (permutation tests, P < 0.001). Red voxels indicate higher values during CALC compared to CTRL, and blue voxels represent the opposite contrast. Axial slices display significant brain clusters, thresholded at BSR ± 2 (akin to P < 0.05, cluster size > 30 voxels) for each parameter. b, Histograms depict group-average median voxel distributions of all parameters (CALC minus CTRL) within the binarized CALC-positive and CALC-negative group masks (shown as surface plot). c, Subject distribution of all parameters in native space.

Any signal increase or decrease for which error bars cross the zero line is considered nonsignificant; an asterisk denotes P < 0.05, not corrected for multiple comparisons. (iii), Clusters are located in different functional networks, as depicted on the brain surface and in axial slices79. Yeo networks: DAN, dorsal attention; FPN, frontoparietal; L, left; R, right; SMN, somatomotor; VAN, ventral attention; VIS, visual; LIM, limbic network.

We then analyzed metabolic parameters regionally, avoiding brain-wide averaging effects. Eight clusters showed positive ∆BOLD, and nine clusters showed negative ∆BOLD (Fig. 2d(i)). Median ∆CMRO2 was significantly positive in half of the positive ∆BOLD clusters but negative in none of the negative clusters (Fig. 2d(ii)). Notably, two auditory network clusters (SMN 1, SMN 2) with negative ∆BOLD had significant positive ∆CMRO2.

We also examined ∆BOLD and ∆CMRO2 for the other contrasts, CALC versus REST (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c) and MEM versus CTRL (Supplementary Fig. 2d–g). CALC-positive and CALC-negative masks showed higher overall ∆BOLD, ∆T2*, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 compared to CTRL, but changes within CALC-negative masks remained nonsignificant (Supplementary Fig. 2c). For the MEM task, results mirrored the CALC patterns, with similar BOLD signal amplitudes and stronger positive than negative ∆BOLD. However, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 were significant only in the MEM-positive mask. Thus, positive ∆BOLD reliably indicated significant positive ∆CMRO2 across conditions, but the metabolic interpretation of negative ∆BOLD remained unclear. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes average parameter changes for all conditions.

Several factors could explain the absence of hemodynamic and metabolic changes, especially related to negative ∆BOLD: (1) voxel-specific signal confounds, (2) limited sensitivity for detecting negative ∆CBF or ∆CMRO2 or (3) distinct hemodynamic mechanisms in certain regions. We address each explanation below.

Most MEM-positive voxels overlapped with the default mode network (DMN), which showed negative ∆BOLD during CALC (Supplementary Fig. 2f). To test for voxel-specific confounds, we analyzed CBF and CMRO2 in voxels occurring in both MEM-positive and CALC-negative masks. Supplementary Fig. 2h shows the histograms of ∆BOLD, ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 for all voxels of a conjunction mask (MEM-positive ∧ CALC-negative). For positive ∆BOLD (0.32%), we observed a canonical increase in ∆CBF (5.94%) and ∆CMRO2 (3.54%). However, in the same voxels, a negative ∆BOLD (−0.29%) was associated with a much weaker ∆CBF (−0.47%), resulting in a positive ∆CMRO2 (1.68%). Thus, a lower ∆CBF than expected from the canonical framework results in negative ∆BOLD for elevated ∆CMRO2. Crucially, the absence of canonical negative BOLD responses in ‘conjunction voxels' cannot be explained by voxel-specific confounds, as those same voxels do display a canonical response for positive ∆BOLD.

According to the hemodynamic response model (Fig. 1d), neurovascular coupling is primarily driven by changes in CBF. To validate the sensitivity of pCASL imaging for detecting ∆CBF, we performed several control analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found ∆CBF magnitudes ranging from −9% to +27%, with regions of positive ∆CBF showing higher n-ratios than those with negative ∆CBF (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Moreover, the spatial pattern of negative ∆CBF during CALC matched that observed with PET from a different study (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Notably, CBF decreases identified by PET and MRI were more localized than BOLD decreases and centered on peak regions. Additionally, we also validated the homogeneity of our MRI-derived OEF with independent PET data (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

We also assessed signal stability of BOLD and CBF measurements during continuous task performance. In the main study (Fig. 1), block durations vary for BOLD (30 s) and quantitative (~6 min) fMRI to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each modality. In a control study (N = 18), participants performed 3-min CALC and MEM blocks while BOLD data were collected. BOLD signals remained stable without habituation or drift (Supplementary Fig. 3d), with amplitude changes comparable to the main study (CALC-positive/negative/MEM-positive: 0.6%/−0.46%/0.34% versus 0.70%/−0.34%/0.51%). Time-resolved pCASL analysis from the main study also showed constant CBF data throughout measurement blocks (Supplementary Fig. 3e).

We next assessed the ∆BOLD–∆CMRO2 relationships on the voxel level and compared our data to an established model of hemodynamic responses. The Davis model predicts ∆BOLD responses based on realistic cortical ranges for ∆CMRO2(%) and ∆CBF(%)48. Figure 3a displays the model's prediction of ∆BOLD (contours, −3% to +3%) for a set of typical hemodynamic response parameters. A canonical BOLD response occurs when ∆CBF exceeds ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio > 1). However, the model also predicts discordant responses—where ∆BOLD disagrees with metabolic change—when ∆CBF is lower than ∆CMRO2 (n-ratio < 1) or their signs differ (Fig. 3a, violet shading). For example, a negative ∆BOLD of −1.3% would arise if CBF increased by only about 5% during a ∆CMRO2 of +23%. In other words, the same metabolic change can result in opposite signs of the BOLD signal, depending on the magnitude of related ∆CBF. Because we measured all relevant parameters and calculated ∆CMRO2 using Fick's principle, we next compared our empirical data to the model predictions.

a, Visualization of the Davis model. Predicted BOLD responses (ΔBOLD (%)) are depicted as colored contour lines across ΔCBF (%) and ΔCMRO2 (%). The model illustrates that for a given ΔCMRO2(%), the direction and magnitude of the BOLD response depend on the amplitudes of ΔCBF(%). The canonical hemodynamic response assumes that an increase in ΔCBF will exceed the increase in ΔCMRO2, resulting in a positive ΔBOLD and vice versa for negative ∆BOLD. However, the Davis model also predicts a range of BOLD responses with discordant signs compared to the changes in underlying metabolic activity (violet shading). b, Empirical data from BOLD and quantitative fMRI for all cortical voxels, median across N = 40 subjects of the main study. ΔCMRO2 was calculated from BOLD-derived ΔR2′ (Methods), median across all subjects per voxel, with colors indicating ΔBOLD (%). Our experimental data replicate the slope and range of values predicted by the Davis model, particularly demonstrating a substantial number of voxels with ΔBOLD opposing ΔCMRO2. c, Voxels representing the median across N = 40 subjects from the main study display significantly positive (top) and negative (bottom) BOLD responses from b. Voxels with ΔBOLD concordant to ΔCMRO2 are highlighted on a light yellow/turquoise background, and voxels with discordant ΔBOLD values are shown on a violet background. The pie charts illustrate the ratio of discordant to concordant voxels. Bottom, the pie chart with black contours specifically summarizes the ratio of discordant voxels within the DMN. Axial slices illustrate the spatial distribution of significantly concordant and discordant BOLD voxels, with black contours indicating the DMN. Right, center, stacked bars illustrate the amplitude distribution of discordant and concordant voxels across BOLD amplitude quartiles. It is noteworthy that discordant voxels show neither spatial nor amplitude preference. d, The boxplots summarize ΔCMRO2 (%) and ΔCBF (%) across all voxels, median across N = 40 subjects of the main study, with either concordant or discordant ΔBOLD (%); (line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; based on median voxel values across subjects). Please note that discordant and concordant voxels exhibit similar ΔBOLD amplitude distributions, even though they signal opposite metabolic responses.

Figure 3b presents subject-averaged voxel data for CALC versus CTRL, colored by positive/negative ∆BOLD (Supplementary Fig. 4a for CALC versus REST and Supplementary Fig. 4b for MEM versus CTRL). To mitigate low SNR at the voxel level, ∆CMRO2 was calculated using more stable ∆R2′ data from BOLD fMRI (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5 for sensitivity analysis). Our empirical data support several predictions of the Davis model: positive ∆BOLD voxels cluster above the line with a slope of 1, indicating an n-ratio > 1. We also identify a substantial number of discordant voxels: those with opposite ∆BOLD and ∆CMRO2. Those can be summarized as red voxels on the left and blue voxels on the right side of zero ∆CMRO2 (Fig. 3b, red dashed line). Interpreting the activity in discordant voxels using only BOLD data and assuming a uniform canonical response would lead to substantial misinterpretation.

To highlight the number of discordant responses, we plotted CALC-positive (Fig. 3c, top) and CALC-negative (Fig. 3c, bottom) voxels separately, highlighting discordant voxels (violet shading). Discordant voxels account for 31% and 66% of positive and negative ∆BOLD, respectively (Fig. 3c, pie charts); with a similar ratio of discordant negative ∆BOLD within the DMN (pie chart ‘DMN only‘), the network with the most consistently reported negative BOLD signal responses. Moreover, discordant voxels are spatially distributed across the cortex (Fig. 3c, brain slices) and occur equally among voxels from the lowest to highest quartile of BOLD signal amplitudes (Fig. 3c, bar plots). We repeated these analyses for CALC versus REST (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and MEM versus CTRL (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Again, discordant voxels appeared with a uniform cortical distribution and across the full range of ∆BOLD, amounting to 36%/52% of significant positive/negative ∆BOLD voxels in CALC versus REST and 12%/54% in MEM versus CTRL.

Figure 3d summarizes voxel median parameter values separately for concordant and discordant voxels. Concordant voxels with either positive or negative ∆BOLD demonstrate a canonical hemodynamic response (n-ratio 2.0 for positive, 1.6 for negative ∆BOLD; Fig. 3d, yellow and turquoise bars). Discordant voxels, however, show ∆BOLD opposite to their metabolic response and lower than expected ∆CBF (Fig. 3d, violet bars). Notably, discordant ∆BOLD occurred in about one-third of positive and two-thirds of negative ∆BOLD voxels across different tasks and all magnitude ranges, distributed evenly throughout the cortex.

Potentially, discordance between ∆BOLD and ∆CMRO2 could result from partial volume effects when integrating voxel data from imaging sequences with heterogeneous voxel sizes, as occurred in our main study. To address this, we conducted a replication study (N = 10) using harmonized acquisition matrices for BOLD and mqBOLD data. Results mirrored the main study (Supplementary Fig. 6): 40% of all voxels with either significant positive or negative ∆BOLD were classified as discordant, and discordant voxels again showed smaller CBF responses than expected from canonical neurovascular coupling.

Finally, we directly estimated the parameters of the Davis model using our own data. With measurements of ∆BOLD, CBV, OEF and CBF, we calculated α and each subject's calibration factor M empirically. The average values were α = 0.38 and M = 11.2 ± 1% (N = 40). Supplementary Fig. 7 replicates Fig. 3 using the Davis model parameters instead of Fick's formula to quantify CMRO2.

Next, we examined whether voxels with both positive and negative BOLD responses during CALC or MEM (using the conjunction mask of the control analysis in Supplementary Fig. 2h) exhibit consistent hemodynamic response patterns for both signs of ∆BOLD. Voxels were classified as ‘concordant only‘, ‘discordant only' or ‘mixed' based on whether BOLD and metabolic responses matched in both tasks, differed in both tasks or showed a mixed pattern (Fig. 4a). The pie chart illustrates that most voxels (48%) were ‘mixed‘, and 35% and 18% were consistently concordant or discordant, respectively. Figure 4b displays the spatial and amplitude distributions for ∆CBF and ∆CMRO2 across the three categories. ‘Concordant only' voxels showed canonical hemodynamic responses (n-ratio ~2) regardless of BOLD sign or task (yellow/turquoise bars), and ‘discordant only' voxels lacked canonical responses for either direction (violet/lilac bars). ‘Mixed' voxels exhibited canonical coupling for positive BOLD, but not for negative BOLD (red/orange bars). Because changes in CMRO2, which are not modulated by CBF, must be matched by OEF changes, we tested whether baseline OEF varies by voxel type. We hypothesized that ‘discordant only' voxels, with the lowest ∆CBF during a task, would have the lowest baseline OEF (indicating the highest oxygen buffer). In line with this hypothesis, baseline OEF was lowest in ‘discordant only' voxels, intermediate in ‘mixed' and highest in ‘concordant only' voxels (Fig. 4c), suggesting that discordant voxels compensate for higher oxygen demand mainly via OEF changes. Importantly, OEF data were independently acquired from CBF data.

Median voxel values across N = 30 subjects of the main study. a, Conjunction voxels (i; green outlines) display both positive and negative changes in BOLD signal during the CALC and MEM conditions. (ii), these voxels were categorized based on their response types. (iii), the pie chart summarizes the consistency of these response types across voxels: 35% of all conjunction voxels showed concordant responses, meaning they had the same sign of ΔBOLD and ΔCMRO2 during both MEM and CALC conditions (‘concordant only'); 18% of all conjunction voxels showed discordant responses in both conditions (‘discordant only'); 48% of the conjunction voxels (‘mixed' voxels) showed concordant responses in one condition and discordant responses in the other. b, The spatial distribution (i) of voxel categories is illustrated on brain slices with consistent color overlays: ‘concordant only' and ‘mixed' voxels primarily cluster in regions of the DMN, and ‘discordant only' voxels occur in the medial part of the VAN. The boxplots display subject-median parameter values separately for 1,410 ‘concordant only' (ii), 1,943 ‘mixed' (iii) and 723 ‘discordant only' voxels (iv) (line, median; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; based on median voxel values across subjects). Although the range of ΔBOLD is similar across the three categories, ΔCBF and ΔCMRO2 vary strongly as expressed by their n-ratios. Asterisks indicate significant differences from zero, tested via independent t-tests, two-sided, corrected for multiple comparisons. c, The three voxel categories exhibit significantly different OEF during CTRL baseline, with ‘concordant only' voxels having significantly higher OEF and ‘discordant only' voxels having significantly lower OEF than ‘mixed' voxels. **P < 0.001, independent-sample permutation test on the median values, two-sided, conducted for ‘mixed' versus the two other voxel types, 2,000 permutations. rOEF, relative OEF.

We next examined baseline hemodynamics across the cortex by pooling all voxels with significant ∆BOLD during either task (CALC, MEM)—comprising 53% of all gray matter (GM) voxels—and categorizing them as concordant, discordant or not task-involved (Fig. 5a(i)). Regression plots show that baseline CMRO2 correlates linearly with CBF, OEF and CBV across all voxel groups, consistent with Fick's principle. Multiple linear regression analyses using all three parameters showed that baseline OEF accounted for >68% of CMRO2 variance, followed by CBF (>28%) and CBV (>1%), with similar model parameters for concordant and discordant voxels (concordant model: F(3,21,809) = 72,070, P < 0.001, CMRO2 = 139.9 + 321.1 × OEF + 3.3 × CBF + 0.4 × CBV + e, R2 = 0.91; discordant model: F(3,14,544) = 48,390, P < 0.001, CMRO2 = 128.1 + 309.2 × OEF + 3.2 × CBF + 1.3 × CBV + e; R2 = 0.91; all predictors mean-centered, P < 0.001 for all beta values). According to the CMRO2 model parameter, discordant voxels have a lower baseline metabolism, whereas concordant voxels have significantly higher baseline CBF and OEF but lower CBV (Fig. 5b).

a, Across all task conditions, 22% of all GM voxels showed discordant and 32% showed concordant responses, and 46% were not significantly involved in any task (i). Regression plots (ii): during baseline, CMRO2 and CBF show a moderate correlation (Pearson's r > 0.32, P < 0.001), CMRO2 and OEF are highly correlated (r > 0.7, P < 0.001), and CMRO2 and CBV show a weak negative correlation (r < −0.1, P < 0.001) across all groups of voxels; voxel medians across 40 subjects. b, In CTRL baseline, across all 40 subjects, discordant voxels, on average, show significantly lower CBF (−3.4%), lower OEF (−5.7%) and higher CBV (2.1%) than concordant voxels (paired samples, two-sided t-test, P < 0.001). Boxplots: line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; individual dots, median subject values across voxels; gray line, median of remaining GM voxels. c, Marginally but significantly lower baseline susceptibility (QSM) and higher venous density in discordant versus concordant voxels, revealed by two external datasets68,69. Boxplots: line, median; box limits, upper and lower quartiles; whiskers, minimum and maximum data points except for outliers: values outside of 1.5 × IQR; based on voxel values; gray line, median of remaining GM voxels. **P < 0.001, independent samples permutation test on the median values, two-sided, conducted for discordant versus concordant voxels, 2,000 permutations. d, Correlation of ΔCMRO2(%) with either ΔCBF(%), ΔOEF(%) or ΔCBV(%) across all task contrasts (CALC versus CTRL, voxel median across 40 subjects; MEM versus CTRL, voxel median across 30 subjects), separately for concordant (pale) and discordant (dark violet) voxels. ΔCMRO2 and ΔCBF showed a strong positive correlation across concordant voxels (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation across discordant voxels (r = 0.48, P < 0.001). In contrast, ΔCMRO2 and ΔOEF showed a moderate, positive correlation across discordant voxels (r = 0.60, P < 0.001) and a weak, negative correlation across concordant voxels (r = −0.41, P < 0.001). ΔCBV could only be evaluated for a subset of 10 subjects and only across the CALC versus CTRL contrast (Methods). ΔCMRO2 and ΔCBV showed a weak correlation around zero across concordant voxels (r = −0.07) and a moderate, negative correlation across discordant voxels (r = −0.46, P < 0.001). Conc., concordant; Disc., discordant.

To validate lower OEF and higher CBV in discordant voxels, we analyzed two external quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) datasets (Fig. 5c). Projecting our voxel masks onto these data, we observed that discordant voxels had slightly but significantly lower susceptibility (indicating lower deoxyhemoglobin (dHb)) and significantly higher venous density, supporting our findings.

Finally, we investigated whether ∆OEF might serve as an alternative mechanism to ∆CBF in accommodating oxygen demand during task processing. Regression plots show the linear correlation between ∆CMRO2 and ∆CBF, ∆OEF and ∆CBV, separately for concordant and discordant voxels, illustrating the significant contribution of each hemodynamic parameter to oxygen metabolism (Fig. 5d). However, we also identified two distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that in concordant voxels, ∆CMRO2 was mainly driven by ∆CBF (concordant model: F(2,21,971) = 67,980, P < 0.001, with ∆CBF explaining 87% and ∆OEF 16% of a total explained variance of R2 = 0.86 of the model: ∆CMRO2(%) = 2.6 + 0.83 × ∆OEF(%) + 0.86 × ∆CBF(%) + e; all predictors mean-centered, P < 0.001 for all beta values). In discordant voxels, ∆OEF was the primary regulator, with ∆CBF secondary (discordant model: F(2,14,694) = 39,320, P < 0.001, with ∆OEF explaining 58% and ∆CBF 42% of a total explained variance of R2 = 0.84 of the model: ∆CMRO2(%) = 1.2 + 1.1 × ∆OEF(%) + 0.88 × ∆CBF(%) + e; all predictors mean-centered, P < 0.001 for all beta values). The negative ∆CMRO2 − ∆OEF correlation for concordant voxels reflects compensatory oxygenation during ∆CBF surplus (Fig. 5d, center). CBV was not included in these regressions, as ∆CBV was only acquired for the CALC–CTRL contrast. In summary, concordant voxels regulate CMRO2 mostly via ∆CBF (87%), whereas discordant voxels rely more on ∆OEF (58%) compared to ∆CBF (42%).

In this study, we evaluated the consistency between changes in the BOLD signal and oxygen metabolism in GM voxels across the human cortex. This would support the common interpretation of positive and negative ∆BOLD as indicators of increased or decreased neuronal activity. Contrary to the canonical BOLD response model, we found that approximately 40% of brain voxels with significant ∆BOLD exhibited opposing changes in oxygen metabolism. Specifically, voxels with positive ∆BOLD showed decreased ∆CMRO2, whereas those with negative ∆BOLD exhibited increased ∆CMRO2. By measuring the BOLD signal, CBF, OEF and CMRO2 in the same session, we uncovered distinct neurovascular mechanisms in regions with concordant versus discordant responses. Discordant voxels primarily regulate oxygen demand via ∆OEF, whereas concordant voxels display a larger increase in ∆CBF, aligning with canonical predictions. Moreover, discordant voxels demonstrated lower baseline CMRO2 and OEF, indicating that their baseline oxygen supply is sufficient to meet higher metabolic demands. In conclusion, we identified two distinct hemodynamic responses to neuronal activity changes, influenced by baseline OEF and metabolism.

We combined BOLD with quantitative fMRI to investigate hemodynamic and metabolic changes in relation to ∆BOLD. Participants performed cognitive tasks eliciting both positive and negative BOLD signal responses across the cortex. Specifically, we aimed to elicit both response types in identical voxels, facilitating a direct comparison of their hemodynamic responses. We employed a cognitively demanding calculation task that induced positive ∆BOLD in various attention-related regions49,50 while concurrently inducing negative ∆BOLD in DMN regions50,51. Additionally, participants undertook an autobiographical memory task known to induce positive ∆BOLD in DMN regions, partially overlapping with those of negative ΔBOLD during CALC52,53. This allowed us to examine opposing ∆BOLD within the same voxels.

Our study also addressed the implications of differing baseline states. Although BOLD signal responses to cognitive tasks are usually compared against low-level control tasks53,54,55, negative ∆BOLD was often reported in comparison to an uncontrolled resting state51,56. Consequently, we included both baseline types into the study design, and all experimental conditions successfully elicited anticipated BOLD signal responses. On average, negative BOLD signal responses constituted approximately 50–70% of the amplitude of positive ΔBOLD (Fig. 2). Additionally, ΔBOLD was larger when compared to REST than to CTRL baseline (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c).

Compared to BOLD fMRI, which requires subtraction analyses between conditions, the mqBOLD approach provides quantitative measures for each condition. During CTRL baseline, we observed average GM values of CMRO2 and hemodynamic parameters (Table 1) consistent with existing literature on the healthy human brain35,38,42,51,57,58,59. Likewise, task-related changes (Supplementary Table 1) aligned with prior findings58,60,61, where ∆CMRO2 and ∆CBF exceeded positive ∆BOLD by factors of 10–20, yielding an n-ratio of approximately 2 (Fig. 2) and thereby conforming to the canonical hemodynamic response10,62.

Despite a canonical hemodynamic response for mean positive ΔBOLD, we did not find significant hemodynamic or metabolic changes for negative ΔBOLD (see CALC versus CTRL, Fig. 2c) for either task condition (see MEM versus CTRL, Supplementary Fig. 2g) or when comparing against REST baseline (Supplementary Fig. 2c). In a region-specific analysis, we also observed significant deviations from the canonical response in four out of eight clusters with positive ΔBOLD (Fig. 2d). One could argue that voxels with discordant ΔBOLD might suffer from voxel-specific artifacts such as partial volume effects or differences in vasculature, leading to insignificant ΔCBF. To address this issue, we designed our study to achieve significant ΔBOLD during both CALC and MEM tasks in identical voxels, facilitating within-voxel comparisons of ΔBOLD and quantitative measures. Among these voxels (Supplementary Fig. 2h, ‘conjunction voxels'), we observed only weak ΔCBF (−0.5%) for negative ΔBOLD but strong positive ΔCBF (5.9%) for positive ΔBOLD, despite similar ΔBOLD amplitudes (−0.29% and 0.32%). For this voxel subset, discordant negative ΔBOLD is unlikely due to artifacts, as a canonical hemodynamic response was confirmed for positive ∆BOLD.

In summary, we identified a canonical hemodynamic response for mean positive ΔBOLD, but inconsistencies in certain regions. For negative ΔBOLD, we did not find significant negative ΔCBF or ΔCMRO2 across subjects. Our findings align with previous animal studies indicating inconsistent hemodynamic responses in cortical and subcortical regions31,34,63.

On the voxel level, we evaluated our findings in comparison to a well-established model of cerebral hemodynamic responses (Fig. 3). The Davis model predicts BOLD signal amplitudes for realistic ranges of ∆CMRO2 and ∆CBF in the human brain48. Despite it being published more than 20 years ago, no study has examined the model's accuracy across the human cortex. Intriguingly, the Davis model predicts a range of discordant positive and negative ΔBOLD for biologically plausible ΔCBF in relation to ΔCMRO2 (Fig. 3, violet shading and voxels). Our empirical findings (Fig. 3b) align closely with these predictions using established model parameters from the literature. For all voxels with concordant positive and negative ∆BOLD, we observed a canonical hemodynamic response with average n-ratios of 2.0 and 1.6, respectively (Fig. 3d). Our data also confirm the presence of a substantial number of discordant voxels, comprising 31% of voxels with positive and 66% of voxels with negative ΔBOLD for CALC versus CTRL (Fig. 3c), and similarly for the REST (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and the MEM condition (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Additionally, we recalculated ΔCMRO2 via the Davis model using parameters (α, M) derived from our own data, yielding a similar percentage and regional distribution of discordant voxels, along with comparable CMRO2 responses (Supplementary Fig. 7). In conclusion, these results strengthen the reliability of the mqBOLD approach, successfully validating the decades-old model parameters of the Davis model.

One could argue that discordant ΔBOLD arises from misalignment and partial volume effects when integrating voxel data across modalities. Thus, we performed a replication study with matched voxel sizes and matrices in BOLD and mqBOLD sequences, albeit sacrificing whole-brain coverage for higher voxel resolution in pCASL imaging. Utilizing the same study design and analysis pipeline of the main study, we again found an n-ratio > 1 for concordant voxels (BOLD pos/neg: 1.7/1.2) and, critically, a considerable proportion of discordant voxels (BOLD pos/neg: 40%/40%) (Supplementary Fig. 6). One may also discuss sensitivity issues of mqBOLD across cortical voxels. For instance, low pCASL sensitivity or high vascular effects (high R2′ or CBV) might lead to low ΔCBF and thus artificially induce discordant ΔBOLD. Consequently, we validated our results using control masks focusing on voxels with significant ΔCBF or ΔCMRO2, while excluding those with high vascular contributions (Supplementary Fig. 8). All control analyses confirmed the presence of discordant voxels, with both positive (11–29%) and negative (68–78%) ΔBOLD values. As a final control against voxel-specific artifacts, we investigated hemodynamic and metabolic responses for both signs of ∆BOLD within identical voxels (Fig. 4, conjunction mask). We assessed response patterns in approximately 4,000 voxels and classified them by response type. The ‘concordant only' voxels displayed a canonical hemodynamic response for both positive and negative ∆BOLD (Fig. 4b(ii)), demonstrating that the mqBOLD method reliably detects canonical responses across the ΔBOLD spectrum. The largest group, labeled ‘mixed' voxels, showed a canonical hemodynamic response for positive ∆BOLD (Fig. 4b(iii), red) but lacked a significant CBF response for negative ∆BOLD (Fig. 4b(iii), orange). Paradoxically, interpretation based solely on BOLD fMRI data would suggest increased activity in one condition and decreased in another, despite both tasks indicating a significant increase in ∆CMRO2 of similar magnitude in those voxels (Fig. 4b)(iii).

Discordant voxels occurred for both positive and negative ∆BOLD, as well as for ∆CMRO2 derived from Fick's formula and the Davis model. The presence of both concordant and discordant responses within identical voxels implies different hemodynamic mechanisms serving varying oxygen demands. Reference 31 identified microvascular variations between cortical and subcortical regions, and simultaneous recordings of neuronal activity and CBF suggest that interneuron activity may influence blood flow more than other neuronal activity64,65,66. In humans, refs. 16,67 both found discrepancies in the coupling of CBF and ∆BOLD in sensory cortices, which they interpreted as distinct neurovascular coupling mechanisms, particularly for negative ∆BOLD. In conclusion, mqBOLD effectively identifies canonical hemodynamic responses but also a considerable number of voxels exhibiting discordant ∆BOLD across various tasks and in relation to varying baseline conditions.

According to Fick's principle, a change in CMRO2 without CBF alteration arises from ∆OEF. We hypothesized that baseline OEF varies across voxels with different hemodynamic response types, suggesting the presence of regionally varying oxygen buffers. Our findings confirmed significantly different baseline OEFs across three response types among ‘conjunction voxels' (Fig. 4c). Baseline OEF was lowest in ‘discordant only' voxels and highest in ‘concordant only' voxels, with ‘mixed' voxels in between. We also observed a significant positive linear relationship between baseline CMRO2, CBF and OEF across voxels of all tasks, covering more than 50% of all GM voxels (Fig. 5a(ii)). Multiple linear regression showed that OEF accounts for the majority of baseline CMRO2 variability (>68%), followed by CBF (>28%) and CBV (>1%), which also aligned with QSM data68,69 (Fig. 5c). Collectively, our results suggest that OEF is a key modulator of baseline metabolism across the human cortex, potentially predicting regional hemodynamic responses during tasks (Fig. 5d). In line with baseline results, multiple linear regression revealed that ∆OEF significantly contributes (58% of the total explained variance) to task-related oxygen demand in discordant voxels. Conversely, concordant voxels primarily accommodate ∆CMRO2 through ∆CBF (87%), supporting the canonical hemodynamic response. In summary, OEF is a strong predictor of baseline metabolism across the cortex, and ∆OEF regulates oxygen demand in spatially distributed voxels. Our findings align with rodent studies demonstrating varying neurovascular coupling based on variations in vascular composition14,28,31.

The mqBOLD method, although less invasive than PET, has notable limitations. Still, systematic biases in CBF, OEF and CMRO2 quantification affect only across-subject comparisons and do not account for task effects, which are derived from ΔOEF or ΔCMRO2 within identical voxels.

Absolute quantification of CBV through dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is challenging, reflecting total rather than venous CBV. Yet this limitation applies to nearly all available CBV measurements, including PET70. To enhance intersubject comparability of CBV values, we implemented a global normalization procedure44. Despite these limitations, our CBV data are valuable as they represent a rare attempt to quantify baseline CBV and ΔCBV during task processing in healthy individuals.

We further evaluated the sensitivity of our mqBOLD method to accurately detect both positive and negative ∆CBF. Our analysis replicated the amplitude and extent of reduced CBF observed in a prior PET study (Supplementary Fig. 3b) using a similar analysis approach71. Additionally, our findings reveal ∆CBF in regions exhibiting significant positive ∆BOLD, aligning with earlier MRI-based CBF measurements50,72.

Furthermore, CMRO2 values in white matter (WM) are not interpretable because T2 and T2* quantification is influenced by orientation effects of myelinated nerve fibers and differences in lipid concentration between GM and WM. In prior work, our group addressed these systematic errors of background magnetic fields44, T2-related bias45 and orientation-related effects in WM structures73. Additionally, we used masking to reduce partial volume effects of adjacent WM structures, confirmed our main result in a replication study and demonstrated that mqBOLD-based OEF agreed well with PET-based OEF46.

We also performed several control analyses to confirm the study design. A separate control study validated the stability of the BOLD (Supplementary Fig. 3d) and CBF (Supplementary Fig. 3e) signals during extended measurements. Crucially, neither signal exhibited habituation or drift effects during prolonged acquisition.

Our study reveals spatial variability in hemodynamic changes across the human cortex, suggesting diverse underlying mechanisms. First, voxels primarily governed by ∆OEF exhibit a greater oxygen buffer, maintaining adequate oxygen pressure during tasks7,19. Second, OEF regulation may indicate different signaling mechanisms6, including astrocytic activity74, shifts in excitatory/inhibitory signaling75,76 or neuromodulatory regulation77. Third, our findings underscore the importance of quantitative mqBOLD fMRI for future research, particularly when examining groups with altered hemodynamics, such as in aging30 or neurodegenerative conditions78.

Forty-seven healthy adults were enrolled; 7 were excluded due to task difficulties (n = 1), contrast-agent issues (n = 2) or poor data quality (n = 4; for example, motion or susceptibility artifacts, unilateral CBF), leaving 40 right-handed participants (22 women, 18 men; mean age 32.1 ± 9.2 years) for analysis. Of these, 30 completed all four conditions (CALC, MEM, CTRL, REST), and 10 performed only CALC and CTRL but underwent two DSC scans, enabling within-subject ∆CBV estimation; analyses of MEM or REST thus includes 30 participants.

To assess BOLD fMRI stability during prolonged tasks, a separate cohort of 18 right-handed healthy adults (11 women, 7 men; mean age 28.1 ± 4.8 years) underwent BOLD fMRI.

For a replication with harmonized voxel matrices and resolution across BOLD and mqBOLD sequences, ten healthy adults (five women, five men; mean age 31.8 ± 6.8 years) performed CALC and CTRL.

All participants gave written informed consent. Procedures were approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, and participants were compensated.

Participants were scanned supine, viewing instructions on a screen via a mirror mounted on the head coil. Right-hand responses were recorded with a button box (Cambridge Research Systems). Tasks were explained and briefly practiced before scanning, emphasizing accuracy over speed. All tasks were designed to maintain continuous engagement during BOLD and quantitative fMRI.

CALC (calculation task): This task aimed to elicit negative BOLD responses in the DMN and positive BOLD responses in task-positive networks. Participants solved arithmetic problems at their own pace, with a maximum response time of 10 s per task, following a design similar to that of ref. 50. Each trial presented a row of three numbers plus a question mark (n1, n2, n3,?) with instructions to solve the arithmetic and fill in the missing number. The solution followed this rule: n2 − n1 = DIFF, n2 = n1 + (1 × DIFF), n3 = n2 + (2 × DIFF) and ? = n3 + (3 × DIFF). For example, for the row 33 38 48?, DIFF = 5, making the correct answer 63. Participants selected from three response options, including the correct answer, each corresponding to a button on the response box.

MEM (autobiographical memory task): The MEM condition was based on the design of refs. 53,55, using cue words instead of pictures for consistency across tasks. Participants recalled a specific autobiographical event with as many details as possible, with the cue word displayed for up to 15 s. They pressed the first button twice upon recalling an event. If they couldn't recall any details, they pressed the second and third buttons in succession for a new cue word, ensuring uniformity in button presses across tasks.

CTRL (low-level baseline): The CTRL condition involved a simple task with minimal cognitive demands. A row of random letters was displayed for 5.9–8.9 s, and participants pressed a button to indicate whether the first letter was a vowel. This active baseline ensured visual input, and button presses were consistent with the CALC and MEM tasks.

REST (resting state baseline): Although studies on DMN activations typically use matched control tasks for contrasts53,54,55, such as our CTRL condition, DMN deactivation studies often compare to an uncontrolled resting state baseline50,51,56. To replicate these DMN contrasts, we also collected REST data, featuring a white fixation cross on a black screen.

MRI was conducted on a 3 T Philips Ingenia MRI scanner with an Elition upgrade and a 32-channel head coil. The quantitative fMRI protocol included multiparametric, quantitative BOLD (mqBOLD) and ASL imaging:

Multiecho spin-echo T2 mapping: Three-dimensional (3D) gradient spin echo readout as implemented by our group45 with 8 echoes of even-spaced echo times (TE): TE1 = ΔTE = 16 ms; TR = 251; readout duration = 128 ms; α = 90°; voxel size 2 × 2 × 3.3 mm3; 35 slices (30 slices in 4 subjects); total acquisition time = 2:28 min (for 35 slices).

Multiecho gradient-echo T2* mapping, as implemented by our group44,45: 12 echoes, TE1 = ΔTE = 5 ms; TR = 2,229 ms; readout duration = 60 ms; α = 30°; voxel size 2 × 2 × 3 mm3; gap 0.3 mm; 35 slices (30 slices in 4 subjects). Correction for magnetic background gradients with a standard sinc-Gauss excitation pulse80,81; acquisition of half- and quarter-resolution data in k-space center for motion correction82; total acquisition time = 6:08 min (for 35 slices).

DSC, as implemented by our group83: Single-shot GRE-EPI; echo planar imaging (EPI) factor 49; 80 dynamics; TR = 2.0 s; α = 60°; acquisition voxel size 2 × 2 × 3.5 mm3; 35 slices (30 slices in 4 subjects). Injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent as a bolus after five dynamics, 0.1 ml kg−1, minimum 6 ml, maximum 8 ml per injection, flow rate: 4 ml s−1, additionally flushing with 25 ml NaCl; total acquisition time = 2:49 min (for 35 slices).

Pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL): following ref. 84 and as implemented by our group45,85. Post-labeling delay 1,800 ms, label duration 1,800 ms; 4 background suppression pulses; two-dimensional EPI readout; TE = 11 ms; TR = 4,500 ms; α = 90°; 20 slices (16 slices in 1 subject); EPI factor 29; acquisition voxel size 3.28 × 3.5 × 6.0 mm3; gap 0.6 mm; 39 dynamics plus one proton-density-weighted M0 scan; total acquisition time = 6:00 min.

In addition to quantitative fMRI, we acquired

BOLD fMRI using single-shot EPI, EPI factor 43; voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm3; FOV 192 × 192 × 127.8 mm3; TE = 30 ms; TR = 1.2 s; α = 70°; 40 slices; SENSE-factor = 2; MB-SENSE-factor = 2; 400 dynamics (8:05 min) for 4 conditions, 200 dynamics (4:05 min) for 2 conditions, 1,650 dynamics (33:05 min) for the long-block control study acquisition. For susceptibility correction, a B0 field map was acquired with two echoes; TR/TE1/TE2 = 525 ms/6.0 ms/9.8 ms; 40 slices; parallel acquisition; α = 60°; voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm3; FOV 192 × 192 × 127.8 mm3; total acquisition time = 0:35 s.

T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE pre- and post-gadolinium (TI/TR/TE/α = 100 ms/9 ms/4 ms/8°; CS-SENSE-factor = 7.5; 170 slices; FOV = 240 × 253 × 170 mm3; voxel size 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3; acquisition time = 2:05 min) and T2-weighted 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (TR/TE/α = 4,800/293/40°; CS-SENSE-factor = 10; 140 slices; FOV = 240 × 248.9 × 168 mm3; acquisition voxel size 1.2 × 1.2 × 1.2 mm3; turbo spin-echo factor 170; inversion delay 1,650 ms; acquisition time = 2:09 min) images were acquired for anatomical reference and to exclude brain lesions.

MRI was performed on a 3 T Philips Ingenia scanner with a 32-channel head coil and included only T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE and BOLD fMRI, with all acquisition parameters being identical to those described above.

MRI was performed identical to the main study, but with matching voxel matrices: T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE, multiecho spin-echo T2 mapping and multiecho gradient-echo T2* mapping as described above, with T2/T2* voxel size = 2 × 2 × 3.0 mm3, gap 0.3 mm. BOLD fMRI as described above, but with a voxel acquisition size = 4 × 4 × 3 mm3, gap 0.3 mm, 40 slices. pCASL as described above, with BOLD fMRI voxel size (4 × 4 × 3 mm3, gap 0.3 mm; 26 slices). As a result, subject data were acquired with harmonized voxel dimensions: that is, matching BOLD and pCASL voxel sizes and four T2/T2* voxels per BOLD/pCASL voxels in the x–y plane. Whole-brain coverage was not possible with this higher-resolution pCASL sequence; thus, we positioned the volume at the same angle as before to cover all key regions of interest (ROIs) from our main study (‘brain coverage', Supplementary Fig. 6).

After obtaining informed written consent, a physician placed a venous catheter for blood sampling (hemoglobin, hematocrit (Hct), creatinine). DSC contrast was administered only if creatinine was normal, ensuring renal health. Arterial oxygen saturation was tracked via pulse oximetry (Nonin Medical B.V.).

Figure 1b illustrates the imaging session from the main study.

BOLD fMRI: The four task conditions were presented using a 30-second block design, each repeated four times in random order. BOLD alternated with mqBOLD fMRI runs to reduce habituation or fatigue effects. During mqBOLD imaging, conditions were presented pseudo-randomly for pCASL and T2* mapping. DSC (CTRL) were performed at the end of the session to avoid signal artifacts. The contrast agent was administered via a pump (Medtron AG) under a medical doctor's supervision.

After the imaging session, participants completed a memory questionnaire about the MEM condition, rating the ease of recalling specific events on a difficulty scale (1 = ‘very easy' to 4 = ‘very difficult‘) and the detail of their memories on a concreteness scale (1 = ‘very detailed' to 4 = ‘very vague‘). On average, participants scored 1.8 ± 0.7 on difficulty and 2.0 ± 0.6 on concreteness, indicating that recalling events was relatively easy and memories were reasonably detailed. Participants took an average of only 2.5 ± 1 s to recall an event.

A subsample of N = 10 subjects from the main study performed only the CALC and CTRL conditions but instead received two DSC scans (totaling a full clinical dose of 16 ml). This enabled calculation of within-subject ∆CBV for task effects.

fMRI BOLD data were obtained for CALC and MEM tasks with a 30-s block design (four repetitions each, interleaved with 30-s CTRL blocks), alongside extended 3-min blocks (four repetitions each, interleaved with 1-min CTRL blocks), totaling 41 min of scan time.

Study design and data acquisition were identical to the main study, utilizing the group median CBV data from the main study for analyses.

BOLD fMRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 20.2.4 (ref. 86) within a Docker container based on Nipype 1.6.1 (ref. 87). Preprocessing involved segmentation, estimation of motion parameters and other confounds, correction for susceptibility distortions, coregistration in native T1w space and normalization to MNI152-ICBM-2mm space with a nonlinear sixth-generation registration model developed by Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. fMRIPrep relies on FSL 5.0.9 for registering EPI time-series data to T1w data with boundary-based registration, FSL FAST for brain tissue segmentation and ANTs 2.3.3 (ref. 88) for spatial normalization to MNI space in a multiscale, mutual-information-based, nonlinear registration scheme, where all transforms are first concatenated and registration steps applied at once. As part of the fMRIPrep pipeline89,90, correction for head motion and susceptibility distortions was performed in the subject's native space, applying a single composite transform to the BOLD fMRI time series. The same data were also resampled into standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin6Asym space. Preprocessed BOLD fMRI data, without global signal regression, were then used as input to the PLS model. All datasets from the main, control and replication studies underwent identical processing.

We calculated quantitative parameter maps using in-house scripts (in Matlab) and SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL). Figure 1 illustrates the procedure and shows representative subject-averaged parameter maps.

T2/T2*-mapping: Quantitative T2 and T2* parameter maps were obtained by applying monoexponential fits to multiecho spin and gradient echo data, as described by our group44,45,91. Corrections for macroscopic magnetic background fields were implemented81, and motion artifacts were addressed through redundant acquisitions of k-space centers82.

R2′ maps were calculated via

yielding the transverse, reversible relaxation rate that depends on the vascular dHb content within a voxel92,93. Caution is required when interpreting these values at air–tissue boundaries (magnetic field inhomogeneities), in deep GM (iron deposition) or in WM structures (orientation effects in myelin), as previously discussed45,81.

CBV maps were derived from DSC MRI after contrast agent application via integration of leakage-corrected ΔR2* curves94 and subsequent normalization to a WM value of 2.5% (ref. 95). The DSC procedure has been described by our group83,96.

OEF maps were calculated from R2′ and CBV parameter maps via the mqBOLD approach39,43 and, as implemented by our group44, via

with c = γ × \(\frac{4}{3}\,\) × π × Δχ0 × Hct × B0 (gyromagnetic ratio γ = 2.675 × 108 s−1 T−1; susceptibility difference between fully deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin Δχ0 = 0.264 × 10−6; magnetic field strength B0 = 3 T; small-vessel hematocrit Hct, calculated as 85% of the (large-vessel) hematocrit values measured in each subject44,97). OEF (ratio) represents the amount of oxygen extracted from capillaries among passage.

CBF maps were calculated from pCASL data as described in ref. 84. Specifically, CBF was calculated as the pairwise difference of the averaged and motion-corrected label and control images and then scaled by a proton-density-weighted image.

CMRO2 maps: For each condition separately, we calculated the voxel-wise CMRO2 by combining all parameter maps via Fick's principle:

where CaO2 reflects the arterial oxygen content (in µmol) for each subject and was calculated as CaO2 = 0.334 × Hct × 55.6 × O2sat, with O2sat being the oxygen saturation measured by a pulse oximeter93.

All parameter maps were calculated in subject space and coregistered to the first echo of the T2 data. Any normalization into MNI space was performed afterward. Specifically, parameter maps were first coregistered to native T1w space before applying the normalization matrix to MNI space, as derived from fMRIPrep. CBF values were upscaled by 25% to account for the systematic underestimation of CBF due to the four background suppression pulses, as motivated here98,99. The data of the replication study were processed identically to those of the main study.

For our analyses in standard space, we excluded voxels that fell within the lowest 15th percentile of the temporal SNR for more than 66% of participants, based on the BOLD fMRI data from each subject and voxel. The excluded voxels were primarily found in regions with significant susceptibility artifacts, such as the fronto- and temporo-basal brain areas. Additionally, we masked out the cerebellum and any voxels with a GM probability of less than 0.5. The resulting group mask was then applied to both the output of the GLM group analysis and the input matrices for the PLS analyses. For the analyses in native space, we additionally masked CSF-prone areas (T2 > 90 ms), high-susceptibility areas (R2′ > 9 s−1), voxels with a high percentage of blood volume (CBV > 10%, probably driven by larger veins/arteries) and voxels with biologically implausible values, such as T2′ > 90 ms, OEF > 0.9 and CBF > 90 milliliters per 100 grams per minute.

After a sensitivity analysis at our institution, we found that half the clinical dosage of contrast agent was sufficient to reliably assess CBV in healthy subjects. Therefore, the final subset of ten participants received two half-dosages during the CALC and CTRL conditions, allowing us to quantify CBV in both conditions. We calculated the voxel ∆CBV for CALC compared to CTRL in subject space and averaged the results across Glasser's 360 functional ROIs100. This subject-averaged ∆CBV map was then used to estimate a CBV surrogate map for the remaining 30 subjects, who had only one baseline CBV measurement. These data are among the most empirically supported data for ∆CBV in quantitative fMRI studies, but this was possible only for the CALC condition. Hence, we continued using the CBV CTRL map to calculate CMRO2 during the MEM condition.

The estimation of quantitative CMRO2 maps relies on the combination of R2′, CBV and CBF values, according to equation (3). To control for potential error propagation during voxel-wise analyses, especially from R2′ measurements (see appendix in ref. 73), we calculated R2′ parameter maps during MEM and CALC from baseline R2′ and BOLD fMRI data as suggested by ref. 101. Instead of calculating ΔR2′ from quantitative R2′ (multiecho gradient-echo-based T2*) during task conditions, ΔR2′ is approximated as

with TE = 30 ms, R2′0 being the baseline R2′ and \(\frac{\Delta S}{{S}_{0}}\) the BOLD signal change, derived from task data. R2′ in CALC and MEM was calculated via R2′ = R2′0 + (ΔR2′ × R2′0) and fed into OEF and CMRO2 calculations according to equations (2) and (3). These semiquantitative CMRO2 parameter maps differ from the regional CMRO2 maps only in their underlying R2′ values. In Supplementary Fig. 5, we compared the PLS results of the BOLD-informed approach with those of the fully quantitative approach and found very similar signal ranges and voxel distributions.

The Davis model was originally designed for calibrated fMRI and allows to derive ∆CMRO2 by using carbon dioxide breathing as a physiological method to manipulate CBF independently of CMRO2. The model relies on the parameters M, α and β (ref. 48):

where α is a power-law exponent relating ∆CBV to ∆CBF, β reflects the microvascular anatomy93 and M is commonly referred to the maximum ∆BOLD that occurs when all hemoglobin is fully oxygenated and depends on baseline OEF92. Previously, α = 0.38 was used102, but more recent studies have identified lower values. In Fig. 3a, we plotted the range of predicted ∆BOLD using empirical values for all parameters, derived from recent calibration studies with α = 0.23, β = 1.3 (ref. 93) and M = 5.5 (ref. 78). Assuming α and β, the fractional change in CMRO2 can be calculated from combined BOLD signal and CBF measurements during tasks78,92,103.

PLS analyses were performed using the pyls library in the Python language (Python Software Foundation, version 3.8). Mean-centered PLS is a data-reduction method that computes latent variables (LVs) and corresponding brain patterns, optimizing the relationship between brain signals and experimental design104. In this study, we used PLS analyses to perform group-level statistics to identify brain regions that distinguish between task conditions (CALC or MEM) and a baseline condition (CTRL or REST). This analysis was applied to both BOLD fMRI and mqBOLD data, allowing for comparison of statistical maps. For mqBOLD data, we used quantitative OEF, CBF or CMRO2 values per voxel and subject. For BOLD fMRI data, we used median percent signal change (from either CTRL or REST) across 24 s (20 TRs) per task condition, excluding the first 6 s of each task block to account for the hemodynamic response lag.

The significance of the LVs (multivariate patterns) was tested using permutation tests (3,000 permutations), and the reliability of brain saliences (voxel contributions) was assessed through bootstrap resampling (3,000 samples). Significant brain regions were identified using the bootstrap ratio (BSR), where a BSR > ±2 suggests a 95% confidence interval (CI) if the bootstrap distribution is normal105,106. To interpret BSR maps, they must be compared to design scores of each condition within each LV for task differences. In this manuscript, orange-red indicates a positive task effect (higher values during the task versus baseline), and blue indicates the opposite. We visualized the whole-brain, non-thresholded PLS results by transforming statistical maps from native to surface space with the ‘vol_to_surf' function from nilearn's surface toolbox and plotted them on the ‘fsaverage pial left and right mesh' using ‘plot_surf_stat_mat.‘

The BOLD clusters in Fig. 2d are based on a PLS analysis of BOLD data, with statistical maps thresholded at a BSR score of >±3. We extracted regions with a size of >1,000 connected voxels using Nilearn's region package in Python and fused fragmented clusters that belonged to the same Yeo network upon visual inspection79.

To validate the PLS analyses, we used a general linear model (GLM) approach as recommended by ref. 107. The GLM included confound variables such as CSF and WM signals, dvars, framewise displacement and translations/rotations across the x, y and z axes. We applied a high-pass filter (100 s) and a 6-mm smoothing kernel. For native space analyses, we used individual first-level z maps (z > 2.5). The contrasts calculated were CALC-positive (CALC > CTRL or REST), CALC-negative (CALC < CTRL or REST), MEM-positive (MEM > CTRL) and MEM-negative (MEM < CTRL). To cross-validate the PLS results, we used FWE-corrected z maps from the second-level analysis.

For the native space analyses, we calculated median values within each native-space ROI from the first-level GLM output (z > 2.5) for each subject. We assessed significant task-related differences compared to baseline using paired-samples two-sided t-tests across subjects. For other analyses, we obtained median voxel values in standard space across subjects (Figs. 2b, 3b and 4a,d). Bar plots (Fig. 2d) were created using Python's seaborn library108 with error bars indicating a 95% CI based on 2,000 bootstraps. A CI that included zero indicated a statistically nonsignificant median delta value. To analyze hemodynamic differences between discordant and concordant voxels, we conducted paired t-tests on median subject values, and baseline differences were assessed using independent-sample permutation tests. High-resolution external maps were downsampled to 2-mm MNI standard space before analysis.

Survey results suggest that peer reviewers are increasingly turning to AI.Credit: Panther Media Global/Alamy

More than 50% of researchers have used artificial intelligence while peer reviewing manuscripts, according to a survey of some 1,600 academics across 111 countries by the publishing company Frontiers.

Nearly one-quarter of respondents said that they had increased their use of AI for peer review over the past year. The findings, posted on 11 December by the publisher, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, confirm what many researchers have long suspected, given the ubiquity of tools powered by large-language models such as ChatGPT.

“It's good to confront the reality that people are using AI in peer-review tasks,” says Elena Vicario, Frontiers' director of research integrity. But the poll suggests that researchers are using AI in peer review “in contrast with a lot of external recommendations of not uploading manuscripts to third-party tools”, she adds.

Source: Unlocking AI's untapped potential, Frontiers

Some publishers, including Frontiers, allow limited use of AI in peer review, but require reviewers to disclose it. Like most other publishers, Frontiers forbids reviewers from uploading unpublished manuscripts to chatbot websites because of concerns about confidentiality, sensitive data and compromising authors' intellectual property. 

The survey report calls on publishers to respond to the growing use of AI across scientific publishing and implement policies that are better suited to the ‘new reality'. Frontiers itself has launched an in-house AI platform for peer reviewers across all of its journals. “AI should be used in peer review responsibly, with very clear guides, with human accountability and with the right training,” says Vicario.

“We agree that publishers can and should proactively and robustly communicate best practices, particularly disclosure requirements that reinforce transparency to support responsible AI use,” says a spokesperson for the publisher Wiley, which is based in Hoboken, New Jersey. In a similar survey published earlier this year, Wiley found that “researchers have relatively low interest and confidence in AI use cases for peer review,” they add. “We are not seeing anything in our portfolio that contradicts this.”

The Frontiers' survey found that, among the respondents who use AI in peer review, 59% use it to help write their peer-review reports. Twenty-nine per cent said they use it to summarize the manuscript, identify gaps or check references. And 28% use AI to flag potential signs of misconduct, such as plagiarism and image duplication (see ‘AI assistance').

Mohammad Hosseini, who studies research ethics and integrity at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, says the survey is “a good attempt to gauge the acceptability of the use of AI in peer review and the prevalence of its use in different contexts”.

AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried

AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried

Some researchers are running their own tests to determine how well AI models support peer review. Last month, engineering scientist Mim Rahimi at the University of Houston in Texas designed an experiment to test whether the large language model (LLM) GPT-5 could review a Nature Communications paper1 he co-authored.

He used four different set-ups, from entering basic prompts asking the LLM to review the paper without additional context to providing it with research articles from the literature to help it to evaluate his paper's novelty and rigour. Rahimi then compared the AI-generated output with the actual peer-review reports that he had received from the journal, and discussed his findings in a YouTube video.

His experiment showed that GPT-5 could mimic the structure of a peer-review report and use polished language, but that it failed to produce constructive feedback and made factual errors. Even advanced prompts did not improve the AI's performance — in fact, the most complex set-up generated the weakest peer review. Another study found that AI-generated reviews of 20 manuscripts tended to match human ones but fell short on providing detailed critique.

Mosasaurs were enormous marine reptiles that lived more than 66 million years ago, but new evidence shows they did not spend all their time in the ocean. Researchers analyzing a mosasaur tooth discovered in North Dakota have found strong signs that some of these animals lived in rivers. The tooth likely came from an individual that grew up to 11 meters long. Led by scientists at Uppsala University, the international research team concluded that mosasaurs adapted to freshwater river systems during the final million years before their extinction.

The tooth was uncovered in 2022 from a river deposit in North Dakota. It was found alongside a tooth from a Tyrannosaurus rex and a jawbone from a crocodylian, in a region already known for fossils of the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus. The unusual mix of land dinosaurs, river-dwelling crocodiles, and a giant marine reptile immediately stood out. If mosasaurs were ocean animals, how did one of their teeth end up preserved in a river?

Isotopes Provide the Answer

To solve this puzzle, researchers from the United States, Sweden, and the Netherlands examined the chemical makeup of the mosasaur tooth enamel using isotope analysis.

Because the mosasaur tooth, the T. rex tooth, and the crocodylian jawbone all date to roughly the same time, about 66 million years ago, the scientists could directly compare their chemistry. The work was carried out at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) in Amsterdam and focused on isotopes of oxygen, strontium, and carbon. The mosasaur tooth contained unusually high levels of the lighter oxygen isotope (16O), which is typical of freshwater environments rather than marine ones. Strontium isotope ratios also pointed to a freshwater habitat.

"Carbon isotopes in teeth generally reflect what the animal ate. Many mosasaurs have low 13C values because they dive deep. The mosasaur tooth found with the T. rex tooth, on the other hand, has a higher 13C value than all known mosasaurs, dinosaurs and crocodiles, suggesting that it did not dive deep and may sometimes have fed on drowned dinosaurs," says Melanie During, one of the study's corresponding authors.

"The isotope signatures indicated that this mosasaur had inhabited this freshwater riverine environment. When we looked at two additional mosasaur teeth found at nearby, slightly older, sites in North Dakota, we saw similar freshwater signatures. These analyses shows that mosasaurs lived in riverine environments in the final million years before going extinct," says During.

When Seas Slowly Turned Into Rivers

The findings also help explain how this lifestyle shift became possible. Over time, increasing amounts of freshwater flowed into the Western Interior Seaway, a vast inland sea that once ran north to south across what is now central North America and split the continent in two. As freshwater input grew, the seaway gradually changed from salty to brackish and eventually to mostly freshwater, similar to conditions seen today in the Gulf of Bothnia. The researchers suggest this process created a 'halocline', with lighter freshwater forming a surface layer above denser saltwater. Isotope data supports this idea.

"For comparison with the mosasaur teeth, we also measured fossils from other marine animals and found a clear difference. All gill-breathing animals had isotope signatures linking them to brackish or salty water, while all lung-breathing animals lacked such signatures. This shows that mosasaurs, which needed to come to the surface to breathe, inhabited the upper freshwater layer and not the lower layer where the water was more saline," says Per Ahlberg, coauthor of the study and promotor of Dr. During.

Adapting to a Changing World

The researchers argue that the teeth studied clearly belonged to mosasaurs that had adjusted to these new conditions. Large predators shifting between habitats is not unheard of in evolutionary history.

"Unlike the complex adaptation required to move from freshwater to marine habitats, the reverse adaptation is generally simpler," says During.

Modern animals show similar flexibility. River dolphins live entirely in freshwater even though their ancestors were marine. The estuarine crocodile, known in Australia as the saltwater crocodile, regularly moves between rivers and the open ocean, hunting wherever prey is available.

A Bus-Sized Predator in Unexpected Places

Mosasaur fossils are common in marine deposits across North America, Europe, and Africa dating from 98-66 million years ago. In contrast, they are rarely found in North Dakota, making this discovery especially striking. The size of the tooth suggests an animal up to 11 meters long, roughly the length of a bus. Earlier discoveries of mosasaur bones at a nearby site support this estimate. The tooth likely belonged to a prognathodontine mosasaur, although its exact genus cannot be identified. Close relatives in the genus Prognathodon had massive heads, powerful jaws, and robust teeth, and are thought to have been opportunistic predators capable of attacking large prey.

"The size means that the animal would rival the largest killer whales, making it an extraordinary predator to encounter in riverine environments not previously associated with such giant marine reptiles," says Ahlberg.

The research was carried out by scientists from Uppsala University in collaboration with Eastern West Virginia Community and Technical College, Moorefield, West Virginia, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and the North Dakota Geological Survey. The article draws on a chapter from Melanie During's doctoral thesis, which she defended at Uppsala University in November 2024.

Three U.S. senators have launched an investigation into whether tech giants, driven by soaring AI energy demands, are raising residential power bills. Separately, Amazon released a white paper Tuesday stating that its data centers are not the problem, and that in some regions it actually pays more than required for energy use.

The Democratic senators sent letters to Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and three data center firms, according to the New York Times. The lawmakers raised concerns that energy demand driven by artificial intelligence was forcing utilities to deploy new power plants and upgrade the grid — with local ratepayers helping foot the bill.  

“We write in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. data centers' energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities,” the senators said, according to the Times.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut issued the letters. 

Amazon offered a much different take in an analysis that examined the potential benefits, costs and risks that large energy loads created by data centers have on electric utilities.

The Amazon-funded study found that in some locations, the power bills currently being paid by the company more than cover the utility impacts. A typical 100 megawatt data center was estimated to pay an additional $3.4 million beyond the costs associated with its electricity use, which also include a utility's infrastructure upgrades, deployment of new energy generation, operations and maintenance.

Utilities can use that surplus “to reduce rates for other ratepayers, but how this potential benefit is realized will differ across jurisdictions,” the study stated. 

The assessment examined Amazon data center campuses in Oregon, California and Mississippi and was performed by E3, an independent economic consulting firm.

The white paper said the benefit to the utilities and other customers should continue into 2030, but noted that utilities will need to adjust their rates in the future to ensure that ratepayers are not subsidizing tech operations.

“To continue to prevent cross-subsidization, utilities must keep pace and leverage the full range of tools available to them to mitigate these risks…” the document states. 

The rapid growth of the sector is central to the debate. A Department of Energy report projected that data center energy use, which was more than 4% of U.S. electricity consumption in 2023, could triple by 2028. This forecast is fueled by tech giants' expanding investment: Microsoft and Amazon each reported nearly $35 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter, much of it on data center infrastructure.

The tech giants are also investing globally in new wind and solar power and energy storage, while pursuing more costly power sources including nuclear.

In October, a group of U.S. representatives raised similar concerns to the senators', asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Edison Electric Institute and the Data Center Coalition for information regarding data center impacts on residential power bills “to help ensure everyday Americans and small businesses aren't bearing the brunt of data center energy costs.”

Washington representatives Kim Schrier and Adam Smith as well as Oregon Rep. Andrea Salinas were among the 20 lawmakers who made the request.

The investigations come amid a general rise in household expenses, making the allocation of utility costs particularly contentious. Residential electricity costs nationwide are on the rise, according to federal data. Power bills rose more than 7% on average when comparing September rates to a year earlier.

But the causes of the increase are complicated. A study this month in a peer-reviewed journal concluded that multiple factors impact electricity prices, including inflation, fluctuating gas prices and natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms and wildfires.

Caroline Merin, who spent nearly a decade developing on-demand services as the first Latin American general manager for Uber Eats and later the COO of Rappi, recognized how badly healthcare tech lagged behind. While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication.

“I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they'll respond,” she told TechCrunch.

But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said.

Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors' communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched Leona Health, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors' WhatsApp accounts.

On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst; Accel; Maven Clinic CEO Kate Ryder; Nubank CEO David Vélez; and Rappi CEO Simón Borrero. The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties.

With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup's mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor's behalf.

The startup will also soon launch a fully autonomous agent that will handle conversational scheduling and simple intake.

Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel.

“These poor doctors, they're receiving requests for very serious medical consults to, ‘I need a letter for my kids' school,' or, ‘I want a receipt for my appointment last week,'” Merin said.

Since these messages can arrive in the evenings and on weekends, physicians are often forced to monitor their WhatsApp around the clock. Leona solves this by immediately alerting doctors only to the most serious health requests and allowing them to deprioritize more routine or administrative questions.

“The idea is to help the doctor regain time,” Merin said. “We're hearing from our users that they're saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.”

While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company's long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the U.S., patients also demand and are permitted to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic.

Leona's team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located.

Washington and 35 other states reached a settlement with Hyundai and Kia in which the automakers will provide restitution to consumers and fixes to millions of eligible vehicles nationwide that lacked industry-standard, anti-theft technology.

Washington Attorney General Nick Brown's office announced details of the settlement Tuesday, in which Hyundai and Kia have agreed to:

Eligible car owners can receive up $4,500 for a total loss or up to $2,250 for a partial loss, according to compensation details on the settlement website. The claim deadline is March 31, 2027.

An engine immobilizer prevents thieves from starting a vehicle's engine without the vehicle's “smart” key, which stores the vehicle's electronic security code. The lack of the necessary tech on cars resulted in “an epidemic of car thefts and joy riding” across Washington and the country, 

“Security is a key piece for families looking to buy a vehicle, but Hyundai and Kia spent years selling people cars that lacked the industry's standard protections,” Brown said in a statement. “Year after year, consumers have been easily victimized because of the automakers' failure here.”

In late 2020, teenage boys began posting videos on social media describing how to steal the cars simply by removing a plastic piece under the steering wheel and using a USB cord. Posts with the hashtag “Kia Boys” racked up more than 33 million views on TikTok by September 2022, according to CNBC. The videos included teens engaged in reckless driving of the stolen vehicles.

Despite years of evidence, Hyundai and Kia waited until 2023 to launch a service campaign to update the software on most of the affected vehicles, Brown's office said. The update was easily bypassed by thieves.

Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison filed a similar lawsuit against Kia and Hyundai in January 2023.

“Kia and Hyundai chose to cut corners and cut costs at the expense of their customers and the public. As a result, our police force has had to tackle a huge rise in vehicle theft and related problems with already stretched resources,” Davison said in a statement at the time.

In May 2023, Hyundai and Kia agreed to a consumer class-action lawsuit settlement worth $200 million over rampant thefts of the Korean automakers' vehicles. The Seattle City Attorney's Office said at the time that it was a “good first step for consumers” but that the settlement involving individual owners “does not include the litigation brought by the City.”

We reached out to the City Attorney for comment on Tuesday and will update when we hear back.

Under the new multistate settlement, eligible consumers will be notified by the companies that they will have one year from the date of the notice to make an appointment to have the zinc-reinforced ignition cylinder protector installed at their local Hyundai or Kia authorized dealerships. Consumers are urged to schedule the installation of the zinc-reinforce ignition cylinder protector as soon as possible.

Consumers who previously installed the software update on their vehicles (or were scheduled to do so) but nonetheless experienced a theft or attempted theft of their vehicle on or after April 29, 2025, are eligible to file a claim for restitution for certain theft and attempted-theft related expenses.

An epidemiologist who has speculated about whether there is a connection between Covid-19 vaccines and “turbo cancer” in young people, and works as chief epidemiologist at a company that sells ivermectin alongside reviews that claim it has efficacy as a cancer treatment, has been appointed by president Donald Trump to a key position overseeing the National Cancer Program.

Harvey Risch, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, announced his appointment as chair of the President's Cancer Panel on X earlier this month. Risch's profile page on the Yale website has also been updated to read “In November 2025, President Trump appointed Dr. Risch to Chair the President's Cancer panel.”

No formal announcement was made by the president or the White House, and the Cancer Panel website's list of current members does not include Risch. The White House, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Cancer Panel, and Risch did not respond to requests for comment.

In his new position, Risch will oversee a group which is assigned to monitor “the development and execution of the activities of the National Cancer Program and report to the President on progress, efficacy, and opportunities for improvement,” according to the Cancer Panel's website.

As well as lending credibility to unproven treatments for Covid-19 like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin—he promoted the former in congressional testimony—Risch has more recently wondered whether the Covid-19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer” in some people. Now experts are worried that he could derail critical research into the causes and treatments for cancer.

“Having him on the panel charged with monitoring the progress of efforts to improve cancer treatment and providing recommendations to the president is a disaster for cancer patients, as he will inject conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and false claims about cancer into the panel's reports,” alleges David Gorski, a surgical oncologist.

Another expert, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they're afraid of retribution for speaking out about a Trump appointee, warned that they are concerned his conspiracy-adjacent beliefs might bleed into the National Cancer Program, a longstanding effort to coordinate the funding of critical cancer research and training.

“I am genuinely concerned that we are going to see ivermectin for cancer promoted at the federal level,” the doctor, who closely tracks the spread of medical disinformation, tells WIRED.

Risch is just the latest in a litany of controversial or unqualified figures who have been appointed to key public health positions in the federal government in Trump's second term in office, including the appointments of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and former daytime talk show host Dr. Memhet Oz being appointed to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Trump has also nominated Casey Means to be surgeon general despite the fact she does not currently have a licence to practice medicine. Kennedy, meanwhile, has filled his vaccine advisory committee with doctors who have promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.

Risch was among a cohort of medical professionals who embraced the use of alternative treatments for Covid-19 during the global pandemic in 2020. He was an early proponent of hydroxychloroquine, relying on questionable data to back up his claims.

At the time, his Yale colleagues publicly criticized his efforts. “As his colleagues, we defend the right of Dr. Risch, a respected cancer epidemiologist, to voice his opinions,” they wrote in a public letter. “But he is not an expert in infectious disease epidemiology and he has not been swayed by the body of scientific evidence from rigorously conducted clinical trials, which refute the plausibility of his belief and arguments.”

Despite—or perhaps because of—this, Risch became a fixture on right-wing media outlets during the pandemic, including appearances on Fox News and Steve Bannon's War Room podcast. A 2022 House Select Committee report also revealed that Risch was in direct contact with people adjacent to the Trump administration about the use of hydroxychloroquine.

As well as his position at Yale, Risch is also the chief epidemiologist for The Wellness Company, a MAGA-aligned alternative health organization that sells supplements as well as hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and a treatment that has been advocated for as a Covid vaccine “detox.” While the website does not advertise ivermectin as a cancer treatment, the reviews of the products clearly show that customers are using it as a way to treat their cancer. The Wellness Company did not respond to requests for comments.

In 2023, Risch speculated about whether there is a link between the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine and so-called “turbo cancers.” This echoed claims that anti-vaccine activists online had been promoting for years, suggesting without evidence that the vaccines could cause more aggressive forms of cancer.

“The most serious errors in his beliefs are in regards to ‘turbo cancer,'” says Frank Han, a pediatric subspecialist at the Heart Center at Connecticut Children's hospital. “This is so fundamentally against basic principles of oncology and epidemiology that it is hard to believe someone professionally trained in epidemiology would make this mistake.”

Risch's speculation is in direct opposition to the advice dispensed by the National Cancer Institute. “There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” the NCI website reads. “Furthermore, COVID-19 vaccines do not change your DNA.”

In fact, the NCI says that cancer patients tend to be older, have weakened immune systems, and other comorbidities, which “are all reasons for them to get vaccinated.”

Risch, if his appointment is confirmed, will replace Elizabeth Jaffee, a pancreatic cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University whose term as the panel's chair ended in March,. “There typically is turnover with a new administration,“ Jaffee, who has been critical of the Trump administration's cuts to funding for cancer research, tells WIRED. “My term was toward the end at that point.”

The panel currently has two other members, Mitchel Berger, a neurosurgeon and Carol Brown, gynecologic cancer surgeon. Neither responded to requests for comment.

MX-7 features a new formula for lower resistance and higher performance.

Arctic has a well-earned reputation for its thermal pastes, with its MX-6 being one of the best thermal pastes on the market. The company has introduced the MX-7 to stay ahead of the competition. It claims the MX-7 is the company's coolest thermal paste to date, with prices ranging from $6-10.

Having launched three years ago, the MX-6 still feels quite new, but in a competitive market where new products come out every year, staying relevant is key. The MX-7 features a new formula that Arctic understandably keeps under wraps. Still, the company shares that the MX-7 boasts low adhesion for even distribution, high viscosity for flow resistance, and high cohesion for more durable bonding.

Arctic takes a different approach from other thermal paste brands by not emphasizing thermal conductivity values for its products. As detailed in the specification sheet, the MX-7 is up to 22% less viscous than the MX-6 and approximately 12% denser than its predecessor. In Arctic's own testing, using a Core Ultra 9 285K at 4.5 GHz and drawing around 284W in an ambient temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the MX-7 managed to deliver temperatures about 3% cooler than the MX-6 and up to 6% cooler than the MX-4.

Rest assured, the thermal paste is completely safe to use with direct-die cooling solutions because it's not electrically conductive or capacitive. This means you don't need to worry about any risk of short circuits or discharges that could damage your devices.

While the MX-7 is less thick than the MX-6, it still has a nice, viscous consistency. Arctic suggests avoiding spreading the paste with a spatula. Instead, applying it in a simple cross pattern is best, and let your CPU cooler do the magic. The pressure from the cooler will evenly spread the MX-7, filling in any gaps and giving you complete coverage. This helpful tip also works well for coolers with direct-touch heat pipes.

Since the MX-7 is non-capacitive and non-conductive, it's simple to wipe away excess or old applications with ease. Arctic also offers a separate MX Cleaner wipe that's perfect for cleaning thermal paste. Plus, these wipes can be purchased together as an MX-7 bundle for added convenience.

You can easily find the MX-7 for sale on Amazon. The latest thermal paste isn't much pricier than the previous version. To give you an idea, the 2-gram and 8-gram syringes cost just about $1.40 more, while the other MX-7 options are less than $0.50 more expensive than their older versions.

With so many Arctic knockoffs out there, it's a good idea to buy your MX-7 from trusted retailers. Arctic has also improved its MX Authenticity Check system, allowing you to easily verify your product's authenticity using a unique QR code for each item. This helps ensure you get the real deal and have peace of mind with your purchase.

The animated adaptation of The Mighty Nein is based on the Critical Role campaign played via Dungeons & Dragons. Like Vox Machina, there are a lot of D&D-isms implemented throughout each episode, and this week's features the most important of all: shopping.

io9's got an exclusive clip of tomorrow's episode, “Belonging.” With the Nein back in Zadash, Caleb (Liam O'Brien) finds himself in need of some spell components, which takes him to the Invulnerable Vagrant, a magic shop that's got everything he needs. It's also owned by Pumat Sol, a firbolg who runs it with the help of his three simulacra handling the front work while Pumat Prime takes care of everything in the back. And like in the campaign, all four Pumats are voiced by Matthew Mercer.

Pumat's a fan-favorite character owing to his kind disposition and the imagined (and now real) sight gag of three of the same guy finishing each other's sentences, working around the shop, and people reacting to seeing that for the first time. Think of him as the Nein's equivalent to Gilmore from Vox Machina: he pops up throughout the campaign whenever the Mighty Nein end up back in Zadash, and he's a hoot each time, so expect to see him again whenever they eventually come back into town.

If that wasn't enough, we've also got a behind-the-scenes look at how Pumat's introduction was brought to life. Check it out below!

The penultimate episode of The Mighty Nein lands on Prime Video overnight, followed by the season finale next week.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

How many penguins are in this wildlife video? Can you track the orange ball in the cat video? Which teams are playing, and who scored? Give me step-by-step instructions from this cooking video?

Those are examples of queries that can be fielded by Molmo 2, a new family of open-source AI vision models from the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) that can watch, track, analyze and answer questions about videos: describing what's happening, and pinpointing exactly where and when.

Ai2 cites benchmark tests showing Molmo 2 beating open-source models on short video analysis and tracking, and surpassing closed systems like Google's Gemini 3 on video tracking, while approaching their performance on other image and video tasks.

In a series of demos for reporters recently at the Ai2 offices in Seattle, researchers showed how Molmo 2 could analyze a variety of short video clips in different ways. 

Molmo 2, announced Tuesday morning, caps a year of major milestones for the Seattle-based nonprofit, which has developed a loyal following in business and scientific circles by building fully open AI systems. Its approach contrasts sharply with the closed or partially open approaches of industry giants like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.

Founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Ai2 this year landed $152 million from the NSF and Nvidia, partnered on an AI cancer research initiative led by Seattle's Fred Hutch, and released Olmo 3, a text model rivaling Meta, DeepSeek and others.

Ai2 has seen more than 21 million downloads of its models this year and nearly 3 billion queries across its systems, said Ali Farhadi, the Ai2 CEO, during the media briefing last week at the institute's new headquarters on the northern shore of Seattle's Lake Union. 

As a nonprofit, Ai2 isn't trying to compete commercially with the tech giants — it's aiming to advance the state of the art and make those advances freely available.

The institute has released open models for text (OLMo), images (the original Molmo), and now video — building toward what he described as a unified model that reasons across all modalities.

“We're basically building models that are competitive with the best things out there,” Farhadi said — but in a completely open manner, for a succession of different media and situations.

In addition to Molmo 2, Ai2 on Monday released Bolmo, an experimental text model that processes language at the character level rather than in word fragments — a technical shift that improves handling of spelling, rare words, and multilingual text.

With the newly released Molmo 2, the focus is video. To be clear: the model analyzes video, it doesn't generate video — think understanding footage rather than creating it.

The original Molmo, released last September, could analyze static images with precision rivaling closed-source competitors. It introduced a “pointing” capability that let it identify specific objects within a frame. Molmo 2 brings that same approach to video and multi-image understanding.

The concept isn't new. Google's Gemini, OpenAI's GPT-4o, and Meta's Perception LM can all process video. But in line with Ai2's broader mission as a nonprofit institute, Molmo 2 is fully open, with its model weights, training code, and training data all publicly released.

That's different from “open weight” models that release the final product but not the original recipe, and a stark contrast to closed systems from Google, OpenAI and others.

The distinction is not just an academic principle. Ai2's approach means developers can trace a model's behavior back to its training data, customize it for specific uses, and avoid being locked into a vendor's ecosystem.

Ai2 also emphasizes efficiency. For example, Meta's Perception LM was trained on 72.5 million videos. Molmo 2 used about 9 million, relying on high-quality human annotations.

The result, Ai2 claims, is a smaller, more efficient model that outperforms their own much larger model from last year, and comes close to matching commercial systems from Google and OpenAI, while being simple enough to run on a single machine.

When the original Molmo introduced its pointing capability last year — allowing the model to identify specific objects in an image — competing models quickly adopted the feature.

“We know they adopted our data because they perform exactly as well as we do,” said Ranjay Krishna, who leads Ai2's computer vision team. Krishna is also a University of Washington assistant professor, and several of his graduate students also work on the project.

Farhadi frames the competitive dynamic differently than most in the industry.

“If you do real open source, I would actually change the word competition to collaboration,” he said. “Because there is no need to compete. Everything is out there. You don't need to reverse engineer. You don't need to rebuild it. Just grab it, build on top of it, do the next thing. And we love it when people do that.”

At the same time, Molmo 2 has some clear constraints. The tracking capability — following objects across frames — currently tops out at about 10 items. Ask it to track a crowd or a busy highway, and the model can't keep up.

“This is a very, very new capability, and it's one that's so experimental that we're starting out very small,” Krishna said. “There's no technological limit to this, it just requires more data, more examples of really crowded scenes.”

Long-form video also remains a challenge. The model performs well on short clips, but analyzing longer footage requires compute that Ai2 isn't yet willing to spend. In the playground launching alongside Molmo 2, uploaded videos are limited to 15 seconds.

And unlike some commercial systems, Molmo 2 doesn't process live video streams. It analyzes recordings after the fact. Krishna said the team is exploring streaming capabilities for applications like robotics, where a model would need to respond to observations in real time, but that work is still early.

“There are methods that people have come up with in terms of processing videos over time, streaming videos,” Krishna said. “Those are directions we're looking into next.”

Molmo 2 is available starting today on Hugging Face and Ai2's playground.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Instagram is expanding Reels-viewing beyond mobile, the social network announced on Tuesday. The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.

By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don't have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.

IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.

Reels will also play automatically, so you won't have to keep scrolling to watch what's next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.

Users have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. 

It's worth noting that IG for TV shouldn't be confused with IGTV, which was Instagram's app for watching long-form content before being shut down in 2022. 

The launch of the TV app doesn't come as a surprise, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in October that the company was planning a dedicated TV app. 

“We're exploring TV,” Mosseri said at Bloomberg's Screentime event. “TV is an increasingly important surface, it's been very important for YouTube […] it's been very important for TikTok. So we'd like to figure out how to make sure that we show up in a compelling way on all the relevant devices.”

Mosseri went on to note that it was a mistake for the company not to have explored a TV app earlier, and that he wishes they had done so a few years ago.

Spotting this deal gave me some serious deja vu, as one of my PCs looks very similar and also features some of the same components. I have a gaming rig with a 9800X3D and the same Phanteks NV5S Black case - a gorgeous and amazing value case with superb airflow, a built-in GPU bracket, and a PSU shroud. This CyberPower PC offering available at Newegg is only $1739.99, which is a pretty good value for a prebuilt gaming PC that not only packs the king of gaming CPUs - the AMD Ryzen 9800X3D, but also sports the top-end AMD GPU, the Radeon RX 9070 XT. That makes for one potent gaming PC.

The components list for this CyberPower PC (model-GM 70929) includes the aforementioned Phanteks NV5S Black case, AMD Ryzen 9800X3D processor, Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 2TB SSD, B850 motherboard, AIO liquid cooling, and a 1000W power supply.

This is a great combination of hardware specs for a gaming PC that will blast through any game title you throw at it. The 9800X3D dominates at 1080p gaming, and the included Radeon RX 9070 XT is comparable to the RTX 5070 Ti from Nvidia. Faster on rasterisation, but falling behind on ray-tracing and MFG implementation, but if those last two don't concern you, then it's an absolute beast of a GPU.

This CyberPower gaming PC model (GM 70929) packs the king of gaming CPUs, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, and also AMD's top-tier GPU offering, the Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card. This is quite the potent gaming setup, and it also includes 32GB of DDR5 memory and a 2TB SSD for storage. 

If you've had a chance to take a look at the best gaming CPUs list, you will have noticed that AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D tops the charts. AMD's 3D V-Cache has allowed it to climb to the top of the benchmark leaderboards; the single CCD Ryzen 7 9800X3D still edges ahead of the pack, including its stablemates.

It's the fastest gaming CPU by a considerable margin, especially at 1080p, where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D outpaces the likes of Intel's Core i9-14900K by a massive 30% margin in games. Even offering a solid generational improvement over its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is nearly 15% faster.

The AI race has got senators concerned about rising power costs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Three U.S. Senators — Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. — are looking at how AI data center operations across the country are impacting the cost of electricity for the average American consumer. According to The New York Times, the legislators sent letters to seven tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, CoreWeave, Digital Realty, and Equinix, saying that the massive power demands of the AI data centers they're building have forced utility companies to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their systems.

“We write in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. data centers' energy usage has caused residential electricity bills to skyrocket in nearby communities,” the letter said. It also mentioned that “Utility companies have spent billions of dollars updating the electrical grid to accommodate the unprecedented energy demands of A.I. data centers and appear to recoup the costs by raising residential utility bills.”

Many big tech companies are investing in energy infrastructure to support their growth. But because most of the contracts between them and energy providers, it's difficult for the public to ascertain whether the recent price hikes were caused by the infrastructure build-out for AI data centers or by the utility companies' own upgrade programs. After all, aside from needing to build additional power lines, substations, and power plants to support all these new data centers, they also need to replace older facilities and harden equipment in the face of threats caused by changing conditions, like wildfires.

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory actually discovered that the AI boom probably lowered electricity rates by shouldering some of the upgrade costs necessary for their operations. However, the trend of increasing electricity rates suggests otherwise, with the average household paying 7% more in electricity bills as of September 2025, compared to just a year before.

Electricity is the bottleneck that the AI industry is currently facing, especially as the U.S. aims to outpace China in the development of this technology. The East Asian country recognizes the importance of power generation in this race, with some experts warning that it's already miles ahead, as the U.S.'s lack of supply and infrastructure is setting it back in its long-term AI plan. It has even gotten to the point that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented that “China is going to win the AI race” because of issues with electricity in the U.S.

Digantara, an Indian space surveillance startup, has raised $50 million in a new funding round as it moves beyond space situational awareness into missile tracking, citing growing demand from governments for space-based defense capabilities.

The all-equity Series B round included new investors such as 360 ONE Asset and SBI Investment of Japan, as well as serial entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, with existing backers Peak XV Partners and Kalaari Capital also participating. The funding comes more than two years after the startup's $10 million Series A1 round, bringing its total capital raised to $64.5 million.

Globally, governments are investing more heavily in space-based surveillance and early-warning systems as missile launches and satellite interference become more frequent, with many seeking faster detection than traditional ground-based radar can provide. Digantara aims to tap that market by using its space- and ground-based infrared sensors along with software-based analytics and intelligence.

Founded in 2020, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup initially focused on space situational awareness, tracking debris and objects that could damage satellites. The startup has since expanded its scope to include missile detection and tracking, building on the space- and ground-based sensing and analytics technologies it developed for space surveillance, its founder and chief executive Anirudh Sharma (pictured above) said in an interview.

Digantara launched its first space surveillance satellite, SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking), in January aboard SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission, enabling space-to-space observation. A month later, the startup opened an office in Colorado Springs as part of its push into the U.S. defense market, a move that has since led to contracts with U.S. Space Command for analytics as a service. Its U.S. entity has also been selected for the Missile Defense Agency's SHIELD contract vehicle, which supports next-generation missile defense programs.

“Given we've already built IR sensors, we are now extending our IR capabilities to other domains like mid- and long-wave infrared,” Sharma told TechCrunch.

Digantara has split its operations across geographies to meet national security requirements. Its U.S. team is focused on building larger satellites and spacecraft in the 100-kilogram class tailored to American defense needs, while its India operation concentrates on analytics, data processing, and space situational awareness. The structure reflects the regulatory realities of defense procurement, where sensitive systems must be designed and built domestically for each market.

Digantara has so far closed contracts with a combined value of about $25 million, Sharma told TechCrunch. The startup currently operates across India, Singapore, and the U.S., and plans to expand into Europe by setting up a local entity there as early as 2026.

In India, Digantara operates a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility capable of producing up to five satellites simultaneously, and plans to scale that capacity significantly. The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government of Andhra Pradesh to set up a larger facility that could manufacture as many as 30 satellites at once, which it aims to bring online next year.

Digantara has already been selected as the winning bidder for government defense tenders in India and is completing administrative formalities before work begins, Sharma said.

Through 2026–27, Digantara plans to expand its space- and ground-based infrastructure, including additional electro-optical and lidar satellites for space surveillance, space-based sensors for early missile warning and tracking, and a larger network of ground-based observatories, the company said. It is also exploring the potential use of its lidar and laser technologies for future interceptor systems, Sharma asserted.

Digantara plans to launch another satellite through SpaceX in March, followed by additional launches in June and October, with multiple satellites scheduled for the latter mission. The company aims to deploy a total of 15 satellites over the next two years, Sharma said.

The latest funding, he noted, will support those launches, with about $7 million to $10 million earmarked for expansion in the United States and roughly $2 million to $3 million set aside to establish operations in Europe, while the remainder will be used to scale its India-based manufacturing and operations.

Digantara has seen revenues grow more than tenfold over the past two years, Sharma said, declining to disclose current figures. He added that the company is targeting annual revenues of $25 million to $30 million over the next 18 months as defense and government work ramps up.

The startup currently employs around 125 people, including roughly 80 to 85 engineers.

The IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it?

Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago.

This is Databricks' third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. 

The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers' vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products.

Series L rounds aren't really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts.

Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. 

“The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers.

“Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks' co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement.

The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated.

Adobe is updating its AI video-generation app, Firefly, with a new video editor that supports precise prompt-based edits, as well as adding new third-party models for image and video generation, including Black Forest Labs' FLUX.2 and Topaz Astra. 

Until now, Firefly only supported prompt-based generation, so you would have to recreate the entire clip if any part of the video was not to your liking. With the new editor, you can use text prompts to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, and we also get a new timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds, and other characteristics easily.

The company first announced the new video editor in October in private beta, and now it is rolling out to all users.

The company said that using Runway's Aleph model, users can give Firefly specific instructions, such as “Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject.”

And with Adobe's own Firefly Video model, users can now do stuff like upload a start frame and a reference video of a camera motion and tell it to recreate that camera angle for the video they're working on.

The company also said users can now use the Topaz Labs' Astra model to upscale videos to 1080p or 4K. Black Forest Labs' FLUX.2 image generation model is coming to the app, too, along with a collaborative boards feature. 

The company said FLUX.2 will be available on Firefly across platforms immediately, and Adobe Express users will be able to use FLUX.2 from January.

With competitors releasing new models for image and video generation, Adobe wants to lure users into engaging with its app more. Along with new updates to the Firefly app, the company said subscribers of the Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit, and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model in the Firefly app until January 15.

Adobe has made a ton of changes to its Firefly models and apps this year. In February, the company launched a subscription that let users access various levels of image and video generation; then it launched a new Firefly web app along with mobile apps later in the year, and has added support for more third-party models within the Firefly app.

Of course, the silliness has always been refuted, since nobody has an authentic example of "Berenstein" that isn't itself an error or misprint.It also touches on the lack of care that people tend to have when it comes to getting names right. The creators of the Bears dealt with this in school, with a teacher who absolutely refused to believe that the A spelling was correct, asserting "there is no such name". A very large number of people throughout history have suffered similar fates, where others would dispute the spelling of their name, or indeed their entire name.

> The Sega Channel was an online game service developed by Sega for the Sega Genesis video game console, serving as a content delivery system. Launched on December 12, 1994, the Sega Channel was provided to the public by TCI and Time Warner Cable through cable television services by way of coaxial cable. It was a pay to play service, through which customers could access Genesis games online, play game demos, and get cheat codes. Lasting until July 31, 1998, the Sega Channel operated three years after the release of Sega's next generation console, the Sega Saturn. Though criticized for its poorly timed launch and costly subscription fee, the Sega Channel has been praised for its innovations in downloadable content and impact on online game services.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Channel

"It's bad, and it's getting worse right now."

Kingston Datacenter SSD Business Manager Cameron Crandall said in an interview that NAND prices for RAM and SSD are expected to rise throughout 2026. The Kingston employee said on The Full Nerd Network podcast that NAND prices increased by 246% from 1Q25, 70% of that happening in just the last 60 days. And with this component making up 90% of the bill of materials for an SSD, the company will have to adjust its pricing accordingly.

When asked how consumers could cope with the ongoing shortage and price hikes, Crandall said, “I think the best thing to do if you're looking at upgrading your system is to do it now and not wait because prices are going to continue to go up.” He also added, “My advice today would be to not hold off on that purchase because it will be more expensive 30 days from now, and more likely it will be more expensive 30 days after that.” Crandall also stated that prices are increasing "like we've never seen" in 29 years of working at Kingston.

This contradicts Sapphire's prediction that DRAM prices will stabilize within the next six to eight months, although Crandall says that the memory market has a pricing cycle and that we are in an upswing at the moment. It's likely because of this that memory companies are holding back on expanding their production lines or building new fabs. After all, there is still the threat of the AI bubble that could leave chipmakers holding expensive NAND inventory with zero demand if it bursts.

Another question tackled during the episode is whether Kingston will follow in the footsteps of Micron and exit the consumer business. Thankfully, Crandall confirmed that Kingston is focused on the distribution channel and that the company, alongside other SSD and RAM suppliers, will take up the slack from the shutdown of Crucial.

In the end, Crandall hopes that the shortage doesn't drag on too long. Although he does not believe that this pricing apocalypse would last a decade, as some suggest, he still says that pricing is not headed down anytime soon. So, if you're on the market for memory or storage, he recommends that you get what you can right now.

Two things are important to think about.1. Power should be measured in relative terms not absolute. (For a good treatise on this, read Paul Kennedy's Rise and Fall of the Great Powers). The US would have to be keeping up with China, India, and rest of world to maintain its previous pole position.2. Great nations/empires generally become so at least partially through population growth. This can be organic or engineered (ie: continuously conquering more and more territory) but rising dominance almost never coincides with demographic stagnation, which the US is experiencing. This population plateau has been accurately predicted by the US Census for my entire lifetime.Also nothing about this decline is unusual or unexpected. This is the course of empire, which is not a new concept.

I would argue everything should be measured in relative terms. More often than not this is not the case.>The US would have to be keeping up with China, India, and rest of world to maintain its previous pole position.This is the biggest problem I see. US is not keeping up. Nor its willingness to compete. Taking the US dollar as world reserve currency for granted.

It's the exact opposite: US citizens got fed up with the domestic problems created by Triffin's Dilemma and wanted out.Remember, the "imperial revenue" in our model doesn't get helicoptered into the economy, it pumps assets. Stocks, bonds, and real estate. Your share of the imperial loot is proportional to the value of the assets that you own, and worse, even if you don't have a big house and fat brokerage account you still have to compete with people who do and they're going to bid up the price of anything that doesn't have highly elastic supply. Health care, housing, and education are the ones creating problems. America got a great deal, but most Americans got a raw deal: costs went up, income didn't, misery ensued.Pumped bonds allow (force, really) the government to run deficits (homework: what breaks if they don't? It happened in Clinton's term, you can go and check) and to some extent that distributes the money. There's the whole services narrative which held that the services sector would pump hard enough to backfill manufacturing, but it never did. The people who got the door slammed in their face are no longer convinced that the door is their path to prosperity and now they want to tear the whole thing down.If you want to hear an actual economist talk about this, see "Trade Wars are Class Wars" by Klein and Pettis.

The exporter countries contain smart people who may seek to suppress this process to maintain revenue flows. This prevents the development from happening.Two examples:1: the 'unequal treaties' between 19th century Japan and America prohibited certain kinds of tariffs and subsidies by Japan. This allowed westerners, prominently Americans, to maintain market share in Japan by product dumping.2: in 18th and 19th century India various British offices at different times had policies of having their sepoys arrest textile workers and maim them by the forcible amputation of both thumbs, to preserve the market share of British textiles.

If only there was a conflict somewhere with a perieved superpower, maybe a nuclear country or something that would be relatively easy to win without even entering into a direct altercation. Oh, wait!America could've easily won the war in Ukraine by just ging away a bit more weapons, specifically long range missiles. It could even just tell European countries to give their long rhange missiles in exchange for a resupply for some plausible deniability.It could've been a bit more generous with intelligence.Unfortunately, America elected Trump. A person who doesn't believe in anything that doesn't directly concern him. If it doesn't benefit (or hurt) him personally it might as well not exist. Which make it easy to sway his foreign policy. Russia is actively trying to buy him and he thinks it's great. It's going to be a very fast decline of American influence as more and more countries around the world will see that it takes very little to buy an american president, allegedly the most powerful person in the world. And if any petty dictator can buy him, what worth is his power?

India is yet to harmonise widespread organisation.Relative gaps are smaller, but the persistance of gap is never more entrenched than ever.That is not a decline.  It is however a Great Game, not played with nations but with ideology and where the US and China are quite aligned.  That game is less visible until it is seen.

I've always said that if India got a unified national language they would become a nearly instant world power.Imagine an India where English was mandated in every public school - and every child, regardless of caste (which officially doesn't exist...), attended school. English, because it's more internationally useful than Hindi, and doesn't have the same ethnological competition (Hindi vs Bengali vs Tamil vs <297 others>).Then imagine that, now that all of India can actually speak to each other, they get their shit together, and build a truly functional national highway system. Top it off with a safe railway system, complete with modern trains. Enough trains that you don't have to ride on top. (OK, I'm starting to dream big.)One generation later India is a dominant world power. Pakistan is completely fucked, sure, because Delhi will never get over their petty sibling hatred. But India can start power-brokering between all other nations.

India is similar to the USSR in that it buckets disparate languages, religions and cultures into a single nation with inevitable separatist tendencies.

India's big problem is lack of natural resources, and lack of clear hierarchy to manage the limited resources (including choosing to screw some people for the greater good).  China had the same issue of enormous population relative to natural resources, but it had the clear hierarchy to be able to execute.

If you buy into liberal universalism, sure you don't agree with the policy.

A hateful voter will go down with the ship if this takes their enemies down too. What "merit"?Look around, look at the last US presidential elections, those politicians were elected "on their own merit". Hate, bigotry, populism, treason, corruption. That "merit".

The facts are there, easily accessible for people to read or see.  That they choose to ignore them is evidence of the problem with democracy.  Whatever mistakes were made by the party that lost, their candidate was not the one with a (comparatively) long track record of fraud, treason, and overall lack of decorum.

The knee-jerk reaction is protectionism but it is too late. The other parts of the world have caught up. And that is normal and sound. It rebalances the world. It is a new equilibrium. This is  just the natural way for most closed systems where there is a gradient.What is weird is that it is almost like watching a movie. Meaning that the current technological push into AI, energy and robotics is likely to spearhead us into a whole new kind of economics (post-money/post-work kind of). And probably requires to open the system (find new territory beyond the existing).
The point is that it will probably offset the current protectionist trend.Wondering how AI will affect governance...

I don't think China is against this change, but their agenda seems to be more focused on international trade and internal growth, rather than specific strategy against the US.The EU is definitely not benefiting from it in the short term. While some argue it needs this change in the long term, it is difficult to imagine that the EU wants it to happen so arbitrarily and quickly.Those holding any meaningful power in the US are either benefiting from this change, at least in the short term or personally, or oblivious to it, possibly also due to influence from the agents of change.It's an opportunity for other states to gain influence. And in particular for Russia to advance their geopolitical ambitions, since this is from their playbook.It would be in the interests of the United States to alter the course, and regain the influence already lost.

It was dragged into the first world war (despite strong public aversion) because J.P. Morgan Jr started lending money to Britain and France to buy American steel, thus setting in motion a cycle of investment and production protection that eventually required boots on the ground.It was dragged into the second world war by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor (and Germany's subsequent declaration of war, as it was obligated to do under its treaty with Japan).It protected Europe and SE Asia in the post-war years in order to contain communism, which it feared more than anything else. Once that threat subsided, there wasn't much reason for it to continue with its overseas footprint other than inertia and protecting important trade routes.Gulf Wars I was to protect oil prices (and because they already had the equipment for war), and Gulf Wars II was to be seen to be doing something about 9/11.Now that Trump is in power, America is performing its "great reset" (which was going to come eventually), where it becomes isolationist again, sticking to the Americas (reinvigorating the Monroe Doctrine), and leaving everyone else to their own devices.

On the other hand, the emergence of China, India, and to a lesser extent Russia (as a puppet of the Chinese) upon the world stage as independent actors, out of the shadows of Western domination, is another way in which the US is "losing control" but this is much less politically interesting in the sense that it was an inevitable and expected outcome. There is nothing the US has done, is doing or could do that would diminish non-Western ambition and agitation for power.

But I think this past year really changed the direction of the US and to a lesser extent the EU with respect to oil and gas versus renewables.As the US has realized at the institutional level that China has secured a very strong position on refining rare earth materials into batteries and other green technology it is doubling down on oil and gas as the energy choice for the foreseeable future, climate change be damned. Not that China ever really cared about the climate, they just, for good reasons, wanted an alternative energy production source because even if they seized Taiwan the US Navy can bring oil and gas imports to near 0. Pipelines from Russia are sitting ducks too, so not much reprieve there.US is putting $40 billion into Al Udeid and signing AI deals with the Middle East powers, and is close enough on a deal to legitimize Israel. Add Venezuela. You can see where this is going.The EU politically wants to switch to green tech but it's facing a problem which is doing so will result in effective deindustrialization since they would wind up buying most equipment from China including cars. The EU either did or is about to shelve the requirement that cars are EVs by 2035. I expect this to be fully repealed. While the EU likes to not mince words about US tariffs, they're ultimately heading in the same direction. China had a $1 trillion export surplus. If the US isn't buying their subsidized products who is? Brazil? Right now it's Europe, but do you think Germany will let its manufacturing sector go away? If so I have a ticket to sell you to the next AfD rally. The product dumping from China is going to be too much and in a judo move the west will be able to use China's manufacturing capacity against it. Nice factories you have there, too bad nobody buys anything you make (relatively speaking).So the EU is sitting between two oil and gas energy superpowers oh and the Middle East is just around the bend. Politically they'll still work on climate change initiatives but as push comes to shove, and with China overplaying its hand with export controls on rare earth materials and creating more panic in Brussels (never mind China's support for Russia invading Ukraine), the EU will generally maintain an oil and gas industrial direction, if I were to guess.I'm not pro gas/oil or anything like that. Drive an EV and love it. But that's my fun armchair take on what's going on here.

It's no better than shipping stuff in Africa and getting Zimbabwean money in return. Everyone knows that it can't be claimed for anything tangible, except from other countries who also owe fealty to the US and are forced to give this currency value. If everyone "asked" for something in return of those IOUs from the US itself, they'd get nothing of tangible value in return. These IOUs only have value insofar as the US is the world police.

It's also a useless discussion: whatever faith you may have in European progressive/socialist parties, they are not willing to give up the prosperity they have. They want fairness in addition to MORE than what the European people already have. If the demand is to give up more than 100% of European economic growth, you will not find them allies. Oh and there's the problem that they've got maybe 10-20% of the vote, and all other parties are not nearly as willing to help.So these utopian outcomes won't happen. What will?What these people never discuss is who will replace the US? Because the only real contender is the Chinese CCP. That will, to put it mildly, not be good. Frankly, the absurdly huge distinction between US hegemony and all others, whether you mean British hegemony, Ottoman hegemony or even going as far back as Roman or Greek hegemony is that every hegemon with the sole exception of the US conquered and murdered their empire together using slave armies (to their credit, some European powers, not all but some, at least refused to use slavery)You might say "but China has promised not to ...". Ok, let's go there. Let's say China doesn't actually go ahead and try to conquer 1/3 of the world. Or, at least somewhat realistically, let's say they take over Taiwan and the Phillippines and stop there. Or let's even say they add Indonesia and Malaysia maybe even Japan to that ... and then stop.Note: the CCP ideology is authoritarian and racist. We can perhaps argue if they'll go as far as the Nazi's did in the past century, but I don't understand how any rational person can argue it isn't at least going to go quite a ways in that direction. But if you don't live there ... who cares right? Also: if you live in these countries: get the fuck out of there (because the EU is definitely going to refuse to pay for the US securing the seas)Or you might say you actually believe the CCP, and let's say that you're right to do so. The result is that the US withdraws from the global oceans ... and that's the end of that. What will happen?The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was at the end of WW1, at the real ending of Colonialism (I mean that yes, colonies endured a bit more, but the economic domination of European powers ended there. Their last big hurrah. At that point European Colonial powers had enjoyed a large surplus but right there and then, it was gone, and that's the point where the decline became totally inevitable, and exactly what happened became a certainty: a very large, protracted, slow economic decline. We might also mention what people chose to do in response to this happening: WW2)This is not theory. This is history. This is what actually happened. Any rational person should at least consider it might happen again.But let's discuss what will happen to us. Because that's what matters, right?First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. As a result international trade will largely collapse.Maybe EU-US trade will survive, and maybe even US-China trade. But EU-Africa? EU-China? It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Or put it this way. If you erased Serbia from the map, the Serbia-Kosovo conflict would continue. If you erased Kosovo from the map, the conflict would stop). Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. India-Pakistan. China vs essentially everyone. And so on and so forth.The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls "justice". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. We need that influence, because other forces are looking to destroy the rights we currently enjoy. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in "the West".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps they simply think the US will win WW3 and the world will go back to 1950. Perhaps their theory is that the best idea for the US is for WW3 to start before this economic crisis really hits the US, that the only thing they need to do is to withdraw the US army, weapons and diplomacy currently standing between a great many adversaries.Hell, that may be exactly what happens. But this is both giving these people way too much credit AND ignores that of course WW3 will make the world suck pretty fucking bad for a long time.

So these utopian outcomes won't happen. What will?What these people never discuss is who will replace the US? Because the only real contender is the Chinese CCP. That will, to put it mildly, not be good. Frankly, the absurdly huge distinction between US hegemony and all others, whether you mean British hegemony, Ottoman hegemony or even going as far back as Roman or Greek hegemony is that every hegemon with the sole exception of the US conquered and murdered their empire together using slave armies (to their credit, some European powers, not all but some, at least refused to use slavery)You might say "but China has promised not to ...". Ok, let's go there. Let's say China doesn't actually go ahead and try to conquer 1/3 of the world. Or, at least somewhat realistically, let's say they take over Taiwan and the Phillippines and stop there. Or let's even say they add Indonesia and Malaysia maybe even Japan to that ... and then stop.Note: the CCP ideology is authoritarian and racist. We can perhaps argue if they'll go as far as the Nazi's did in the past century, but I don't understand how any rational person can argue it isn't at least going to go quite a ways in that direction. But if you don't live there ... who cares right? Also: if you live in these countries: get the fuck out of there (because the EU is definitely going to refuse to pay for the US securing the seas)Or you might say you actually believe the CCP, and let's say that you're right to do so. The result is that the US withdraws from the global oceans ... and that's the end of that. What will happen?The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was at the end of WW1, at the real ending of Colonialism (I mean that yes, colonies endured a bit more, but the economic domination of European powers ended there. Their last big hurrah. At that point European Colonial powers had enjoyed a large surplus but right there and then, it was gone, and that's the point where the decline became totally inevitable, and exactly what happened became a certainty: a very large, protracted, slow economic decline. We might also mention what people chose to do in response to this happening: WW2)This is not theory. This is history. This is what actually happened. Any rational person should at least consider it might happen again.But let's discuss what will happen to us. Because that's what matters, right?First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. As a result international trade will largely collapse.Maybe EU-US trade will survive, and maybe even US-China trade. But EU-Africa? EU-China? It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Or put it this way. If you erased Serbia from the map, the Serbia-Kosovo conflict would continue. If you erased Kosovo from the map, the conflict would stop). Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. India-Pakistan. China vs essentially everyone. And so on and so forth.The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls "justice". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. We need that influence, because other forces are looking to destroy the rights we currently enjoy. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in "the West".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps they simply think the US will win WW3 and the world will go back to 1950. Perhaps their theory is that the best idea for the US is for WW3 to start before this economic crisis really hits the US, that the only thing they need to do is to withdraw the US army, weapons and diplomacy currently standing between a great many adversaries.Hell, that may be exactly what happens.

But this is both giving these people way too much credit AND ignores that of course WW3 will make the world suck pretty fucking bad for a long time.

First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. As a result international trade will largely collapse.Maybe EU-US trade will survive, and maybe even US-China trade. But EU-Africa? EU-China? It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Or put it this way. If you erased Serbia from the map, the Serbia-Kosovo conflict would continue. If you erased Kosovo from the map, the conflict would stop). Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. India-Pakistan. China vs essentially everyone. And so on and so forth.The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls "justice". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. We need that influence, because other forces are looking to destroy the rights we currently enjoy. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in "the West".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps they simply think the US will win WW3 and the world will go back to 1950.

The US are by no means innocent of terrorism and invasion of other countries, but at least with countries commonly counted as "the west", the US was a friendly nation. If we have the likes of terrorist states like Russia taking over, then we got some very dark times ahead of us.Even worse, if the right wing and right extreme talking points and policies in the US don't stop, we might face the (still) strongest military on the planet becoming the arm of a fascist state. It might even get worse than the WW2, since the US military is probably more superior compared to almost any other nation on the planet, than Nazi Germany's military was, and already has presence in basically all parts of the world, plus the logistics.So lets hope that the current period of idiocy ends soon, and we can get back to peaceful international relations, with a sane US leadership, instead of one, that seemingly seeks to tear down as many bridges as possible. However, we are only in year one (!) of the current US government, so we will probably have to hold out breath a little longer, and Europe will have to rely on itself.

It is easy to know what is implied. Issue is emotional - people do not want to admit that yes, these are fascists.

Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices. The appeal is obvious: If you've ever worn cashmere, you know it's soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that's hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch.

Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That's not a lot of supply for a growing market.

“The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you're seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they're being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it's creating unsustainable herding practices.”

Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors, including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing.

To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine-tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry.

At its core, Everbloom's process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: They're all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom's process.

The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.”

To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it.

The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement. 

“All the components that we're using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said.

Plus, it should be cheaper. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don't believe in a ‘sustainable premium'” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That's what we're aiming for.”

CEOs at the world's biggest companies are preparing to dump even more money into AI next year, despite mounting evidence that their existing investments aren't actually paying off.

The Wall Street Journal reported today that 68% of chief executives plan to increase AI spending in 2026, citing an annual survey of more than 350 public-company CEOs conducted by advisory firm Teneo. Bewilderingly, those same executives admitted that fewer than half of their current AI projects have generated returns that exceeded their initial costs. The survey focused on CEOs at public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue and was conducted this fall.

The survey's findings arrive as fears of an AI bubble continue to rise. AI investments now account for roughly 40% of U.S. GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for about 80% of gains in the American stock market. Despite the U.S. economy becoming more dependent on AI, there is surprisingly little to show for it as of now, even in small ways at non-AI corporations.

Wall Street analysts have increasingly noted the circular nature of major AI investments. For example, Nvidia announced this year that it is investing $100 million in OpenAI, which then turns around and buys Nvidia chips for data centers it has planned with Oracle. Making things worse, those data centers have been slow to materialize. Reports that Oracle is delaying some of its data center projects have only heightened Wall Street's anxiety, as they push any tangible payoffs further into the future. Meanwhile, AI companies continue to promise that more advanced models will unlock significant productivity gains, spark innovation, and maybe even help cure diseases.

Non-AI companies have already started putting the tech to the test, rolling out AI tools across various departments including customer service, IT, marketing, and human resources. But there's still little evidence that even in those spaces AI tools are transforming operations or even meaningfully improving bottom lines.

Today's survey echoes a report released by MIT in August. Despite the major push to adopt AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs have produced real revenue gains, the report found. The MIT analysis drew from  150 executive interviews, a survey of 350 employees, and a review of 300 public AI deployments.

“Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable [profit and loss] impact,” the report said. Meaning that “95 per cent of organizations are getting zero return.”

The findings briefly rattled investors and sent AI stocks sliding at the time.

And yet, CEOs still appear convinced that AI will eventually justify the spending spree. According to Teneo's survey, 84% of leaders at companies with more than $10 billion in annual revenue believe it will take longer than six months for AI investments to start paying off.

The rise of GPS vulnerability is putting more resilient, atom-based navigational tools on the map.

In late September, a Spanish military plane carrying the country's defense minister to a base in Lithuania was reportedly the subject of a kind of attack—not by a rocket or anti-aircraft rounds, but by radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system. 

The flight landed safely, but it was one of thousands that have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of GPS interference since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it's somewhere else. 

US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data. 

But another approach that's emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment. 

Tracking changes

Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it's difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK's Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation & Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour. 

“If you're guiding a missile that flies for one minute, that might be good enough,” he says. “If you're in an airliner, that's definitely not good enough.” 

A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time.

Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle's bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it's traveled. Infleqtion's sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they're measured with a detector. If the vehicle has turned or accelerated while the atoms are in motion, the two paths will be slightly out of phase in a way the detector can interpret. 

Last year the company trialed these inertial sensors on a customized plane flying at a British military testing site. In October of this year, Infleqtion ran its first real-world test of a new generation of inertial sensors that use a steady stream of atoms instead of pulses, allowing for continuous navigation and avoiding long dead times.

Infleqtion also has an atomic clock, called Tiqker, that can help determine how far a vehicle has traveled. It is a kind of optical clock that uses infrared lasers tuned to a specific frequency to excite electrons in rubidium, which then release photons at a consistent, known rate. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. It has passed tests on flights in the UK, on US Army ground vehicles in New Mexico, and, in late October, on a drone submarine. 

“Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Eventually the company hopes to make the unit smaller and more rugged by switching to lasers generated by microchips. 

Magnetic fields

Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. These fields vary slightly depending on the location, and the variations, or anomalies, are recorded in various maps. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle. 

Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. Her team uses a material called nitrogen-vacancy diamond. In NV diamonds, one carbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom, and one neighboring carbon atom is removed entirely. The quantum state of the electrons at the NV defect is very sensitive to magnetic fields. Carefully stimulating the electrons and watching the light they emit offers a way to precisely measure the strength of the field at the diamond's location, making it possible to infer where it's situated on the globe. 

Kealy says these quantum magnetometers have a few big advantages over traditional ones, including the fact that they measure the direction of the Earth's magnetic field in addition to its strength. That additional information could make it easier to determine location. 

The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. “This is a major step forward.” 

Delicate systems

Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors' functioning. Even the vehicles themselves present problems for magnetometers, especially “the fact that the airplane is made of metal, with all this wiring,” says Michael Biercuk, the CEO of Q-CTRL. “Usually there's 100 to 1,000 times more noise than signal.” 

After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane's location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring. 

In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its "software-ruggedized" mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. The company is also testing the technology with commercial partners, including the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin and Airbus, an aerospace manufacturer. 

“Northrop Grumman is working with Q-CTRL to develop a magnetic navigation system that can withstand the physical demands of the real world,” says Michael S. Larsen, a quantum systems architect at the company. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.”

Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year. 

Sensor fusion

Even as quantum navigation emerges as a legitimate alternative to satellite-based navigation, the satellites themselves are improving. Modern GPS III satellites include new civilian signals called L1C and L5, which should be more accurate and harder to jam and spoof than current signals. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade. 

US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. The latter will start to become available when the GPS IIIF generation of satellites is in orbit, with the first scheduled to go up in 2027. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson says new GPS satellites with M-code are eight times as powerful as previous ones, while the GPS IIIF model will be 60 times as strong.

Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX's internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,” says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. “They can get a good position in just a few minutes. So that is a huge leap.”

Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says. 

The navigation resources that a vehicle draws on will change according to its environment—whether it's an airliner, a submarine, or an autonomous car in an urban canyon. But quantum navigation will be one important resource. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it's stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.”

Don't take your eyes off the road to read new research from the University of Washington.

In partnership with Toyota Research Institute, UW researchers are exploring how modern touch screens in cars affect driving now that dashboard knobs and buttons are increasingly a thing of the past. The results could help auto manufacturers design safer, more responsive screens and in-car interfaces.

The team's study, which was presented this fall at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in Busan, Korea, adds to what we already know about the dangers of distracted driving when it comes to phone use.

Participants driving a vehicle simulator and interacting with a touch screen (see video above) were given memory tests that mimic the mental effort demanded by traffic conditions and other distractions, the UW reported. Sensors tracked their gaze, finger movements, pupil diameter and electrodermal activity. 

While driving, participants had to touch specific targets on a 12-inch touch screen, similar to how they would interact with apps and widgets. They did this while completing three levels of an “N-back task,” a memory test in which the participants hear a series of numbers, 2.5 seconds apart, and have to repeat specific digits. 

Researchers found that when people try to multitask behind the wheel, their driving and their ability to use a touch screen both suffer. The simulator car drifted in its lane, and speed and accuracy using the screen declined while driving.

“Touch screens are widespread today in automobile dashboards, so it is vital to understand how interacting with touch screens affects drivers and driving,” said co-senior author Jacob O. Wobbrock, a UW professor in the Information School. “Our research is some of the first that scientifically examines this issue, suggesting ways for making these interfaces safer and more effective.”

Popular Mechanics wrote about the mental bandwidth and finger precision that many modern infotainment screens require in cars.

Based on the UW/Toyota findings, researchers suggest future in-car touch screen systems might use simple sensors in the car — eye tracking, or touch sensors on the steering wheel — to monitor drivers' attention and cognitive load. Based on these readings, the car's system might adjust the touch screen's interface to make important controls more prominent and safer to access.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Igor Mezine, Guru Valicherla, Chris Bode, and Sid Bhoopathy.

The evaluation of reactive metabolite (RM) production is an important aspect of the modern drug development process.

Most common for producing and trapping RM in vitro are liver microsomes and/or S9 fractions.

The detection of trapped RM (TRM), which is frequently present at low levels, is facilitated in large part by using a mixture of glutathione (GSH) and stable isotope labeled (SIL)-GSH. These labels enable the automatic filtering of peaks of interest by searching for the relevant monoisotopic pattern (MIP).

Because such subcellular systems lack a comprehensive set of enzymatic machinery involved in drug metabolism, hepatocytes are frequently used instead of or in conjunction with subcellular fractions to research drug metabolism.

However, detecting low-level TRM in hepatocytes is far more difficult than in subcellular models.

To aid in the detection of TRM, the researchers studied the SILAC method employing SIL-glycine (SIL-Gly). The researchers plated human, rat, and dog hepatocytes in vendor-supplied seeding media supplemented with SIL-Gly (1 mM).

The plated hepatocytes (PH) were then treated with the model chemical, clozapine (CLZ, 30 mM) for 24 hours.

The medium was withdrawn, and the attached cells were extracted with 50 % MeCN. After centrifugation, the cell extract supernatants and medium were evaluated using liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRAMS) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos.

The collected data was then processed with Compound Discoverer (CD) and Xcalibur software.

Assessment of the data revealed the presence of numerous known CLZ GSH conjugates in medium alone, as well as the incorporation of SIL-Gly in GSH.

Interestingly, MIP ratios, defined as the proportion of A0 (SIL-GSH)/A0 (GSH), were both conjugate-specific and species-dependent, ranging from 20 % to 90 %. These results show a complicated interplay between the kinetics of model compound metabolism, SIL-Gly absorption, GSH production, and efflux.

As a result, the researchers employed CLZ as a positive control molecule to develop MIP search acceptability criteria in CD software. The new SILAC technique can be combined with CYP induction investigations to undertake further metabolite profiling and facilitate TRM detection.

Plated human and animal CYP induction-certified hepatocytes were purchased from XenoTech. CLZ and glycine-(13C2, 15N) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Thermo Fisher supplied HPLC-grade solvents.

Thermo Fisher's Accucore C18 column (1.5 µm, 150 x 2.1 mm) was used for UPLC separation using a MeCN gradient in water (constant at 0.1 % formic acid).

Figures 1 and 2 show extracted ion chromatograms (XIC) with peaks of CLZ and GSH conjugates G1-G6 in human and rat incubation samples, respectively.

Figures 3 and 4 compare observed HRAMS spectra to theoretical monoisotopic patterns of GSH and SIL-GSH conjugates G2 (human) and G3 (rat), respectively.

MIP values in human and rat incubation samples ranged consistently from 20 to 45 %. Interestingly, dogs have significantly higher MIP values, particularly in the case of G3, where MIP exceeded 100 % (Figure 5).

Drug binding in primary hepatocytes is an important test for in vitro ADME research. To effectively detect drug binding in hepatocytes, it is necessary to deactivate their metabolic activity.

This has been accomplished traditionally by using heat inactivation, enzyme inhibitors, or freeze-thaw cycles. This study used these three ways to assess the unbound percentage of ten commercial drugs in hepatocytes and determined which method was most suited for routine testing.

By comparing the percentage unbound (%) and the three approaches, it was discovered that, for the majority of substances, the three methods produced comparable findings.

For the chemical carvedilol, however, the freeze-thaw approach increased the stability from 26.43 % to 73.93 % when compared to the Enzyme Inhibitor method, demonstrating that the freeze-thaw method has a higher enzyme inactivity ability.

For the majority of substances, the three approaches produced comparable results, just as they did for rats. However, for the chemical carvedilol, the freeze-thaw approach increased its recovery from 54.84 % to 82.16 % when compared to the Enzyme Inhibitor method, demonstrating that the freeze-thaw method has a better enzyme inactivation ability.

For most substances, the Enzyme Inhibitor and Freeze-Thaw techniques produced similar binding results.

For carvedilol, the FreezeThaw approach significantly improved metabolic stability (26.43 % vs. 73.93 % after 4 hours), and microscopy revealed higher membrane rupture, indicating more efficient inactivation.

Overall, the Freeze-Thaw method provides practical benefits such as better inactivation for some medicines, streamlined processes, and clear morphological evidence, making it a more convenient and trustworthy option for routine in vitro ADME research.

A research team of Prof. Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) has discovered that the bacterium Ewingella americana, isolated from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs (Dryophytes japonicus), possesses remarkably potent anticancer activity. This groundbreaking research has been published in the international journal Gut Microbes.

While the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has attracted considerable attention in recent years, most approaches have focused on indirect methods such as microbiome modulation or fecal microbiota transplantation. In contrast, this study takes a completely different approach: isolating, culturing, and directly administering individual bacterial strains intravenously to attack tumors - representing an innovative therapeutic strategy.

The research team isolated a total of 45 bacterial strains from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs, Japanese fire belly newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster), and Japanese grass lizards (Takydromus tachydromoides). Through systematic screening, nine strains demonstrated antitumor effects, with E. americana exhibiting the most exceptional therapeutic efficacy.

In a mouse colorectal cancer model, a single intravenous administration of E. americana achieved complete tumor elimination with a 100% complete response (CR) rate. This dramatically surpasses the therapeutic efficacy of current standard treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 antibody) and liposomal doxorubicin (chemotherapy agent).

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Jing Lai, Gang Yang, Yushi Cao, Xuehua Zhang, Yi Li, Bojia Liu, Youpeng Yang, Ning Yang and Mandy Xu.

Sulfonation (also known as sulfurylation) is a significant phase II conjugation reaction that occurs throughout the metabolism of both xenobiotics and endogenous substances.

It is catalyzed by sulfotransferases (SULT). In humans, the eighteen SULT genes are divided into five gene families.

Recognizing the metabolic phenotyping and inhibition of sulfotransferases is essential for analyzing drug-drug interactions during drug discovery and development.

Conventional probe substrates, such as 4-nitrophenol and dopamine, frequently require ion-pairing reagents and can damage instruments, rendering them unsuitable for high-throughput LC-MS/MS analysis.

To address these constraints, this study utilized new probe substrates, developing a panel of in vitro phenotyping and inhibition tests to characterize SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1 via recombinant enzymes and optimized LC-MS/MS methodologies.

The researchers in this study designed and validated LC-MS/MS-based phenotyping assays for SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1. These assays allow for the assessment of compound substrate potential towards various SULT enzymes.

To improve the accuracy and throughput of SULT inhibition tests, probe substrates were selected and adjusted for each enzyme.

The relevant LCMS/MS procedures were also optimized. Key parameters such as probe substrate Km and IC50 values, as well as appropriate protein concentrations for recombinant SULT enzymes, were identified.

The validated in vitro SULT phenotyping and inhibition assays are now ready for use in evaluating compounds of interest during drug discovery and development.

Every movement you make and every memory you form depends on precise communication between neurons. When that communication is disrupted, the brain must rapidly rebalance its internal signaling to keep circuits functioning properly. New research from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences shows that neurons can stabilize their signaling using a fast, physical mechanism - not the electrical activity scientists long assumed was required.

The discovery, supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals a system that doesn't depend on the flow of charged particles to maintain signaling when part of a synapse - the junction between neurons - suddenly stops working.

Maintaining this balance between neurons is essential for muscle control, learning and overall brain health. Failure to maintain this "homeostasis" has been linked to neurological conditions such as epilepsy and autism.

USC Dornsife researchers led by Dion Dickman, professor of biological sciences, set out to understand how neurons compensate when communication between them falters. Specifically, they wanted to know how the receiving side of a synapse detects a sudden loss of function and signals the sending neuron to increase its output to restore homeostasis.

Working with fruit flies, a standard model for studying the nervous system, the team blocked glutamate receptors on the receiving side of the synapse with a chemical known to shut them down, then used electrical recordings and high-resolution microscopy to observe how the synapse responded. To identify the molecules responsible for triggering the response, the researchers used CRISPR gene-editing tools to remove specific structural proteins one by one and observe what changed in the cells.

This process of elimination revealed that the key trigger for the rapid adjustment is not the loss of electrical activity but the physical reorganization of a specific type of receptor. When these receptors were blocked, they rearranged themselves within the synapse, which set off a signaling process that instructed the sending neuron to release more neurotransmitter, helping maintain steady communication.

A scaffold protein called DLG proved essential for this response. When DLG was removed using CRISPR, the rapid compensation failed.

The researchers also showed that this fast signaling process continues even when all electrical synapse activity is silenced, indicating that the system relies on structural cues rather than electrical signals.

Understanding how synapses quickly adapt could help guide future research into treatments that strengthen neural resilience and ward off neurological diseases.

For much of the past century, Alzheimer's disease has been one of medicine's most daunting frontiers – biologically complex, devastating in impact, and difficult to diagnose early. Conventional diagnostic methods like positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis offer precision but remain invasive, costly, and logistically challenging, especially in low- and middle-income regions.

That is now changing. Ultra-sensitive, blood-based biomarkers are transforming how clinicians and researchers detect, monitor, and study Alzheimer's. These advances are reshaping diagnostics and collaboration between the public and private sectors to speed up drug development and scale innovation.

Blood-based biomarkers – like p-tau217, p-tau181, Aβ42/40 ratios, NfL, and GFAP – enable Alzheimer's pathology measurement with a simple blood draw. The availability of clinically validated blood tests are changing how clinicians diagnose and treat Alzheimer's disease and how clinical trials are designed. Furthermore, researchers are evaluating blood tests that may identify disease progression years before symptoms, potentially allowing health systems to extend early detection from tertiary care to primary and community settings.

Globally, this could help expand access for disease detection and management. Many countries face rapid ageing, increased rates of dementia, and limited access to imaging. Blood tests offer a scalable, cost-efficient way to expand early detection and better allocate specialist resources. Tests that combine multiple biomarkers in a single blood draw, such as Quanterix's LucentAD Complete - which measures five AD biomarkers simultaneously – further democratize the process. Over time, this could help reduce diagnostic disparities linked to income and geography.

These same biomarkers are changing drug development. In clinical research, they help reduce imaging needs, monitor responses to therapy, and enable adaptive trials.

This approach accelerates discovery and approval. Researchers can now track molecular changes indicating true disease modification, not just late-stage cognitive outcomes. As combination therapies and precision neurology emerge, these insights will be essential for selecting patients and optimizing trial success.

Government-funded initiatives have long built the foundation for Alzheimer's research – such as NIH cohort studies in the U.S. and efforts in Japan, Korea, China, and Singapore. These projects built the datasets and insights essential to today's biomarker development.

Now, as government research budgets shrink and approval processes shift, the private sector is taking a larger role in translational science. Pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, as well as laboratories, increasingly partner to validate assays, set reference standards, and advance the clinical readiness of tests.

This shift creates a new balance: the public sector generates knowledge and long-term data, while industry supplies speed, capital, and technical infrastructure to turn that knowledge into patient-ready solutions. When coordinated, these strengths can move research to patient care more quickly than ever.

To fulfill their promise, blood-based biomarkers must remain accessible and sustainable in healthcare systems. Reimbursement and pricing are persistent global challenges. In 2024, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed reimbursement levels for AD biomarkers that many labs called unsustainable, highlighting a bigger issue: the economic model for next-generation diagnostics still lags behind their clinical value.

Policymakers, payers, and industry must align on frameworks that acknowledge the cost savings of earlier diagnosis and optimized treatment. Demonstrating that biomarker results alter decisions and outcomes will be key to securing coverage. Harmonized standards, quality controls, and international collaboration will ensure tests work reliably across regions and populations.

The story of blood-based biomarkers is a convergence of biology, technology, and shared commitment. Public research lays the foundation; private enterprise scales innovation. Both sectors transform discovery into diagnostic products, leading to better patient outcomes.

In Alzheimer's and beyond, biomarkers let us detect disease earlier and act sooner. Sustaining progress requires ongoing collaboration across borders, sectors, and disciplines. With thoughtful investment and equitable access, blood-based diagnostics can move from promise to practice and redefine brain health.

Canada should rethink its reduced pledge to the Global Fund to protect the health of people in Canada as well as around the globe, argue authors in an editorial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.252036.

In November, Canada reduced its pledge by 16% to the Global Fund, which fights AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria and strengthens pandemic preparedness. Two related commentaries in the same issue describe increases in tuberculosis in Canada and the backsliding in addressing HIV/AIDS around the world and potential solutions.

"Canada's reduced pledge to the Global Fund reflects shortsighted political thinking that fails to appreciate the complexity of global health threats and long-term health consequences," write Drs. Kirsten Patrick, editor-in-chief, CMAJ, and deputy editor Helena Swinkels. "If the anticipated shortfall in pledges to the Fund is not offset, Canada should anticipate reduced success in domestic TB and HIV control in forthcoming years, rather than the progress toward elimination that is hoped for now."

Reduced funding will also open the door to other infectious disease threats.

"Unfortunately, HIV and TB control will not be the only casualties of the current global funding shortsightedness," write the authors. "In public and global health, managing problems in silos may seem appealing, but health threats do not fit into neat containers; they affect systems. As the COVID-19 pandemic revealed plainly, surges in rates of 1 infectious disease can ultimately affect health systems' ability to manage others. A decrease in resources for disease management adds complexity to this problem."

The CMAJ editors urge Canada's government to invest in improving social determinants of health that underly TB and HIV infection, and to implement disease-specific suggestions outlined in the related commentaries published in CMAJ, such as creating a national body to address TB and providing better access to data and medications for both diseases.

Chelsea injuries up 44% on previous year, Howden finds

It calculates injury cost in top leagues over past five years

Chelsea experienced a 44% increase in injuries between June and October compared with the previous season, a report released on Tuesday has found. This year's period covers their participation in the Club World Cup and its aftermath.

The figure, which goes some way towards vindicating Enzo Maresca's rotation and his complaints about injuries, is contained in a report published by the insurance company Howden, which puts the cost of injuries to clubs in Europe's top five leagues over the past five years at almost £3bn.

Maresca cited the impact of the Club World Cup in September when Chelsea were missing five defenders through injury and lost three successive games in the Champions League and Premier League. He made five changes last week for the Champions League defeat at Atalanta, a setback followed by cryptic comments on Saturday after a Premier League win against Everton that he had endured his “worst 48 hours” at the club owing to a lack of support from unspecified people.

The report found Chelsea had 23 injuries between 1 June and 31 October, including seven during the Club World Cup in the US, the same number as Paris Saint-Germain, whom they beat in the final.

Howden calculated the financial loss to Chelsea of players missing through injury as £17m up to October, almost a quarter of their £80m Club World Cup prize money, and more than a third of their £45m loss last season. It calculates financial loss according to wages paid to injured players.

Manchester City were found to have had the second-most injuries among Club World Cup teams, at 22, although they did not sustain any during the tournament, perhaps because they were knocked out in the last 16. PSG were found to have had 19 injuries, including seven during the Club World Cup.

Howden's findings echo concerns expressed by the global players' union Fifpro regarding workload. A Fifpro report in October showed Chelsea's players were given 20 days off after the Club World Cup and that PSG rested their players for 22 days.

“The Howden report demonstrates the impact of pushing players to their limits through a year-round schedule of football,” the Professional Footballers' Association chief executive and Fifpro board member, Maheta Molango, said.

“Serious injuries are always going to happen if players are not given proper breaks for rest and recovery. Players are exposed to an extreme schedule at a younger and younger age. That will have an impact on their careers and their wellbeing. The current calendar makes no sense for players, fans or clubs.”

Howden has produced the Men's European Football Injury Index for the past five years, with the report released on Tuesday calculating there have been 22,596 injuries in Europe's top five men's leagues over that period, costing clubs a combined £2.97bn. Premier League clubs account for 24% of these injuries, with more than £1bn paid out in salaries to injured players.

Manchester United incurred the highest injury costs of Premier League clubs at £154.5m over five years, with Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City above average.

The report also highlights that young players are most susceptible to injury. Premier League forwards under the age of 21 sustained an injury every 120 minutes of competitive domestic football over the past five years.

Japanese international defender Takehiro Tomiyasu has officially joined Dutch club Ajax on a short-term contract, seeking to rebuild his career after a challenging period with injuries at Arsenal. The 27-year-old was a free agent after mutually agreeing to terminate his deal with the Gunners in July of this year. 

Tomiyasu's time in London was significantly impacted by recurring fitness issues, culminating in knee surgery in February that ruled him out for most of the 2024-2025 season. He managed 84 appearances for the Gunners in total following his 2021 transfer from Bologna. Tomiyasu has signed a six-month "prove-it" deal with Ajax, running until June next year, with reports suggesting his earnings will be linked to the number of appearances he makes. This arrangement minimises risk for the Dutch giants while offering the player a clear path to consistent playing time once fit. 

On leaving the Gunners, he took to Instagram to say: "After four unforgettable years, the time has come for me to say goodbye to this incredible club. Obviously, I have got many things to say, but the thing that I want to tell you guys the most is just thank you for the love you guys gave me.  

"ARIGATO and all the best, Tomi."

Now back in training, the versatile defender, capable of playing at right-back or centre-back, aims to regain match sharpness and put himself back in contention for the Japan national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Ajax Director of Football Marijn Beuker has praised the signing, noting Tomiyasu's experience and ability to add balance to the team's relatively young squad. The move is seen as a strategic opportunity for both the player - with the tournament in the USA, Canada and Mexico on the horizon - and the club.

Beuker said: "Takehiro has proven himself to be an excellent defender with extensive experience in several top leagues. He is an intelligent, two-footed defender. Together with the scouting department and the coaching staff, we have reviewed a lot of footage of him in recent weeks, and everyone is enthusiastic. His injury history was also an important consideration. From the outset, he has worked hard on his recovery, the medical staff have assessed him thoroughly, and once his work permit is finalised, he can immediately join group training. 

"Although he still needs to regain match sharpness, we believe that, given his experience, he will pick this up almost straight away. Contractually, we have also found a good way to enter into a collaboration together. All in all, we expect that with Takehiro we have brought in a player who can bring more balance to our relatively young, but very talented squad in the short term."

Tomiyasu arrives at Ajax with the club in dire straits as, despite a recent uptick in results, the club has endured a woeful start to the season, marked by managerial upheaval and disappointing results in Europe. In the Eredivisie, Ajax are currently in third place, but sit a distant 14 points behind league leaders PSV Eindhoven. Results in the Champions League have been even worse with the Amsterdam side sitting 34th in the 36-team league phase, having lost five of their six games so far, though they recently secured a 4-2 victory over Qarabag. 

Off the pitch, the club sacked head coach Johnny Heitinga in November 2025, appointing Fred Grim as caretaker manager. Fan unrest has also been a problem, leading to a match abandonment due to fireworks being let off before the match with Groningen. After the game was called off, a club statement said: "Ajax considers what happened in the stadium this evening to be utterly outrageous. We offer our apologies to everyone who has been affected in any way. The safety of spectators and players has been put at risk. That is unacceptable. We emphatically distance ourselves from this misconduct. Fireworks do not belong in the stadium."

Chelsea experienced a significant 44 per cent surge in injuries following their participation in this year's expanded Club World Cup, new findings revealed on Tuesday.

However, the latest edition of the Men's European Football Injury Index suggests the newly enlarged tournament has, so far, had a "minimal impact" on overall injury rates across European football.

The decision by Fifa in 2023 to expand its flagship club event from seven to 32 teams faced considerable opposition, with players' unions voicing concerns over potential physical and mental burnout due to an ever-growing match schedule.

Despite these warnings, Fifa proceeded, staging the tournament in the United States during June and July.

Chelsea emerged victorious in the inaugural competition, receiving the trophy from U.S. President Donald Trump at MetLife Stadium and securing approximately $125 million in prize money.

Yet, according to the Index, between June and October, Chelsea recorded 23 injuries – more than any of the nine participating clubs from Europe's top leagues.

This figure, which included star player Cole Palmer, represents a 44 per cent increase compared to the same period last year.

While Chelsea, who played 64 games across the 2024-25 season, saw their injury count rise, the Index, compiled by global insurance firm Howden, noted an overall decrease in injuries among the top European clubs.

"In principle you would expect this increased workload to lead to an increase in the number of injuries sustained, as a possible rise in overall injury severity," the Index report stated, but concluded: "The data would suggest a minimal impact on overall injury figures."

The nine teams from Europe's top leagues – England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France – recorded 146 injuries from June to October, a reduction from 174 in the previous year.

Specifically, the August-October period saw 121 injuries, marking the lowest figure for that three-month span in the Index's six-year history.

Manchester City, however, sustained 22 injuries since the tournament, the highest among the nine teams.

Despite these figures, the report's authors acknowledge it is too early to fully assess the Club World Cup's impact, as the findings only extend to October.

James Burrows, Head of Sport at Howden, commented: "We would expect to see the impact to spike in that sort of November to February period. What we've seen previously is that's where the impact is seen from summer tournaments."

Red Bull New York has completed the signing of American winger Cade Cowell from Mexican side Chivas de Guadalajara on a one-year loan with an option to buy, a source tells amNewYork. 
It is the first significant attacking signing under new head of sport, Julian de Guzman, and comes shortly after officially announcing the hiring of US soccer legend Michael Bradley as head coach. 
Cowell, 22, is coming off a difficult 2025 campaign with Chivas, where playing time grew scarce, and production dried up with it. He recorded just a single goal and assist in 20 appearances across all competitions after recording 10 in 43 matches over the previous two seasons, which featured Liga MX Player of the Month honors in July of 2024.

He rose to prominence with the San Jose Earthquakes, scoring 12 goals and providing 12 assists in 114 matches for the MLS side before being purchased for $4 million by Chivas. All the while, he had broken into the United States men's national team, making 11 appearances for the Stars and Stripes. The last one, however, came in November of 2024, early in Mauricio Pochettino's tenure as US head coach.

Cowell now joins a Red Bulls squad that is currently in transition, but claims to have a clear vision under de Guzman and Bradley. While the new head of sport has promised a more entertaining, attacking brand of soccer, Bradley will likely institute a 4-3-3 formation that will highlight the club's attacking wealth — whenever that picture clarifies. 
Former Bayern Munich star Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting is the anchor up front, while captain and Swedish international Emil Forsberg pulls the strings from the midfield. But the Red Bulls have traded away Scottish international Lewis Morgan to San Diego FC, who, when healthy, was one of the squad's most valuable players. Peter Stroud was also dealt to Minnesota United. AmNewYork had learned of both transactions last week.
Cowell is expected to play a significant role in Bradley's plans on the wing, working alongside Choupo-Moting, and he is likely to be the first domino to fall in addressing de Guzman and Bradley's vision. 

Should the partnership thrive, there is no reason why Cowell could not at least force his way back into the national team conversation, too. The only thing working against him is time, as the 2026 FIFA World Cup on American soil is just six months away.

Addressing its depth issue within its back line, New York has also signed right back Justin Che from Brondby of the Danish first division on a three-year contract with an option for the 2029 season.







The 22-year-old was once a can't-miss prospect of the US youth national team while with FC Dallas' academy, but injuries have slowed his development. Following a loan spell with German powerhouse Bayern Munich's academy, he made 15 MLS appearances with Dallas before moving to the second team of Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. After signing with Brondby three seasons ago, he proceeded to bounce around Europe on a pair of loans.
Still a young, moldable prospect, he is known for his ability to play out of the back, which jives with New York's new style. He will likely compete for the significant minutes at right back with veteran Dylan Nealis. 
“Justin is an intelligent defender that has great speed and will help add to our backline this upcoming season,” Bradley said. “He has played a lot of minutes all across Europe and will be another great person to add to our roster to help our club accomplish its goals.”

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is coming to Atlanta, and with it tens of thousands of soccer fans ready to spend money.

The city's hospitality industry is gearing up as Atlanta becomes host for eight matches, five during the group stage and three later in the tournament.

Demand for short-term rentals has already skyrocketed as prospective spectators take to travel sites and plan their World Cup experience.

Now, a report from Airbnb and Deloitte found the tournament could drive as much as $70 million for the accommodation sector in Atlanta — and you can get a piece.

"Tourists' spending initiates a chain reaction throughout the economy, starting with direct impacts on sectors such as accommodations and restaurants. As businesses respond to this increased demand, indirect effects ripple throughout the supply chain," according to the report. "Additionally, induced effects arise as higher wages circulate within the economies, further stimulating economic activity across different sectors."

The full impact of this "multiplier effect" will be clear during the World Cup, where Deloitte estimates the city will see $23 million in direct impact to the hospitality industry by Airbnb guests, but an additional $24 million in indirect financial gains and $23 million in induced gains, bringing a total positive impact on the sector to $70 million.

Airbnb guests will not only bring money to their accommodations, but also to restaurants and bars, cultural activities, retail spaces and private and public transit, according to the report.

Airbnb rental availability is directly impacted by how many Atlanta residents are willing to rent their apartments or homes, but there is a clear financial incentive.

More than 200,000 people will be looking for a place to stay during the World Cup, including at least 6,000 Airbnb rentals. Guests are expected to spend an accumulated 45,000 guest nights in the city.

Deloitte and Airbnb estimate each guest will spend about $500 a night during their stay, primarily within the city or the neighborhoods just outside of the perimeter.

That money isn't just going to Airbnb, but a majority portion goes into the pockets of hosts.

"We project total host earnings in Atlanta and surrounding areas during the World Cup to reach nearly ($3 million), resulting in an average earnings per host of approximately ($3,700) over the event duration. These earnings could be particularly impactful for women, who represent 59% of Airbnb hosts in the USA, and for seniors, who represent 20% of hosts," according to the report.

In the days after the group stage matches were set for the World Cup, global flight interest for Atlanta was up 154%, according to a report from KAYAK. Travel searches for U.S.-bound trips was also up more than 200%, the company said.

Flight interest for Atlanta for the same time period domestically was also up more than 70% from the previous year, KAYAK said.

The same report found that hotels had increased their prices in Atlanta by 59% for the period of the World Cup, averaging about $319 per night. This means both U.S. and international travelers may be turning to sites like Airbnb and VRBO for their stay.

Teams and fans from Spain, Cabo Verde, South Africa, Denmark, North Macedonia, Czechia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Haiti, Uzbekistan, Congo, Jamaica and New Caledonia could all make appearances in Atlanta.

North Texas now knows exactly what the world will be watching. Following the official FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw, the full match schedule confirms that Dallas Stadium in Arlington will host a tournament-high nine matches, including a semifinal on July 14, 2026, cementing the region's role as a central hub of the world's biggest sporting event.

According to FIFA, the expanded 2026 tournament will feature 104 matches across 16 host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Dallas Stadium will host more matches than any other venue, welcoming eight national teams during the group stage and continuing through multiple knockout rounds.

Group stage play in Arlington will feature Argentina, Austria, Croatia, England, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands and the winner of European Play-off Final B, which will be decided in March 2026.

“We are thrilled with the teams selected to play at Dallas Stadium in Arlington,” said Monica Paul, president of the North Texas FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee, during the press conference following the draw held on Dec. 9. “Hosting a tournament-high nine matches featuring some of the world's best players will be an unforgettable experience for fans across our region.”

Five group stage matches will be played in Arlington, drawing global attention throughout June 2026:

Kickoff times were finalized as part of the global schedule to balance team recovery, travel and worldwide viewership, according to FIFA.

Dallas Stadium's role will extend well beyond group play. The venue will host two Round of 32 matches on June 30 and July 3, followed by a Round of 16 match on July 6. The run culminates with a semifinal on July 14, placing North Texas squarely in the spotlight during the tournament's final stretch.

“This is a special and historic time,” said Dan Hunt, FIFA World Cup co-chair and president of FC Dallas, during the press conference. “We have the greatest match schedule I've ever seen at a World Cup in the group stages.”

Beyond matchdays, North Texas will serve as a major operational center for the tournament. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas will host the International Broadcast Center, while cities across the region, including Frisco, are being evaluated as team base camps.

“We truly are the epicenter of World Cup 2026,” Hunt said. “We have nine matches, a semifinal, the International Broadcast Center and all of these base camps.”

Chad Estis, executive vice president of business operations for the Dallas Cowboys, said the stadium was designed with moments like this in mind. “This was the vision of the building back in the early 2000s,” Estis said. “We're excited to show the world what this stadium can be.”

Fans will soon have another chance to secure tickets. FIFA's next sales phase, the Random Selection Draw, opened Dec. 11 and runs through Jan. 13, 2026, at FIFA.com/tickets. According to FIFA, entry timing during the window does not affect selection chances, with successful applicants notified and charged in February.

Hospitality packages that include match tickets are already available through FIFA's official provider, On Location.

With schedules set and teams confirmed, preparations across North Texas are shifting into high gear. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Paul said. “Not just for soccer, but for the future of our region.”

The complete FIFA World Cup 2026 match schedule is available at FIFA.com.

Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)

Nigeria's hopes of reaching the 2026 FIFA World Cup remain alive following a formal protest lodged by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) against the Democratic Republic of Congo over alleged breaches of player eligibility rules.
The Super Eagles were eliminated in November after losing to DR Congo on penalties in the African playoff round. However, questions have since arisen regarding the eligibility of several Congolese players who featured in that match. Reports suggest that up to six players may not have completed the full nationality switch process required under FIFA regulations.
Central to the allegations is the claim that the players did not formally renounce their previous citizenships, a requirement under Congolese law, which does not recognise dual nationality. Further concerns have been raised about players holding European passports and being over the age of 21, circumstances that could place them in breach of FIFA's eligibility rules.
Confirming Nigeria's position, the NFF Secretary General, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, disclosed that a petition has been submitted to FIFA challenging the participation of the players.
“We're waiting. The Congolese rules say you cannot have a dual citizenship or nationality. Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; there are some of them that have French passports, some of them Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition,” he said.       Related News  Eagles test might against Pharaohs today  10 players hit Super Eagles camp for 2025 AFCON  Uzoho, Nwabali are early birds as Super Eagles launch ‘Naija 4 The Win' campaign   
Sanusi explained that FIFA's clearance of the players was based on documentation provided by DR Congo, but Nigeria believes the process may have been compromised.
“That's why FIFA cleared them. FIFA rules say once you have passports of your country, you're eligible, as far as FIFA is concerned, they are eligible and that's why they were cleared. But right now, our concern is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. It is not the responsibility of FIFA to ensure that the regulations of Congo are followed. FIFA goes by its own regulations, and it was on the basis of what was submitted to FIFA that they cleared them. What we are saying is that it was fraudulent,” he added.
The matter is now before FIFA, which will determine whether DR Congo breached eligibility rules. Should Nigeria's petition succeed, the Super Eagles could be reinstated into contention for the Intercontinental Playoffs scheduled to take place in Mexico in March 2026, provided the fixtures have not already been played.
The development has rekindled hope among Nigerian supporters who had resigned themselves to missing out on the World Cup following the defeat in November. The outcome of FIFA's investigation will be decisive in determining whether Nigeria's campaign can be revived.

File Copy: Super Eagles Players

Kindly share this story:

The Nigeria Football Federation has confirmed that it has initiated a probe into DR Congo's use of ineligible players during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, a development that could reopen Nigeria's path to the tournament in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, PUNCH Online reports.
DR Congo eliminated Nigeria from the African play-offs in November after a 4–3 penalty shoot-out victory in Morocco, a result that ended the Super Eagles' hopes of progressing to the FIFA intercontinental play-off.
The Congolese side has since been handed a bye into the final of the intercontinental play-off tournament, where they are scheduled to face the winner of the semi-final between New Caledonia and Jamaica.
However, their participation at that stage could now be in doubt following concerns raised by the NFF over the eligibility of several DR Congo players fielded during the African play-offs. 






Reports suggest that between six and nine DR Congo players who switched national allegiance may not have fully complied with the eligibility requirements under Congolese law before representing the country.
While FIFA reportedly cleared the players on the basis that they possessed valid DR Congo passports, it is alleged that they failed to formally renounce their previous citizenships, contrary to the Central African nation's constitution, which does not permit dual nationality.
“NFF has done the needful,” a member of the federation's executive board told PUNCH Online.          Related News  Super Eagles unveil squad for Egypt friendly clash  AFCON: Osimhen 'on another level,' defenders'll be scared - Onyeka  Super Eagles camp swells to 22 ahead of Egypt friendly   
“Their constitution does not allow dual citizenship, and about six to nine players had that status during the play-off. That is the loophole we are exploring. Our lawyers must have submitted the relevant documents to FIFA as well.”
NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, also confirmed that the NFF has faulted the players' switch.
“We're waiting. The Congolese rules say you cannot have dual citizenship or nationality,” Sanusi said. “Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; some of them have French passports, others Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition.
“FIFA rules say once you have a passport of your country, you're eligible, and that is why they were cleared,” Sanusi explained. “But our concern is that FIFA was deceived into clearing them. It is not FIFA's responsibility to enforce Congo's domestic regulations; FIFA acts based on what is submitted to it. What we are saying is that the process was fraudulent.”
The development has boosted Nigeria's hope of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The country had been condemned to missing back-to-back World Cups after failing to qualify for the 2022 edition in Qatar as well.
DR Congo, meanwhile, has appeared at the FIFA World Cup on one occasion in 1974 when they were known as Zaire.

“Their constitution does not allow dual citizenship, and about six to nine players had that status during the play-off. That is the loophole we are exploring. Our lawyers must have submitted the relevant documents to FIFA as well.”
NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, also confirmed that the NFF has faulted the players' switch.
“We're waiting. The Congolese rules say you cannot have dual citizenship or nationality,” Sanusi said. “Wan-Bissaka has a European passport; some of them have French passports, others Dutch passports. The rules are very clear, and we have submitted our petition.

It is not FIFA's responsibility to enforce Congo's domestic regulations; FIFA acts based on what is submitted to it. What we are saying is that the process was fraudulent.”
The development has boosted Nigeria's hope of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. The country had been condemned to missing back-to-back World Cups after failing to qualify for the 2022 edition in Qatar as well.

Alyssa Thompson's transfer to Chelsea featured all the hallmarks of a marquee signing. First reported to be in the works over a week before it was done, allowing the hype and excitement to build, it was given a dramatic conclusion by being completed right at the Women's Super League's transfer deadline, and for a bumper fee surpassing £1 million ($1.4m) which set a new world record for the women's game at the time. Brought out to greet the fans of her new club at Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea opened their WSL title defence with a statement win over Manchester City, Thompson was given the stage of a true star. But would she be?

Only 20 years old, the Blues were signing a player who was still more of a work-in-progress than an established talent. Thompson spent the first three years of her senior career with an Angel City side often at the wrong end of the NWSL table, making her return of 15 goals and 11 assists in 62 league games more impressive, but still with room for improvement. She was clearly gifted, but how would she adapt to the challenge of playing for a world-class side like Chelsea, while also juggling the difficulties that moving to a new city and new country, some 5,000 miles from home, at such a young age, brings?

Most of the women's game's most expensive signings have been guaranteed performers and that is often the sort of profile Chelsea have often gone for when it has come to big spending, with the likes of Naomi Girma, Keira Walsh and Pernille Harder all joining the Blues for big fees after they had already established themselves as world-class players. The deal for Thompson, then, was a little bit different. However, through the first few months of her Chelsea career, she has shown what the club and many others already believed: that she is certainly capable of hitting those heights, and is well on track to do so.

When it happened, it was fair to question aspects of this move for both Chelsea and Thompson. Would the 20-year-old get the game time she needed in order to keep developing at the impressive rate she did at Angel City? Or would a smaller-sized step have been better for her, to maintain that trajectory?

On the other side, when Chelsea were handily beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals last season, one of the main takeaways was that the Blues needed more world-class match-winners in order to close the gap to the Catalans, who have ended their European dream in four of the last five seasons. Given her age and limited experience, Thompson didn't feel like she was that just yet. But would she be expected to be from the get-go? Or could she reach that point quickly?

It wasn't just that Thompson had a new environment, on and off the pitch, to adapt to, either. She was also joining a Chelsea side that is extremely adaptable when it comes to formation and, as such, requires its players to be able to change position frequently.

At Angel City, Thompson almost always played as a left winger. There were a couple of times where she lined up on the right, even fewer occasions where she might find herself in central areas, and occasions when she would be asked to be a little bit deeper or more advanced than usual. But, generally speaking, the young forward consistently played the same position in her two and a half years in Los Angeles and that no doubt helped her settle into the NWSL nicely, to become a very productive outlet. By contrast, in her three months at Chelsea to date, Thompson has already played as a winger on the right and the left and, most differently, as a wing-back.

Speaking about her United States, and now Chelsea, team-mate on the We Are Chelsea podcast, Girma described Thompson as someone who is "used to being uncomfortable in those environments," after her experiences coming into the NWSL and the international game. Still, this was a move that was going to present more challenges than ever before for her, and all at once.

It's to Thompson's immense credit, then, that she is passing these tests with flying colours and showing she can be exactly what Chelsea need. As the Blues' season prepares to hit its halfway stage, with Wednesday's Champions League clash with Wolfsburg and Sunday's League Cup quarter-final against Liverpool all that is left before the winter break, the 20-year-old has nailed down a starting spot in head coach Sonia Bompastor's team, featuring in the XI for each of the last nine matches and repaying that faith with four goals and two assists.

Last month, her sublime strike against Arsenal was named WSL Goal of the Month, while her goal-and-assist display against Brighton on Sunday was right up there with that performance against the Gunners as a contender for her best to date in Chelsea blue, helping her side sign off in the WSL in 2025 with a vital win.

It's clear that having such a settled run in the Chelsea team is helping Thompson find that consistency and she deserves further praise for managing to nail one down, because the Blues have one of the best and most competitive squads in Europe. She's not wasting those opportunities, either, learning as much as possible from every outing in order to keep taking steps forward.

Asked about the biggest differences between the WSL and the NWSL she noticed when moving to England, Girma explained on the We Are Chelsea podcast: "Having different styles of games in the league is different. For different teams, you have to prepare different game plans and sometimes a team, especially against a team like Chelsea, will sit in or high press. I think the tactics change a lot. I think that has been different and the preparation for each game."

That's something Thompson herself has noted in these last few months, too. "I feel like every game is different," she said last month. "All of these teams are coming from different leagues so even the fact that we play different styles has helped me a lot in terms of viewing the game tactically. I can see what I need to work on against different teams' blocks and it helps me show more versatility in my game. Having that every week in the Champions League is really cool."

Having a manager who really believes in her talent must help, too. As well as trusting her as a regular starter, Bompastor has repeatedly praised Thompson since her arrival in London and said she believes there is even more to come from her, the kind of comments which must make any young player, never mind one 5,000 miles from home in a totally new environment, feel extremely confident.

"She brings a lot of speed up front," Bompastor said after Thompson's goal-and-assist display against Paris FC in October, in some of her most glowing comments about the 20-year-old to date. "She's really comfortable on the ball and she takes risks. She attacks the defender, one-on-one, and she's able to come inside or outside, so it's really difficult to defend against her.

"She's able to provide a lot of crosses when she goes outside but also, she's able to finish when the ball is on the opposite side. She has the engine and she also has the desire to help the team in and out of possession. When we are attacking, we are high up on the pitch, and if she has to run to recover some space, to help the team defend, she's able to do that. She's still a young player but she has a lot of talent.

"We haven't seen the best of her yet but hopefully we'll see that soon. She's come from abroad, she speaks the language, which helps, but it's a new environment, a new club, and she's still learning to connect with her team-mates on the pitch."

As 2025 nears its end, it feels like we have got much closer to the best of Thompson in the six games since that high praise from Bompastor. The upcoming winter break is likely to do her the world of good, too, given she arrived in the WSL off the back of five months of action in the NWSL, which runs from March to November. A little bit of time off should help her reset before a big end to the season.

In the New Year, Chelsea have a lot on their plate. The Blues will be aiming to become the first team in WSL history to overturn a six-point deficit at the halfway point to win the title, as they bid to take down league leaders Manchester City to win a seventh successive crown. There are also title defences in the League Cup and FA Cup to come, and the challenge of the Champions League. Chelsea have still never triumphed in Europe and will be more determined than ever to change that.

To be successful on multiple fronts, the Blues need several things and one of the big ones is match-winners, the kind of which can make the difference at the elite level. In her first half-season at the club, Thompson has taken real strides and shown that she can be exactly that, making all the hype and excitement surrounding her arrival absolutely worthwhile.

Barcelona have reportedly identified Borussia Dortmund defender Julian Ryerson as a shock transfer target to bolster their defensive options. The Catalan giants are scouring the market for reinforcements amid growing fears that Manchester City could launch a swoop for Jules Kounde, forcing Hansi Flick to draw up contingency plans for the right-back position.

Flick is reportedly looking to raid the Bundesliga for defensive reinforcements, with Ryerson emerging as a surprise candidate to strengthen the Spanish league leaders' backline. The German head coach, who maintains a close eye on football in his homeland, is said to be an admirer of the Norwegian international's industrious style of play and versatility.

According to reports from Sky Sport, the Catalan club have placed the 28-year-old on their shortlist of potential targets as they look to add depth to their defensive unit and have already opened talks with his representatives to sound out his interest in a move. 

The report indicates that Barcelona's sporting department values the profile of the Dortmund man highly. Since joining the Black and Yellows from Union Berlin in January 2023, Ryerson has established himself as a fan favourite at Signal Iduna Park. Known for his tireless work rate, defensive solidity, and aggression in duels, he has become a staple in the starting XI, often keeping more high-profile names out of the team.

Flick is understood to appreciate players who offer tactical discipline and physical intensity, traits that the Norwegian possesses in abundance. While he may not offer the same attacking flair as some of the modern full-backs the Blaugrana have fielded in the past, his reliability and ability to play on both the right and left flanks make him a valuable asset for a squad competing on multiple fronts.

The urgency to recruit a right-back has been heightened by the uncertain future of Jules Kounde. Although the Frenchman has performed admirably on the right side of the defence for both club and country, he has made no secret of his preference to play as a central defender. His performances have reportedly caught the eye of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, who had shown interest in him in the previous transfer window.

He ended up signing a new contract, suggesting his long-term future lies with the Camp Nou club, though City returning for him has not been ruled out. Even if Kounde stays, the lack of a natural, experienced alternative in the squad is a concern for Flick and the club hierarchy is reportedly keen to bring in a seasoned professional who can rotate with the former Sevilla man or step in should he be sold to alleviate the club's well-documented financial issues.

Ryerson represents a potentially cost-effective solution for Barcelona. Unlike other high-profile targets who would command astronomical transfer fees, the full-back could be available for a more modest sum. His contract with Dortmund runs until the summer of 2028, but the report states Dortmund do not have a massive asking price.

Dortmund would likely be reluctant to lose a player described as a "hero" by the Yellow Wall for his commitment and fighting spirit. Ryerson was instrumental in the club's run to the Champions League final in 2023-24, proving he can handle the pressure of the biggest stages in European football. However, the allure of playing for Barcelona, combined with the opportunity to work under a manager of Flick's pedigree, could prove difficult for the player to turn down.

One of the key factors driving the interest is the player's ability to play multiple positions. While primarily a right-back, he has frequently been deployed as a left-back during his time in Germany. This two-footedness and tactical flexibility would allow Flick to cover two positions with a single signing, a crucial factor for a squad that has often been stretched thin by injuries.

The Sky Sport report suggests that while no formal offer has been made, the interest is concrete. Barcelona scouts have been monitoring Ryerson's performances throughout the current campaign. With the January transfer window approaching, it remains to be seen whether the reigning Spanish champions will test Dortmund's resolve immediately or wait until the summer to launch their pursuit.

Former Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has, after enduring a missing dog ordeal in Mexico, aired his surprise at seeing Liga MX side Pumas rip up his contract. The Wales international played just six games for the Central American outfit after stepping out of his comfort zone in Europe. He returned to the UK after seeing his beloved pet go missing in October.

Ramsey, who has struggled to steer clear of injury over the course of his career, picked up a hamstring complaint prior to seeing his dog Halo disappear - in what his family called a “haunting” experience.

Personal problems made life difficult for Ramsey in Mexico, but he was tied to a one-year deal through to the summer of 2026. It was reported following his decision to head back to his homeland that said terms had been terminated by mutual consent.

Ramsey has now confirmed that his deal was torn up, leaving him with “no choice” but to settle again in Wales. The 34-year-old maintains that, despite his issues on and off the field, his release came as a shock to the system.

He has posted on Instagram: “I would like to thank the Mexican people for their kindness and generosity and making me and my family feel so welcome in Mexico City. I also want to give a big thanks to the manager, the coaching staff and particularly the medical staff for helping me through what was a difficult time with injuries.

“However with their help and a lot of hard work I was ready and match fit for the remaining games and I was looking forward to giving my best to the Pumas. Unfortunately my contract was terminated which was a surprise and obviously disappointing. Therefore I had no choice but to come home to Wales. Thank you again for all the support through the time we spent in Mexico. It's a beautiful place and we will definitely come back to visit soon.”

Ramsey took in a brief stint as player-manager of Cardiff at the end of the 2024-25 campaign. He had returned to his roots after spending time in Italy with Serie A giants Juventus and France with Nice.

Eyebrows were raised when he headed to Mexico in July. A matter of months after that move was made, his pet beagle - who was last seen in San Miguel de Allende, in the Guanajuato region - went missing.

Ramsey offered a $20,000 (£15,000) reward to anyone that could help to track down the hound, with Halo's disappearance from a shelter causing confusion and anger. Ramsey has posted: “We've remained quiet trying to understand how you can leave your dog on a ranch and never see her again. Without any explanation? The cameras weren't recording, a tracker couldn't find her, no sightings, no body, and a pile of lies.”

Pumas boss Efrain Juarez said when asked about Ramsey's situation: “We're monitoring it. I said it on Wednesday - let's see what happens in the coming days. He's dealing with his situation, which we all know about, involving his dog. Also, there was an issue before he left during the FIFA break. So, we'll have to wait and see what happens in the next few days.”

It has now been revealed that Ramsey will not be heading back to Mexico City, with a forgettable and distressing saga being brought to a close. His last appearance for Pumas came in a 4-1 defeat to America at the end of September.

An injury picked up at that time prevented him from joining up with the Wales squad and making more appearances at club level. He is now a free agent again and on the look out for another contract.

Ramsey, who is captain of his country, has earned 86 caps for Wales. He helped them to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and will be hoping to grace next summer's World Cup finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico - with Craig Bellamy's side preparing for a play-off semi-final clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina in March.

United States men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams has suspected medial collateral ligament damage after limping out of Bournemouth's 4-4 draw with Manchester United in the Premier League on Monday.

In the second minute of the match at Old Trafford, Adams was injured while challenging Matheus Cunha. He came off after treatment on the pitch.

"He's the worst news from the game, definitely," Bournemouth coach Andoni Iraola said. "The knee twisted, I think the MCL. We'll have to check and see if it is a small sprain or bigger.

"To lose a player like Tyler for us is massive, especially when you don't have Lewis Cook (suspended). Alex (Scott) has to play in that holding midfield position and he has done it really well but it's bad news for us because Tyler is massive for us."

Adams captained the United States at the last World Cup in 2022 in Qatar. The next U.S. games are not until March, a pair of friendlies.

He's been invaluable again for Bournemouth, appearing in all but one Premier League round and scoring twice, including the goal of the month for November.

A furious blur of shotmaking and nerve, Carlos Alcaraz's quarter-final victory over Arthur Fils at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters has been voted by fans as the ATP Tour's Match of the Year for 2025.

The two young stars produced a blistering spectacle in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, one that felt like the birth of a long-term rivalry. Fils unloaded explosive, heavy groundstrokes from the baseline to grab the opening set before Alcaraz mounted the kind of miraculous escape that would become a theme of his title run, prevailing 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 after two hours, 23 minutes.

In the fan vote, the Alcaraz-Fils thriller fended off strong competition, including Jannik Sinner's marquee championship-match triumph in Vienna over Alexander Zverev and a gruelling, three-hour Athens final between Novak Djokovic and Lorenzo Musetti.

It was, however, Alcaraz's mix of quality, courage and chaos in Monte-Carlo that made his triumph the match that supporters deemed the year's unforgettable standout.

Watch Alcaraz vs. Fils Highlights:

Saving three break points at 5-5, 0/40 in the second set and later overturning a 1-3 deficit in the third, Alcaraz repeatedly absorbed Fils' pace and power before counterpunching with trademark flair. The Spaniard's nerve under pressure not only cracked Fils' resistance but also marked one of three victories from a set down on his way to a maiden triumph in the Principality.

"I think his level is high right now and he puts a lot of pressure on his opponents,” Alcaraz said of Fils. “Today I could feel it but in some moments he just made a few mistakes. I tried to make the most of those points and wait for my chances.”



It marked one of eight tour-level trophies across the season for Alcaraz, who also clinched Roland Garros and US Open crowns en route to reclaiming ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the first time since 2022. The Spaniard also produced a clay-court thriller in the Roland Garros final, delivering an epic comeback to stun rival Sinner for the crown. That match topped the list of Best Grand Slam matches from 2025.

Roger Federer will return to the Australian Open in January, taking the court in an exhibition match featuring three other ATP No. 1 Club members: Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt.

 
The season's first major will launch a new tradition of having an Opening Ceremony the night before main-draw action begins. The Opening Ceremony will take place on Saturday, January 17 at Rod Laver Arena.

“It feels like a lifetime ago that I coined the phrase the ‘Happy Slam' for the Australian Open, and it still makes me smile when I think about all the moments I've had here,” said Federer, a six-time Australian Open champion, in a press release.


“I've experienced so many emotions on Rod Laver Arena… The joy of lifting ‘Norman' [the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup] six times, the honour of playing in front of Rod Laver himself, the challenge of competing against my biggest rivals, and always the overwhelming love and support of the Australian fans.


“Coming back to win the AO in 2017 is one of my most treasured Grand Slam memories and backing it up to win in 2018 was another dream come true in Melbourne. I can't wait to come down under again to the AO and create more fantastic moments with all the Aussie fans.”

A post shared by Roger Federer (@rogerfederer)

Tournament director Craig Tiley added: "I'm thrilled we're introducing this very special AO Opening Ceremony. While the AO has a reputation for innovation and is renowned for pushing the boundaries, we are also the custodians of a proud 120-year history filled with some of the sport's greatest champions.


“This inaugural Opening Ceremony will mark the start of a new tennis season in spectacular fashion. I can't wait to see Roger back on Rod Laver Arena, along with other greats of the game, Andre, Pat and Lleyton. And I know fans across Australia will be just as excited to share this moment with him."


The 2026 Australian Open runs from 18 January-1 February. Italian Jannik Sinner is the two-time defending champion while Carlos Alcaraz, World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will be seeking his maiden Melbourne title in pursuit of completing the Career Grand Slam.

The ATP has today announced the renewal of its long-standing partnership with Rolex. The Swiss watchmaker continues as the Official Timekeeper and Gold Partner of the ATP.

Rolex's relationship with tennis dates back to 1978, and the brand has since gone on to support many of the most prestigious events on the ATP Tour. Through the renewal, Rolex will remain the Official Timekeeper of the ATP Tour, an Official Partner of the Nitto ATP Finals, the ATP's flagship season finale, and the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the world's top 20-and-under players, reinforcing its commitment to young talent and the future of the game.

Rolex will maintain year-round brand visibility across the ATP's social and digital platforms, with content providing match start times and game durations, reaching a global fanbase of over one billion.

Daniele Sano, ATP Chief Business Officer, said: “It's difficult to understate the commitment Rolex has shown towards our sport and the ATP Tour. For almost 50 years, it has championed the qualities that define tennis – elegance, prestige, and precision. As a valued partner of the ATP since 2005, we're proud to reinforce such an iconic legacy.”

Arnaud Boetsch, Rolex Director of Communication and Image, said: “Rolex is proud to reaffirm its long-standing commitment to tennis. While celebrating the dedication and remarkable performances at the highest levels of the game, Rolex supports the leading tournaments, governing bodies and players, as they continue to shape the future of the sport.”

Rolex is also an Official Partner of all ATP Masters 1000 events, as well as the Australian Open, Roland-Garros, The Championships, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Beyond tennis, the brand holds a significant presence across global sport, including golf, motorsport, yachting and equestrianism.

Rolex counts several leading ATP athletes among its family of Testimonees, including current World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz and World No. 2 Jannik Sinner, alongside Ben Shelton, João Fonseca and tennis legends Roger Federer and Björn Borg.

Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo are re-teaming for the feature film Heist of Benin. 


	Set against the backdrop of contemporary London, Heist of Benin is described as a “thriller that intertwines art, love and restitution.” Oyelowo will star.


	It has just been announced on stage at the Studiocanal Paris showcase, which is taking place as this story publishes.


	The film marks the latest collaboration between DuVernay and Oyelowo, who also worked together on Academy Award-winning movie Selma, which earned acclaim for its portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 1965 Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery. For that movie, Oyelowo played King. More recently, Oyelowo starred in DuVernay's A Wrinkle in Time.












	DuVernay said: “Reuniting with David in this way feels full circle. This film speaks to history, identity and love, all through the lens of a high-stakes, modern adventure. I'm thrilled to bring it to life with him and Studiocanal.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Ava and I have been looking for the right story to tell together again,” Oyelowo added. “Heist is that story. It's thrilling and high-powered with deeply resonant themes that matter to us both.”


	The film is produced by Endurance Media's Steve Richards and Jake Katofsky alongside Yoruba Saxon's Lisa Bruce and Oyelowo, from an original idea and spec script from screenwriter Jesse Quiñones, who will executive produce. Studiocanal will finance, distribute and handle international sales. Ron Halpern, Shana Eddy and Sam Shipp will oversee for the studio. 

	











	Meanwhile, Studiocanal revealed on stage Elsinore, a Simon Stone and Stephen Beresford movie starring Andrew Scott and Olivia Colman about the life of actor Ian Charleson.

	Less than a month after Billy The Kid ended after three seasons, MGM+ has ordered a new western series.


	The streamer and linear network has greenlit a series adaptation of The Magnificent Seven from Heroes creator Tim Kring.


The Magnificent Seven, the 1960 film from director John Sturges, was one of a number of MGM/United Artists movie titles that Jeff Bezos' company had targeted for development after Amazon acquired the James Bond studio.


	It is, however, a different take on the title than the one that was previously in the works from True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto.












	The eight-part drama series will be written by Kring, who also created Fox's Touch. He exec produces with Billy The Kid exec producer Donald De Line, Lawrence Mirisch and Bruce Kaufman. It will be produced by MGM+ Studios and MGM Television Studios and is set to start production in June.




			Watch on Deadline		







The Magnificent Seven will air on MGM+ in the U.S., UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile.


	The reboot is set in the tumultuous 1880s American frontier. After a peaceful Quaker village is massacred by mercenaries working for a greedy and ruthless land baron trying to force them off the land he covets, seven gifted but flawed mercenaries are hired by the community to protect them from the land baron's hired guns. But as the team embeds itself in the community, preparing to defend them against overwhelming odds, they are all forced to grapple with an essential question: is the use of violence acceptable to defend a people whose faith is based on non-violence? The series takes a deep dive into the stories behind each of the Seven; what's at stake for them, and why they choose to take on this mission.


	“Tim Kring is a master storyteller,” said Michael Wright, head of MGM+. “Tim, Donald De Line, Larry Mirisch, and Bruce Kaufman have crafted a series that delivers the energy of a classic western, honors the legacy of the original film, and reasserts its timeless themes of the power of unity against oppression and flawed heroes finding redemption by helping those who can't help themselves.”

Police tape blocks off the road at both ends while TV news vans post up on the curbs and swarms of podcasters jostle each other as the mansion becomes part of the town's topography of tragedy.


							By

Articles Editor


	If you were to stick a pin into a map of Los Angeles at the precise location where one might least expect a heinous act of murderous violence, it would likely land right here, on South Chadbourne Avenue. This narrow lane in Brentwood, tucked discreetly a few blocks south of Sunset, lined with palm trees and gated multimillion-dollar mansions, is usually as calm and idyllic as a David Hockney landscape.


	But not right now. On this day, Dec. 14, it looks like something out of a James Ellroy fever dream. Police tape blocks off the road at both ends while TV news vans crowd the curbs and swarms of podcasters and online influencers jostle each other with their vlogging sticks for better views of the grisly scene up the street.

					Nick Reiner Revealed Violent Outburst, Family Issues and "Cocaine Heart Attack" on 2018 Podcast Taping		
			









	At one point, a resident wanders out of her home, glances at the mob milling in front of her driveway, breaks into sobs, then rushes back inside.


	Police hadn't yet officially confirmed it, but everybody here knows what's just happened. Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, have been brutally murdered. The sickening details will trickle out over the coming hours: how earlier in the day one of the Reiners' daughters discovered her parents dead in their home, their throats viciously slashed; that the LA Fire Department arrived first, followed by LAPD homicide detectives; that the prime suspect in the slayings, now in custody, was another of the Reiners' children, Nick, 32, who has suffered a long history of drug and mental health challenges.

	There have been some hard Hollywood deaths this past year — Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Diane Keaton — but it's fair to say this one hit the town particularly hard, and not just because of the shocking circumstances. Reiner, 78, had been a fixture in the industry his whole life, starting when his father, Carl Reiner, a legendary Hollywood figure in his own right, would bring him to the set of The Dick Van Dyke Show, the classic sitcom he was creating for CBS. 


	As a teenager, Reiner occasionally popped up elsewhere on the dial — there was a non-speaking part in Wagon Train — and when he was 20 his dad gave him a role in 1967's Enter Laughing, his semiautobiographical movie about growing up in Depression-era New York. But, of course, it was the part Reiner landed just a few years later, at the age of 23, that would set the course for a career that would one day rival and even surpass his father's.

	











	For a generation of TV viewers, Reiner will always be “Meathead,” Archie Bunker's long-suffering liberal son-in-law on Norman Lear's seminal 1970s sitcom All in the Family. The show, which gleefully pushed political and social hot button issues — racism, sexism, homophobia, they all were treated as punchlines — was such a cultural phenomenon it could easily have defined Reiner's legacy on its own. That was a danger Reiner was all too aware of. “I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write, ‘Meathead wins the Nobel Prize,'” he lamented more than once.


	Turns out he was wrong about that — he ended up growing out of Michael Stivic remarkably quickly. In fact, through his 30s and 40s, Reiner would evolve into one of the most successful filmmakers of his generation, shooting an astonishing string of what can reasonably be called instant classics. For starters, there was This Is Spinal Tap, his 1984 directorial debut that pretty much invented the mockumentary (poignantly, last September, it was bookended by its long-in-the-works sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, Reiner's final film). 


	Over the next incredibly productive eight years, he'd make Stand by Me (River Phoenix's breakout film); The Princess Bride (still a cable-TV holiday staple); When Harry Met Sally (the Nora Ephron-scripted rom-com that made Meg Ryan a star — and also the film on which Reiner met his wife, who was a photographer on the set); Misery (which won Kathy Bates an Oscar); and A Few Good Men (noms for best picture and best supporting actor for Jack Nicholson).


	Offscreen, Reiner was just as active, an outspoken champion of civil rights and an unapologetically progressive activist. He was a founding board member of AFER, the organization that, in 2013, helped overturn California's ban on same-sex marriage. His opinions sometimes drew fire from the right — especially recently, with President Trump not even letting Reiner's death get in the way of attacking him for being “deranged” and “very bad for our country” — but most reasonable people, even when they disagreed with him, could find something to respect in his humanity and dignity.


	Of course, no career is without its low points, and Reiner certainly had his share of dips. His 1994 high-concept family comedy North — with future-Frodo Elijah Wood playing a hyper-articulate 11-year-old who sues his parents for not being appreciative enough — was the flop that finally cracked his winning streak, not only tanking at the box office but also famously earning zero stars from Roger Ebert. Still, despite such later-career setbacks, Reiner's track record at his peak, in the 1980s and early 1990s, puts him right up there with Ron Howard, Robert Zemeckis and maybe even Steven Spielberg, planting him squarely in the A-list echelon of late 20th century auteurs, part of Hollywood's most elite cadre.

	











	Except for one other — the one Reiner and his 67-year-old wife of 35 years joined this past weekend, after the horrific events at their Brentwood home; it's a much sadder pantheon, but equally famous and even more enduring — the icons of Hollywood's most infamous crimes and catastrophes.


	That house on Chadbourne Avenue? The Reiners lived there for more than 30 years — since buying the 10,000-square-foot estate from Lear in 1991. It's not too far from another famous Brentwood address: 875 Bundy Drive, where Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered. And that house, it turns out, is only a short distance from Fifth Helena Drive, where Marilyn Monroe overdosed. There are scores of other equally grim landmarks strewn all over the city. Sharon Tate's Benedict Canyon estate, Phil Hartman's suburban home in Encino, Sal Mineo's apartment in West Hollywood — they have all become landmarks in this town's topography of tragedy.


	It will likely be the same with the Reiners' Brentwood mansion, once the news vans and influencers eventually clear out. Hollywood is a town built on storytelling and myth-building. Regrettably, Rob Reiner's story, however huge its imprint on the culture, is now part of that mournful, terrible tradition.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	The new Steven Spielberg movie from Universal will be titled Disclosure Day. A new trailer dropped Tuesday that you can watch above, and the movie remains set to open on June 12 next year.


	The movie reps Spielberg's return to his extra-terrestrial invasion stomping ground made popular with such tentpoles as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and War of the Worlds. 


	In the trailer we see Emily Blunt's weather girl not holding it together as she becomes possessed by some foreign entity. Whatever is going on in the world — it also has the attention of wild animals and nuns. The studio's logline sent around today: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.”

	











	Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson and Colman Domingo also star in the pic, the plot of which had been mostly under wraps. The story is from Spielberg, with the screenplay from his longtime collaborator David Koepp, who previously teamed on scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

Disclosure Day marks Spielberg's first film since 2022's semi-autobiographical The Fabelmans, which scored seven Oscar nominations.

Sick beatboxing

You know, in this current atmosphere, with so much hate and anger and vileness, I'm honestly not sure I can do this tone. It just feels like nonsense.

looks good.

I like the teaser. I haven't been interested in seeing any of his films since Crystal Skull.

As the HBO Max-Crave series grows in popularity, the 24-year-old actor is taking his newfound stardom in stride and sharing one reason why the show might be resonating: “If ‘Challengers' was the cocktease of it all, then our show just leans in and gets in there.”


							By

	It may seem like everything's happened overnight for Heated Rivalry breakout Hudson Williams, but the 24-year-old actor swears it's felt a bit more gradual on his end. 


	“There's no way to prepare for what this side of things looks like,” Williams tells The Hollywood Reporter about his newfound stardom. The actor was in L.A. for the show's first round of in-person U.S. press, and he's in good spirits despite what has to be a long week.




	It's hard to go on the Internet and not see Williams or his co-star, Connor Storrie. The HBO Max–Crave series, based on Rachel Reid's novel of the same name, has been a surprise hit for the streaming services.

	Written and directed for television by Letterkenny alum Jacob Tierney, Heated Rivalry follows Williams' Shane Hollander, an anxious and endlessly endearing Canadian hockey prodigy and his rival, Russian phenom Ilya Rozanov, played by Storrie. The show takes audiences along for the ride as the pair navigate a near-decade-long situationship, spanning their entire professional hockey careers.


	Even if things didn't happen overnight, life is looking a different than it used to for Williams. Before taking on Heated Rivalry, he was working as a waiter at The Old Spaghetti Factory in New Westminster, British Columbia. He assures he never once felt better than the job but did feel he was “good enough” at acting that he should be seeing some reward from that front.


	“But I loved it. That was how I paid my rent. It was paycheck to paycheck. Vancouver is more expensive than Los Angeles, so it was very hard,” he says of his old gig. “I had a great outlook. In a lot of ways, it was a lot easier than what it's like now.” 

	











	As Heated Rivalry heads into its penultimate episode, its popularity continues to grow. It was announced last week that it had been renewed for a season two. Williams, however, is proceeding with cautious optimism, looking forward to whatever the future might hold.


	Below, the actor speaks with THR about what he initially thought life would look like after Heated Rivalry, how he deals with negative comments online and what he hopes comes next.


How are you doing? That's a genuine question. I assume you've been a little crazy.


	It is crazy. I feel like I'm a compass on a magnetic field. It's pointing every which way, and I don't know who the hell is right, but I'm very excited. It's very auspicious looking. I was talking with Connor [Storrie] about this. I don't know if someone's going to reach out and be like, “We want you in this new YA show. It's really poorly written, but we think you're perfect.” Or if Luca Guadagnino is going to crawl out of Italy and be like, “I want you.” I don't want to make any assumptions, so I'm just trying to be as calm as I can. But so far, the fan reactions are very nice and mostly wholesome. [I'm] overwhelmed, overscrolling on the socials, so I delete them lots. Every time I post something, I go and delete it again.


Wow, you just delete whole app?


	Connor and I both do that. I deactivate Twitter and fully delete it, and I delete Instagram periodically, always.


Is it because you know you'll look? Are you someone who wants to know?












	Instagram, I don't really have a problem actually. I can just look at it for 10 minutes, and then that's my day. But Twitter's the one [that's a problem] because it's shit posting. People are just thought, or lack of thought, to speech [and] they'll post it. It's still mainly good. I always doubted celebrities when they said, “There are going to be 200 good things, and you'll remember the bad one.” I was like surely that can't be true, and it is true. I also take the bad ones with a grain of salt. Sometimes they're so overtly mean [that] they just make me laugh so hard. Those are the ones I'm sharing with people around me. I think my friends and family sometimes even take joy in really overt assholes. (Laughs.)


Just because it's so ridiculous?


	It's so ridiculous to actually believe these people. To actually go, “Oh my God.” To be offended would be to think they matter. It's like, why be offended? Just kind of laugh.


You now suddenly have a lot of people talking about you on online. It seemed quick from the outside. Do you find it more difficult to deal with because it wasn't as gradual? Or is it simply something you can't prepare for?


	I don't think it's something you can prepare for. I would say to a degree it has been gradual. We saw the fans find us when we were halfway through shooting — they found it through Instagram sleuthing — so it wasn't like, oh, this is a totally normal fan base. It was like, oh, these people can be obsessive. Then I think our Instagrams only went to a few thousand followers. We had a Canadian press [run], which was a little bit more light. We had Montreal day one, which wasn't too crazy. There was a big packed house full of fans, but it wasn't like press, press, press. Then day two was Toronto, and it was more cast and crew. Then we had press later on, so it was kind of a build. But at the end of the day, still feels reminiscent of an overnight success. There's no way to prepare for what this side of things looks like.

	











When you took this project on, what did your life look like? 


	I was serving at The Old Spaghetti Factory [in] New Westminster. It's like y'all's version of an Olive Garden. I would argue less swanky, but I loved it there. Walking through that door every day though, through the server's entrance, is a little bit like… I'm not better than this, but I do feel I'm good enough at acting that I should be reaping some reward for it. But I loved it. That was how I paid my rent. It was paycheck to paycheck. Vancouver is more expensive than Los Angeles, so it was very hard. I had a great outlook. In a lot of ways, it was a lot easier than what it's like now. 


I'm very curious what you thought life was going to look like once the show came out when you initially signed on.


	When I got this role, and I saw the fan base — it wasn't a New York Times bestseller and it didn't have any metrics of how many copies it sold. Jacob was coming off Shoresy and Letterkenny, so I was looking at that as a metric. For him to do two successful shows that are hockey related, I thought it seemed a little bit more commercially viable. If you go gay hockey, less hockey… I didn't think it would blow up to this. I thought it'd be more of a niche fan base. Not that I think of Instagram followers or anything, but unfortunately it is sort of a metric of relevancy in actors. I thought I'd maybe get 100,000 [followers] by episode six release. Episode six drops, five months go past. There's a climb. I'll maybe cap out 100,000 followers, and that'll be the level, so this already is like, oh, fuck, did not expect this. (Laughs.)

	











Why do you think it clicked? What is it that you saw in the show that you're happy that other people are seeing in it?


	I think the writing is brilliant. I know there is a lot of sex and a lot of stuff that's sparking interest in it. There's a very garish title. It's not subtle in advertising. But I always thought from the moment I read [them], they are Emmy's quality scripts, and Jacob is a brilliant writer. I'm honored to be a part of this. All Connor and I could do was fuck it up.


Well, you didn't.


	After seeing how good Connor was at Ilya and then him getting cast, it made me a little bit more confident that Jacob must be casting me somewhat right. If Connor was so good at what he does, maybe if I'm almost as good as that, then I must be pretty OK. I [also] think queer sports hasn't really been done too much. If Challengers was the cocktease of it all, then our show just leans in and gets in there.


How much did you know about this story before? Were you aware of it?


	I didn't even know hockey smut was a thing, let alone popular. I wasn't even very familiar with how these women-catered romance genres, how fucking vulgar they are. Not in a bad way, by any means, but they get into it. They get so nasty and so descriptive. It's beautiful, I love it. But holy fuck, I just didn't realize that was the level. Reading it, the heart permeates way past it. It supersedes the sex and the level of intimacy, and these characters really stay with you after you read them. That's sort of what surprised me to a degree.

	











Shane is such an internal character. Having read this book, it wasn't super clear how that would work on screen. Did that give you pause? Was that something you had to work through day-to-day?


	After reading Jacob's scripts, even before the book, I immediately saw how he would operate. My dad is on the spectrum, he knows it. He's a mechanical engineer, graduated top of his class, first in class in everything, very technical genius in a lot of ways, but sort of socially… I think he would say that he doesn't want to deal with emotions. He has told me, I'm not even paraphrasing, “I relate more with Vulcan than human,” referencing the Star Trek, the hyper-cerebral alien creatures. I love my dad to death, and I've always felt very connected to him. He has a sensitivity to him that is very boyish. I think when I read the script, I took a huge page out of living my life with him. Rachel [Reid] has said [Shane] is autistic, so I think I knew how it should look. I empathized with him a lot, immediately.


What is it about Shane that you love and were drawn to?


	He is hyper competent at this one thing. He's stereotypically masculine in a lot of regards. He's a kind person, and he's so overtly Canadian. He's harboring something that he thinks is a career-ending secret because he just doesn't have the emotional maturity or societal maturity to sort of understand what his own queerness means. To him, it's most likely detrimental, which is the wrong assumption to some degree, but it shatters his own idea of what his masculinity is, or at least it cripples it. And yet, he still never harms a fly.

	











This story takes place over almost a decade. This was all filmed together, correct? How do you handle that as an actor?


	I remember immediately after I heard Jacob was directing all of it, I called him before we even went to Toronto. I [asked him if he was] blockshooting this thing. He [said we were] shooting it one giant five-hour movie. I was like oh, fuck. OK, I know what that means. It means out of order, and it looks like a goddamn headache. I was talking with actors who had done Christopher Nolan-y storylines because I [wanted to know how] they did that. 


What did you find out?


	A lot of the actors I kept hearing [from] were talking about physical maps that they drew, like a cheat sheet of timeline points. I remember I did that pretty early on, drawing a map. Then the scripts were so clear of where they were each time that if I was coming into a day, we're doing year two, and it's the 10th hour of the shoot day, and before that we were shooting year eight. I would have to [ask Jacob] what happened right before. “Pre-Rose, post this, this happened, haven't said this yet.” I got it, and then he would have to tell me very little for me to know exactly what happens after and what has happened right before. I had a pretty dense understanding of the timeline, and so I felt like I could jump in emotionally. It didn't feel like I needed much last minute prep on it. I goof off a lot, but all the work was done was well before I even got to set.


You said something earlier that was essentially that you were doing a gay hockey show minus a lot of the hockey. But hockey was still a part of it. Did you know how to skate? Were you athletic growing up?












	I played a lot of sports, but I did not know how to skate.


Like at all or…


	I could stand without falling, and push and waver around the ice, but it wasn't even a true skate, skate. It was like, I'm just not falling and a little bit past just taking steps. I [asked] Jacob how much hockey he needed us to do. That was one of the first questions I asked him. He was like, “Jump off the bench, skate up to the face off.” I made it my goal to be able to play rec hockey; drop in beer league hockey was my sort of obnoxious goal. I fell short, but from the gist of what I understood from him, it would've been more than what we needed.


What about when you shot the hockey scenes? 


	The hockey section was all packed into one week, and it was much later into the shoot. We didn't step on the ice until our fourth week in or something. Even when we were in Toronto, we were meeting with our hockey coordinator to skate. The closer we got to the hockey, I [started thinking]; how do I hold a mouth guard? How do I jump over the thing? How do I touch my gloves? How do I hold the stick when I'm just chilling? How do I stretch? I realized it wouldn't be all this hockey stuff, it'll be hockey culture stuff. It'll be details.


You seem to be having a lot of fun with this experience, which is nice to see. What are you doing to keep it fun, especially as it gets a bit more daunting perhaps?


	Well, I have one of my best friends for life right beside me through it all, which is already a luxury that a lot of actors don't get. I'm sure I would've probably had a smaller appetite for the amount of stuff we're doing if I didn't have him through this. I'm an omnivert, leaning more to an extrovert, but I still get… I have ADHD, I'm unmedicated, currently, for the last while, so my social battery can just tap [out] pretty quick. At the end of the day, I'm pretty forgiving with myself if I'm talking with a reporter in a polite, more boring way. Then when I've had coffee, and I've had a nap, I let myself be chaotic. I let myself off the leash. I try to say, whatever mood I'm in, just be Canadian, don't be mean. Whatever they get, they get.

	











There was already a built-in fanbase for this project, but you did shoot most of it in a bubble before people knew. Do you think that helped?


	In hindsight, I want to say it was probably really helpful. I did still go on social media and Reddit to hear people's discussion about the book because I did want it to be a shared effort in a way. Also, I've read the scripts. Shane is fucking overthinking things every single second. If this just makes me more neurotic, it can only help. For another character, I would not do that necessarily. It would've probably been more overwhelming with more people hearing about it before we shot it, but I think it would've still looked similar. I had the assurance that whatever I did in the audition without having read the book was something that resonated with Jacob. I think he cried during one of the chemistry reads. I [thought] that was a good sign. After reading the book, and then reading discussions about the book and the character — I think it was good that it got to feel like a student film. At this level of hype, it could've only added more pressure on Connor and me, and just made it a little bit more uncomfortable.


In terms of what's next, what're you hoping for as you continue this journey? Do you know what that is at this point for you? How are you feeling about it?


	Some people talk about this show like it's just smut. I don't know if I can trust my own opinion on if I just did The Vampire Diaries or if I did Normal People. I believe in the work I did. I believe [in] what Jacob wrote. At the end of the day, I believe I have a lot more to offer. As an actor, and an actor who likes character actors, those have always been the role models from a single digit age. That's just where I'd want to go — challenging roles with auteur filmmakers is the very natural, not forced proclivity. If it actually pans out that way, I'm very appreciative. If it leads to very commercial piss and cheap fast food movies, well then, OK, I guess. Not what I envisioned, but I could still be at The Old Spaghetti Factory, so I can't be too much of a prude.

Scott will play the Scottish actor and Colman his doctor in the movie written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Simon Stone for the studio, LD Entertainment, Lucky Red, and Magnolia Mae Films.


							By

Global Business Editor


Andrew Scott (All of Us Strangers, Ripley, Pressure) and Olivia Colman (The Favourite, The Crown, The Lost Daughter) will star in Elsinore, a film based on the life of Ian Charleson, the Scottish star of the 1981 movie Chariots of Fire, whose final role was Hamlet in a celebrated London theater production. The movie comes from Canal+'s StudioCanal, LD Entertainment, Lucky Red, and Magnolia Mae Films.


Anna Marsh, CEO of StudioCanal, home of such film franchises as Paddington and such one-off hits as I Swear, and chief content officer and deputy CEO of Canal+ Group, shared the news that the studio has come on board to fully finance and distribute the film during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of her appearance during a Tuesday evening Canal+ 2026 content lineup event in Paris.

	Simon Stone (The Dig) is directing the film, produced by Andrea Occhipinti (Il Divo, Everybody Knows) of Lucky Red and Gaby Tana (Philomena, The Dig) of Magnolia Mae, along with Pete Shilaimon and Mickey Liddell of LD Entertainment, Stefano Massenzi and Carolyn Marks Blackwood. Scott is also serving as a producer. 


	The film is written by  Stephen Beresford  (Pride), who is also executive producing the project, along with Ethan Silverman, who originated it. Mike Eley (The Dig) will serve as cinematographer, Helen Scott (Living) as production designer, Mel Page (The Dig) as costume designer, with Valerio Bonelli (Darkest Hour) as editor, and Jessica Ronane (Emma) handling casting. 

	











Elsinore will start shooting in the U.K. on Jan. 5. It will also feature an ensemble of British actors to be announced closer to the start of production. 


	A synopsis describes the movie as a “powerful, deeply moving and inspiring true story of the actor Ian Charleson who faced incredible odds while preparing to give the performance of his life in Hamlet at the National Theatre in London.”


	Scott will portray Charleson, while Colman will play his doctor. Charleson is best known for his starring role as Olympic athlete and missionary Eric Liddell in Chariots of Fire, which won four Oscars, including the best film honor. He also portrayed Rev. Charlie Andrews in the 1982 eight-time Oscar winner Gandhi.


	Charleson was diagnosed with HIV in 1986 and died of AIDS-related causes in January 1990 at the age of 40. In October and November 1989, he performed Hamlet at the National Theatre. When Ian McKellen was honored with the Evening Standard Award for Best Actor for playing Iago in Othello, the actor lauded Charleson as the “perfect Hamlet.”


	“Elsinore” refers to Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, Denmark, the setting for Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. It is therefore also often called “Hamlet's Castle.”


Elsinore reunites StudioCanal with Scott following the production of Anthony Maras' Pressure, set to be released in 2026, this year. The film, produced and developed with Working Title, sees Scott star as Royal Air Force meteorologist James Stagg, who must deliver a weather report to the Allied high command, determining the feasibility of the planned D-Day. Colman most recently starred in and produced StudioCanal's Wicked Little Letters and also starred in Paddington in Peru for the studio.

	











	“This is one of the most exciting projects I've ever been involved in,” said Stone. “Stephen Beresford's screenplay is both heartbreaking and hilarious, a beautiful ode to the power of community in times of crisis. Andrew Scott is one of the greatest actors of his generation, as Ian Charleson was: it's momentous casting.”


	Marsh told THR about Elsinore that it looks at Charleson, who falls ill, but in the months leading up to his death, is given the opportunity to play “the role of his life” when he is offered the part of Hamlet at the National Theatre in London. “It is a film about ambition, art, and the quest for excellence, both on the stage and off. Andrew Scott will incarnate Charleson. I couldn't think of a better fit. And the wonderful Olivia Colman will play his doctor.”




	StudioCanal is financing Elsinore, with LD pre-buying North America. Ron Halpern, executive vp, global production, and Joe Naftalin, snior vp, global production, will oversee the project for the company. StudioCanal will release it theatrically in its territories of the U.K., France, Germany, Poland, Benelux, Australia and New Zealand, with distribution in Italy handled by Lucky Red. 


	Scott is represented by Lindy King at United Agents and Zach Kaplan and Ben Dey at CAA. Colman is represented by Lindy King and Olivia Homan at United Agents. Stone is repped by CAA, Stacey Testro International, and David Fox of Myman, Greenspan, Fox. Beresford is represented by Jessica Sykes at ITG.

Steven Spielberg is returning to the aliens-among-us grandeur of his classic films like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “War of the Worlds” with his latest event film, “Disclosure Day.” The film's title was revealed in a teaser shared online by Universal Pictures on Tuesday; the movie is set for release on June 12, 2026, with the teaser rumored to play ahead of “Avatar: Fire and Ash” this December.

The writing was on the walls (or in the skies!) about the film's first look when an ominous billboard appeared in Times Square this month showcasing a bird and the promise that “all will be disclosed.” Spielberg's latest film stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, and Colman Domingo, with a script by David Koepp. He wrote the scripts for Spielberg's “Jurassic Park,” “The Lost World,” “War of the Worlds,” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” — films that, combined, grossed more than $3 billion worldwide.

The story for “Disclosure Day” comes from Spielberg's own idea, and while the trailer showcases some apocalyptic imagery, particularly as Blunt delivers a weather forecast interrupted by disturbing extraterrestrial noises, the plot has been concealed until now. Here's Universal's written tease so far: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.”

Spielberg shoots the film with his regular director of photography, Janusz Kamiński, whose widescreen images of flares and shadows are on full display here. Birds, crop circles, and car chases abound. Oh, and the birds appear to be trying to tell us something, beyond just being an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film.

“Disclosure Day” is produced by five-time Academy Award nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (“The Fabelmans,” “West Side Story”) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. Spielberg's last feature was Best Picture nominee “The Fabelmans.”

Watch the teaser for “Disclosure Day” below. “Disclosure Day” is set for theaters from Universal Pictures on June 12, 2026. What's a movie summer without an alien blockbuster to kick it off?

	Michelle and Barack Obama were supposed to see Rob Reiner and Michele Singer the day they were killed, the former First Lady revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live Monday night.


	Reiner was a longtime activist, supporter of progressive causes, and booster of the Democratic Party, and as Obama noted, she and her husband had known the Reiners for “many, many years.” She added, “We were supposed to be seeing them that night, last night. And we got the news. Let me just say this, unlike some people, Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know.” (That seemed to be a not-so-subtle nod to President Donald Trump, who mocked Reiner after hearing the news.) 


	The Reiners were killed at their home on Sunday, Dec. 14. Their 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, was arrested later that night and eventually booked for murder. He remains in custody without bail, and a court hearing is expected to happen today.


	Along with all his peers, friends, and admirers in the entertainment world, Reiner was also mourned by many in politics, especially those on the left. Though best known for his comedy, Reiner's work often had a sharp political edge, especially his two career-defining films with Aaron Sorkin, A Few Good Men and The American President. 

	











	“What they have always been are passionate people in a time when there's not a lot of courage going on,” Obama said on Kimmel. “They were the kind of people who were ready to put their actions behind what they cared about. And they cared about their family, and they cared about this country, and they cared about fairness and equity.”

	In his own statement, Barack Obama said that all of Reiner's stories were imbued with “a deep belief in the goodness of people — and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.” He added, “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”


	Other tributes were also shared by Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Independent film has been declared dead often enough to qualify as a horror subgenre. Box office is synonymous with struggle, streamers retreated from discovery, and the festival-to-distribution pipeline feels like a straw. Everyone knows the drill: fewer buyers, slower deals, shrinking risk tolerance, and a talent pool stuck waiting for a system that isn't correcting itself.

 










At the same time, a growing cohort of filmmakers is opting out of the long march toward institutional validation. They're borrowing from the creator economy's playbook instead: start small, move fast, build community, own the means of production, and treat strategy as part of the creative process.

That's the backdrop for “Skit,” a $65,000 feature that began as an almost comically DIY proposition between a father-daughter duo — a veteran media executive-turned-media theorist and an early-career actor staring down a post-strike Hollywood. 

 










This isn't a miracle story. It's nepotism as apprenticeship, and a case study in what happens when filmmakers stop waiting for permission and start building.

What they made is less a microbudget success than a preview of where indie filmmaking may be headed next: creator brain meets indie grit, an eight-day sprint treated like a startup launch, a distribution plan engineered before anyone called “action,” and a path to a worldwide, day-and-date premiere on Tubi.

In another era, a straight-to-streaming film made for $65K would have been dismissed. Today, it looks like part of a larger power shift — one in which distribution, marketing, and even greenlights are no longer handed down, but designed from the ground up.

Evan Shapiro and Jamie Shapiro's candid, sometimes combative exchange is both blueprint and provocation for filmmakers still clinging to the old model. What follows is their unvarnished conversation about making Skit, navigating a creator-driven marketplace, and why the future of indie film may belong to those who greenlight themselves first. Let Hollywood catch up later.

EVAN SHAPIRO: I am really worried about indie movies — basically panic stricken over their future. I've worked in independent film for over 20 years: I was general manager of IFC and then president of both IFC and Sundance TV.

 










In 2006, I executive produced the Kirby Dick documentary “This Film Is Not Yet Rated,” which demonstrated the bias Hollywood and movie theater owners have against indie film, using the MPA as bag man.

Last year, I collaborated with Keri Putnam on her study of independent and documentary film which showed that, despite streamers, commissioners, and theaters all but abandoning independent cinema, there is still a huge demand among Americans for indies and documentaries — one that goes underserved as the general economics of Hollywood slip into systemic failure.

At that very moment, you, my daughter, pitched me on producing an indie movie called “Skit.”

JAMIE SHAPIRO: I moved to LA a year and a half earlier in the hopes of living out my dream as an actress, only to be met with the industry-wide strikes. Ever dramatic, I was mourning the death of my nonexistent career.

Post-strikes, Hollywood resembled one of those dinosaur dioramas right before the asteroids hit: actors scrambling for work, directors teaching workshops they don't believe in, writers pretending to “staff” on imaginary shows. Every creative I knew was stuck waiting for someone with a laminated badge to grant them permission to exist.

And that is when two of your longtime mentees, Des Lombardo and Badr Mastrouq, brought you their script — with me conveniently attached as producer and star.

 










You had been coaching me (aka screaming at me) to take control of my career now, or I'd be at risk of waiting tables at a hipster Silverlake restaurant for the rest of my life (or worse, living at home with you and Mom).

So when Des, Badr, and I brought you this project with a mid-five-figure budget, you agreed. And then you texted me budget spreadsheets, demanding we drive toward production far faster than any of us had originally planned.

EVAN: Simultaneously, I had been writing and speaking about the rise of the creator economy — how it was becoming the gravitational center of global culture, andhow, if they so choose, producers and publishers could and should become creators themselves.

Which is why I urged (aka forced) the creative team of “Skit” to keep the budget super low and lean, while still maintaining a premium, professional mindset in making the movie.

JAMIE: “Skit” became our collective crash course in what happens when you treat a film like a creator project.

We ran the entire production like a DIY startup: casting brilliant, up-and-coming actors and comedians who hadn't yet gotten the roles they deserve; utilizing a SAG micro-budget contract (which feels like the only part of Hollywood tethered to the current media reality); and embarking on a whirlwind eight-day shoot that took years off our lives.

 










It resulted in a finished feature less than four months after greenlight and a movie that actually feels alive. It was creator-brain-meets-indie-film-grit: make it small, make it sharp, and make it now, not in five years when the industry finally decides creativity is back in style.

EVAN: As we finished the film, we started collaborating with BBC Studios on content about their fandom-first business model and creator mindset.

I was speaking to Anjali Sud, CEO of Tubi, about their burgeoning creator strategy, and we started partnering with Alan D'Escragnolle, CEO of Filmhub, on a slate of thought-leadership initiatives. I also fell down the rabbit hole of #filmtok.

All of this helped me solidify a distribution strategy for Skit built entirely on the foundation of the creator economy.

JAMIE: The wild part is how quickly that creator theme boomeranged back at us in real time. I met Anjali Sud (on whom I have an insane career crush) at a Fordham Business School event where you were interviewing her, and I all but ambushed her with: “Hi, I love your whole thing, please continue reinventing streaming so people like me don't starve.”

Then at StreamTV in Denver I met Sam Harowitz, head of content acquisitions at Tubi, who spoke about the future of content like he was reading prophecy off a stone tablet. It felt like everyone outside the traditional film bubble was saying the same thing: “Creators are the new Hollywood.”

 










EVAN: So we built a fully fleshed-out meta marketing and community strategy. I took it to our friends at Filmhub over a sushi dinner.

We partnered with the amazing PR team at FerenComm. Then we went to Tubi, where Sam introduced us to Rich Bloom — who Anjali had just brought on board to build out their creator platform — and where Filmhub already had a strong content partnership.

While we already had a good relationship with Tubi, the partnership with Filmhub was crucial. It allowed Tubi to come on board without crafting a one-off deal for a single tiny indie film from smaller creators.

Instead, we were able to use existing infrastructure to move quickly and make a deal for an exclusive premiere on the platform.

JAMIE: I remember you calling me to break the good news — and you being annoyingly right about, “if you want to make stuff… blah blah blah.”

EVAN: I believe the end of that is this: First, you need to understand the market for your stuff.Then build a holistic plan that fits that market. Then go make your stuff, with a budget and timeline that lets you take advantage of the market — before the market changes again.

Unfortunately, making films or TV series isn't only about the art. It's not just camera angles and narrative structure. Filmmakers need to be strategists, marketers, press agents, and dealmakers. I know that sounds daunting, but when artists think beyond the art and focus on the business part of show business, they can make things happen.

 










What's more, there are people on the other side of the business waiting and willing to work with them.

JAMIE: That's been the most surprising part of this process. Filmhub and Tubi were incredibly chill — no labyrinthine contracts, no “maybe in Q4 of 2031” release windows. Just: yes, let's do it, and here's how.

EVAN: But that's because we came in with everything already figured out. We made it easy for them to say yes.

As Rich Bloom said on our podcast: Yes, it was a really good film; we had the right expectations; the project perfectly matched their strategy; we came to the table with an existing partner; and we arrived with a fully fleshed-out marketing plan. That's how we got a worldwide, day-and-date premiere for a $65,000 film shot in eight days, one year after we wrapped.

JAMIE: It almost made me suspicious, honestly. But the reality is that by understanding our audience — and the needs of potential buyers — we found genuinely good partners who believe indie doesn't mean insignificant.

EVAN: So what do you think this experiment has taught us?

JAMIE: “Skit” taught me that the old-school indie philosophy of “just start making stuff” isn't quaint nostalgia. It's more relevant now, in the creator economy, than at any other point in film history. It's not easy, but there are more tools and more information available than ever before.

 










I've learned that a young artist who wants to work needs to greenlight themself — make the thing in a way they can actually afford.

EVAN: So what's next?

JAMIE: First, we need to get everyone to watch “Skit.” Next, my collaborators and I are about to shoot “BFA,” a pilot based on our experiences in NYU's theater program.

We saved up, we're spending our own money, and we're calling in a lot of favors to shoot it ourselves in five days. Then we're releasing it on YouTube — an idea I would have rejected out of hand before this experience.

EVAN: It's ironic, yes: the boomer mentality is a real blocker to the transformation media needs. But Gen Z artists in film schools are often stuck in those same ruts.

Young filmmakers still cling to traditional distribution — festivals, theaters, gatekeepers — because of a romantic Hollywood fantasy we were all raised on. This is a learned delusion. Film schools still preach it, partly because the people teaching haven't made a movie since dial-up internet, and partly because it's easier to teach submission than subversion.

I loved making “Skit” with you because it's timely and fresh — but also because it's a real case study for the next generation of indie filmmakers.

JAMIE: I feel like you should have said “because you love me” or something. But that's fine.

 










Making “Skit” didn't just give me a film. It gave me a blueprint. Stop waiting. Stop hoping. Stop emailing the same manager for eight months. Develop your art. Then develop the plan to make it. Then develop the plan to get it seen.

“Skit” showed me that the future belongs to the artists who build the thing first — and let Hollywood catch up later.

EVAN: I do love you, you know.

JAMIE: Whatever. Too late now.

“Skit” is now available to stream for free on Tubi, Amazon, Apple TV, Relay, Roku, and YouTube Movies & TV.

5. What the WBD Deal Tells Us About Netflix, YouTube, Games, and Short-Run Series by Jen Topping

Filmmakers lamenting the increased consolidation of Hollywood often take solace in the idea that the old industry is dying and the real opportunity growth lies in short form videos and other new media. But what if traditional industry players start moving into those spaces too? This article makes the case that Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery has as much to do with competing against YouTube as anything else — and explores what that means for creators.4. Doorways Into a Film by Tomas Leach

The Hidden Potential in Streaming's Enshittification by Max Cea
 










Any silver linings that we can find in the current entertainment industry should be cherished. Here, newsletter favorite Max Cea makes the case that the declining quality of streaming services could end up being the factor that nudges audiences back towards paying for individual films in ways that benefit artists, whether that's in theaters or on boutique services.2. Stop Apologizing for Being Too Many Things at Once by Maris Lidaka

It used to be a widely accepted best practice that specializing early was a reliable path to forging a career in the film industry. But while young professionals with an interest in a variety of departments were told to pick a lane, this article makes the case that the once-maligned jack-of-all-trades mentality has now become an advantage.1. Mary Sloppins by Travis Clark

Disney's deal with OpenAI nauseated many film purists, but are the specifics of the licensing agreement really that bad? Once you get past the initial visceral reaction about some of pop culture's most iconic characters teaming up with the company behind ChatGPT, Clark argues that the notion of a controlled licensing agreement that doesn't use the likenesses or voices of real people and gives the copyright holder some degree of control might be a repeatable path forward.

James Cameron is a master of sequels, having made three of the best part-two movies of the blockbuster era. He's so good, in fact, that those second installments often feel complete without a third (and if someone else makes a third anyway, maybe even more so). This means that Avatar: Fire And Ash is actually the first threequel of his 40-year career. It's also his first follow-up to trail its predecessor within a normal sequel timeframe—and, for that matter, the quickest turnaround for any Cameron film since True Lies emerged almost exactly three years after Terminator 2. Maybe that's why Fire And Ash, despite some lingering momentousness in the relatively scarce Avatar series, carries the constant, looming threat that it will feel something like a normal sequel. Not a long-awaited event, not a radical expansion or re-envisioning of its predecessor, not even Cameron's first film of the decade. Just another spectacular, near-ceaselessly entertaining fantasy epic that shames 90% of its big-ticket competition. You know, one of those.

It's an appropriately rarified problem for a repeated engineer of the “most expensive movie ever made.” As frustrating as it may have been to wait a decade-plus between Cameron's fiction films, the earlier Avatar sequel The Way Of Water took advantage of that gap, catching up with human-turned-Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his Na'vi wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) years after the end of the first film. All of a sudden, with the addition of four Sully children, the movie was about a family of six—plus Pandora's favorite son-in-law Spider (Jack Champion), a human who aspires to roll with the Na'vi full-time. Fire And Ash, meanwhile, finds the family shortly after the death of eldest son Neteyam in Water's climactic battle. Neytiri is still in her ritual grieving period, and her vengeful anger strains her marriage to Jake, as well as her patience for Spider's continued presence.

Because Spider requires special oxygen masks to breathe the alien atmosphere, Jake and Neytiri insist that he return to the friendly human scientists maintaining a base on Pandora, over the protests of their kids Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Kiri (Sigourney Weaver, again playing a teenager through the magic of motion capture), and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss). The family decides to accompany Spider on his journey back, via airships that combine seafaring vessels and horsedrawn carriages with a veiny, organic-looking hot-air balloon technology. They're quickly attacked by another, more aggressive Na'vi tribe led by the literally fiery Varang (Oona Chaplin); the family is separated, pursued by both Varang and that pesky Quaritch (Stephen Lang), the ex-human colonel whose consciousness has been transferred to a Na'vi body, providing an ongoing dark mirror to Jake's metamorphosis. In classic '90s Batman-villain style, Varang and Quaritch decide they may be of use to each other. Varang holds no particular grudge against Jake and Neytiri, but she sure as hell isn't happy with their beloved goddess Eywa, and wants to get her hands on what other Na'vi will not permit: firearms.

There's more plot than that, too, some of which more closely rehashes material from the first two films—Water in particular, to the point where it's easy to wonder whether some sequel material was dragged and dropped from the second movie into the third during their lengthy gestation period. The large cast, multiple Na'vi tribes, and tripled bad guys (the regular “sky people”—the humans who still want to ravage Pandora for its various natural resources—are also still hanging around) deviate Fire And Ash from the counterintuitive but highly effective structure of the first two movies. In both of those, Cameron spends a surprising amount of time luxuriating in the exploration of new fantasy environments, just as he explores so much of the Titanic well before the ship his the iceberg. The new movie parcels out action sequences at a more typical epic-blockbuster clip. This oddly makes the expansive runtime feel longer than the other two, even though it only exceeds them by a matter of minutes and may be the most purely action-packed of the three.

Then again, it's hard to complain that Cameron serves up slam-bang set pieces at regular intervals. That early airship attack does the neat trick of introducing the fearsome, red-painted Varang through action so dynamic and excitingly choreographed that it should send the airship-fixated Kevin Feige into the fetal position. Even the most familiar of later sequences, a massive mash-up of the air battle from the first movie and the sea battle from the second, adds great new details: majestically murderous new sea creatures, or a smaller-scale fight scene that knocks its participants from floating rock to floating rock.

As is usually the case with Cameron, all of this potentially cacophonous action is easy to follow. It's a little trickier to track all of the major characters' emotional journeys, especially with the irrepressible Spider elbowing his way into the family. As Fire And Ash goes on, it feels increasingly unsure of just how much of a wrap-up this will be—or even what's on the table for story threads that can be wrapped up, versus what will be left as the kind of dangling (or are they frayed?) threads that, until the Avatar sequels, rarely had a place in Cameron's fantastical worlds. As a result, some of the most intriguing new wrinkles in this film, primarily involving Quaritch's unlikely and sometimes downright hallucinatory alliance with Varang, fail to develop into full-fledged subplots. Quaritch's Dark Sully act in particular feels like it could be excavated further, especially in a series that sometimes wants to have its colonialism and vanquish it, too.

In a sense, Cameron is a victim of his own success. The Avatar movies are so lushly overgrown with visual detail, and draw such surprisingly nuanced and sensitive motion-capture performances from its human cast, that any momentary storytelling hiccup can feel like a glitch in the machine. Fire And Ash is terrific entertainment that occasionally gives the impression of well-appointed vamping; it's almost enough to wonder if all the meticulous writer's-room blueprinting of two-to-four Avatar sequels might have done as much harm as good. Viewers who just long for more time in Pandora are in luck: Cameron may not see a way out himself.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	Much of the political media was chattering about a newly Vanity Fair piece on Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who not only gave a rare interview to writer Chris Whipple but some very candid assessments of the personalities in Trump 2.0.


	The profile accompanied a Vanity Fair photo shoot, from Christopher Anderson, of members of the Trump team, marking full cooperation with a mainstream media outlet of the type that the president often attacks.


	In a series of interviews, Wiles talked of growing up with her father, sportscaster Pat Summerall, who was an alcoholic who later got sober.

	“Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I'm going to say,” Wiles told Vanity Fair. “But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink. And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.”


	Trump does not drink, but Wiles said that he has an “alcoholic's personality,” an operates with a view that “there's nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”


	In other parts of her interviews with Whipple, Wiles said that Vance has been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.” She also said that Elon Musk is an “odd, odd duck,” and referred to his ketamine use. 


	She also said that she was “aghast” when Musk shut down USAID, the foreign aid organization. 


	“Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,” Wiles said. “And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.”


	Musk left the White House in May and had a very public falling out with Trump.


	Wiles also criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi over her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.


	“I think she completely whiffed on appreciating that that was the very targeted group that cared about this,” Wiles said, per Whipple's interview. “First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk. There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.”

	











	But Wiles said that she read through what she referred to as the “Epstein file,” and while Trump is named, “he's not in the file doing anything awful.”


	Wiles posted on X on Tuesday, “The article published early this morning is a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history. Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.”

I don't think Vanity Fair needs to paint Donald Trump as chaotic when we can all see it for ourselves every day through his own words and actions. The man is a chaos agent.

Somebody is going to have a lot of free time in 2026.

When your own chief of staff says this… you know you're a fascist dictator

He's not doing anything awful yea just by the way he acts now you can tell that's a lie he's a narcissist and anybody that voted for him I bet y'all are regretting it and he was behind the capital incident everything about him is awful taking away people food stamps to get what he wants that is awful all while remodeling the ballroom something that was not necessary

Yeah… she's getting let go after this. Why did she give this interview!?

Even after all this time, the simple fact of it still boggles my mind: Every single film James Cameron has made over the last 40 years represents some kind of evolutionary paradigm shift for blockbuster cinema. 

“The Abyss” gave us the first “photorealistic” computer-generated character, while “Terminator 2” pioneered advanced morphing effects and the far more extensive use of CGI. “Titanic” seamlessly blended digital assets with large-scale practical sets in order to create what's still the most transportive disaster movie ever made, while “Avatar” and 2022's “The Way of Water” took performance-capture technology to such extraordinary new heights — and depths — that it feels like the rest of Hollywood is lagging several generations behind. Hell, even “True Lies” could be considered a game-changer for its innovative composite work and next-gen approach to cartoonishly virulent anti-Arab racism (9/11 was still almost a decade away, but Big Jim has always been ahead of the curve!).

Which is all to say how bizarre it is to watch a James Cameron new movie that feels like something you've already seen before. That notion seemed like a distinct possibility when it was first announced that he was going to be directing four “Avatar” sequels, but it didn't prepare me for the reality of watching one of cinema's greatest explorers walk in circles for three hours, even if Cameron — being Cameron — naturally finds a way to make that journey feel novel and invigorating at times. 

 










But “Avatar: Fire and Ash” isn't just more of the same, it's also a significant amount less. 

Not only does the third installment of the “Avatar” saga lack the unprecedented spectacle of its predecessors (the second of which was somehow even more jaw-dropping than the first), it also lacks the relative newness of their storytelling. Whereas the first movie effectively camouflaged its cliches amid the uncharted planet of Pandora, and the second extrapolated the franchise's settler-adoption space fantasy into a hyper-emotive aquatic fable about the destructive nature of humanity's survival instinct, “Fire and Ash” largely devotes itself to sifting through the ruins of a world that Cameron seems half-ready to leave behind and sitting with the fallout of the series' previous battles. That wouldn't be a weakness in and of itself, but his archetypical characters weren't built to carry a “Lawrence of Arabia”-sized epic that hinges on the nuances of their love, grief, and neuroses. Spider doesn't even have a shirt, let alone the layers required for us to care about his daddy issues. 

At heart, “Fire and Ash” is a story about how people, in the broadest sense of the word, reconstitute themselves in the aftermath of war and its attendant losses. In other words, the first “Avatar” film that fails to meaningfully iterate on the premise of its franchise's is ironically preoccupied with our power to change, a tension that Cameron struggles to resolve — and indeed makes a fair bit worse — by repeating so many of the same action beats from “The Way of Water.” 

 










As might be expected of a movie that was initially conceived as the second half of the previous one (and could easily have been marketed as “The Way of Water Part II” had it been finished in time for Christmas 2023), “Fire and Ash” picks up where the first “Avatar” sequel left off. Jake Sully's family — or what's left of it — continue to mourn the cost of their latest and most devastating skirmish with the colonist forces of the Resources Development Administration, in which Jake's son Neteyam was killed by the colonist “Sky People.”

Still embedded with the Metkayina Clan in the turquoise reefs of Pandora, the Sullys each embrace their own forms of grief. Jake (Sam Worthington), who was a Marine before his consciousness was transferred into the body of a giant blue alien, retreats into a mission-oriented state of mind, while his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) seethes at the dreadlocked white human child their family has raised as one of their own (Jack Champion), in no small part because Spider's father is the evil “recombinant” who murdered Neteyam (Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, both men having the time of their lives as a towering extra-terrestrial horndog). 

Now the eldest of the Sully kids, Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) sulks with survivor's guilt, while teenage adoptee Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) questions her seemingly immaculate conception while deepening her connection to the all-knowing nature goddess Eywa. Jake and Neytiri's biological daughter Tuktirey (Trinity Bliss) is also there, a fact that Cameron seems to be remembering in real-time whenever she finds her way into the frame. But it's Spider who's firmly at the center of the action here, as his inability to breathe the Pandoran air without a mask compels Jake and his family to escort him back to the safety of the High Camp, where all of our human scientist friends from the first “Avatar” are still going strong. 

 










While that decision effectively amounts to the Sully clan losing another son (Kiri is extra upset about it, as she empathizes with Spider's outsider status), Jake rationalizes it as a necessary sacrifice to heal the cracks in his family — a family that he's always likened to a fortress. Alas, as anyone who's ever played a JRPG might expect of a journey aboard a massive flying galleon, the Sullys' convoy is attacked in the sky, and their family is scattered into a small handful of different factions that spend the rest of the movie trying to reunite. The ambush is delivered courtesy of the Mangkwan Clan, a cult of kamikaze hedonists who rejected Eywa after a volcano reduced their corner of Pandora to ash, but the RDA is happy to seize on the chaos and launch their final attack on the Metkayina's oceanic stronghold. 

The plot thickens from there, especially once the RDA finds evidence that humans might be able to breathe on Pandora after all (a discovery which could make the planet a viable new home for our species), but Cameron would much rather move the franchise inward than forward. That's an admirable decision on its face, and while it's hard not to be severely disappointed by the pat and self-evident answers we're given to the franchise's most intriguing mysteries, I can't help but support Cameron's willingness to yada yada yada over pieces of lore as soon as they've fulfilled their character-driven function (Eywa is a conveniently unknowable scapegoat, and returning co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver are happy to take full advantage of that). 

 










The problem is that these characters are seldom as intriguing as the mythology that Cameron has used to contextualize them, and — like Spider without a mask on — they begin to suffocate the moment they're forced to survive on their own. Weird and wonderful as it will always be to watch Sigourney Weaver so believably inhabit the body of a teenage alien, “Fire and Ash” has nothing of substance to add to Kiri's vision quest. The same could be said about the strained relationship between Lo'ak and Jake, or the franchise's continued fixation on stress-testing the limitations of found family, to which it applies more pressure than ever when Quaritch issues a “give us Spider and we'll stop trying to kill all the Na'vi” ultimatum. 

And speaking of Spider, no other character so epitomizes how “Fire and Ash” spends most of its time belaboring the aspects from the previous movie that worked so well in small doses. As a glorified bargaining chip in “The Way of Water,” Jack Champion's interstellar army brat was a goofy manifestation of Cameron's most wooden instincts as a writer, his stunted manchild energy a harmless throwback to earlier kid heroes like Rebecca Jorden and John Connor. 

As a — or maybe even the — central figure in this new installment, Spider is basically a surfer-coded Jar Jar Binks. Even if you, like me, find Cameron's Reagan-era bro-speak to be more of a feature than a bug, and even if you, like me, are predisposed to laugh at the part in “Fire and Ash” where Spider guilelessly rocks up next to a 22nd century space whale and shouts, “You're the man, Payakan!,” you might struggle to lock into the later and more harrowing scene where Jake Sully threatens to sacrifice his adopted son to the gods. 

 










Also, it brings me no pleasure to report that Payakan is very much not the man anymore, as the exiled Tulkan, used with precision to unlock oceans of feeling in “The Way of Water,” is wasted here on an enervating “courtroom” subplot that entrusts far too much of this movie to the power of Papyrus subtitles. Like so much of “Fire and Ash,” Payakan's urgent plea for his species to abandon their pacifist ways and fight back against the Sky People keys into Cameron's all too relevant fascination with the various ways that communities reconfigure themselves in response to annihilation. Complicating his tendency to valorize Jake Sully's willingness to realign his allegiances in the face of lived experience, and to vilify Quaritch for continuing to other the Na'vi even after essentially becoming one of them himself, Cameron defines the Mangkwan Clan by how radically they altered their principles in response to the catastrophe that destroyed their home. The “Ash People” don't respect the balance that Eywa demands between ethos and elasticity, and so our heroes must fight them to the death. 

The Mangkwan Clan are one of the only new elements introduced in “Fire and Ash,” and are unsurprisingly responsible for all of the most exciting elements of the movie. Chief among those elements, and chief among the Mangkwan themselves, is a sky-scraping cosmic domme by the name of Varang (Oona Chaplin, going all out), who erupts into this movie with a head full of fire and a power kink that literally brings Quaritch to his knees. An embittered warrior shaman who dresses like an enraged Dilophosaurus and gets off on using her neural queue to force other Na'vi to serve her commands (the sexual imagery here will ripple across Tumblr for decades to come), Varang is both an interesting challenge to Jake's Eywa-loving family and an incredible foil for Quaritch's ongoing adventures in cross-species hybridization. 

 










Cameron might ignore the fact that Quaritch is basically an immortal being who wouldn't remember any of this stuff if he died again, but he sure has fun with the fact that Varang introduces the character to a degree of mutability that Quaritch never allowed before. There's more than a little whiff of Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw to how fast a fascist like Quaritch admits to fetishizing the same population he exists to destroy, and Lang — like Sean Penn — takes giddy advantage of the opportunity this movie gives him to play around with that. The extent to which getting freaky with Varang does, and does not, change who Quaritch is at heart represents the most gripping and detailed character work that “Fire and Ash” has to offer, even if those nuances feel like a distant memory by the time Cameron devotes the story's final act to a dull rerun of the big battle from “The Way of Water.”

Which unavoidably brings us to the ultimate sin of this movie, which is that “Fire and Ash,” as a blockbuster spectacle, fails to meet the unreasonably high standard that James Cameron has set for himself — the unreasonably high standard by which he demands to be judged. 

The action is clean, massive, and staged at a level several cuts above Hollywood's usual CGI slopfests, but only the “Mad Max”-like introduction of the Mangkwan raiders sparks the same visceral excitement that made the last acts of the previous two movies so indelible. There isn't a single beat here that hits with the same fist-pumping force of the Na'vi shooting giant arrows at the RDA forces in mid-air, or Payakan ripping the arm off one of the bad guys who's come to attack the reef. In fact, that same guy is back for seconds, and — in a failing that feels unprecedented in the history of Cameron's filmography — his inevitable demise lands with a half-hearted whimper. So too does everything else in the grand finale, which smacks of obligation where even the least ambitious setpieces in his previous films were drunk with opportunity. 

 










There are certainly things to see here (the Wind Traders' air ship is a majestic vision of floating tentacles, and the sight of Edie Falco operating an “Aliens”-like mechanical exoskeleton is… something), and even the worst “Avatar” movie makes for an undeniable argument on behalf of the theatrical experience (though my patience for high frame rates is at an all-time low). But this one shrugs its way to the finish line with a sense that it doesn't excite its creator in the same way that it used to — that Cameron needs the novelty this film is missing even more than we do. 

I know that Cameron has committed himself to another two sequels, and now I know why he's starting to hedge about whether or not he wants to direct them himself; even the most orgiastic moments in “Fire and Ash” left me feeling like he's ready to come back down to Earth. 

20th Century Studios will release “Avatar: Fire and Ash” in theaters on Friday, December 19.

	After testing the waters earlier this year at New York's Gramercy Theatre, Jesse Malin is relaunching his Silver Manhattan stage show in full force in February, setting up shop five nights a week at a brand-new venue. The 90-minute production, part-concert and part-play, will take up residency at the Bowery Palace, the Lower East Side club formerly known as Bowery Electric. After the rock room closes at the end of January, it'll be converted into a 100-seat theater and venue.


	“Silver Manhattan is the most personal thing I've ever done on stage,” Malin said in a statement. “I want to run it in a smaller theater, and look into the eyes of everyone in the room. I have so much history on the Bowery — I played CBGB's as a kid, and grew up in the neighborhood. My grandfather sold liquor to the bars up and down the Bowery. It's nice to go back to the scene of the crime. There are a lot of beautiful ghosts and spirits on this sacred ground.”


	Malin is a fixture of the New York rock, punk, and hardcore scene, as both a solo artist and with his former bands Heart Attack and D Generation. In 2023, the singer suffered a spinal stroke that paralyzed him from the waist down.

	He describes Silver Manhattan as “his love letter to New York,” as well as a tale of resilience. “Survival is a creative act,” Malin says.

	Performances of the show, written by Malin with Lauren Ludwig, will run Wednesday through Sunday, beginning Feb. 18 and stretching through March 29. Tickets are on sale now via Ticketmaster. Silver Manhattan is produced by Tony-nominated ArKtype / Tommy Kriegsmann and David Bason, and directed by Ellie Heyman. Justin Craig (Stereophonic) and Malin's longtime bandmate Derek Cruz are music directors.

	











	Malin will release his first book, Almost Grown: A New York Memoir, in April.

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The original 2009 Avatar sits on top of the box office heap having made $2.9 billion, nominated for 10 Oscars including Best Picture and winning three. It took 13 years to get the second edition, 2022's Avatar: The Way of Water, but that gap was barely felt, the sequel taking in $2.3 billion and also nominated for Best Picture while again winning for its spectacular visual effects. Avatar is the highest-grossing movie of all time, The Way of Water is the third-highest grosser. Cameron's Titanic is up there too, now in fourth place. Of course, it would be hard to do a sequel to that movie which won a record-tying 11 Oscars — the ship sank. But with the endlessly fertile and fascinating world of Pandora, the landscape and scope seems right for follow-ups and so now we have the third Avatar entry, Avatar: Fire And Ash, and it turns out to be nothing less than an intense 3-hour and 17-minute kickass epic that may be the bluest war film ever made.

	











	This edition ratchets up the action to new heights picking up the story just a few beats after Way of Water's aquatic battle ended with the defeat of Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and the human-led Resources Development Administration which are now regrouping for its eventual goal of making Pandora habitable for the people of Earth, who have destroyed through sheer neglect their own planet and seek to take over this one if they can capture the right elements for human survival. The storyline sees the Na'vi tribe known as Omatikaya but now turned Metkayina, where the Sully family are temporarily hanging with that mellow reef clan. They are also grieving the loss of brave son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), who died in that final battle.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Our main principal warrior Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), who was once a human Marine but now firmly with the Na'vi, is basically readying to go to war. It is what he knows. Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) is at an emotional breaking point, the loss of their son tugging at her heart, and her hatred for all humans making life difficult for their adopted human boy Spider (Jack Champion), freely living with them and at one with them, but still conflicted over his previous life which happens to be as the son of Quaritch. He of course is Pandora Enemy No. 1 and about to have a second act after being eliminated in his human version and now is a Recom or Recombinarts, which makes him a blend of Na'vi and human in order to regenerate and fight another day in the anti-human environment. That time is now and it becomes complex for Spider.


	Jake is leading the clan to High Camp where the RDA is in order to turn Spider in, the arrangement no longer working for them, especially Neytiri, but he is tight with the younger members, notably Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), who you might recall is the 14-year-old Na'vi version of the avatar of Grace Augustine, who ran the Avatar division of RDA. Also key to the gut-wrenching events taking place in this edition is Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), who is feeling tremendous guilt over the death of Neteyam. Back from the Metkayina clan is leader Tonowari (Cliff Curtis), plus his wife Ronal (Kate Winslet) still in personality conflicts and jealousies with Neytiri. New to the storyline, and perhaps the best scene stealer of all, is Varang, the self-made “queen” of the Ash People, a clan that formerly was peaceful but turned angry and vengeful after a volcano wiped out their homeland, now strewn with ash, as are all its inhabitants. Spanish actress Oona Chaplin plays her to the hilt, with grace of movement and purpose as she and her tribe become major threats to the Na'vi which sees Jake fighting on multiple fronts with the Ash and the RDA, and ultimate villain Quaritch.


	Cameron knows how to do spectacle better than anyone, and this Avatar builds out its worlds to such a high degree I would dare to say you could put the first two films together and it still wouldn't add up to the fierce levels and magnitude of the fight in this one. Compared to The Way of Water, this version has far more land action although rest assured, the fan-favorite Tolkuns seafaring whales are back in action when you need them most.


	This is what they used to call in Hollywood a true epic, taking place in the sky, water and land in a visual knockout like you rarely see on this level these days. Its secret sauce however is our emotional connection through the Sully family. They are again the hook, and Cameron and co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver know you have to deliver a compelling family story to keep this all from drowning in too much fire and water. It is a credit to the actors, most having to do performance capture and somehow making us feel for them throughout. Led by exceptional turns again from Worthington and Saldaña, along with standouts Dalton and Champion, plus of course Weaver (convincing even as a 14 year old), there is also room for greater character development than before from Lang, who masters the villainry of Colonel Quaritch in his new guise, but also manages a three-dimensional relationship with Spider that feels authentic. Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement and Giovanni Ribisi also get their moments on the human side of things.

	











	With truly dazzling production elements all around this is a movie hard to resist, even if you think you have already seen what wonders Cameron has in store for this franchise. He isn't committing firmly to the hoped for and scripted fourth and fifth films in the Avatar universe until he sees how this one performs, but my guess is people are gonna go more than once.


	Producers are Cameron and the late Jon Landau, to whom the film is rightly dedicated.

Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver and Kate Winslet head back to the future to continue the Pandoran struggle against genocidal colonists from Earth.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If the title One Battle After Another weren't already taken, it might be a tidy fit for the third installment of James Cameron's sprawling “Blue Man Group” sci-fi adventure, Avatar: Fire and Ash. Yes, the movie offers gargantuan-scale spectacle, imposing technological wizardry and virtually nonstop action involving over-qualified and mostly unrecognizable actors in motion-capture suits. But it's easily the most repetitious entry in the big-screen series, with a been-there, bought-the-T-shirt fatigue that's hard to ignore.


	That leaves way too much time over the movie's ass-numbing three-and-a-quarter hours to wince at the risible dialogue coming from the mouths of Na'vi folk on the distant moon, Pandora. Or to stew in envy over their absence of body fat.

The Bottom Line

	
	Enough with the Modigliani Smurfs already.

									Rated PG-13,
								3 hours 17 minutes			






	The 13-year gap between Avatar and its first sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water, allowed time for a renewed sense of awe at the scope of Cameron's bio-diverse worldbuilding, enhanced by the introduction of a new clan, new creatures and a distinctive new environment. The third movie arrives just three years after its immediate predecessor — and in narrative terms, a few weeks after the events of that film — with the novelty now wearing thin.


	Firstly, it's not a great idea in a film with such an epic run time to have a character urgently shouting, “I've gotta take a leak!” To be fair, it's understandable given that the full bladder belongs to human dude Spider (Jack Champion), revealed in The Way of Water to be the son of vicious Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), sired before the latter was killed and transformed into a new breed of hybrid human/Na'vi soldier. To my knowledge, Spider never does get to pee, unless he just goes in the Metkayina Clan's bioluminescent aquatic ecosystem, like some filthy kid at the pool.

	











	I suppose given his ex-Marine, pre-avatar origins, we can even buy Quaritch's nemesis Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) greeting his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) when she ignores instructions to stay home and watch the kids during a skirmish, instead leaping into the fray with her killer archery skills: “Baby, I don't know whether to kiss you or yell at you!” But that doesn't make it sound any less silly, especially with Worthington's Australian accent.


	And would a young Na'vi really be checking in after a fiery clash by asking his comrade in arms, “Bro, you good?” Surely this biologically and spiritually advanced civilization should have evolved beyond skateboarder vernacular?


	All due respect to a groundbreaking franchise that has thus far raked in over $5.2 billion in theatrical grosses and remains the gold standard for the large-format 3D viewing experience, but Fire and Ash is sound and fury signifying nothing. Or at least nothing excitingly new. (Now might be a good time to clarify that I enjoyed the first two movies.) In the absence of fresh narrative inspiration, Cameron and co-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver simply pile on the lore and multiply the clashes, to numbing rather than invigorating effect.


	Even the Darth Vader/Luke factor of honorary Na'vi Spider's conflicted feelings for his hard-ass father on the side of the Military Industrial Complex oppressor — known as the RDA, or Resources Development Administration, led by Edie Falco's stiff-limbed and humorless General Frances Ardmore — goes to few places not already explored in The Way of Water.

	











	Having been forced by the human invaders to flee the lush green forest home of the Omaticaya people, Jake, Neytiri and their family continue to live among the reefs and islands of the Metkayina clan, headed by tribal chief Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his pregnant wife Ronal (Kate Winslet). But the loss of Jake and Neytiri's first-born son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) remains an open wound for the family, especially for his impulsive brother Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), who blames himself. 


	When Quaritch resurfaces with a personal vendetta, Jake refuses to take a knife to a gun fight, instead loading up on military weapons salvaged from the last “Sky People” assault, which goes against the traditional Na'vi way. The women argue that the divine entity Eywa will provide, blathering on about having faith in “the Great Mother's plan.” But they haven't seen Edie Falco crab-walking in an industrial-grade exoskeleton suit.


	Jake, for one, is not buying the Eywa assurance; he has too much at stake protecting his wife, their surviving children Lo'ak and tween sister Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), as well as adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), the offspring of scientist Grace Augustine's avatar body, who develops a direct line to Eywa, even if she can't yet control it. How much you invest in all that will depend on how much you care about moon dwellers plugging their braids into nature's light sockets.


	When the nomadic Wind Traders led by Peylak (David Thewlis) drop by in their monster jellyfish-powered airships with Amazon packages, Jake decides Spider needs to be sent back with them to the science research facility to live with his fellow humans. His best pal Kiri is devastated but Neytiri, whose hatred of humans has intensified since Neteyam's killing, insists Spider will never be one of them so has to go.

	











	Before the Sully family can get him back to the base, a savage air attack rains down on Metkayina territory. Only this time it's not humans but the barbarian Mangkwan Clan, firebombing the Wind Traders' vessels and laying siege to the peaceful community below. Their leader is bad-bitch warrior Varang (Oona Chaplin), who ululates in triumph every time she “scalps” another Na'vi — which means hacking off the ponytails that are their power source, like Ariana Grande's topknot.


	The Mangkwan, aka Ash People, are a bunch of godless warmongers who basically turned on Eywa when a volcano reduced their homeland to barren ash. Varang is their evil queen. She wears a black and red feathered headdress, a micro-kini and stripes of red war paint over what looks like full-body Kiehl's Mud Mask, while swooping around on a scary dragon called a Nightwraith.


	When she starts demanding to be taught how to “make thunder,” she's not talking about rumbling flatulence, even if that might describe much of the action. Instead, she means advanced military firepower. Varang teams up with Quaritch and gets a whole arsenal of weaponry at her disposal, which is bad news for the Sullys, the Metkayina and the highly intelligent whale-like Tulkun that inhabit the oceans, especially as their annual shallow-water “calf communion” approaches.


	Varang is the most interesting new addition here, and Chaplin plays her as a bloodthirsty sorceress, her yellow eyes aflame with rage as she shrieks about ripping out hearts. But the writers give her no complexity beyond being a relentless WMD. She and Neytiri hiss at each other like territorial cats whenever they get close. But the promised Na'vi-on-Na'vi chick action gets sidelined when the injured Ronal goes into labor, with poor Winslet forced to utter the lament of mothers since the dawn of time: “I am dying, but first I will push out this baby.” You got this, girl!

	











	The escalating chaos is so littered with talk of Na'vi arcana, exotic Pandoran creatures and military jargon, that keeping up with the over-mythologized videogame plotting becomes more of a chore than a challenge. Not that narrative deficiencies are likely to hurt the movie's box office or keep the geek faithful away. The battles may become routinely episodic, but there are plenty of them, which might be all many audiences care about seeing through their 3D glasses.


	In the first two films, the sincerity, respect and sheer wonderment with which Cameron captured the Avatar world — and the faith that Indigenous traditions and the purity, spirituality and balance of nature could prevail over rampaging human destruction and military technology — was transporting enough to overcome the dumb dialogue. Here, it all starts to sound like empty bluster, retreading the same ground with just one new face that makes an impression. There's certainly nothing in the story to justify the bloated run time.


	The knowledge that Cameron has at least two more of these in the works might be great for the New Zealand economy — not so much for anyone who cares about original movies. Great Mother, save us.

Angelina Jolie has nothing to hide. The star, whose personal life has often made headlines, is now opening up about a deeply personal chapter. More than a decade after undergoing a preventive double mastectomy, the Oscar-winning actress is now publicly sharing the results of the surgery and the meaning behind that choice.

Jolie, 50, appears in the first issue of TIME France, available December 18, where she shares photos of her scars and speaks honestly about why now feels like the right time to tell her story.

“I share these scars with many women I love,” Jolie told the magazine. “And I'm always moved when I see other women share theirs.”

For Jolie, the moment is about connection and community. “I wanted to join them, knowing that TIME France would be sharing information about breast health, prevention, and knowledge about breast cancer.”

To jog your memory a little, Jolie decided to undergo a double mastectomy in 2013 after her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, died from cancer at age 56 in 2007.

In a May 2013 New York Times op-ed titled “My Medical Choice,” Jolie revealed that tests indicated she carried the BRCA1 gene. This genetic mutation significantly raised her risk of developing breast cancer.

Jolie wrote in the op-ed: “I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me to breast cancer.”

CBS reported that two years later, in 2015, Jolie underwent further preventative surgery. She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to guard against ovarian cancer.

In the TIME France interview, Jolie emphasized the importance of making genetic testing widely available to women who need it.

“Every woman should always be able to determine her own healthcare journey and have the information she needs to make informed choices: genetic testing and screening should be accessible and affordable for women with clear risk factors or a significant family history,” Jolie said.

She added that access to care must be equitable. “Access to screening and care should not depend on financial resources or where someone lives.”

Sure wish I had someone like her around here, my mom had a double mastectomy and then she died from ovarian cancer the doctors told my sister and I that we would definitely have the ovarian cancer but my insurance won't cover genetic testing and I can't afford to pay for it now I get to worry if I'll be here for my kids while I try to raise money to get the genetic testing for my daughter.

Tomorrow would have been her 64th birthday

The president's remarks were criticized by GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	President Donald Trump spoke out on the deaths of director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, Monday in a post that spurned them for their progressive politics. 


	In the post on Truth Social Monday morning, Trump wrote a “very sad thing happened” to Reiner and his wife but went on to say that it was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.” 




	“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before. May Rob and MIchele rest in peace!,” the post continues. The statement turns what appears to be a homicide into something political, when there's no indication it is.

	The director died at age 78 Sunday along with his wife, Michele, age 70, in their Brentwood home. Their son, Nick Reiner, has been arrested and booked on suspicion of murder and is being held without bail. The Los Angeles Police Department has said that the 32-year-old is “responsible” for the homicide of his parents.


	Trump later doubled down on his comments in a press conference in the Oval Office saying that he “wasn't a fan of [Reiner's] at all.”

	











	“He was a deranged person, as far as Trump is concerned,” Trump continued. “He said — he knew it was false, in fact it's the exact opposite — that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia: the Russia hoax, he was one of the people behind it. I think he hurt himself career-wise; he became like a deranged person, Trump Derangement Syndrome.”


	Reiner, the director of When Harry Met Sally, Princess Bride and Stand By Me, among others was also prominent supporter of the Democratic party as well as an activist in his own right, having co-founded the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which helped overturn Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure that banned same-sex marriage. He also led the campaign to pass Proposition 10, the California Children and Families Initiative, which created a program of early childhood development services. After its passage, he was named the chair of the California Children and Families Commission.


	After Trump's post, many spoke out against him. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who was once a Trump ally but has recently turned to critiquing him, said “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies.”


	“Many people deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,” she tweeted.

	Fellow GOP Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also took issue with Trump's comments, calling them “inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”

Donald Trump has sued the BBC for up to $10 billion in damages, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation and of violating a trade practices law. The lawsuit is based on an edit of a speech given by Trump on Jan. 6, 2021 in a documentary that aired ahead of the 2024 presidential election. 


	According to a complaint filed in Florida on Monday night, Trump alleges that the broadcaster “intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively” edited his speech, which was used in an episode of the BBC‘s Panorama. The president is seeking $5 billion in damages each on two counts. The first count is defamation, while the second count says the BBC violated Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act by allegedly licensing the program outside of the U.K. 


	The lawsuit suggests that viewers in Florida may have watched the Panorama episode by using a VPN or via streaming service BritBox. “The Panorama Documentary's publicity, coupled with significant increases in VPN usage in Florida since its debut, establishes the immense likelihood that citizens of Florida accessed the Documentary before the BBC had it removed,” the filing says. According to The Guardian, the episode never aired in the U.S. 

	











	The Panorama edit was comprised of two different sections of Trump's speech, taken from almost an hour apart. The series suggested Trump said, “We're going to walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”


	The lawsuit claims that the network made “a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump, which was published in a BBC Panorama documentary, that was fabricated and aired by the defendants one week before the 2024 presidential election in a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the election's outcome to President Trump's detriment.”

	











	It also notes, “The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses. Accordingly, President Trump brings this action for compensatory and punitive damages for the extensive reputational harm inflicted upon him by the defendants.”

	Trump initially threatened to sue the BBC last month. He teased the impending lawsuit yesterday, telling reporters at the White House, “In a little while, you'll be seeing I'm suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth. Literally, they put words in my mouth. They had me saying things that I never said coming out.”


	In November, the BBC apologized for the edit and acknowledged the editing was an “error of judgment” after a leaked internal BBC memo criticized how the speech was edited. BBC's director general, Tim Davie, and its head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned. The BBC has not addressed the lawsuit, but has covered it as news.

	A spokesperson for Trump told The Guardian, “The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda. President Trump's powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing.”


	Trump has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit since its filing.

Jerry Seinfeld remembered Rob Reiner on Monday night, crediting the filmmaker with the success of his hit comedy Seinfeld. 


	“Next to Larry David and George Shapiro, Rob Reiner had the biggest influence on my career,” Seinfeld wrote on Instagram. “Our show would have never happened without him. He saw something no one else could. When nobody at the network liked the early episodes, he saved us from cancellation.”


	He continued, “That I was working with Carl Reiner's son, who happened to be one of the kindest people in show business, seemed unreal. I was naive at the time to how much his passion for us meant. Rob and Michele married right as our show was starting and they became an imprint for me of how it's supposed to work, each one broadening the other. Their death, together, is impossibly sad.” 


Seinfeld, which aired on NBC from 1989 until 1998, was produced by Reiner's company Castle Rock Entertainment. In 2016, Reiner discussed the inception of the series in an interview with Howard Stern and remembered helping to save the show from early cancellation. 

	











	He recalled Seinfeld and David coming in to pitch Seinfeld. “We knew they were two funny guys,” Reiner told Stern. “That wasn't the issue.” He added that the network was uncertain what the show was going to be.

	“We knew we had a great show and they wanted to take it off the air,” Reiner said. “They said, ‘We can't have this show. Because what is this show? It's just people sitting around talking.' Remember, they called it the ‘show about nothing.'”

	Reiner went into NBC and had a “screaming, crazy thing” with executive Brandon Tartikoff. “I begged him,” Reiner said. “I said, ‘Please, I promise you there'll be stories. You can't take this show off the air. It's going to be one of the great shows you've ever had.'” 


	Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner were found dead in their home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Shortly after, their son Nick Reiner was arrested for allegedly killing his parents. Much of Hollywood has paid tribute to the beloved filmmaker since.

	Nick Reiner was located hours later in South Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California campus — approximately 15 miles from the crime scene — and taken into custody around 9:15 p.m., law enforcement officials confirmed.


	At a news conference on Monday (Dec. 15), Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell addressed the arrest and ongoing investigation.


	“Our hearts go out to the family and friends of the Reiners,” McDonnell said, calling the situation “a tragic incident.” He also confirmed that a search warrant had been issued for the Reiner property, adding, “It's a critical piece of our investigation.”


	Nick Reiner, who co-wrote the 2015 film Being Charlie — a semi-autobiographical story about a young man's battle with addiction — has reportedly struggled with substance abuse and mental health issues for years. Sources told the Los Angeles Times that Reiner had cycled in and out of rehab facilities, experienced periods of homelessness, and had recently moved back into the family's Brentwood home.

	











	Reiner and Singer's family confirmed their deaths in a statement yesterday, writing, “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”


	Rob Reiner, 78, was a prolific actor, writer, and director best known for helming classic films including Stand By Me, When Harry Met Sally, A Few Good Men, and The Princess Bride. 


	The son of The Dick Van Dyke Show creator Carl Reiner, he was also known for his social activism and outspoken political commentary. His wife, Michele Singer Reiner, was a photographer and activist in her own right.


	Tributes poured in online following the news, with high-profile figures from music, film, politics, and beyond posting tributes to the couple.


	From the music world, Paul McCartney shared an emotional Instagram post thanking Reiner “for all the humour” and calling the tragedy “heartbreaking,” while Elton John also paid tribute to the director behind the Spinal Tap films. 


	Members of Spinal Tap, including Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest (with Jamie Lee Curtis), have issued statements mourning Reiner and describing the deaths as “unspeakable” and “like Greek tragedy.”


	As of Tuesday morning (Dec. 16), Nick Reiner remains in custody at the LAPD Metropolitan Detention Center. 


	He is being held without bail pending formal charges from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. A preliminary court appearance is expected later this week.

	Billboard News, presented by Amazon Prime, breaks down notable highlights from Billboard's Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs, including fan favorites from Katy Perry, Jonas Brothers and Wham!, to name a few. With festive sound cues and seasonal flair, the segment celebrates seasonal favorites and spotlights chart-topping moments, including Mariah Carey's continued reign with “All I Want for Christmas Is You.”


	Tetris Kelly: Yes, it's that time of year, and everybody's playlist is full of holiday bops. Well, if you need suggestions, we're breaking down some of the songs on Billboard‘s Greatest of All Time, Holiday 100 Songs presented by Amazon Prime. Getting cozy down in No. 79 is a holiday favorite by Katy Perry. 


	Katy Perry: Well, you know, I guess if this was the tester, it went well. I love this song, and I created it especially for Amazon. 


	Tetris Kelly: And the boy bands are represented with the Jonas Brothers at No. 70, NSYNC* at 64 and Jackson 5 at 42. Getting closer to the top of the ranks, we see contemporary faves like Ariana Grande at 19 and Justin Bieber at No. 17. This year on the Hot 100 Wham! has already peaked at No. 2, but on our all time list “Last Christmas” is at eight. And with multiple entries on the list, it's no surprise Mariah Carey is No. 1 with “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” It's a big year for Mimi as she continues to break chart records. 


	Interviewer: Did you know you had a hit on your hands? 


	Mariah Carey: I was just into the fact that I was, I was writing a Christmas song. It was from a different perspective, you know, than my usual songwriting. And I never imagined, like, well, first of all, I couldn't think that far ahead in the future anyway, but I never imagined this moment with it. So it's just really nice to be part of people's holiday traditions.

Nick Reiner went on aggressive, drug-fueled “outbursts” and was reportedly threatened to be kicked out of his parents Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's home before he was arrested in connection to their murders.

“Nick had been living in their guesthouse, the same one he destroyed more than once, but it had been like a revolving door all his adult life,” an insider told the Daily Mail Monday.

“He would do meth and not sleep for days and then have outbursts, breaking things, punching walls,” the source continued, explaining the screenwriter “had no control” and once “punched the bathroom wall.”

“He was a ticking time bomb,” the source said. “His drug use was getting worse and his parents wanted him out.”

The insider claimed Nick “would fight with his parents because they would give him the ultimatum, take medication and stop using, or move out.” 

The 32-year-old allegedly once threatened his sister, Romy Reiner, for confronting him, and “all hell broke loose.” 

“His parents threatened to call authorities multiple times, but in the end didn't,” the source alleged. 

“Nick would reportedly find the aftermath of his rages funny and “brag [about] how he could get away with anything.”

“He laughed about destroying his parents' guesthouse more than once,” the insider continued. “He was so nonchalant about it.”

Nick, who has been in and out of rehab, would also allegedly take “money from his parents for drugs and prostitutes.”

“He would talk about this stuff in meetings, but then stopped going because he said it was too cultish,” the insider claimed.

During a 2018 interview on the “Dopey” podcast, Nick recalled a meth-fueled rage that left him “up for days” and “punching out some things in [the] guest house,” such as a TV and lamp

“Everything in the guest house got wrecked,” he said.

Nick was arrested Sunday after his parents were found stabbed to death at their Los Angeles home. He is being held at Twin Towers Correctional Facility and is reportedly on suicide watch.

Insiders told The Post that Rob and Michele's daughter, Romy, found their bodies.

Following in the footsteps of such successful fairy-tale rebrands as Cruella, Wicked, and Malevolent, Disney is looking to reshape the public perception of Beauty And The Beast‘s resident bully. Per Deadline, Disney will finally tell the secret origins of Gaston, the villain of Beauty And The Beast, in an image-rehabilitating live-action movie. The latest draft of the screenplay comes from David Callaham, who, before becoming a regular writer on various superhero properties, including penning versions of Ant-Man, Wonder Woman 1984, Shang-Chi, and Across The Spider-Verse, was best known for introducing us to Sylvester Stallone's Expendables. Deadline didn't offer any plot details for the film. Still, we have a feeling it'll revolve around the untold tragedy of Gaston's life, retroactively making this despicable scallywag's behavior justified, like Cruella, whose puppy-killing ways we now understand because a dog pushed her mother off a cliff.

The outlet reports that Luke Evans, who played Gaston in the 2017 live-action remake, will not be returning to the role. We also expect Disney to drop the character's gay undertones that caused a minor controversy in 2017. Disney would hate to force Snoop Dogg into another instance of “talking to his grandkids.” Evans was expected to reprise the role for a TV series, Deadline continues, but a singing, French push broom swept those plans away. Still, fans annoyed by the recasting will soon be able to make their own Luke Evans-Gaston slop using the magic of AI.

Newly released photos show Nick Reiner being pinned to the ground by a police officer while being arrested on suspicion of murdering his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner.

The 32-year-old was seen pressed to the ground by a Los Angeles Police Department officer as several others watched on Sunday night, per photos shared by the LAPD Gang and Narcotics Unit on Monday.

Additional photos, which were deleted shortly after they were posted, showed him being escorted to the front of a police car.

According to the police department, the screenwriter was located with the help of the US Marshal Task Force.

Nick was reportedly arrested by a metro station 15 miles away from Rob and Michele's home, with sources telling ABC News he was near University of Southern California.

Page Six confirmed that Nick had been arrested on charges of murder after Rob and Michele were found stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Sunday afternoon.

He was originally booked in Downtown Los Angeles' Parker Center Jail before being transferred to Twin Towers Correctional Facility.

Nick is currently being held without bail and reportedly on suicide watch.

Before the murders, Nick and his parents had attended Conan O'Brien's Christmas party on Saturday night. 

Several sources told People that he was behaving erratically and “freaking everyone out, acting crazy.” 

Additional insiders told TMZ that Nick stuck out at the party, wearing a hoodie while everyone was dressed up in formal attire.

The outlet reported that Nick got into a “very loud argument” with Rob and Michele, resulting in the couple leaving the bash.

Nick has been in and out of rehab due to his drug addiction, and once admitted to destroying his parents' guest house after going on a drug-fueled rage.

Sources close to the Reiner family told the Post Monday that Nick has a history of violence but “never thought it would get to the point” of murder.

	A prominent public figure who was outspoken about his politics was brutally killed on Sunday, and Republicans would like you to know that they would never, under no circumstances, mock or minimize a tragedy to score political points.


	Unless the president does it first.


	The reaction to the death of famed director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer, who were allegedly murdered at their Los Angeles home by their son Nick, fell largely into national grief for the man behind films such as The Princess Bride, This Is Spinal Tap, and When Harry Met Sally. 


	The motive behind the murders has not been established, but some conservative s — many aware of Reiner's past criticism of President Donald Trump and his connections to prominent Democratic figures — were quick to assert that they would never dance on his grave  because they disagreed with his politics.


	“You won't see people on the right celebrating the horrific murder of Rob Reiner and his wife. Compare to the Left's reaction to Charlie Kirk's murder,” Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec wrote late Sunday night on social media. Several other conservatives made similar posts. “Liberals are desperately searching for a prominent conservative mocking Rob Reiner and his wife passing,” wrote MAGA commentator Gunter Eagleman.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Is the president of the United States prominent enough?


	Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social that the reason Reiner had been killed was because of “the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”

	











	“He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before,” Trump added. “May Rob and Michele rest in peace.”

	Trump doubled down on his comments later on Monday, telling reporters in the Oval Office that Reiner was “deranged” and that he was “very bad for our country.”


	Trump is, of course, the first person the conservative movement looks to to gauge how they should feel about something. The president's post about Reiner was so despicable, however, that the right wasn't sure how to proceed.


	Some, like Posobiec, began scrambling to craft a defense of Trump's post. “Rob Reiner called for Trump to be jailed over lies. Not surprised Trump said what he said,” Posobiec wrote, alongside several reposts of videos and content highlighting the director's past criticism of the president. Eagleman shared a screen grab of Trump's post but quoted only “May Rob and Michele rest in peace,” as if it were sincere, while ignoring the substance of the post.


	Conservative columnist Kurt Schlichter in the span of a few posts went from claiming that all he had seen were “conservatives being horrified,” to telling people to “CRY MORE” about Trump's statements.


	Laura Loomer, who has advised Trump since he retook office, wrote that Reiner was “a loser.”


	“Naturally, his son was also a loser, and he got addicted to drugs and allegedly murdered his parents,” she continued, attaching a fake, anti-Trump Reiner tweet for effect. “Looks like Rob should've spent more time parenting & less time spreading Russia conspiracy hoaxes about President Trump. I stand with President Trump.”

	In raising the specter of Kirk, conservatives also renewed attention on their  vengeful public crackdown against anyone who dared criticize Kirk in the aftermath of his assassination in September. Many Americans who spoke ill of Kirk after the shooting were fired from their jobs, with a Reuters investigation finding that at least 600 people were “fired, suspended, placed under investigation or disciplined by employers,” for comments about Kirk. 


	At least a few on the right realized that after conducting such an intense campaign of public pillorying of Kirk's critics, Trump's comments were — at a bare minimum — a terrible look. “We can't call out the Left for celebrating Charlie's assassination but laugh at this because it's a ‘mean tweet,' wrote MAGA influencer Brilyn Hollyhand. “Taking a victory lap when a critic is killed? That's how you lose Gen Z and independents. We can't sit on a pedestal and condemn the Left but normalize this.” 

	











	Congressional Republicans were largely silent. The few, the proud, the ones who already have bones to pick with Trump were the most outspoken.


	“This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a recently converted Trump critic, replied to the president's post on X. “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder,” she added. Greene is correct, but that didn't stop her and virtually every Republican in the MAGA movement from leveraging the addiction issues of former President Joe Biden's son Hunter as a cudgel against the former president. Something to think about as Greene continues her attempted rebrand. 


	Longtime Trump critic Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) wrote in response to Trump's post: “Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.” 


	A few other Republicans found it in themselves to gently chide the president. “This statement is wrong,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) wrote on X. “Regardless of one's political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It's a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.” 


	Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who announced this summer that he will not seek reelection in a district that is expected to flip Democratic in 2026, told Axios that the post was “not presidential. The couple were stabbed to death. Most Americans want more and better from our president.”


	Other influencers and commentators, including Piers Morgan, radio host Erick Erickson, and social media influencer Sage Steele criticized the president for being hypocritical and making Reiner's death about himself. Greg Gutfeld awkwardly tried to reckon with Trump's comments Monday night on Fox News. “He was asked to and he didn't,” the host said when a panelist said he hoped the president corrects himself. “You don't have to like the thing he says all the time. In my filter, Trump is always words versus deeds. I don't have to like what he says. In fact, I can hate what he says. But I can also think, in his brain, he's going, this guy compared me to Hitler, he put a target on my back, I don't like him.”

	











	“If it was me, I would go, like, but I'm sorry he's dead,” Gutfeld added. 


	Of course, there will always be those who flat-out defend the president's most vile acts even as they continue to brand themselves as spiritual leaders within the conservative movement.

With a son suspected of murder, recalling a Toronto restaurant session from 10 years ago — and the light it sheds on a dark dynamic.

Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	I almost didn't have dinner with the Reiners.


	At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, I was consumed with covering a slew of stories for my then-employer the L.A. Times. This included the stir around eventual best picture Spotlight, the buzzy Lenny Abramson movie Room and even a controversy over a court injunction stopping the screening of an Aretha Franklin concert documentary. The days were few and the news was great.




	So when a publicist asked me to meet with Rob and Michele Reiner and two of their adult children for a movie they had made called Being Charlie, I was prepared to tell her no. Obviously Rob was a legend; I grew up on the holy texts of The Princess Bride and This Is Spinal Tap. But a movie dramatizing the addiction troubles of Nick, his little-known 20-something son, on a busy weekend night with 10 other events? And it didn't even have distribution? This one just might have to pay the festival price. But the publicist pressed. “You won't regret it,” she said. I relented. The dinner ended up being revealing, heartwarming and jarring.

					Nick Reiner Revealed Violent Outburst, Family Issues and "Cocaine Heart Attack" on 2018 Podcast Taping		
			









	Ever since news broke that Rob and Michele Reiner had been killed in their home — according to the LAPD, by a knife-wielding Nick  —  I have replayed every moment from that night in my mind. Every clang of the fork, every digression from Rob, every uncomfortable Nick shift in the chair. Everything that happened on the second floor of that downtown Toronto restaurant, with loud diners and obsequious servers and barside festival schmoozers creating a din. We sat at a corner table and talked about what it meant to be part of a family with a serious addict — to be a parent, to be a sibling, to be the addict themselves. With the aid of my notes, which I had kept digitally intact from that night, I rewound the DVR in my mind again and again. Trying to connect what allegedly was done by one of the group now with what was happening then. The meal was a decade ago, but alive in front of me.

	Directed by Rob and co-written by Nick, Being Charlie focuses on David, an accomplished actor now running for governor — clearly a Rob stand-in — and his drug-addicted son who feels like he is being pushed hard to get clean so as not to be an embarrassment to his famous father; the character is a clear stand-in for Nick Reiner. The real-life son, who turned 22 on the day of our dinner, had just taken the stage with his father at the premiere a few blocks away. Then they made their way over to the restaurant with me. Nick was sober now, the Reiners said, after some 18 trips to rehab since his early teenage years, some of which he spent on the streets. This movie was going to provide the happy ending to all that sadness.


	“Can you believe this boy?” Rob said as we sat down, beaming. Nick smiled uncomfortably, saying nothing.


	From the start, a kind of fatherly pushing was evident. Rob wanted this story told — wanted, not surprisingly for a man steeped in show business, for the movie to succeed where therapy had failed. But he also genuinely felt pride — “nachas,” as he said, using the Yiddish word for parental joy.


	“I'm so proud; it's incredible. He's been through everything; it's so hard, you're in this position of no control. And how he's sober, here on his 22nd birthday, and he wrote this movie.”


	Nick seemed less game, a little almost like he didn't fully want to be there. He and a fellow addict had originally worked on a treatment for a TV series, so clearly he had some publicizing ambitions. Maybe he was getting cold feet now that his story would be shared with the world. Or maybe he just didn't want his life becoming part of his father's film universe.

	











	“It was tough at first, to think, ‘Am I actually going to do this?'” Nick said after I prodded a little. “I really wasn't sure I wanted to do this. Am I really going to get it out there?”


	Rob jumped in. “That's part of being a creative person — you express it; you get it out there.”


	The director looked lovingly at his wife. “Everybody's so open, and it's because of Michele.”


	“Everybody is,” she said, looking back at her husband. “But we didn't set out to do a public good. We had to do it for each other.”


	We ordered, and Nick explained the ineffectiveness of rehab for him: “I just couldn't get by in these programs. I had resistance every time they tried to reach me.”


	The elder Reiners described their own misgivings.


	“The program works for some people, but it can't work for everybody,” Rob said. “When Nick would tell us that it wasn't working for him, we wouldn't listen. We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”


	Michele said: “We were so influenced by these people. They would tell us he's a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”


	I looked at Romy, the Reiners' daughter. How did she feel? “This is my best friend, and I was there for all of it,” she said, gesturing to her brother, two years older. ”It's weird but good to see it on the screen,” she added. She struck me as someone deeply admiring of her brother, but also, perhaps, a little tired of explaining his behavior, to her parents, to everyone.

	











	Rob, who had been eating, put down his fork. “What got us through is two books, Tweaked and Beautiful Boy,” he said, citing addiction memoirs. Something poignant, even sad, abided. Unable to access the mind of his own son, he turned to the words of strangers to let him in.


	“And then we started talking about the movie,” he said. “That helped.” Michele nodded. “To be honest, by the time we got to the point of making the movie, it didn't matter [if we actually made it],” Rob said. “Because our relationship had gotten so much closer.”


	This was a happy ending. But something about that phrase didn't feel right. Was it not happy? No, it was. It just didn't feel like an ending.


	For all the talk about catharsis and success, something felt unsuccessful. I checked later with the publicist, who wasn't at dinner but had been spending time with the family. Did she pick up on anything? She thought everything was fine. But it didn't feel fine. It felt like things were better but far from resolved; it felt like the festival had arrived and a lot of what hadn't been resolved had been hurriedly shoved in the closet, like the last pile of living-room mess before company arrives.


	Appearing on a podcast a few weeks later, Nick was more candid about his ambivalence about the movie and the promotional efforts around it. Sobriety, he said, was a relative term. While he'd managed to get off meth and heroin, he was still drinking and smoking pot. “I said to [the film's publicists], ‘Listen, I'm not in a position to do this. I'm not a quote unquote sober guy.' I'm going to have to go on these talk shows. They said you have to do this. They want the whole father-son angle. It just goes to show you how disgusting it is.” But he finally relented. “It was uncomfortable, but I felt like it was part of the job.”

	











	At dinner, the family turned its attention to a line Rob insisted make it into the film — “I'd rather have you alive and hating me than dead on the streets.” Rob really, really wanted the line in. It explained his actions, justified them, even though he was now apologizing for thinking that way, for being so hard on his son. I looked over at Nick. He didn't seem so happy to have the line in the film. It was, perhaps, too excusing of the kind of parental pushing he didn't want to excuse.


	There was another line in the movie, right after that. “So what do you want me to do? Tell me what to do,” David begs his son.


	I asked Nick what he thought of that — what could his father had done? But Nick had no answer. Not at dinner, maybe not ever. Maybe there was nothing Rob could do. Maybe the whole movie, I thought, was Rob coming to terms with that inescapable fact, and all the cheer and the pride, well-earned as it was, could simply not illuminate that darker, more severe reality. He had done everything he could to help his son. He had even set in motion the Hollywood machine to help his son. And yet there was nothing he could do to fully help his son. Some things are beyond our greatest effort.


	At dinner, I saw a man who wanted so badly for resolution to be true, for reconciliation to find its way to them, that maybe he was pushing harder than matters should be pushed — that maybe he was trying to will his son into someone he couldn't be.


	And I also saw a man — not a boy — who had to take responsibility for himself, who was no longer a teenager, who couldn't simply point his finger at a father, much as his body language suggested he wanted to. I saw, in short, an American family, where everyone was sympathetic but no one was blameless.

	











	A festivalgoer approached our table, saying he had just come from the premiere. A niece who had battled addiction had survived several suicide attempts, he said, and he hoped that his wife could find solace in the film. “Thank you, that's the point,” Rob said to him. He almost glowed. His own pain was making others feel less alone. All Rob Reiner wanted to do, with all his movies and now with this one, was to make people feel less alone.


	He turned back to the table. “It was very hard. The number one job of any parent is to keep their child safe. And I hadn't done that.” He was almost tearing up. “And now, here, I have done that. I kept him safe. He came out alive.”


	Here in 2025, the words kept ricocheting through my brain. Yes, Nick had come out alive. It was Rob that hadn't.


	I looked at my notes, rifled through my memory — sought some great unlocking of a box whose contents, once unpacked, would explain what allegedly happened in the family's Brentwood home on Sunday. Were there clues? Did someone say something that night that suggested this would all end horribly badly? Was there some dark foreshadow-y Easter egg embedded within, if only I'd known where to look? I came up with tension, with awkwardness. But nothing made me tilt my head back and put my hands in the air to say, “Of course.” The key didn't come. Perhaps it never would, not even to the participants.


	What makes us turn against the ones we love, the ones who give us life? These are the people who care about us most, the people we live because of, and for. And then we rebel. In some extreme cases, violently.

	











	Confronted with the murder of parents by a child, we face the grimmest puzzle. It is unfathomable, and in the face of the unfathomable, the mind speeds through explanations: addiction, mental illness, a fugue state. We cannot — we must not — believe this was a mindful act. Or a slow-growing one. Something “snapped.” If it didn't, how else could it have happened?


	But what if it didn't? What if it had been building? What if the seeds of this were evident a decade ago at that restaurant? Nothing about that night suggested a specifically bad outcome; I'd be lying if I said it did. And yet I'd be equally dishonest if I said something about that night also didn't make me deeply uneasy. Anyone with even a modest EQ could see it.


	I could see the helplessness.  The missteps of a parent. The futility. The irony was painful to me, and, I could only imagine, to Rob Reiner. Here was the nation's storyteller-in-chief, unable to finish the tale how he wanted. Characters reject our keystrokes. We are all agents in our own story but not authors of it. Even the man who shaped some of the best couldn't be an author of it.


	In the end, I thought, what made this different from any awkward dinner between a 22-year-old and his parents? Strip away the iconic persona of the father and the son's addiction struggles (and maybe not even that) and it becomes any other tense family dinner where baggage and demons hover. And yet it wasn't any family dinner: It was Rob Reiner. It was Meathead and The Bucket List, it was Stand by Me and the I'll-have-what-she's-having scene. (Another Reiner parent, incidentally, in another restaurant.) The kind of figure whose stature was supposed to transcend all of this, was supposed to mind-crush the challenge that would befall a more ordinary family. I mean, that's the implicit bargain when we turn ourselves over to such famous storytelling hands, isn't it? That the savvy and talent that made them our family chroniclers would surely be enough to vanquish whatever pedestrian problem beset their own clan. And yet of course it isn't. In the end, it didn't.

	











	Rob Reiner was great precisely because he highlighted these family foibles and made sense of them. We could relate to an inability to get through to a thickheaded father-in-law, and to a boy who grudgingly wants to be read a story by his grandfather, and to being forced to find makeshift brothers on a body-seeking adventure when our own parents are absent. Maybe that's what makes this extra tragic. Reiner was all about sorting through the complexity of parents and offspring and coming out OK on the other side. He's the one who taught us how hard it was but that we could get through it, just as he did with his own famous father, with whom he bonded over baseball. He just couldn't enact the lesson with his own son.


	As the dinner ended, we pushed back our chairs and stood up. Rob looked at me. He took my hand and clasped it. “Thank you, Steve.”


	Perhaps I imagined it, but in his eyes I saw a pleading, an ask. Not to conceal anything. More the opposite — he wanted this story written in a way that willed the best outcome into being. I clasped his hand back as he held my gaze an extra twinkly, plaintive second. It was the last interaction we had.

Patti Lupone is famous for dressing down audience members at her shows. 

But apparently she'll take matters into her own hands when she's there to watch the show as well

Page Six has learned that the Broadway legend “cornered” an unruly patron at show that wasn't even hers and gave them the Full Lupone.

Spies say that “Gypsy” star was at the Duke on 42nd Street this weekend catching Drew Droege's buzz-making “Messy White Gays,” and we're told a woman in the audience “seemed more primed for a bachelorette party than off-Broadway.”

Apparently the offending attendee peppered more than half the one-act show's runtime with “an inebriated cavalcade of four-letter words” and a cackled “Yes b*tch!”

After the show, we're told La LuPone “cornered” the unsuspecting loudmouth, telling her: “Never go to the theater again!”

Our spies tell us the lady “quailed under the diva's stony gaze and apologized.”

Lupone's summary justice is legend.

In 2009 the three-time Tony-winner stopped mid-song in “Gypsy” to yell at someone snapping pictures with a cell phone, and she's snatched phones out of the hands of audience members on many an occasion.

She's even said that the advent of iPhones has led her to consider leaving the stage altogether.

“It isn't changing, it's only getting worse,” she said in a statement after one of her phone-confiscating moments. “And it takes, it's stressful. It's incredibly stressful. So, I will think twice before I sign another Broadway contract. I really will.”

The show has been a big hit not just with gay icons like Lupone but with actual gays.

Cheyenne Jackson, Jeff Hiller, Michael Urie, Bowen Yang, Matt Rogers, Chris Colfer, Todrick Hall, Bryan Safi and even tech billionaire Peter Thiel (who is mentioned in the show) have made it to the Duke to catch it. 

A rep for Lupone didn't get back to us.

Nick Reiner once admitted to losing his virginity to a sex worker he paid with stolen money from his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, years before his arrest in connection to their tragic deaths.

“I was just looking at the different [Craigslist] profiles, and this one [profile picture was] just an ass shot,” the screenwriter, 32, revealed on the “Dopey” podcast in 2017.

“That's the only thing that was her profile picture — and it had a number,” he detailed. “I called her up when I was about 14 or something, and her going rate was about $200.”

“This is the part of the story that I don't usually tell, but I'll tell it anyway,” Nick added. “I got $200 from my parents.”

He clarified that he didn't tell his parents what the money was for. “I didn't say, ‘Hey, look, I'm going to be with a [sex worker] tonight. Do you think you have an extra $200?'”

“It was also like 1 a.m. … She comes over. I didn't know how it worked, so I tried to kiss her.She didn't want that,” he detailed.

Describing the experience, Nick admitted to not finding the woman attractive but not caring because he “was young.” 

“I was like, ‘This is awesome,'” he continued. “[I lasted] 15 seconds … I kind of felt like s–t, but I was like, ‘That's awesome.' Then I realized I had more money on me, and I called her back. She came for a second time.”

“I never asked her name and I never really got into any specifics of anything,” Nick added, explaining he ate a “pot brownie” beforehand and “was extremely blazed.”

“But I still would have done it if I was sober,” he said. 

Nick, who has been in and out of rehab, admitted to getting the idea to contact a sex worker online through a fellow outpatient rehab patient. 

On Sunday, Page Six revealed that Nick had been arrested on murder charges after his parents were found stabbed to death at their Los Angeles home.

He's being held at Twin Towers Correctional Facility without bail.

Leading up to Rob and Michele's death, the actor had reportedly gotten into a heated altercation with Nick at Conan O'Brien's Christmas party on Saturday. 

A neighbor of the couple told The Post on Monday that Nick had a history of violence, but they “never thought it would ever get to this point.”

The company says it repped the legendary singer for years on tricky rights issues "at no cost to her" — in return for a 50 percent cut of her royalties "in perpetuity."


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Dionne Warwick is facing a lawsuit claiming the legendary singer has turned her back on a rights management company that negotiated her deal for the famed sample of her song “Walk on By” in Doja Cat‘s chart-topping hit “Paint the Town Red.”


	In a case filed Monday (Dec. 15), a company called Artists Rights Enforcement Corp. says it's repped Warwick for years “at great effort and expense” on tricky issues, ranging from the recent Doja sample to a 2002 lawsuit against Atlantic Records. But the company says she's now trying to back out.


	“After decades of service, Ms. Warwick is now trying to evade paying Artists Rights hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars,” the company's lawyers write. “In so doing, she has violated her contracts with Artists Rights.”


	Artists Rights says it provided its services to Warwick for years “at no cost to her,” assuming all the risk and upfront costs. In return, it says she agreed in 2002 to pay the company a 50 percent cut of any money recovered through the enforcement efforts — and to do so “in perpetuity.”


	Such arrangements are not unheard of in the music industry, which confronts many artists, even legendary stars, with a thicket of complicated rights deals with a slew of different companies. They mirror contingency deals employed by some law firms, which represent plaintiffs for free with the hope of a big payoff in court.


	Warwick's arrangement worked well for both sides for years, according to Artists Rights, resulting in more than $2.5 million in revenue and a “sixtyfold” increase in royalty distributions from her record companies, according to the lawsuit. But in recent years, Warwick has “increasingly expressed her desire to stop paying Artists Rights,” the company says; in September, her lawyers allegedly reached out to “terminate” the agreement entirely.


	“Artists Rights has performed all of its obligations under the contracts,” the company's lawyers write. “Ms. Warwick has wrongfully and unreasonably repudiated the contracts.”


	Among its work for Warwick, Artists Rights says it handled a 2002 lawsuit against Atlantic and others over the royalties to her chart-topping 1974 hit “Then Came You.” When the case finally settled in 2004, and Warwick was “finally was able to receive some of the royalties that she justly deserved,” the settlement deal signed by the star allegedly required that royalties be routed through Artists Rights.


	The company says it later handled issues with SoundExchange, as well as a complicated matter involving Sony Music paying her royalties to the state of California to satisfy unpaid taxes, among other disputes. Then in 2023, Artists Rights says it handled the clearance of a sample of Warwick's “Walk On By” in Doja's “Paint,” which spent three weeks atop the Hot 100 and 37 overall weeks on the chart: “Ms. Warwick profited enormously from Artists Rights' work,” the lawsuit reads.


	A rep for Warwick did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday. Doja Cat, Atlantic Records and others mentioned in the lawsuit were not named as defendants nor accused of any wrongdoing.

Disclosure Day is coming, and it ain't like E.T.

At long last, we know what Steven Spielberg's next movie is. The director and studio Universal Pictures have kept the details on the 2026 project close to the vest, and all we really knew was it was a sci-fi film about UFOs. Now, we finally have a trailer for the film, titled Disclosure Day, which is attached to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. And it looks... strange.

The Disclosure Day teaser trailer sets the stage for what looks to be an alien invasion, though whether it's a peaceful one or not remains to be seen. This first look at the film looks less at the invaders themselves, who may be acting through Earth's fauna, but a world of seven billion people learning what's happening to their planet. The inciting incident, of all things, seems to be a newscast. A character played by Emily Blunt is about to give the weather report when she starts emitting a strange and intense set of gurgles and clicks. From there, the world slowly finds out what's happening as characters played by Josh O'Connor (Challengers), Colin Firth (the Kingsman movies), Colman Domingo (Sing Sing), and Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, daughter of Bono) come to grips with extraterrestrial intelligence.

A proper synopsis for the film hasn't been released. However, key dialogue in the trailer, which is also included in the trailer's description, reads, "If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you?" It appears to be yet another take on Spielberg's fascination with how alien life would interact with the people of Earth, which he's previously explored in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds.

Disclosure Day is directed by Spielberg with a script from longtime collaborator David Koepp (based on a story by Spielberg), who wrote scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Koepp's non-Spielberg writing work includes Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (writer), Stir of Echoes (writer/director), Mission: Impossible (co-writer), and 2025's critically acclaimed Black Bag (writer) from director Steven Soderbergh. Legendary composer John Williams is once again teaming up with Spielberg to score Disclosure Day.

Disclosure Day will arrive in movie theaters on June 12, 2026. It will be Spielberg's first film since the semi-autobiographical The Fabelmans, and his first dalliance in sci-fi since 2018's Ready Player One.

Supernatural, the long-running CW horror series about brothers Sam and Dean Winchester hunting monsters and solving mysteries, is officially leaving Netflix on December 18. Supernatural first aired in 2005, and at the time, few could have guessed that it would go on to be one of the longest-running live-action shows in history. The show's popularity has endured since the series finale aired five years ago, consistently one of the most popular series on Netflix and streaming at large.

Supernatural has been a part of the Netflix package for a staggering 13 years, and so many subscribers are used to having it and all 327 of its episodes at their fingertips. Unfortunately, Supernatural's time on Netflix is coming to an end. Supernatural is leaving Netflix on December 18. From that point forward, the 15 seasons of Supernatural will no longer be available on the platform.

Fans of Supernatural can also enjoy shows like Grimm and The X-Files, which feature similar adventures with paranormal creatures in the modern world.

Supernatural is leaving Netflix due to an expiring deal with the streamer, and it's definitely going to mark a sad end of an era for fans of the show and Netflix subscribers in general. But while it's sad to see Supernatural leave Netflix after spending such a long time on the platform, the good news is that the show is still going to be readily available to stream on other platforms. Supernatural is coming to Peacock and Amazon Prime Video on December 22. So there will be a few days when Supernatural isn't available to stream on any of the major platforms (without buying the episodes on Prime), but at least it won't take long for it to end up somewhere else.

When Supernatural joins Peacock and Prime Video, it will do so with all 15 seasons intact and all the classic episodes that they entail. Watching all of Supernatural is quite the task, but the show is full of memorable moments, engaging drama, and exciting action. There are definitely long stretches of Supernatural where it dips in quality, but the overall package is a fun time and definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it before.

Considering Supernatural's longevity, some may be wondering if we will ever see the franchise expanded in a serious way, whether through a revival or new spin-off series. There were multiple attempts at a Supernatural spin-off while the show was still on the air, with multiple backdoor pilots filmed, but nothing took off. After Supernatural was over, The Winchesters spin-off series aired, but wasn't popular enough to get more than one season.

The g

, but there's always the chance that the show could make a comeback somehow, especially with how many people still love it to this day. With Supernatural creator Eric Kripke's time on The Boys coming to an end, perhaps the time for a Supernatural reunion will come sooner rather than later. For now, Supernatural fans need to prepare themselves for the show's departure from Netflix, and may want to consider signing up for Peacock or Amazon Prime if they haven't done so already.

Follow the Winchester brothers as they hunt demons, ghosts, and otherworldly creatures in this iconic and long-running TV series. The Blu-ray version of the Supernatural complete series only enhances the atmospheric storytelling and creature-feature thrills, immersing fans in the Winchester legacy with unparalleled clarity and depth. Relive the epic battles between good and evil in Supernatural with this stellar deal.

	Universal Pictures has released the first trailer for Steven Spielberg‘s next film, “Disclosure Day.”


	The movie stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Spielberg developed the science fiction story with screenwriter David Koepp, who previously collaborated with the director as a writer on “Jurassic Park,” “Jurassic Park: The Lost World,” “War of the Worlds” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”

	Here's the logline: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … ‘Disclosure Day.'”




			Popular on Variety		







	The trailer shows Blunt playing a meteorologist who is suddenly overcome by a mysterious, extraterrestrial force while delivering a weather report live on air. O'Connor stars as a man who wants to reveal the truth of alien life to the rest of the world. The rest of the trailer is filled with crop circles, car chases, creepy animals and hints that there is life outside of the humans on Earth.


	“Disclosure Day” is the 37th film that Spielberg has directed since his (partially lost) debut in 1964 — coincidentally, that initial feature, “Firelight,” was also a science fiction film. He has returned to the genre in several films over the years including the two “Jurassic Park” movies and “War of the Worlds” as well as “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” “Minority Report,” “A.I. Artificial Intelligence” and “Ready Player One.”

	











	The cumulative box office gross of Spielberg's directing filmography is over $10 billion worldwide. As a director and producer, he has been nominated for over 23 Academy Awards, taking home three including best director wins for “Schindler's List” and “Saving Private Ryan” in 1993 and 1998, respectively. His most recent film, 2023's semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans” grossed $45 million and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture. 


	Universal will release “Disclosure Day” in theaters on June 12. It is produced by Spielberg alongside Kristie Macosko Krieger at Amblin Entertainment.

In a major year for blockbusters, from Christopher Nolan to Denis Villeneuve, there's none we are anticipating more than Steven Spielberg returning to the realm of extraterrestrial sci-fi. After Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds, the legendary director is back to exploring alien life with Disclosure Day, which opens in theaters on June 12. Ahead of that summer release, the first trailer has now arrived.

With a cast featuring Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, and Wyatt Russell, much of Disclosure has been kept under tight wraps. Last week, mysterious billboards started popping up around the country for the film written by David Koepp and featuring a score by John Williams. Now this trailer finally grants our first peek.

Here's the synopsis: “If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.”

LAWRENCE — When Superman became popular in the 1940s, he originally fought more conventional villains of the era such as gangsters, pirates and Nazis. But one of his foes led to a legendary encounter that may provide strategies for dealing with troubling concerns affecting the society of today.

Colin McRoberts, associate teaching professor of business at the University of Kansas, has written a chapter detailing the 1946 radio serial “The Adventures of Superman” in which the Man of Steel challenged a group known as “The Clan of the Fiery Cross” … aka the Ku Klux Klan.

His chapter titled “A Symbol for Hope: Superman's Battle with the KKK as a Model for Effective Cultural Engagement with Conspiracy Theories” appears in “The Lizard People Don't Want You to Read This: Essays on Conspiracy Theory in Popular Culture.” The new book is published by McFarland & Company.

“In this serial, Superman revealed what motivated the Klan: the xenophobia, the hate, the know-nothingism. My chapter is trying to convince the writers of modern mass media to consider doing the same thing and use their stories to tell what conspiracy theories actually do in the real world,” McRoberts said.

“Here, I'm not talking about the rare ones that turn out to be true, but the ones that are much more dangerous, like anti-vaccine, antisemitic, January 6 types of things. Instead of lionizing and valorizing the conspiracy theorists because they're interesting characters, focus on the victims and the damage those conspiracy theories do — just as the writers of Superman did, because they understood the power their stories had to change public opinion.”

Interestingly, the serial itself generated its own conspiracy. For years, the apocryphal story was repeated that Superman had given away the Klan's secret passwords on the air.

“That just wasn't true. What the show did instead was reveal the business model of the Klan and the hypocrisy and shallowness of the Klan,” McRoberts said.

The chapter noted, “If these episodes lacked genuine secret passwords, they revealed something just as real and even more devastating: The Klan wasn't just hateful and un-American, it was a scam. Despite its pomp and circumstance, it wasn't an ancient and impressive organization — it was just a club that milked its thuggish members to make money.”

McRoberts added, “They made the Klan look silly, and the silliness of the Klan was what undermined its image.”

The professor emphasized conspiracy theories may often seem silly, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less threatening.

“What's usually at the heart of a conspiracy theory is a powerful group we can't see and access that is out to get us,” McRoberts said.

Muddying the concept even further, he said, is that people are often confused by how to apply the term conspiracy theory.

“I don't think of things like the Tuskegee Airmen as a conspiracy theory; I think of it as a conspiracy fact. The classic example is 9/11. Yes, it was a conspiracy. It was a conspiracy of hijackers and terrorists. But it wasn't a conspiracy of Jews. And that's the difference between the conspiracy theory as we normally use the term and a real-world conspiracy,” he said.

The “Lizard People” book of which his chapter is a part of delivers a collection of essays examining topics ranging from clandestine societies to dog whistles to pop culture media such as “The X-Files” and “The Da Vinci Code.”

McRoberts said, “It's a fantastic analysis of how conspiracy theories ripple through mass media and what mass media can do about it. I appreciate how they picked a bunch of different experts in different fields to reflect their facet problem, which is really difficult for the world to get its head around.”

As for his focus on Superman, McRoberts said he was more of an X-Men fan growing up.

“And when I became a lawyer, Daredevil became more my thing,” he said.

A faculty member at KU since 2019, McRoberts was a litigator and a consultant with his own firm, Vasher McRoberts, and with the SAB Group prior to his career in academia.

McRoberts said he hopes the tactic used by Superman's bygone show might work against other groups whose lives revolve around harmful conspiracy theories. 

Unfortunately, the cultural landscape has changed quite a bit in the ensuing decades, he said.

“The biggest problem now is the fragmentation of the media market, which I generally think is a good thing. I love the fact that you've got comic book fans and Jane Austen fans and documentary fans, and everybody's got a healthy media market for whatever floats their boat,” he said.

“But such fragmentation is not great for the power of fiction to actually change public opinion. That is a power Superman had. I don't know if mass media now has one singular show that makes the same impact.”

The plant world is full of wonders that often seem too strange to be real. Some species have evolved unique shapes, colours, and behaviours that challenge our expectations of what a plant should look like. From ghost-white blooms to giant flowers with eerie scents, these plants blur the lines between fantasy and reality, showcasing nature's most astonishing creativity.

The corpse flower (Titan arum) boasts the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, towering over 10 feet with a reddish-brown spadix emitting a rotting flesh odour to lure flies. It grows from a massive underground corm, with huge leaves dominating its cycle, blooming rarely after years of storage; not parasitic.

Also known as Indian pipe, this "ghost plant" does not have chlorophyll in it, so it doesn't undergo photosynthesis, unlike other green plants. But instead, it gets nutrients from a symbiotic relationship with fungi. Because of this, this plant appears otherworldly with its pale white, nodding stems and urn-shaped flowers that turn black when mature.

This plant takes its name from a pair of bright white berries contrasted with dark purple spots to create a resemblance of hanging eyeballs. Such a plant grows in the woodlands of North America, and this eerie sight especially stands out in contrast with red stalks. However, it is important to note these berries are poisonous to human consumption.

The cobra lily closely resembles a hooded serpent, with curved leaves that look like a cobra poised to strike. This carnivorous plant uses its twisted, tubular leaves to trap insects, which are gradually broken down with the help of bacteria inside the pitcher, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients and survive in nutrient-poor soils.

The bat flower with dark purple to black flowers and "whiskers" indeed has a gothic fairy tale appearance, as if it were a creature in a dark fairy tale. Native to Southeast Asia, this unusual flower has bracts and whiskers evoking bat wings poised on its stem.

This ornamental grass looks like streaks of crimson fire rising from the earth, with vibrant red-tipped blades that evoke an almost mystical aura. Though more common in gardens, its bold colour gives it a surreal, otherworldly look that seems pulled from a dreamscape.The garden cultivar 'Rubra' is sterile and non-invasive.

As indicated by its name, because of flowers with a heart-shaped appearance which seem to have drops of ‘bleeding' petal flesh, the bleeding heart plant provides a dramatic and enchanting visual effect. The bleeding heart plants flowers in a way that gives a delicate magic to flower planters.



Nature always has a way of growing things that appear more fantasy than reality. Of course, these seven plants, ranging from the pale ghost plant to the giant corpse flower and bat flower, push our very definition of a plant in a way that reminds us of the wonders of biodiversity on earth, where nature holds magic in a way characteristic of fiction.

Erika Kirk and Candace Owens met on Monday, days after Charlie Kirk's widow joined a CBS town hall and said she wanted Owens to stop peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband's assassination.

Both Kirk and Owens confirmed Monday evening that they had spoken, referring to the conversation as "productive" in separate posts on X. They did not share details from the meeting, but Owens said it lasted four and a half hours, and they "agreed much more than I had anticipated."

Kirk previously said on X Sunday that she and Owens would have a "private, in-person meeting" Monday. She added that they "agreed that public discussions, livestreams, and tweets are on hold until after this meeting" and that she's looking forward to a "productive discussion."

Owens wrote on X that she's "very much looking forward to this discussion."

Erika Kirk sat down with CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss last week for a town hall that aired Saturday on CBS. Weiss asked Erika Kirk what she would want to say to Owens, who has been amplifying conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination.

"Stop," Erika Kirk said. "That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop."

Owens, a onetime friend of Charlie Kirk's and a former employee of his conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA, previously compared their relationship to that of a "brother and sister."

The day after his assassination, she posted a lengthy video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. In the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.

The Treasury Department has since confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk oversees are under investigation by the IRS.

Misha Collins originally auditioned to play a demon on "Supernatural," so he can be forgiven for needing some time to get acquainted with Castiel, the angelic character he ended up playing in Eric Kripke's horror drama. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins and his co-stars, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, looked back at his "Supernatural" debut, with Collins sharing an interesting detail about having to reshoot his first scene.

Castiel first appears in season 4's "Lazarus Rising" episode, which is often regarded as one of the best installments of "Supernatural." The character's grand entrance sees him storm into a building where Dean and Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) are holding up, absorbing a hail of bullets as he walks toward them, looking completely unfazed. It's a great scene, but the creators weren't happy with Collins' early takes. As he told it:

"My debut performance on 'Supernatural' was so substandard that we did a reshoot the next day, because they got the dailies back of my creepy performance and they were like..."

Despite being heavily involved in the scene, Ackles didn't recall being summoned back for reshoots, suggesting that Collins was the only actor who didn't live up to expectations at the time. That said, the Castiel star went on to become a major part of the show until "Supernatural" season 15, proving that the creators must have been happy with his overall performance. However, reshoots pale in comparison to Collins' worst experiences on "Supernatural," as playing Castiel caused permanent damage to his health.

Misha Collins' first outing as Castiel didn't please the creators of "Supernatural," but he got better, and he took the role very seriously from that moment on. In fact, Collins was so dedicated to playing the character that he developed a sore throat through the voice he put on for the show — and the actor has carried that pain around with him since the series ended. As Collins told TVInsider:

"So I went to the doctor and was like, 'I don't know what's going on, but I have a sore throat that's not going away.' I got checked for strep, and it's not strep. I was literally causing damage to my vocal cords. So, that's something that I carried with me from Castiel. Actual physical trauma."

Collins noted that he never expected to become a "Supernatural" mainstay following his debut, so he might have taken precautions to protect his vocal cords if he knew how long his tenure would last. Still, at least he got to be part of a hit series for a very long time, which is as good a reason as any to suffer.
