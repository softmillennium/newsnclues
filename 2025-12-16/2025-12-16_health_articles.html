                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by Igor Mezine, Guru Valicherla, Chris Bode, and Sid Bhoopathy. The evaluation of reactive metabolite (RM) production is an important aspect of the modern drug development process. Most common for producing and trapping RM in vitro are liver microsomes and/or S9 fractions. The detection of trapped RM (TRM), which is frequently present at low levels, is facilitated in large part by using a mixture of glutathione (GSH) and stable isotope labeled (SIL)-GSH. These labels enable the automatic filtering of peaks of interest by searching for the relevant monoisotopic pattern (MIP). Because such subcellular systems lack a comprehensive set of enzymatic machinery involved in drug metabolism, hepatocytes are frequently used instead of or in conjunction with subcellular fractions to research drug metabolism. The researchers plated human, rat, and dog hepatocytes in vendor-supplied seeding media supplemented with SIL-Gly (1 mM). The plated hepatocytes (PH) were then treated with the model chemical, clozapine (CLZ, 30 mM) for 24 hours. After centrifugation, the cell extract supernatants and medium were evaluated using liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRAMS) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. The collected data was then processed with Compound Discoverer (CD) and Xcalibur software. Assessment of the data revealed the presence of numerous known CLZ GSH conjugates in medium alone, as well as the incorporation of SIL-Gly in GSH. Interestingly, MIP ratios, defined as the proportion of A0 (SIL-GSH)/A0 (GSH), were both conjugate-specific and species-dependent, ranging from 20 % to 90 %. These results show a complicated interplay between the kinetics of model compound metabolism, SIL-Gly absorption, GSH production, and efflux. As a result, the researchers employed CLZ as a positive control molecule to develop MIP search acceptability criteria in CD software. The new SILAC technique can be combined with CYP induction investigations to undertake further metabolite profiling and facilitate TRM detection. Plated human and animal CYP induction-certified hepatocytes were purchased from XenoTech. CLZ and glycine-(13C2, 15N) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Thermo Fisher's Accucore C18 column (1.5 µm, 150 x 2.1 mm) was used for UPLC separation using a MeCN gradient in water (constant at 0.1 % formic acid). MIP values in human and rat incubation samples ranged consistently from 20 to 45 %. Interestingly, dogs have significantly higher MIP values, particularly in the case of G3, where MIP exceeded 100 % (Figure 5). Recorded and Simulated HRAMS Spectra of G2 in Human Incubation Sample.

To effectively detect drug binding in hepatocytes, it is necessary to deactivate their metabolic activity. This has been accomplished traditionally by using heat inactivation, enzyme inhibitors, or freeze-thaw cycles. This study used these three ways to assess the unbound percentage of ten commercial drugs in hepatocytes and determined which method was most suited for routine testing. For the majority of substances, the three approaches produced comparable results, just as they did for rats. However, for the chemical carvedilol, the freeze-thaw approach increased its recovery from 54.84 % to 82.16 % when compared to the Enzyme Inhibitor method, demonstrating that the freeze-thaw method has a better enzyme inactivation ability. For most substances, the Enzyme Inhibitor and Freeze-Thaw techniques produced similar binding results. For carvedilol, the FreezeThaw approach significantly improved metabolic stability (26.43 % vs. 73.93 % after 4 hours), and microscopy revealed higher membrane rupture, indicating more efficient inactivation. Overall, the Freeze-Thaw method provides practical benefits such as better inactivation for some medicines, streamlined processes, and clear morphological evidence, making it a more convenient and trustworthy option for routine in vitro ADME research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team of Prof. Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) has discovered that the bacterium Ewingella americana, isolated from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs (Dryophytes japonicus), possesses remarkably potent anticancer activity. This groundbreaking research has been published in the international journal Gut Microbes. While the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has attracted considerable attention in recent years, most approaches have focused on indirect methods such as microbiome modulation or fecal microbiota transplantation. In contrast, this study takes a completely different approach: isolating, culturing, and directly administering individual bacterial strains intravenously to attack tumors - representing an innovative therapeutic strategy. The research team isolated a total of 45 bacterial strains from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs, Japanese fire belly newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster), and Japanese grass lizards (Takydromus tachydromoides). Through systematic screening, nine strains demonstrated antitumor effects, with E. americana exhibiting the most exceptional therapeutic efficacy. This dramatically surpasses the therapeutic efficacy of current standard treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 antibody) and liposomal doxorubicin (chemotherapy agent).

Sulfonation (also known as sulfurylation) is a significant phase II conjugation reaction that occurs throughout the metabolism of both xenobiotics and endogenous substances. It is catalyzed by sulfotransferases (SULT). In humans, the eighteen SULT genes are divided into five gene families. Recognizing the metabolic phenotyping and inhibition of sulfotransferases is essential for analyzing drug-drug interactions during drug discovery and development. Conventional probe substrates, such as 4-nitrophenol and dopamine, frequently require ion-pairing reagents and can damage instruments, rendering them unsuitable for high-throughput LC-MS/MS analysis. To address these constraints, this study utilized new probe substrates, developing a panel of in vitro phenotyping and inhibition tests to characterize SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1E1, and SULT2A1 via recombinant enzymes and optimized LC-MS/MS methodologies. These assays allow for the assessment of compound substrate potential towards various SULT enzymes. To improve the accuracy and throughput of SULT inhibition tests, probe substrates were selected and adjusted for each enzyme. The relevant LCMS/MS procedures were also optimized. Key parameters such as probe substrate Km and IC50 values, as well as appropriate protein concentrations for recombinant SULT enzymes, were identified. The validated in vitro SULT phenotyping and inhibition assays are now ready for use in evaluating compounds of interest during drug discovery and development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When that communication is disrupted, the brain must rapidly rebalance its internal signaling to keep circuits functioning properly. New research from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences shows that neurons can stabilize their signaling using a fast, physical mechanism - not the electrical activity scientists long assumed was required. The discovery, supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals a system that doesn't depend on the flow of charged particles to maintain signaling when part of a synapse - the junction between neurons - suddenly stops working. Maintaining this balance between neurons is essential for muscle control, learning and overall brain health. USC Dornsife researchers led by Dion Dickman, professor of biological sciences, set out to understand how neurons compensate when communication between them falters. Specifically, they wanted to know how the receiving side of a synapse detects a sudden loss of function and signals the sending neuron to increase its output to restore homeostasis. When these receptors were blocked, they rearranged themselves within the synapse, which set off a signaling process that instructed the sending neuron to release more neurotransmitter, helping maintain steady communication. A scaffold protein called DLG proved essential for this response. When DLG was removed using CRISPR, the rapid compensation failed. The researchers also showed that this fast signaling process continues even when all electrical synapse activity is silenced, indicating that the system relies on structural cues rather than electrical signals. Understanding how synapses quickly adapt could help guide future research into treatments that strengthen neural resilience and ward off neurological diseases. Nonionic signaling rapidly remodels postsynaptic DLG to induce retrograde homeostatic plasticity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For much of the past century, Alzheimer's disease has been one of medicine's most daunting frontiers – biologically complex, devastating in impact, and difficult to diagnose early. Conventional diagnostic methods like positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis offer precision but remain invasive, costly, and logistically challenging, especially in low- and middle-income regions. Blood-based biomarkers – like p-tau217, p-tau181, Aβ42/40 ratios, NfL, and GFAP – enable Alzheimer's pathology measurement with a simple blood draw. The availability of clinically validated blood tests are changing how clinicians diagnose and treat Alzheimer's disease and how clinical trials are designed. Furthermore, researchers are evaluating blood tests that may identify disease progression years before symptoms, potentially allowing health systems to extend early detection from tertiary care to primary and community settings. Globally, this could help expand access for disease detection and management. Many countries face rapid ageing, increased rates of dementia, and limited access to imaging. Blood tests offer a scalable, cost-efficient way to expand early detection and better allocate specialist resources. Tests that combine multiple biomarkers in a single blood draw, such as Quanterix's LucentAD Complete - which measures five AD biomarkers simultaneously – further democratize the process. Over time, this could help reduce diagnostic disparities linked to income and geography. These same biomarkers are changing drug development. In clinical research, they help reduce imaging needs, monitor responses to therapy, and enable adaptive trials. Researchers can now track molecular changes indicating true disease modification, not just late-stage cognitive outcomes. As combination therapies and precision neurology emerge, these insights will be essential for selecting patients and optimizing trial success. Government-funded initiatives have long built the foundation for Alzheimer's research – such as NIH cohort studies in the U.S. and efforts in Japan, Korea, China, and Singapore. These projects built the datasets and insights essential to today's biomarker development. Now, as government research budgets shrink and approval processes shift, the private sector is taking a larger role in translational science. Pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, as well as laboratories, increasingly partner to validate assays, set reference standards, and advance the clinical readiness of tests. This shift creates a new balance: the public sector generates knowledge and long-term data, while industry supplies speed, capital, and technical infrastructure to turn that knowledge into patient-ready solutions. When coordinated, these strengths can move research to patient care more quickly than ever. To fulfill their promise, blood-based biomarkers must remain accessible and sustainable in healthcare systems. Reimbursement and pricing are persistent global challenges. In 2024, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed reimbursement levels for AD biomarkers that many labs called unsustainable, highlighting a bigger issue: the economic model for next-generation diagnostics still lags behind their clinical value. Policymakers, payers, and industry must align on frameworks that acknowledge the cost savings of earlier diagnosis and optimized treatment. Demonstrating that biomarker results alter decisions and outcomes will be key to securing coverage. Public research lays the foundation; private enterprise scales innovation. Both sectors transform discovery into diagnostic products, leading to better patient outcomes. Sustaining progress requires ongoing collaboration across borders, sectors, and disciplines. With thoughtful investment and equitable access, blood-based diagnostics can move from promise to practice and redefine brain health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada should rethink its reduced pledge to the Global Fund to protect the health of people in Canada as well as around the globe, argue authors in an editorial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.252036. In November, Canada reduced its pledge by 16% to the Global Fund, which fights AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria and strengthens pandemic preparedness. "Canada's reduced pledge to the Global Fund reflects shortsighted political thinking that fails to appreciate the complexity of global health threats and long-term health consequences," write Drs. Kirsten Patrick, editor-in-chief, CMAJ, and deputy editor Helena Swinkels. "If the anticipated shortfall in pledges to the Fund is not offset, Canada should anticipate reduced success in domestic TB and HIV control in forthcoming years, rather than the progress toward elimination that is hoped for now." Reduced funding will also open the door to other infectious disease threats. "In public and global health, managing problems in silos may seem appealing, but health threats do not fit into neat containers; they affect systems. As the COVID-19 pandemic revealed plainly, surges in rates of 1 infectious disease can ultimately affect health systems' ability to manage others. A decrease in resources for disease management adds complexity to this problem." The CMAJ editors urge Canada's government to invest in improving social determinants of health that underly TB and HIV infection, and to implement disease-specific suggestions outlined in the related commentaries published in CMAJ, such as creating a national body to address TB and providing better access to data and medications for both diseases. Canada's reduced pledge to the Global Fund will threaten infectious disease control at home.
