                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Three U.S. senators have launched an investigation into whether tech giants, driven by soaring AI energy demands, are raising residential power bills. Separately, Amazon released a white paper Tuesday stating that its data centers are not the problem, and that in some regions it actually pays more than required for energy use. “We write in light of alarming reports that tech companies are passing on the costs of building and operating their data centers to ordinary Americans as A.I. Amazon offered a much different take in an analysis that examined the potential benefits, costs and risks that large energy loads created by data centers have on electric utilities. A typical 100 megawatt data center was estimated to pay an additional $3.4 million beyond the costs associated with its electricity use, which also include a utility's infrastructure upgrades, deployment of new energy generation, operations and maintenance. Utilities can use that surplus “to reduce rates for other ratepayers, but how this potential benefit is realized will differ across jurisdictions,” the study stated. This forecast is fueled by tech giants' expanding investment: Microsoft and Amazon each reported nearly $35 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter, much of it on data center infrastructure. The tech giants are also investing globally in new wind and solar power and energy storage, while pursuing more costly power sources including nuclear. In October, a group of U.S. representatives raised similar concerns to the senators', asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Edison Electric Institute and the Data Center Coalition for information regarding data center impacts on residential power bills “to help ensure everyday Americans and small businesses aren't bearing the brunt of data center energy costs.” Residential electricity costs nationwide are on the rise, according to federal data. Power bills rose more than 7% on average when comparing September rates to a year earlier. A study this month in a peer-reviewed journal concluded that multiple factors impact electricity prices, including inflation, fluctuating gas prices and natural disasters such as hurricanes, storms and wildfires.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Caroline Merin, who spent nearly a decade developing on-demand services as the first Latin American general manager for Uber Eats and later the COO of Rappi, recognized how badly healthcare tech lagged behind. While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication. But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors' communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched Leona Health, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors' WhatsApp accounts. The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties. With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup's mobile app. Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel. “We're hearing from our users that they're saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.” While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company's long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the U.S., patients also demand and are permitted to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic. Leona's team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located. Prior to joining TechCrunch, she wrote about VC for PitchBook and Venture Capital Journal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington Attorney General Nick Brown's office announced details of the settlement Tuesday, in which Hyundai and Kia have agreed to: Eligible car owners can receive up $4,500 for a total loss or up to $2,250 for a partial loss, according to compensation details on the settlement website. In late 2020, teenage boys began posting videos on social media describing how to steal the cars simply by removing a plastic piece under the steering wheel and using a USB cord. Posts with the hashtag “Kia Boys” racked up more than 33 million views on TikTok by September 2022, according to CNBC. Despite years of evidence, Hyundai and Kia waited until 2023 to launch a service campaign to update the software on most of the affected vehicles, Brown's office said. Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison filed a similar lawsuit against Kia and Hyundai in January 2023. In May 2023, Hyundai and Kia agreed to a consumer class-action lawsuit settlement worth $200 million over rampant thefts of the Korean automakers' vehicles. Consumers who previously installed the software update on their vehicles (or were scheduled to do so) but nonetheless experienced a theft or attempted theft of their vehicle on or after April 29, 2025, are eligible to file a claim for restitution for certain theft and attempted-theft related expenses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An epidemiologist who has speculated about whether there is a connection between Covid-19 vaccines and “turbo cancer” in young people, and works as chief epidemiologist at a company that sells ivermectin alongside reviews that claim it has efficacy as a cancer treatment, has been appointed by president Donald Trump to a key position overseeing the National Cancer Program. Risch's profile page on the Yale website has also been updated to read “In November 2025, President Trump appointed Dr. Risch to Chair the President's Cancer panel.” As well as lending credibility to unproven treatments for Covid-19 like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin—he promoted the former in congressional testimony—Risch has more recently wondered whether the Covid-19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer” in some people. Now experts are worried that he could derail critical research into the causes and treatments for cancer. Another expert, who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity because they're afraid of retribution for speaking out about a Trump appointee, warned that they are concerned his conspiracy-adjacent beliefs might bleed into the National Cancer Program, a longstanding effort to coordinate the funding of critical cancer research and training. Risch is just the latest in a litany of controversial or unqualified figures who have been appointed to key public health positions in the federal government in Trump's second term in office, including the appointments of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and former daytime talk show host Dr. Memhet Oz being appointed to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Kennedy, meanwhile, has filled his vaccine advisory committee with doctors who have promoted anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. He was an early proponent of hydroxychloroquine, relying on questionable data to back up his claims. “But he is not an expert in infectious disease epidemiology and he has not been swayed by the body of scientific evidence from rigorously conducted clinical trials, which refute the plausibility of his belief and arguments.” Despite—or perhaps because of—this, Risch became a fixture on right-wing media outlets during the pandemic, including appearances on Fox News and Steve Bannon's War Room podcast. A 2022 House Select Committee report also revealed that Risch was in direct contact with people adjacent to the Trump administration about the use of hydroxychloroquine. The Wellness Company did not respond to requests for comments. In 2023, Risch speculated about whether there is a link between the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine and so-called “turbo cancers.” This echoed claims that anti-vaccine activists online had been promoting for years, suggesting without evidence that the vaccines could cause more aggressive forms of cancer. “The most serious errors in his beliefs are in regards to ‘turbo cancer,'” says Frank Han, a pediatric subspecialist at the Heart Center at Connecticut Children's hospital. “This is so fundamentally against basic principles of oncology and epidemiology that it is hard to believe someone professionally trained in epidemiology would make this mistake.” In fact, the NCI says that cancer patients tend to be older, have weakened immune systems, and other comorbidities, which “are all reasons for them to get vaccinated.” Risch, if his appointment is confirmed, will replace Elizabeth Jaffee, a pancreatic cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University whose term as the panel's chair ended in March,. “There typically is turnover with a new administration,“ Jaffee, who has been critical of the Trump administration's cuts to funding for cancer research, tells WIRED.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MX-7 features a new formula for lower resistance and higher performance. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Arctic has a well-earned reputation for its thermal pastes, with its MX-6 being one of the best thermal pastes on the market. Having launched three years ago, the MX-6 still feels quite new, but in a competitive market where new products come out every year, staying relevant is key. The MX-7 features a new formula that Arctic understandably keeps under wraps. In Arctic's own testing, using a Core Ultra 9 285K at 4.5 GHz and drawing around 284W in an ambient temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the MX-7 managed to deliver temperatures about 3% cooler than the MX-6 and up to 6% cooler than the MX-4. Rest assured, the thermal paste is completely safe to use with direct-die cooling solutions because it's not electrically conductive or capacitive. This means you don't need to worry about any risk of short circuits or discharges that could damage your devices. Instead, applying it in a simple cross pattern is best, and let your CPU cooler do the magic. This helpful tip also works well for coolers with direct-touch heat pipes. Since the MX-7 is non-capacitive and non-conductive, it's simple to wipe away excess or old applications with ease. Arctic also offers a separate MX Cleaner wipe that's perfect for cleaning thermal paste. Plus, these wipes can be purchased together as an MX-7 bundle for added convenience. To give you an idea, the 2-gram and 8-gram syringes cost just about $1.40 more, while the other MX-7 options are less than $0.50 more expensive than their older versions. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. With so many Arctic knockoffs out there, it's a good idea to buy your MX-7 from trusted retailers. Arctic has also improved its MX Authenticity Check system, allowing you to easily verify your product's authenticity using a unique QR code for each item. This helps ensure you get the real deal and have peace of mind with your purchase.

Pumat's a fan-favorite character owing to his kind disposition and the imagined (and now real) sight gag of three of the same guy finishing each other's sentences, working around the shop, and people reacting to seeing that for the first time. Think of him as the Nein's equivalent to Gilmore from Vox Machina: he pops up throughout the campaign whenever the Mighty Nein end up back in Zadash, and he's a hoot each time, so expect to see him again whenever they eventually come back into town. If that wasn't enough, we've also got a behind-the-scenes look at how Pumat's introduction was brought to life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instagram is expanding Reels-viewing beyond mobile, the social network announced on Tuesday. By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don't have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead. IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. It's worth noting that IG for TV shouldn't be confused with IGTV, which was Instagram's app for watching long-form content before being shut down in 2022. So we'd like to figure out how to make sure that we show up in a compelling way on all the relevant devices.” Prior to joining the publication in 2021, she was a telecom reporter at MobileSyrup.

This allowed westerners, prominently Americans, to maintain market share in Japan by product dumping.2: in 18th and 19th century India various British offices at different times had policies of having their sepoys arrest textile workers and maim them by the forcible amputation of both thumbs, to preserve the market share of British textiles.

Enough trains that you don't have to ride on top. )One generation later India is a dominant world power. Pakistan is completely fucked, sure, because Delhi will never get over their petty sibling hatred. But India can start power-brokering between all other nations.

As for making friends, the US empire is highly atypical in its "friendliness" and it's entirely plausible that its successor will revert to the mean. If politicians got that through their heads, and started trying to convince voters on their own merit, instead of simply trash-talking their opponents and telling people they voted “wrong”, they would start to get things done again, and we could actually solve real problems.

What "merit"?Look around, look at the last US presidential elections, those politicians were elected "on their own merit". That's hard to claim to make right after a Trump victory—trashing their opponents has been the Republicans playbook my entire life, and it's currently working quite well for them. This line of reasoning is cute, but fact-free. The facts are there, easily accessible for people to read or see. That they choose to ignore them is evidence of the problem with democracy. Whatever mistakes were made by the party that lost, their candidate was not the one with a (comparatively) long track record of fraud, treason, and overall lack of decorum. Trump was more isolationist than Clinton, Biden was more isolationist than first-term Trump and Trump beat Biden last year partially on the basis of becoming much more isolationist than his first term version, surpassing Biden. Meaning that the current technological push into AI, energy and robotics is likely to spearhead us into a whole new kind of economics (post-money/post-work kind of). Meaning that the current technological push into AI, energy and robotics is likely to spearhead us into a whole new kind of economics (post-money/post-work kind of). Mind you, another consequence of the regime is that nobody knows what's real and what's keyfabe any more. They were also threatening to invade Canada, lost a colossal amount of goodwill as a result, and got bored and moved on. The benefits would seem to flow to those countries that would have been swallowed up without Pax Americana. No, but the USA is getting a lot of stuff in exchange for $$ which it can print for basically free. One can view Trump's tariff actions as preparatory for US debt default. This would crash the dollar and make imports much more expensive. I don't agree with Trump about much but he's correct that the other liberal democracies have been more than happy to have us foot the bill for keeping the wolves at bay while looking down on us for doing it. I'd also be very surprised if US military expenditure decreased by a single cent as a result of increased spending by other NATO countries. That's just explaining why it's not worth the expense. I don't think China is against this change, but their agenda seems to be more focused on international trade and internal growth, rather than specific strategy against the US.The EU is definitely not benefiting from it in the short term. While some argue it needs this change in the long term, it is difficult to imagine that the EU wants it to happen so arbitrarily and quickly.Those holding any meaningful power in the US are either benefiting from this change, at least in the short term or personally, or oblivious to it, possibly also due to influence from the agents of change.It's an opportunity for other states to gain influence.

Morgan Jr started lending money to Britain and France to buy American steel, thus setting in motion a cycle of investment and production protection that eventually required boots on the ground.It was dragged into the second world war by Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor (and Germany's subsequent declaration of war, as it was obligated to do under its treaty with Japan).It protected Europe and SE Asia in the post-war years in order to contain communism, which it feared more than anything else. Once that threat subsided, there wasn't much reason for it to continue with its overseas footprint other than inertia and protecting important trade routes.Gulf Wars I was to protect oil prices (and because they already had the equipment for war), and Gulf Wars II was to be seen to be doing something about 9/11.Now that Trump is in power, America is performing its "great reset" (which was going to come eventually), where it becomes isolationist again, sticking to the Americas (reinvigorating the Monroe Doctrine), and leaving everyone else to their own devices.

There is nothing the US has done, is doing or could do that would diminish non-Western ambition and agitation for power. Except that MAGA cheers on new wars. They enjoy fishermen boats being destroyed and want to bomb Venezuela.This is not about distaste toward foreign wars. This is not about distaste toward foreign wars. What's insane about America's foreign policy is that it costs huge amounts of money, pisses off most of the third world, and doesn't even seem to result in any flow of wealth to the U.S. Until Ukraine, which is the exact bit of world policing that Republicans no longer recognize as crime. You, a European, want to tell the US public how their resources are to be used, and when they don't agree with you then you act morally superior about it. As an American, I can confidently say that we do the exact same thing from the other perspective. Isn't this an extreme low-ball estimate? The long consequence of the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions was providing Russia with a pretext for its own interventions, from the various caucasus states to Syria to Ukraine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War#Tab...Still, "over 100,000" is technically correct if it's more than 100,000.

Why do you think every incremental ratchet step on the gear of Germany rearming in the last three years has been taken as serious headline news by so many?

Why do you think every incremental ratchet step on the gear of Germany rearming in the last three years has been taken as serious headline news by so many? Cause they started two world wars previously. But even reading history isn't enough. I think we're fundamentally not equipped to understand what a large number of deaths actually looks and feels like. 10 deaths happening in our vicinity is an unbearable tragedy. So folks are struck by a nostalgia for a time when humans killed each other by the millions.In some ways they remind me of the people who long for the days before vaccines eliminated a bunch of diseases.

(IMO there has actually been a retreat from China trying to do propaganda "please like us" adventures overseas in the past few years. Of course you might get a bit of radioactive dust blow over the sea for a few hundred years but totally worth it. I feel fairly malicious authoritarianism and corruption will be observed in our own countries within this century (if that matters to you, depends on your age I suppose). But I think this past year really changed the direction of the US and to a lesser extent the EU with respect to oil and gas versus renewables.As the US has realized at the institutional level that China has secured a very strong position on refining rare earth materials into batteries and other green technology it is doubling down on oil and gas as the energy choice for the foreseeable future, climate change be damned. Not that China ever really cared about the climate, they just, for good reasons, wanted an alternative energy production source because even if they seized Taiwan the US Navy can bring oil and gas imports to near 0. Pipelines from Russia are sitting ducks too, so not much reprieve there.US is putting $40 billion into Al Udeid and signing AI deals with the Middle East powers, and is close enough on a deal to legitimize Israel. You can see where this is going.The EU politically wants to switch to green tech but it's facing a problem which is doing so will result in effective deindustrialization since they would wind up buying most equipment from China including cars. I expect this to be fully repealed. While the EU likes to not mince words about US tariffs, they're ultimately heading in the same direction. Right now it's Europe, but do you think Germany will let its manufacturing sector go away? The product dumping from China is going to be too much and in a judo move the west will be able to use China's manufacturing capacity against it. Nice factories you have there, too bad nobody buys anything you make (relatively speaking).So the EU is sitting between two oil and gas energy superpowers oh and the Middle East is just around the bend. Politically they'll still work on climate change initiatives but as push comes to shove, and with China overplaying its hand with export controls on rare earth materials and creating more panic in Brussels (never mind China's support for Russia invading Ukraine), the EU will generally maintain an oil and gas industrial direction, if I were to guess.I'm not pro gas/oil or anything like that.

So I hope the historical behaviour breaks down first. I'm aware of Le Monde, but didn't they previously use a different domain? Silicon Valley is great for innovating new "intellectual property," but they don't manufacture any real products any more.China has entire cities which not only can develop IP, but they have the entire ecosystem collocated.Catching up with them will be expensive and will need focus.

If a rebalancing were to occur, it is the surplus countries hit with mass unemployment that will hurt much more than deficit countries that can move production back at a much quicker pace. The author is making the mistake of viewing tings from a supply side perspective when given excessive reliance on investment and high savings the world is constrained by chronic underconsumption. No they're not sending it for free, the US dollars and IOUs are real and ultimately translated into maintaining the salaries of millions of factory workers. Thats the whole point of export driven growth. Trying to abstract away the balance sheet as imaginary is not how real economics works.The CCP, the IMF, World Bank, BIS, etc certainly aren't thinking like you are, growing consumption has proven extremely difficult in practice over growing industry. The CCP, the IMF, World Bank, BIS, etc certainly aren't thinking like you are, growing consumption has proven extremely difficult in practice over growing industry. I mean, what makes american so special in their ability to consume? Just ship this crap there instead of in the US if you're so concerned about consuming it.It's trade imbalance! Everyone knows that it can't be claimed for anything tangible, except from other countries who also owe fealty to the US and are forced to give this currency value. If everyone "asked" for something in return of those IOUs from the US itself, they'd get nothing of tangible value in return.

If everyone "asked" for something in return of those IOUs from the US itself, they'd get nothing of tangible value in return. Well if you believe so you can go present your findings to policymakers or the CCP rather than in internet forum comments. They would be VERY interested to know what revolutionary insights you have that hundreds of economists are unable to solve. We don't refer to the same problem. This problem you're referring to is not about finding those people who have the ability, so rare among non-american people, to consume stuff. If we go back to being peers, so what? Rich people who've capitalized on the favored position will cry and complain (and spend billions trying to keep control) but the world will go on. It seems the US wasn't in the war until two years after it started, and was drawn in due to Pearl Harbor. It's also a useless discussion: whatever faith you may have in European progressive/socialist parties, they are not willing to give up the prosperity they have. They want fairness in addition to MORE than what the European people already have. If the demand is to give up more than 100% of European economic growth, you will not find them allies. Oh and there's the problem that they've got maybe 10-20% of the vote, and all other parties are not nearly as willing to help.So these utopian outcomes won't happen. That will, to put it mildly, not be good. Frankly, the absurdly huge distinction between US hegemony and all others, whether you mean British hegemony, Ottoman hegemony or even going as far back as Roman or Greek hegemony is that every hegemon with the sole exception of the US conquered and murdered their empire together using slave armies (to their credit, some European powers, not all but some, at least refused to use slavery)You might say "but China has promised not to ...". Let's say China doesn't actually go ahead and try to conquer 1/3 of the world. We can perhaps argue if they'll go as far as the Nazi's did in the past century, but I don't understand how any rational person can argue it isn't at least going to go quite a ways in that direction. But if you don't live there ... who cares right? What will happen?The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was at the end of WW1, at the real ending of Colonialism (I mean that yes, colonies endured a bit more, but the economic domination of European powers ended there. At that point European Colonial powers had enjoyed a large surplus but right there and then, it was gone, and that's the point where the decline became totally inevitable, and exactly what happened became a certainty: a very large, protracted, slow economic decline. We might also mention what people chose to do in response to this happening: WW2)This is not theory. Because that's what matters, right?First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. And so on and so forth.The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls "justice". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in "the West".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps their theory is that the best idea for the US is for WW3 to start before this economic crisis really hits the US, that the only thing they need to do is to withdraw the US army, weapons and diplomacy currently standing between a great many adversaries.Hell, that may be exactly what happens. But this is both giving these people way too much credit AND ignores that of course WW3 will make the world suck pretty fucking bad for a long time. So these utopian outcomes won't happen.

At that point European Colonial powers had enjoyed a large surplus but right there and then, it was gone, and that's the point where the decline became totally inevitable, and exactly what happened became a certainty: a very large, protracted, slow economic decline. We might also mention what people chose to do in response to this happening: WW2)This is not theory. Because that's what matters, right?First, perhaps most obvious, piracy will return, at the very least to East and West African coasts, maybe even the African Mediterranean coast, and to Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as parts of India. None of the countries there have any hope in hell of securing their own coast, never mind international waters. Quite a few will participate in piracy like they did before. It will at the very least become orders of magnitude more expensive.Second, a large list of countries (a growing list, I might add) that are at each other's throats but are currently being stopped either directly by the US army, or by US weapons and diplomacy, and even some being restained by EU weapons and diplomacy, will burst out into ethnic violence. We'll have 10, or god forbid 50, Sudan-style conflicts. There is even such a conflict brewing in the EU: Kosovo - Serbia ... nothing is solved there and while people aren't currently at each other's throats, they're not far from it (and if you're truly honest, the problem is Kosovo. Greece and Turkey ... they're perhaps further from war than Kosovo, but I would still argue that left to their own devices, another war there is inevitable. And so on and so forth.The problem is "multilateralism" was demonstrated EXACTLY what it was just after WW1. There is a large group of countries that when restraints on their actions are released ... the result is a large set of genocides all occurring at once. I'm a pessimist, but let's be honest: this will simply happen again.That is at the very least a big risk of what Piketty and other calls "justice". And the problem is simple: for at least the next few years it is extremely in the EU's and EU member states' financial interest to bring us closer to this scenario. Piketty is arguing for social justice, and he should: we need that. But they'll never talk their way into more than minority influence in "the West".Perhaps Trump and MAGA are just extreme and cruel fatalists who realize what is coming now: a large, protracted, worldwide economic crisis, caused by Europe and China, followed by WW3. Perhaps their theory is that the best idea for the US is for WW3 to start before this economic crisis really hits the US, that the only thing they need to do is to withdraw the US army, weapons and diplomacy currently standing between a great many adversaries.Hell, that may be exactly what happens. But this is both giving these people way too much credit AND ignores that of course WW3 will make the world suck pretty fucking bad for a long time. Note: the CCP ideology is authoritarian and racist. We can perhaps argue if they'll go as far as the Nazi's did in the past century, but I don't understand how any rational person can argue it isn't at least going to go quite a ways in that direction.

The US are by no means innocent of terrorism and invasion of other countries, but at least with countries commonly counted as "the west", the US was a friendly nation. It might even get worse than the WW2, since the US military is probably more superior compared to almost any other nation on the planet, than Nazi Germany's military was, and already has presence in basically all parts of the world, plus the logistics.So lets hope that the current period of idiocy ends soon, and we can get back to peaceful international relations, with a sane US leadership, instead of one, that seemingly seeks to tear down as many bridges as possible. However, we are only in year one (!) of the current US government, so we will probably have to hold out breath a little longer, and Europe will have to rely on itself.

Nationalist policies and rhetoric (and I have lived with worse than the US) do not lead to fascism that easily, especially when you have strong institutions. And in most of Asia too where China is a very immediate threat.> Even worse, if the right wing and right extreme talking points and policies in the US don't stop, we might face the (still) strongest military on the planet becoming the arm of a fascist stateThat seems alarmist to me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CEOs at the world's biggest companies are preparing to dump even more money into AI next year, despite mounting evidence that their existing investments aren't actually paying off. The Wall Street Journal reported today that 68% of chief executives plan to increase AI spending in 2026, citing an annual survey of more than 350 public-company CEOs conducted by advisory firm Teneo. Bewilderingly, those same executives admitted that fewer than half of their current AI projects have generated returns that exceeded their initial costs. The survey's findings arrive as fears of an AI bubble continue to rise. AI investments now account for roughly 40% of U.S. GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for about 80% of gains in the American stock market. Despite the U.S. economy becoming more dependent on AI, there is surprisingly little to show for it as of now, even in small ways at non-AI corporations. Wall Street analysts have increasingly noted the circular nature of major AI investments. For example, Nvidia announced this year that it is investing $100 million in OpenAI, which then turns around and buys Nvidia chips for data centers it has planned with Oracle. Making things worse, those data centers have been slow to materialize. Reports that Oracle is delaying some of its data center projects have only heightened Wall Street's anxiety, as they push any tangible payoffs further into the future. Meanwhile, AI companies continue to promise that more advanced models will unlock significant productivity gains, spark innovation, and maybe even help cure diseases. Non-AI companies have already started putting the tech to the test, rolling out AI tools across various departments including customer service, IT, marketing, and human resources. But there's still little evidence that even in those spaces AI tools are transforming operations or even meaningfully improving bottom lines. Today's survey echoes a report released by MIT in August. “Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable [profit and loss] impact,” the report said. Meaning that “95 per cent of organizations are getting zero return.” And yet, CEOs still appear convinced that AI will eventually justify the spending spree. According to Teneo's survey, 84% of leaders at companies with more than $10 billion in annual revenue believe it will take longer than six months for AI investments to start paying off. Amazon is being forced to repeatedly learn a lesson: use AI slop, and get people yelling at you until you don't.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it's somewhere else. US military contractors are rolling out new GPS satellites that use stronger, cleverer signals, and engineers are working on providing better navigation information based on other sources, like cellular transmissions and visual data. But another approach that's emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites. As GPS interference becomes more of a problem, research on quantum navigation is leaping ahead, with many researchers and companies now rushing to test new devices and techniques. In recent months, the US's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its Defense Innovation Unit have announced new grants to test the technology on military vehicles and prepare for operational deployment. Perhaps the most obvious way to navigate is to know where you started and then track where you go by recording the speed, direction, and duration of travel. But while this approach, known in the field as inertial navigation, is conceptually simple, it's difficult to do well; tiny uncertainties in any of those measurements compound over time and lead to big errors later on. Douglas Paul, the principal investigator of the UK's Hub for Quantum Enabled Precision, Navigation & Timing (QEPNT), says that existing specialized inertial-navigation devices might be off by 20 kilometers after 100 hours of travel. Meanwhile, the cheap sensors commonly used in smartphones produce more than twice that level of uncertainty after just one hour. “If you're in an airliner, that's definitely not good enough.” A more accurate version of inertial navigation instead uses sensors that rely on the quantum behavior of subatomic particles to more accurately measure acceleration, direction, and time. Several companies, like the US-based Infleqtion, are developing quantum gyroscopes, which track a vehicle's bearing, and quantum accelerometers, which can reveal how far it's traveled. Infleqtion's sensors are based on a technique called atom interferometry: A beam of rubidium atoms is zapped with precise laser pulses, which split the atoms into two separate paths. Later, other laser pulses recombine the atoms, and they're measured with a detector. The device “will lose one second every 2 million years or so,” says Max Perez, who oversees the project, and it fits in a standard electronics equipment rack. “Tiqker operated happily through these conditions, which is unheard-of for previous generations of optical clocks,” says Perez. Vehicles deprived of satellite-based navigation are not entirely on their own; they can get useful clues from magnetic and gravitational fields that surround the planet. By precisely measuring the local magnetic or gravitational field and comparing those values with anomaly maps, quantum navigation systems can track the location of a vehicle. Allison Kealy, a navigation researcher at Swinburne University in Australia, is working on the hardware needed for this approach. That additional information could make it easier to determine location. The technology is far from commercial deployment, but Kealy and several colleagues successfully tested their magnetometer in a set of flights in Australia late last year, and they plan to run more trials this year and next. “This is where it gets exciting, as we transition from theoretical models and controlled experiments to on-the-ground, operational systems,” she says. Other teams, like Q-CTRL, an Australian quantum technology company, are focusing on using software to build robust systems from noisy quantum sensors. Quantum navigation involves taking those delicate sensors, honed in the placid conditions of a laboratory, and putting them in vehicles that make sharp turns, bounce with turbulence, and bob with waves, all of which interferes with the sensors' functioning. After Q-CTRL engineers ran trials of their magnetic navigation system in a specially outfitted Cessna last year, they used machine learning to go through the data and try to sift out the signal from all the noise. Eventually they found they could track the plane's location up to 94 times as accurately as a strategic-grade conventional inertial navigation system could, according to Biercuk. They announced their findings in a non-peer-reviewed paper last spring. In August Q-CTRL received two contracts from DARPA to develop its "software-ruggedized" mag-nav product, named Ironstone Opal, for defense applications. “Technology like magnetic navigation and other quantum sensors will unlock capabilities to provide guidance even in GPS-denied or -degraded environments.” Now Q-CTRL is working on putting Ironstone Opal into a smaller, more rugged container appropriate for deployment; currently, “it looks like a science experiment because it is a science experiment,” says Biercuk. He anticipates delivering the first commercial units next year. Both are scheduled to be fully operational later this decade. US and allied military users are intended to have access to far hardier GPS tools, including M-code, a new form of GPS signal that is rolling out now, and Regional Military Protection, a focused GPS beam that will be restricted to small geographic areas. Other plans involve using navigation satellites in low Earth orbit—the zone inhabited by SpaceX's internet-providing Starlink constellation—rather than the medium Earth orbit used by GPS. Since objects in LEO are closer to Earth, their signals are stronger, which makes them harder to jam and spoof. LEO satellites also transit the sky more quickly, which makes them harder still to spoof and helps GPS receivers get a lock on their position faster. “This really helps for signal convergence,” says Lotfi Massarweh, a satellite navigation researcher at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. Ultimately, says Massarweh, navigation will depend not only on satellites, quantum sensors, or any other single technology, but on the combination of all of them. “You need to think always in terms of sensor fusion,” he says. He says, “If quantum technology really delivers what we see in the literature—if it's stable over one week rather than tens of minutes—at that point it is a complete game changer.” The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health. The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do. The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.
